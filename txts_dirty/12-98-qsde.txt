3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 


4 argument next in Case 12-98, Delia v. E.M.A. 


Mr. Maddrey? 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MADDREY 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. MADDREY: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

9 please the Court: 

The Medicaid Act requires States to take 

11 reasonable measures to seek reimbursement from liable 

12 third parties and that States require recipients to 

13 assign their rights for -- to payment for medical care. 

14 The Act does not direct how a State must determine what 

portion of a recipient's third-party recovery is 

16 properly attributable to past medical expenses. North 

17 Carolina's procedure establishes --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you know that ex 

19 ante? 

MR. MADDREY: Excuse me? 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you ever know 

22 that ex ante? I mean, without looking at the individual 

23 facts of the case, the 30 percent is going to be 

24 underinclusive in some circumstances, overinclusive in 

others. So how do you deal with our holding that you

1 are not entitled to the overinclusive portion? 

2  MR. MADDREY: Justice Sotomayor, the -- the 

3 answer to that depends on whether the State has to 

4 predict with certainty the amount --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Life is never certain, 

6 and so I don't even go to that issue. I go just simply 

7 to the question, how can you, ex ante, predict --

8 particularly with a statute that wasn't based on any 

9 empirical data -- that 30 percent normally is the right 

amount? 

11  You just picked it out of the air? You 

12 could pick 40, 50, 60. How do we draw the line? 

13  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the -- the statute 

14 doesn't predict; it defines. It tells the recipient how 

much out of a recovery they must allocate to satisfy the 

16 repayment obligation. If it were a prediction, that 

17 would make it a presumption and you would have to defend 

18 it as such. 

19  But here the statute defines the portion 

that the State, as a condition of extending the Medicaid 

21 benefits, tells the recipient they must allocate --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: They must allocate? Is the 

23 State saying, You do not own that 30 percent of the 

24 recovery, so you never get a property right in it, so 

that there's never any problem about asserting a lien

1 against it? I thought that's what's going on here. And 

2 I think that's sort of disguised by talking about 

3 allocation. 

4  I thought the State is saying, as to 

30 percent of the recovery, you have no property right 

6 in it. Is it not saying that? Am I wrong? 

7  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the State is 

8 saying that as to the amount of Medicaid benefits 

9 provided, the State has a right of recovery. And it 

says that of any third party --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe you didn't 

12 hear my -- my question. My question is: Is the State 

13 saying that you have no property right in the 

14 30 percent? 

MR. MADDREY: The State has the right to 

16 recover that portion. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask my question 

18 again. Is the State saying that you have no property 

19 right in the 30 percent? I think that can be answered 

"yes" or "no." 

21  MR. MADDREY: And -- yes, Your Honor, the 

22 position would be there is no property right in that --

23 in that percentage that the State has conditioned the --

24 the extension of benefits on. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, how does it have 

6

Official 

1 the right to announce that in a FELA case or in a Jones 

2 Act case where those injured parties, they have a 

3 property right in their protection but this statute 

4 applies to that recovery as well? 

MR. MADDREY: If those -- if those litigants 

6 are Medicaid recipients, it applies to them as a 

7 condition of having received the State Medicaid 

8 benefits. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they can deny a 

litigant a property right in that recovery? 

11  MR. MADDREY: As a --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how you can 

13 go in and ask for something you don't own. I don't know 

14 how the plaintiff can go in and litigate a case if they 

don't have a property interest that they can then assign 

16 to someone else. I've never heard of such a thing, how 

17 they would have standing to sue on your behalf if they 

18 have no property interest in the recovery. 

19  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, I'm -- I'm 

confused by the question. I was --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you sue for 

22 something you have no property interest in? 

23  MR. MADDREY: I don't know how you'd sue for 

24 something you don't have a property interest in, Your 

Honor.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So go back to 


2 Justice Scalia's question. 


3  MR. MADDREY: The inner --


4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There has to be some 


interest in the 30 percent by the plaintiff. 

6  MR. MADDREY: The -- the 30 percent attaches 

7 upon the recovery from a third party. The -- the cause 

8 of action is for whatever sources of injury that 

9 individual would have. To the extent the recovery is 

for medical expenses previously paid for by Medicaid, 

11 that's what the State's interest could --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just clarify one 

13 point? Does this rule preclude parties, as we said in 

14 Ahlborn, from stipulating to a settlement at all? 

MR. MADDREY: No, Your Honor. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief is not clear 

17 on that. They can still stipulate. It's only if after 

18 the stipulation, it hasn't been allocated that you can 

19 recover? 

MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the stipulation 

21 must include the State as a party to it for it to be 

22 binding. That's --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you're basically 

24 now saying is that there can never be a stipulation. 

MR. MADDREY: There could be an advance

1 agreement, Your Honor, but --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're saying that the 

3 parties cannot enter into a stipulation. 

4  MR. MADDREY: If the parties are private 

litigants, a plaintiff and a defendant in a medical 

6 malpractice action, their -- their stipulation doesn't 

7 bind the State. All parties to this case agree that --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You can bind the parties 

9 for other purposes, I assume. There are other purposes 

for which the distinction between pain and suffering and 

11 medical expenses might make a difference, right? 

12  What -- what if the parties agreed that it's 

13 50/50? Would the State take 50 percent then, or is the 

14 State still limited to 30? 

MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the statutory 

16 percentage applies in that situation as well. The 

17 33 percent cap would apply. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

19  MR. MADDREY: Again, the State's interest is 

the amount of the Medicaid benefits it provided, capped 

21 at 33 percent of the recovery. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, how do you come up 

23 with 33? Why 33? Why not 10 or 60 or 90? Why -- how 

24 did you come up with the number? 

MR. MADDREY: The North Carolina General

1 Assembly first enacted it as it relates to Medicaid in 

2 1988. It reflects a legislative history in 

3 North Carolina going back to 1935 with a -- a statutory 

4 lien applicable to medical providers in -- in civil 

actions. It became specifically applicable to Medicaid 

6 scenario in the 1988 provision. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: What if this case is tried 

8 to a verdict and there is a special verdict and the jury 

9 says that 10 percent was medical expenses? Would the --

the statute would override that? 

11  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, I believe the 

12 judge imposing judgment following that jury verdict 

13 would have to conform the verdict to the law. Just as 

14 if the verdict had said, there was 100 -- excuse me, 

$1 million in punitive damages when there is a statutory 

16 cap of $500,000 for punitive damages, the judge would 

17 have to conform the verdict to the applicable law. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

19 between that case and Ahlborn, where you have -- where 

the State has agreed that a certain amount is 

21 attributable for medical expenses, and then this 

22 hypothetical that the jury has determined that a certain 

23 amount constitutes medical expenses? What's the 

24 difference between those two? 

MR. MADDREY: In the jury verdict scenario,

25

Official 

1 the State's not a party to that and didn't commit to 

2 the -- to the portion that -- that was attributable to 

3 medical expenses. The jury doesn't have any authority 

4 to countervene the statute, to enter a verdict in 

violation of -- of the statutory requirement. And --

6 and here the statute tells the Medicaid recipient, in 

7 advance, how much of any recovery, whether that be from 

8 a settlement or a verdict, has to be allocated and paid 

9 back to the State. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the reasoning of 

11 Ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the 

12 medical expenses were and what -- what part of the 

13 judgment this represents or the settlement represents 

14 medical expenses, then only that much can be assigned to 

the government? And I don't see the difference between 

16 that and the verdict situation. 

17  MR. MADDREY: The verdict situation would 

18 depend upon what -- would be in the hands of the parties 

19 to the lawsuit, what evidence was presented, what --

what theories were advanced. The State would not have 

21 any control over that. It would be --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it can --

23 it can participate in that process, can't it? Its --

24 its money's at issue? 

MR. MADDREY: The State can initiate a 

11

Official 

1 lawsuit on behalf of its -- its medical claim by virtue 

2 of the subrogation and the assignment of the right. It 

3 could participate in advance or it could participate 

4 afterwards. But that doesn't come without costs 

because, of course, if the State participates on its own 

6 in advance, it would be for the full amount of the 

7 medical payments. Here --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. 

9  MR. MADDREY: -- here 1.9 million, and the 

33 percent cap would have no application. That applies 

11 only to amounts recovered by a recipient from -- from a 

12 third party. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, you were -- you 

14 were telling me a little bit about the history of this 

statute. But why 30? Is there any indication of why 

16 the State picked 30? 

17  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, historically 

18 33 percent or three times the medicals was the -- the 

19 rule of thumb used in -- in tort actions that -- that 

parties used that as the -- the methodology, the way to 

21 come up with a value to the case, with the theory being 

22 33 percent for the medicals, 33 percent for attorneys' 

23 fees and 33 percent to the victim. That was -- that was 

24 the underlying --

JUSTICE KAGAN: If that's where it comes

25

Official 

1 from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't 

2 it? 

3  MR. MADDREY: Historically it does. It's 

4 been the policy of the State of North Carolina for 

almost a century, as I referenced the lien statutes that 

6 apply generally to -- to tort actions, to civil 

7 recoveries, to protect the providers of medical 

8 services, in those cases date back to 1935. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a somewhat 

technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention 

11 because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind. 

12 All right. It's my understanding of North Carolina, 

13 everyone accepts the rule and North Carolina agrees that 

14 if you in -- in North Carolina advance to the victim 

$50,000 in medical expenses -- now, you're never going 

16 to get more than that back and you don't want more than 

17 that back. 

18  Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter 

19 into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is 

you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent, 

21 whichever is less. That's the rule, whichever is less. 

22  So if the settlement is for $100,000, you 

23 are not going to take more than 33, so you have advanced 

24 50. Okay. So you have basically three situations. The 

first situation is where a judge has said -- you know 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 what, I find that only $10,000 of this settlement is for 

2 medical expenses. In that case you take $10,000, no 

3 more. Is that right? 

4  MR. MADDREY: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. I got the impression 

6 that if there was a judicial -- there are three 

7 situations: One is there is a judicial finding that 

8 only 10 percent was medical. And the second is the 

9 situation where they stipulate that only 10 percent is 

for medical, and the third situation is this situation, 

11 namely there is no stipulation and there is no judicial 

12 finding. 

13  So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if 

14 the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than 

10 percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of 

16 10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided 

17 that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation 

18 and no judicial finding. Now you're telling me I have 

19 that wrong. So you explain what the North Carolina is 

on that because I think it makes quite a difference. 

21  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the statute 

22 applies to settlements or judgments received by a 

23 Medicaid recipient from a third party for --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but in the 

settlement they stipulate that 10 percent is for medical 

14

1 and the rest for pain and suffering. Now, I thought 

2 North Carolina courts have not yet decided whether North 

3 Carolina -- which would like more than 10 percent -- can 

4 get it. Is that true or not true? 

MR. MADDREY: That is not true, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: They have decided? 

7  MR. MADDREY: The North Carolina Supreme 

8 Court in the Andrews case said --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Said? 

MR. MADDREY: -- said that the key point in 

11 Ahlborn was the stipulation --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: This has nothing to do with 

13 Ahlborn. Ahlborn, we all agree, says you cannot get 

14 more than medical -- the medical expense, okay? The 

question here is how to figure that. 

16  So I thought that one way to figure it -- I 

17 will just be repeating myself. One way to figure it is 

18 how much of this $100,000 settlement is attributable to 

19 medical expenses as a judge would say. Now, you're 

telling me there is a case in North Carolina which says 

21 if the judge himself says that 10 percent of the 

22 settlement is for medical, that's not what California --

23 that doesn't matter according to North Carolina law, 

24 and I'd like the name of the case, the State case that 

says that.

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we don't know the 

4 answer to that. We know what you would like, but we 

don't know the answer. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think the statute 

7 may -- may give you the answer? It says: "Any attorney 

8 retained by the beneficiary shall out of the proceeds 

9 obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement 

with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third party 

11 by reason of injury or death distribute to the 

12 department the amount of assistance paid by the 

13 department on behalf of...up to 33 percent." It applies 

14 to judgments as well as to settlements. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You answered the question 

16 with respect to jury verdicts. I suppose it would be no 

17 different if it 's the judge that found the 10 percent 

18 rather than the jury. 

19  MR. MADDREY: I would agree, 

Justice Ginsburg. The statute --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I didn't hear Justice 

22 Ginsburg's question. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question that 

24 Justice Breyer was asking about the 10 percent has 

already been answered because we were told that if a

Official 

1 jury allocated 10 percent to medicals, it would not make 

2 any difference, the statute entitles the State to 

3 30 percent. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Basically you are saying 

the judge would be required to give you your one-third 

6 regardless of what the jury said. 

7  MR. MADDREY: Exactly. As we said, he would 

8 either have to conform a jury verdict to the --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So all those States that 

have jury verdicts, special verdicts that require a 

11 certain amount, they could avoid that by just simply 

12 passing this law and avoid the anti-lien statute that 

13 way? 

14  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, it would -- it 

would depend how the State could rationally defend their 

16 statute under their experience as consistent with their 

17 jurisprudence. Of course, tort law being primarily the 

18 province of --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 16 States already have 

something close to a presumption of a percentage. Do 

21 you have any evidence that in those 16 States where it's 

22 only a presumption and not a fixed amount, that they are 

23 falling apart because of it? 

24  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, I -- I don't have 

any evidence as to the specific performance in those 16 

17

1 States. That would leave 34 States that don't have one. 

2 It also would raise the question of how many of those 

3 States -- I believe the 16 States were the ones that had 

4 some sort of procedure, some post-settlement either 

hearing or trial to allocate --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the absence of this 

7 statute, what did your State do beforehand? 

8  MR. MADDREY: This statute dates back to 

9 1988. Prior to 1988 I don't know how -- from the 1965 

effective date of Medicaid how things were handled. But 

11 certainly for the last --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, on your theory am I 

13 correct that the North Carolina legislature could amend 

14 this statute tomorrow to make it two-thirds? 

MR. MADDREY: Certainly a statute could be 

16 amended. Whether it could be defended under -- under 

17 the circumstances --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's what I mean. I 

19 mean, on your theory it seems not to matter whether this 

statute says one-third or two-thirds. And I'm asking 

21 whether that's correct. 

22  MR. MADDREY: Two-part answer, Your Honor. 

23 As to the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid Act, if 

24 the statute defines the amount of medicals as 230 --

excuse me -- two-thirds, that would present the same 

18

Official 

1 analysis under the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid 

2 Act. The difference would be whether the State could 

3 show a rational basis in its -- in its tort law, in its 

4 jurisprudence. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I'm not sure about 

6 that. In other words, I'm assuming an amendment that 

7 just all it does is it changes one-third to two-thirds. 

8 And so your theory it seems to me would work the exact 

9 same way. Then you say, well, you need a rational basis 

for doing that. But I thought you told me that the 

11 one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an 

12 estimate of how much is medical and how much is not 

13 medical. So it seems that you would have the same basis 

14 to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third. Am I 

wrong about that? 

16  MR. MADDREY: I would say, Justice Kagan, 

17 the reason it's not the same is that it would treat 

18 Medicaid recipients decidedly differently than other 

19 tort litigants in North Carolina. Given the 1935 

history of the allocation of -- of tort settlements and 

21 the liens in favor of the providers of medical care that 

22 preexist the North Carolina Medicaid statute, if you 

23 then change the Medicaid statute --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're saying there's a 

kind of side constraint, that Medicaid recipients have

1 to be treated like others, but then presumably, the 

2 State could change everybody's? 

3  MR. MADDREY: I -- I believe that would be 

4 the case, yes. The -- the question would be whether 

there was any disparate treatment, any singling out 


6 of -- of a Medicaid recipient. And certainly, we've 


7 demonstrated that under the -- the North Carolina 


8 experience, that is not the case. 


9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought 


your brief said that at some point, if it gets too high, 

11 you do have a problem under the anti-lien provision of 

12 Medicaid? 

13  MR. MADDREY: I -- I believe, Your Honor, in 

14 response to the 90 percent or 100 percent scenario or 

hypothetical, I would certainly posit it would be 

16 difficult for a State to defend --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I don't understand 

18 that. You see, I think the only way you can defend it 

19 is that -- is that the recipient never -- never had a 

property right. Once -- once recovery is given to the 

21 recipient, the recovery does not belong to the 

22 recipient. And if that's true for 33 percent, it can be 

23 through -- true for 100 percent. 

24  Has there ever been any litigation since 

1935 about takings problems, with -- with the State

1 requiring 33 percent to go to the medical provider, even 

2 though it may well be that -- that less or more of that 

3 amount went to medical damages --

4  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, under the general 

lien statutes in Chapter 44 of the North Carolina 

6 general statutes, Sections 49 and 50 are the two 

7 provisions that we cite. I'm not aware of any 

8 takings-related challenges to those laws. I am aware of 

9 State supreme court opinions saying that the attorney 

had to distribute proceeds in accordance with the 

11 statute. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: -- can I go back for a 

13 second? Because I want to show you where I got my 

14 perhaps mistaken idea from. 

There is a case called Andrews. And there 

16 is a statement in Andrews, which is a South --

17 North Carolina case -- which says in certain 

18 circumstances, although the statute says just what 

19 Justice Scalia says, the lawyer sits there, he takes 

one-third and pays it to the State. Then this case has 

21 this sentence in it: "Ahlborn controls when there has 

22 been a prior determination or stipulation as to the 

23 medical expense portion of a plaintiff's settlement. In 

24 those cases, the State may not receive reimbursement in 

excess of the portion so designated."

1  Now, having read that sentence, I thought 

2 the law of North Carolina was that this statute does not 

3 apply, and that when, in fact, the jury or the judge 

4 finds that only 10 percent was for medical expenses, the 

State cannot take more than 10 percent. And the same is 

6 true of a stipulation. That's what those words seem to 

7 say to me. 

8  Now you're telling me I'm not reading 

9 those words correctly, that the case of Andrews does not 

affect our case here, and that you -- that the law of 

11 North Carolina is that you get one-third. 

12  Now, what is it? Do you see why I am 

13 confused? 

14  MR. MADDREY: Yes, Your Honor. I will 

try -- try, if I can, to explain what I believe to be 

16 the source of the confusion is. 

17  The stipulation in Ahlborn referenced in the 

18 Andrews decision was between the Medicaid recipient and 

19 the State of Arkansas, the lienholder. It came in the 

Federal court action to challenge Arkansas's imposition 

21 of its lien. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. 

23  MR. MADDREY: Therefore, there was a 

24 stipulation binding the State, the lienholder, that 

controlled in Ahlborn.

3 determination to mean a determination by a judge or a 


4 jury. What does it mean, if it doesn't mean that? 


MR. MADDREY: I think later in the Andrews 

6 decision, you will see a reference to the parties 

7 certainly had the opportunity to negotiate with the 

8 State a lesser amount than -- that the amount of the 

9 statutory lien. That would be -- that would be the 

prior determination, I believe. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I correct that what 

12 you believe and what the courts have been doing in your 

13 State, the lower courts, is that they won't approve a 

14 settlement that doesn't have the one-third, and they 

won't enter a judgment that doesn't have the one-third? 

16  Is that correct? 

17  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, when there's a 

18 lump sum settlement in -- in these actions, the court 

19 directs the attorney for the recipient to enforce the 

statute to protect the State --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I'm right. They just 

22 won't accept the private stipulation that doesn't do 

23 that, and they won't enter into a judgment that doesn't 

24 do that, correct?

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just answer my question. 

3  MR. MADDREY: Yes, Your Honor. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 

Going back to Justice Alito's. The jury 

6 says it's less or more or whatever of -- of the 

7 settlement is medical expenses, it doesn't matter what 

8 they say, the court can't enter a judgment for that 

9 amount, they have to enter a judgment for either the 

one-third or the full medical expenses. 

11  MR. MADDREY: They have to enter a judgment, 

12 yes, Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's what they 

14 have been doing. 

MR. MADDREY: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and 

16 that is the rationale behind the statute that the jury, 

17 nor the judge, can enter a judgment that's not in 

18 conformity with the statute. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you how often 

this comes up in North Carolina? Do you have any 

21 figures where you have a dispute of this nature, during 

22 the course of a year? 

23  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, I've tried in the 

24 briefs to indicate the dollar amounts involved. The 

numbers of cases are in the hundreds, it's my

2 third-party payments, not just from medical malpractice 

3 cases, but insurance coverage and other situations that 

4 -- that trigger the repayment obligation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to take up 

6 too much time talking about Andrews, but it seems to me 

7 that what the North Carolina Supreme Court said in 

8 Andrews is that in those States where there is a prior 

9 determination, that controls, but the -- North Carolina 

is entitled to adopt a different procedure and have a 

11 one-third across-the-board rule. 

12  That's the way I read it. 

13  MR. MADDREY: Well, certainly, that --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does -- does that accord 

with your understanding? 

16  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, I think they were 

17 saying two things. Other States have different 

18 procedures --

MR. MADDREY: -- and that in North Carolina, 

21 this is the rule, and that the prior determination also 

22 could include an action involving binding the State of

6 to read Ahlborn carefully and read what it cited, and I 

7 don't see it cited. 

8  MR. MADDREY: I'm sorry. I don't know --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't see the North 

Carolina procedure referenced in Ahlborn as something 

11 that States could do. It wasn't referenced directly in 

12 the -- in the opinion, and it wasn't referenced 

13 indirectly by the amici. The amici were talking about 

14 substantially different procedures. 

MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the holding in 

16 Ahlborn said you can't go beyond the amount 

17 represented -- that represents repayment for medicals. 

18 It didn't say how a State has to or could determine 

19 that, and that's the question that's presented. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But my point is, Justice 

21 Kennedy's question was that somehow in that opinion, we 

22 approved the North Carolina system.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR., 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

12  MR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

13 please the Court: 

14  The -- General Maddrey has steadfastly 

argued that the North Carolina statute overrides a jury 

16 verdict. I think his argument is well-grounded, given 

17 the language of the statute, but that illustrates the 

18 very problem here, that this statute takes one-third of 

19 a settlement or judgment regardless of the true facts of 

the case. And that is problematic under Ahlborn. 

21  Justice Kagan, you had asked Mr. -- General 

22 Maddrey about the basis for the North Carolina statute. 

23 General Maddrey had referred to it being a rule of thumb 

24 of three times medicals. But if you actually turn to 

the Fourth Circuit's decision, which is based on the

25

Official 

1 briefs that were filed in the Fourth Circuit, in the 

2 petition at page 20A, the rule of thumb is actually 

3 three times specials, which of course is different than 

4 three times medicals because special damages would 

include things like lost wages and various other things. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Browning, let me give 

7 you a different rationale for this statute. It's 

8 different from the one the State suggests, but it would 

9 go something like this: 

There is an allocation that has to be made. 

11 In making allocations there are two ways of doing it. 

12 We can do it case-by-case, individualized 

13 decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules. 

14 And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are 

cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more 

16 inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking because in 

17 individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too. 

18  So this is a reasonable way to make an 

19 allocation decision. And nothing that we said in 

Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by-case 

21 decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the 

22 allocation that it needs to make between medical and 

23 nonmedical damages. What about that? 

24  MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, I would 

turn to the language of the Ahlborn decision which makes 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 clear that States cannot lay claim to more than a 


2 portion of a settlement or judgment that represents 


3 payment for medical care or medical expenses. 


4  When you have --


JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that doesn't 

6 answer the question. I mean that portion, according to 

7 North Carolina, is one-third. 

8  MR. BROWNING: It is the State saying it is 

9 one-third even though there is no basis and even though 

you have cases like this where it's clearly not 

11 one-third --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what the State 

13 says is the law. I mean, the State says one-third is 

14 for medical. 

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, if that is all 

16 North Carolina had to do, of course, the Ahlborn 

17 decision would have been dramatically different if 

18 Arkansas had simply enacted a cap of 100 percent or 

19 50 percent or 40 percent because, in the Ahlborn 

decision, the State of Arkansas was only seeking to 

21 recover 39 percent of the tort settlement. 

22  And under North Carolina's theory, if 

23 Arkansas had simply been bright enough to implement a 

24 cap, the Ahlborn decision would have been completely 

different. And that makes absolutely no sense. I think

Official 

1 the Ahlborn decision indicates that there has to be a 

2 process in order to fairly and appropriately determine 

3 the amount that the State may --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you need, ultimately you 

need an adjudication. You have to leave it either to a 

6 jury to decide what percentage of the total award is --

7 is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding. 

8 Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a 

9 separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really 

for medical. You know, they may say 10 percent is, but 

11 who believes that? You -- you need a proceeding. 

12  That is awfully time-consuming. And -- and 

13 as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be 

14 very accurate. I don't think a jury determination is 

going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score. 

16 And I don't know how you go about determining how much 

17 of a settlement is attributable to -- to medical 

18 expenses versus other things, especially when the 

19 settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical 

expenses. 

21  MR. BROWNING: Well, Justice Scalia, I think 

22 it is very easy for States to follow that and to put in 

23 practices or procedures that result in appropriate 

24 allocation of medical expenses. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you do that?

1  MR. BROWNING: Yes. There are a variety of 

2 ways that States can do it. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 16 are doing it already. 

4  MR. BROWNING: Absolutely. 16 and the 

District of Columbia have a process for appropriate 

6 adjudication. Moreover, it is perfectly appropriate if 

7 a State wants to have a presumption.  The problem is it 

8 can't be an irrebuttable presumption. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work? Because 

I would imagine at the negotiation you have the -- the 

11 victim's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer and the 

12 tortfeasor's lawyer is interested that the bottom line 

13 number be as low as possible and the victim's number, 

14 that it be as high as possible. And the victim's 

lawyer, in fact, would like as little as possible to be 

16 allocated to a source which is going to take that money 

17 away from him. 

18  So they can reach agreement. What they will 

19 do is say 1 penny is for medical expenses and everything 

else is for pain and suffering, and that's very good for 

21 the victim. And it's irrelevant to the tortfeasor. 

22  So -- so when you see that on a piece of 

23 paper, what is it you are going to do? What kind of 

24 proceeding are you going to have? And it's a proceeding 

about a proceeding. It's a proceeding about the

1 settlement negotiation. What's it going to look like? 

2 What does it look like in the 16 States? We will have a 

3 plaintiff's lawyer testify. He will say, Your Honor, I 

4 really wanted 1 penny and only 1 penny to be allocated 

to pain and -- to medical expense. And the defendant's 

6 lawyer, he's being very honest, he'll say, I didn't 

7 care; if that's what he wants, that's fine with me. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's worse 

9 than that. He does care because the smaller amount 

means that the victim is going to actually get to keep 

11 more and that's all the victim's lawyer is concerned 

12 about, and that's fine with the tortfeasor's lawyer 

13 because otherwise he would have to pay more. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. So what does it 

look like? 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry to --

17  MR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, if I first 

18 can turn to your point and then respond to 

19 Justice Breyer's question.

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the same point.

6 States? 

7  MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and 

8 Justice Breyer, I don't think it's all of that 

9 complicated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. What 

11 do you adjudicate? What is the issue in the 

12 adjudication? How much of the award should have been 

13 allocated to medical expenses, or how much of the award 

14 was, in fact, allocated to medical expenses? Which is 

the issue? 

16  MR. BROWNING: What should be adjudicated --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it should be 

18 the latter, shouldn't it? 

19  MR. BROWNING: What should be adjudicated 

consistent with the Ahlborn decision is the portion of 

21 the settlement that represents payment for medical 

22 expenses. And that, that is --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. How much was

been. The issue is what proportion did the parties in

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. But that's --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: But I am asking the same

How does it work?

13 they have it. I want to know how it works. We have put 

14 the problem as to why it seems it might not work too 

well, and now I would like you to tell us how it really 

16 works. 

17  MR. BROWNING: How it really works in those 

18 States is the States will -- will generally negotiate 

19 with the State Medicaid agency and come to a fair 

allocation without the necessity for a judicial 

21 determination that's appropriate. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about fair? 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that because they

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When told to come in, 

6 they ignored it. In those States, States know they are 

7 going to increase potentially their costs, so they come 

8 in more often. 

9  MR. BROWNING: Exactly, Justice Sotomayor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly what? 

11  MR. BROWNING: It levels the playing field 

12 so that there is an incentive on both sides to come to 

13 an appropriate allocation. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how is this allocation 

not happening? 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to say, 

17 how do we know what's fair and appropriate? You come 

18 in -- let's say you have $20,000 in medical expenses and 

19 a claim for pain and suffering. And they come in and 

they recover a million dollars, right? 

21  So what's appropriate in that case? The 

22 other side will say, well, we settled on a million 

23 dollars, pain and suffering was really 20 million and we 

24 came down to a million. So what's fair allocation in

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, it is a process 

6 that the courts can determine based upon the experience 

7 of the judge, that who generally would be very 

8 experienced in the valuation of cases, can make an 

9 appropriate decision, and can consider all the facts, 

the equities --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do judges do

19 This is -- it costs too much, it's too burdensome. 

We've already answered why not, but in the end, they 

21 don't believe you could ever figure out the number.

13 envision happening, if the -- if the parties can't -- if 

14 the State and the -- and the recipient of the -- of 

Medicaid assistance can't come to an agreement. 

16 Basically, you have to make an estimate of what the 

17 damages would have been if the case had been tried and 

18 then you determine that the medical portion of the 

19 damages would have been 15 percent and so you reduce, 

then you take the amount of the settlement, and the 

21 amount of the settlement that is attributable to the 

22 medical expenses is 15 percent. That would be what I 

23 would envision. Is that not correct?

7 likelihood that the plaintiff would have actually 

8 recovered on the claim, and various other factors that 

9 the court deems appropriate and it puts it in the 

discretion of the court. 

11  What we're saying here is that Ahlborn 

12 requires that there must be a determination of the 

13 portion of the settlement that represents payment for 

14 medical --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, in those 

16 proceedings, are witnesses called or is it usually done 

17 on papers? 

18  MR. BROWNING: It's usually done in a fairly 

19 expedited process, yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, putting --

21 putting it in the discretion of the court, as you say is 

22 done in the workmen's compensation, is quite different 

23 from what you're proposing here. That seems to me quite 

24 workable -- you know. The -- the court hears the 

evidence and he decides how much should be reimbursed

4 to -- to the medical portion. 

MR. BROWNING: I think it needs to be --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a totally different 

7 question. 

8  MR. BROWNING: Justice Scalia, I think it's 

9 an objective determination. I don't think the parties 

can skew it one way because of the way they structured 

11 the settlement just because -- just as the State can't 

12 skew it the other way because they have an arbitrary 

13 number, whether it be 100 percent, 90 percent, 

14 75 percent, it doesn't allow for the fact that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Are you satisfied --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've said several 

17 times that the way you do this is based on the judge's 

18 experience and so on with -- with the cases. And I 

19 think what your -- your friend on the other side is 

saying is that's pretty much what's going on here except 

21 over time -- I mean, would it be all right if over time 

22 the judge says, well, typically, sometimes it's 

23 25 percent, sometimes it's 35 percent, over time, it's 

24 sort of 33 percent. And so we're going to have that as 

an absolute rule so that we don't have to go through

3  What's -- I guess it's Justice Kagan's 

4 question -- what's wrong with the bright-line rule here? 

MR. BROWNING: There would be nothing wrong 

6 with a rule that creates a presumption. What is the 

7 problem is, you have cases that are on the extremes like 

8 this case where you have absolutely horrendous injuries 

9 and a physician who -- who doesn't have the financial 

wherewithal to pay for the extent of the damages that he 

11 caused. 

12  Here, EMA's guardian had no option but to 

13 settle the case for the available funds of $2.8 million. 

14 But that is a far cry from how anyone would objectively 

evaluate --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: So you're -- you're 

17 satisfied with the presumption. Is there any law here 

18 that gives you a leg-up? I mean, is this like Chevron 

19 or Skidmore or something like that? 

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I certainly think 

21 in this case the fact that the United States Department 

22 of Health and Human Services has filed an amicus brief 

23 that points out that this sort of ill rebuttable 

24 presumption, this sort of --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know that's their

1 position. But my question is, does the law mean that 

2 when we decide this case, I see you have a reasonable 

3 point, they have a reasonable point, that if both points 

4 are reasonable, you get the benefit of some kind of 

legal presumption like Chevron, Skidmore, et cetera. 

6 Maybe you can think of another one, I don't know. Do 

7 you or don't you? 

8  MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I think it would 

9 be appropriate to give Chevron deference to the 

arguments of the United States --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we're dealing 

12 with a North Carolina statute. Don't they get deference 

13 along the same lines? 

14  MR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor. I don't 

think -- the starting point has to be the Federal 

16 statute, Medicaid's anti-lien provision, which is very 

17 clear that no lien may be imposed. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it can't be 

19 very clear because CMS took the opposite position before 

this case, right? 

21  MR. BROWNING: I don't think that they took 

22 the opposite position. With regard to the letter that 

23 was sent to Congressman Coble that that was a -- an 

24 employee who was not within a policymaking decision, who 

has to field thousands of these sort of requests for

2 put a whole lot of credence on that particular letter 

3 that has been expressly disavowed by the secretary and 

4 the director of CMS. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you a question 

6 on this different point? Could the -- suppose the North 

7 Carolina legislature passed a statute that says 

8 something like the following: "In any tort action in 

9 which an item of damages sought is medical expenses, the 

plaintiff may not recover for any other item of damages 

11 until the full amount of the medical expenses is 

12 satisfied." 

13  Now, there they're just restructuring their 

14 tort law. Would there be a problem with that? 

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I think in the 

16 case of the anti-lien provision, that that would 

17 effectively circumvent the anti-lien provision and allow 

18 by the backdoor what we would contend would not be --

19 the State could not do directly. So yes, I do see 

potential problems with that. Obviously, it would be 

21 different than the scenario that we have here, but it 

22 does -- the starting point has to be the anti-lien 

23 provision, which is no lien may be imposed. 

24  This Court in Ahlborn assumed without 

deciding that there would be an implied exception to

1 that statute. But that -- that exception is very 

2 limited. It has to be in the context of, as this Court 

3 recognized, a State can only lay claim to that portion 

4 of the settlement that represents payment for medical 

care. So until you have --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Does Federal law -- did 

7 Federal law require your client to seek compensation for 

8 medical expenses? 

9  MR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor, I don't 

believe that there is a requirement that Medicaid 

11 beneficiaries would have to file a suit and try to 

12 recover medical expenses. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: So you could have -- could 

14 you have filed suit and disclaimed any -- any claim for 

medical expenses, you only want to be compensated for 

16 other things? 

17  MR. BROWNING: If -- first of all, there 

18 would be some medical expenses that wouldn't be 

19 Medicaid, medical expenses that were incurred by the 

family. But moreover, even in that scenario, I think 

21 given the language of the North Carolina statute, the 

22 State would still be seeking one-third. So, if one were 

23 to take that route, it would be an extremely treacherous 

24 route that you would be -- not being able to -- to get 

full -- full recovery from the defendant, but still

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: But it would be the 

4 defendant who's -- who's -- who's jiggering the system, 

I mean, not suing for the medical portion simply because 

6 the defendant knows that at least some of that portion, 

7 if not all of it, would -- would go -- would go to the 

8 State. So, in a situation, such as yours, where the 

9 total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover 

both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be 

11 very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed. And 

12 that seems to me a real, I don't know, gaming -- gaming 

13 of the system. 

14  MR. BROWNING: I don't think it would be a 

gaming of the system, Justice Scalia, if the State, 

16 based upon the statute, based upon its previous 

17 directives would expect the Medicaid beneficiary to seek 

18 recovery of those claims and to remit one-third to the 

19 State. Thank you, Your Honor.

Official 

1 please the Court: 

2  To start with the types of procedures that 

3 States may use to allocate medical damages, I think the 

4 States have a broad range of discretion to determine 

what should be an appropriate allocation. 


6  They're not --


7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you move the 


8 microphone so it's a little closer to you? 


9  MS. ANDERS: Sorry. 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Thank you. 

11  MS. ANDERS: Is this better? 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. Thanks. 

13  MS. ANDERS: So the States are not 

14 determining, they're not trying to reconstruct what the 

plaintiff's and the defendant's intent was in entering 

16 into the settlement. Often, there will be no shared 

17 intent. What -- what the States are doing is 

18 determining what the appropriate allocation should be. 

19 And the States that have individualized determinations, 

which is what we think is required here, have developed 

21 a number of different procedures for doing that. 

22  For instance, a district court in 

23 Pennsylvania, in McKinney --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I have a -- I 

have a theoretical problem right at the outset. I mean, 

46

25

Official 

1 what the statute forbids is asserting a lien on recovery 

2 that is for medical expenses. And you're telling me 

3 that the States aren't even trying to find out what 

4 portion of the recovery was for medical expenses. 

They're looking to determine what proportion should have 

6 been for medical expenses. 

7  How does that tie in with the -- with the 

8 prohibition of the lien? 

9  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think this Court 

established in Ahlborn that the beneficiary and the 

11 State, they respectively have interests in the 

12 settlement that arises from the fact that in the tort 

13 case the plaintiff has asserted claims for medical 

14 damages and for nonmedical damages. 

And so Ahlborn establishes that we need to 

16 divide the two in order to determine what the State may 

17 recover. Ahlborn also establishes that the beneficiary 

18 has an interest in the settlement that arises from her 

19 nonmedical claims that can be allocated away by an 

allocation method, such as one that gives -- that says 

21 that 100 percent of the settlement must always be 

22 allocated to -- to medical damages. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so you're saying that 

24 the State can, in making this determination, in fact 

take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a 

47

25

Official 

1 greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount 

2 in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by 

3 determining how much should have been allocated to 

4 medical expenses, right? 

MS. ANDERS: The State does have some 

6 discretion to determine what the appropriate allocation 

7 is --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're messing up the 

9 lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it. 

MS. ANDERS: Well, I think Ahlborn 

11 establishes that we have to make some kind of division 

12 of the settlement, and when the parties haven't done it, 

13 there's no jury determination. We don't know ahead of 

14 time before the allocation has been done what precisely 

the amount the medical damages should be. But we do 

16 know because the plaintiff, the beneficiary, has 

17 asserted nonmedical claims and she has compromised them, 

18 we do know that she has an interest in the settlement 

19 that arises from her nonmedical claims. 

So for instance, you can imagine the 

21 situation in which a plaintiff has a claim -- a claim 

22 that is 10 percent medical damages and 90 percent lost 

23 -- past lost wages. So they're both equally concrete. 

24 In that situation, when the plaintiff settles for 

pennies on the dollar, I think we -- we would have

Official 

1 serious questions about whether a one-third allocation 

2 to medical damages in that case would be appropriate. 

3  But without an individualized determination, 

4 there would be no way to know whether this is a case in 

which the -- the blanket rule that the State has is 

6 actually overestimating the amount that should be 

7 appropriately allocated to medical damages. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Anders, could you 

9 please finish your response, when you said various 

States do various things. Could you describe some of 

11 them? 

12  MS. ANDERS: Certainly. So for instance, in 

13 McKinney v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, this is a 

14 district court case in Pennsylvania, what the court did 

was it said, we have the settlement; we know how much 

16 the past medical damages were because we know what the 

17 medical bills were; and we can -- we can assume that the 

18 jury, had this case gone to trial, would have awarded 

19 100 percent of the medical damages because they were 

provable and because there weren't disputes about --

21 about that. 

22  And so the court then said, I'm going to 

23 then apply a discount rate for the uncertainty that the 

24 defendant would have been held liable at all. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a

2  MS. ANDERS: That was the Federal district 

3 court. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not a State 

Procedure? 

6  MS. ANDERS: Pennsylvania law. That case 

7 happened to be in Federal court. Pennsylvania law 

8 provided a -- a rebuttable presumption, and so the court 

9 determined --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if 

11 the other -- the parties I guess are coming in and 

12 saying, well, that's not how juries work. They don't 

13 care that this measure of damages is particularly 

14 calculable. They come to a general view. You've got 

medical expenses, you've got pain and suffering. They 

16 make a judgment about that. Would that be a good 

17 argument to make? 

18  MS. ANDERS: I think the Court could take 

19 that into account in allocating, yes, so some --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how would it take 

21 it into account? You said, well, because the medical 

22 expenses are readily calculable, we assume that that's 

23 what the jury meant first, and then the other stuff is 

24 extra so the State can get it. But maybe sometimes they 

just come to a -- a total figure and they don't care how

1 it's allocated. You say, well, that's an argument they 

2 can make. 

3  Well, what's a judge supposed to do in a 

4 particular case? 

MS. ANDERS: Well, I -- this is positing a 

6 situation in which there's been a settlement rather than 

7 a jury determination.  So I think that the -- the court 

8 that's doing the allocating has some discretion here. 

9 And so one thing it can do is say I'm going to 

essentially prioritize medical damages because I think 

11 juries usually will award them. But a State could also 

12 provide that the inquiry should be more equitable and 

13 open-ended. 

14  So, for instance, Illinois and Missouri have 

provided simply that -- that the court shall make an 

16 equitable allocation. It can take into account the fact 

17 that the -- that the plaintiff may receive a double 

18 recovery. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree -- do you 

agree that the only flaw in the North Carolina statute 

21 is that it's a fixed amount, and that if it were a 

22 rebuttable presumption it would be okay? If the North 

23 Carolina law says 30 percent is the cap, but in a 

24 particular case you can show that that's not a fair 

allocation? 

51

15

20

25

Official 

1  MS. ANDERS: That's absolutely right. And 

2 -- and to return to one of Justice Kagan's earlier 

3 questions, I think a one-third allocation may be in the 

4 mine run of cases a reasonable presumption. But there 

will be some cases, like my 90 percent, 10 percent 


6 example, where it isn't a reasonable allocation. 


7  JUSTICE KAGAN: And in those rebuttal 


8 presumption States, can both sides come in and try to 


9 rebut it? So the individual beneficiary can try to 


rebut it, but the States could as well? Or is it just a 

11 right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the 

12 presumption? 

13  MS. ANDERS: I think in those States, it's 

14 just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the 

presumption. Some of those States start with a 

16 rebuttable presumption of full reimbursement. So that 

17 the presumption starts at the full amount that the State 

18 paid. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this is a real, 

significant increase in the burden on the State under 

21 the Medicaid program. You're saying yes, you can try to 

22 recover recovery from third-party tortfeasors, but if 

23 you do that you've got to set up this apparatus where 

24 everybody can come in and you've got to prove what the 

allocation was and all that.

Official 

1  So -- I mean some -- 34 States haven't done 

2 that, right? 

3  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think what's more 

4 significant for our purposes is that 16 States plus D.C. 

have, and --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yes, for your 

7 purposes. But I'm interested in -- in my purposes. And 

8 I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's a 

9 significant financial burden on the State -- if they're 

going to go about trying to recover this money, that 

11 they've got to provide some apparatus, administrative, 

12 judicial, whatever, to make a calculation that I still 

13 don't understand what it's addressed to. 

14  And -- and not only that, but even if you do 

know what it's addressed to, you just take into account 

16 all these things and come up with an equitable. 

17  MS. ANDERS: I don't think that these States 

18 have found that it's a significant administrative 

19 burden. One reason is that once the allocation rules 

are in place, it's our understanding that most of these 

21 cases settle. The beneficiary and the State agree as to 

22 what the allocation is, so this doesn't go to a hearing 

23 in the first place. But even -- even when there are 

24 hearings, I think States can take significant measures 

to lessen the burden.

4  MS. ANDERS: There are -- there are five 


other States like North Carolina that have an 

6 irrebuttable presumption with a cap. There are 10 

7 others that have an irrebuttable presumption, we think, 

8 of full reimbursement. But -- but I should caveat that 

9 by saying that we simply don't know in those States what 

they do, what their practices are. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't -- the missing 

12 part here -- maybe I just missed it -- we're 

13 interpreting a statute, and the part that trumps the 

14 lien provision is the part that says the State is 

entitled to payment that has been made for medical 

16 assistance for health care items -- and some other 

17 similar language is in the statute. 

18  They think their one-third rule is a good 

19 way of measuring that. You think that the one-third 

rule as a rebuttable presumption is a better way of 

21 measuring that. Now normally, or often, I would see 

22 government arguments like that where they'd say, and, by 

23 the way, we're interpreting very technical language in 

24 our statute, and Chevron and/or Skidmore means that you 

should give us particular weight.

14  MR. MADDREY: We have heard a lot about what

16 do under the Medicaid Act to fulfill its obligations? 

17 The Fourth Circuit and respondents and apparently the 

18 United States say they have to have a post-settlement 

19 trial, I guess a trial to settle the settlement. And 

that, while an available option, is not a mandatory 

21 requirement under anything that I can see in the 

22 Medicaid Act. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General, how about 

24 this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here 

because I think a State could come in, or I think there

1 is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and 

2 say -- you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our 

3 best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an 

4 individualized decision-making on top of that. 

But as I understand your argument, that is 

6 not what you are saying. You are making a very 

7 different kind of argument, suggesting that you can peg 

8 this number any place, no matter what the relationship 

9 between the number and the actual allocation that 

cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical 

11 damages in the real world. 

12  So if that's the case, what do I do? 

13  MR. MADDREY: Your Honor, the statute --

14 North Carolina's statute defines the amount that must be 

included for the repayment by the Medicaid recipient. 

16 It's not guessing after the fact, but instead providing 

17 in advance, the recipe as to how to put the settlement 

18 together. It tells the parties what they have to do. 

19 And that makes it a bright-line rule, which I think you 

need to compare to the alternative, which is this --

21 this, what the Fourth Circuit called a true value 

22 hearing after the fact, after the settlement, how did --

23 how did they get there? Is it what they did or what 

24 they should have done or what they could have done?

your medical expenses? And using the Solicitor 

6 General's Office example, everybody knows that the true 

7 value of medical expenses in a particular case was only 

8 10 percent, you are still getting 30 percent. How do 

9 we -- how do we honor the terms of the Federal statute? 

MR. MADDREY: Because the State statute says 

11 the State never recovers more than its actual medical 

12 expenses. If in that hypothetical the medical expenses 

13 were 100,000 or 10 percent, the North Carolina statute 

14 would say North Carolina gets up to one-third of the 

settlement but never more than they paid. 

16  So by definition it can't be for something 

17 that was not medicals. And that's the bright-line rule 

18 that the North Carolina statute creates. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

21  (Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the 

22 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
