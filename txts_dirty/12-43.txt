CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 12-43, PPL Corporation and Subsidiaries v. 

the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 

Mr. Clement? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This case has its origins in a decision by 

the British government in the Major Thatcher years to 

privatize a number of previously State-owned utilities. 

The government's plan was to keep prices constant and 

allow the companies to make profits by increasing 

efficiencies and reducing costs. Only after an initial 

period in which prices would be fixed would the prices 

be re-jiggered and then savings passed on to the 

consumers. 

Now, this, in practice, worked very well for 

the companies. They were able to increase their 

efficiencies and cut costs to a greater extent than 

people expected. This was not, however, greeted as a 

uniform success. Instead, the opposition party 

criticized this and said that the fat cats at the

utility companies had earned too much and the 

conservative government had made a mistake by valuing 

the shares at IPO too cheaply. 

And so they promised, as an express election 

promise, to impose a tax on the excess profits of 

privatized utilities. And, when elected, they made good 

on that promise and passed the Windfall Act --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: See, I have a problem 

with this argument because it assumes a way of looking 

at this, but it's an assumption. You can look at it in 

either way. You can look at it as they made too much 

money, we want a part of that profit, or they paid too 

little for what they got. 

And that was the debate going on in 

Congress. Did they pay too little on the floatation 

value? Or did they make too much money? And what the 

government says -- rightly -- is whether you paid too 

much or too little money depends on the value of the 

company. And one of the factors that goes into that is 

how much money has the company made? 

And so you always have to look at profits, 

to some extent. So what's wrong with looking at it 

their way? Why does it have to be your way? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, it has to be my way 

because of the way the specific tax was designed. But

the first --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you can only do it 

your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take 

out from your simplified equation the fact that the 

time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant. 

You artificially freeze it the time at which they 

operated. Only by freezing that number can you come out 

with your equation. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Your Honor, we're not 

artificially freezing the -- the number. The number --

the D -- 1461 for almost every company -- is, itself, 

part of the statute because they picked a period by 

which they were going to measure the profit in 

value-making terms. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was at least 

two or three companies that had a very different period, 

and they paid a huge amount, much further than their 

gross profits. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I can talk about the 

outlying --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because of that, D 

changed for them. 

MR. CLEMENT: I can talk about the outlying 

companies. They paid a different effective rate because 

the D was different. But there's two important things

to remember. One, I believe it's common ground between 

the parties, that the way you applied this regulation is 

to look at the tax in -- to use the regulatory phrase --

in the normal circumstances in which it applies. 

So I believe it's common ground that you 

ignore the outliers anyway. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you change the other 

part of the equation -- or of the tax regulation, which 

says it has to be true for all taxpayers. 

MR. CLEMENT: No. That particular 

provision -- think of it as like a Clark v. Martinez 

principle for taxes. They either are creditable or 

they're not. That's what that principle has been 

interpreted to. The case you should look at, if you're 

really interested in it, is the Exxon case, the tax 

court, we cite it in both our briefs. 

And, there, it was a situation where, again, 

a British Excess Profits Tax, in the main, it was an 

Excess Profits Tax on the companies that were developing 

the North Sea oil field. But, as the tax applied to a 

couple of companies that really hadn't gotten any oil 

out, it applied very differently. 

And the tax court and the government in that 

case both conceded, no, you look at the tax in its main 

applications. And in those main applications, everyone

concedes that this tax operates exactly like a 

51.75 percent tax on profits above a threshold, a 

threshold of 4/9ths of the floatation value. 

And that is not an accident. That's not 

some kind of tricky math thing that somebody pulled up. 

It's right there in the statute itself because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose everyone in the 

case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to 

compensate the government for having valued the shares 

at too low a price, and this was stated right in the 

enactment. Would that change your argument? 

MR. CLEMENT: It wouldn't, Justice Kennedy, 

because, at the end of the day, it's the substance of 

the tax, not its purpose behind it that matters. Now, I 

do think, in this case, as Justice Sotomayor alluded to, 

everybody in this process really understood that those 

were just the flip side of the same coin. 

You can talk about the profits being too 

high, vis-à-vis floatation, you can talk about 

floatation being too low vis-à-vis the subsequently 

reported profits, but what makes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose we think 

this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value. 

Then what do we do? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, in this particular case,

1 you would say it's creditable because the only measure 

2 of value here is by looking at retrospective earnings 

3 over a 4-year period. And the best hypothetical I can 

4 give you is think about a foreign government that says 

we want to tax the value of corporations, but the way we 

6 are idiosyncratically going to measure value is to look 

7 at their earnings over the past year. 

8  Now, I would hope that tax would be for U.S. 

9 substantive economic tax purposes fully creditable. Of 

course, it's a tax on income, by our eyes. Now, in 

11 saying that, you're not suggesting that the other company --

12 the other country did something wrong or that's not value in 

13 their conception. 

14  But the whole point that this Court made 

clear in the Biddle case, going back 75 years ago, is 

16 when you're looking at foreign taxes, for purposes of 

17 applying the foreign tax credit, you don't take the 

18 foreign characterizations, the foreign classifications, 

19 as a given. You look at the substance of the tax for 

our purposes. 

21  And, if you look -- if you apply that 

22 mechanism to this tax, this tax looks exactly like a 

23 U.S. Excess Profits Tax. It is really --

could just -- suppose -- we say, well, this is a 

one-time tax, in order to recalculate, reassess the 

value. If it's on income, it's still an Excess Profits 

Tax, in your view? 

MR. CLEMENT: Yes. And, of course, you 

could have had a one-time, one-off tax, to use the 

British phrase, and you could have taxed the difference 

between the value at floatation and -- let's say the 

London Stock Exchange price at some later point. And 

that would have been a normal estimate of value, and it 

would not have been creditable for a number of reasons. 

But when you do what this tax uniquely did, 

which is you don't look at a normal rubric of value, but 

you look at a construct -- I mean, the very fact that 

they had to use the phrase "value in profit-making 

terms" tells you something weird's going on here. I 

mean, if they were really --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, is there 

another example -- Justice Kennedy mentioned that this 

was what they call "one-off." It's one time only, and 

it's retrospective. Is -- is there any instance in 

which a foreign tax credit has been given to something 

that looks like this, a one-time only adjustment that 

is -- that operates retrospectively on past earnings?

all the pieces of that together and say there's one case 

that had all of these various features, and then it was 

still creditable, but I don't think that matters. It's 

very clear, I think, for starters, that the fact that 

this is a retroactive tax is not dispositive. 

You look at one of the regulatory 

requirements, and that's realization. And that treats 

an estimate of future income generation very differently 

because that doesn't involve a realization event. But 

what the regulation says is that the tax has to be 

imposed upon or subsequent to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My fear is, as warned by 

the government and the tax professors, that the rule you 

want us to announce to help you win is to say anytime a 

tax uses estimates of profits, no matter how it does it, 

it is credible -- creditable. That's the rule you want. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, it is not. It is 

emphatically not. And let me tell you why there is no 

slippery slope here. First, the big thing they want to 

tell you is this is a normal way of valuation. And, if 

you allow this, then any valuation is going to be 

creditable. That is flat wrong, and the reason that's 

flat wrong is because almost every effort in valuation 

is prospective. 

If you want to try to value a piece of

property, you could value it by saying, well, what kind 

of rents can I get on this property, and I'll discount 

them back to net present value. And I suppose you can 

conceive of a property tax as a tax on a percentage of 

those projected future earnings. 

But you know what? Easily obviously not 

creditable because the first requirement on the 

regulation is that there be a realization event. And 

when you're talking about projected future income 

streams, there's no realization events. So all of those 

are off the table. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't that to say 

I want to find the original floatation value, and, 

instead of estimating what the profits are, I'm simply 

going to use the ones that happen? 

MR. CLEMENT: Exactly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is that 

different? 

MR. CLEMENT: Because you never would do 

that in any normal valuation. What you would do --

occasionally, in valuation, you have to go back in time. 

This isn't the only place in the world that anybody 

said, I wonder what Google's stock was worth, like, back 

in the day. 

But, when you do that for valuation

purposes, the first rule of thumb is to avoid hindsight 

bias, and so this tax uniquely taxes nothing, but 

hindsight bias. It's going back to 1990 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there -- there is 

an argument about that because it has two components 

that you keep ignoring, the floatation value and the 

time that the company --

MR. CLEMENT: I would love to talk about 

those other variables. The floatation value -- I mean, 

it's a tax between the difference between -- between two 

variables. 

The reason I am focusing on the value and 

profit-making terms is because it's the larger of the 

two numbers, and the tax falls in the difference between 

the two, and the floatation value is basically taken as 

a given. And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry, 

please. 

MR. CLEMENT: Go ahead. I mean, I could 

talk floatation value all day. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'd really like to 

hear -- I'd really like to hear what you are going to 

say. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Then let me ask you

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ok. Do you agree -- I mean, you 

4 said we should look to the way this is designed, so 

let's look to the way that the actual formula is 

6 designed. 

7  Do you agree that this tax would impose 

8 identical tax liability for companies with -- at the 

9 same average profits, but could impose very different 

tax liability for companies with the same total profits? 

11  That's the way the thing is designed, is it 

12 not? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: Yes, and that's true of every 

14 Excess Profits Tax, Your Honor. What matters for those 

tax --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's the question. 

17 Is that true of every Excess Profits Tax? Take a -- a 

18 hypothetical like this: You have two companies, Company 

19 A and Company B, and one company operates over four 

years and makes a lot of money, and one company operates 

21 over one year and makes only a quarter of that amount of 

22 money. 

23  Now, a typical Excess Profits Tax is going 

24 to take Company A, which has made a lot of money, and --

and it's going to end up paying four times as much tax

as Company B, which has made only a quarter of the 

amount of money. But, under this tax, Company A and 

Company B pay the exact same thing; isn't that right? 

MR. CLEMENT: No. They -- they would pay 

different taxes. I mean, they pay the same rate --

JUSTICE KAGAN: One year or four years? 

Four --

MR. CLEMENT: They have the same -- they'd 

have the same rate. They'd have -- I mean, 

the same calculation, but it would affect them very 

differently. But in --

JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, a company 

that has made four times as much profits under this 

formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't think --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Because it was operating 

four times as long. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And because there is that D 

variable. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right -- that's right. But, 

of course, the floatation value is going to play a 

bigger role in the other company --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Assuming the floatation 

value is the same for both companies.

MR. CLEMENT: Then -- then maybe it could, 

Justice Kagan, but let me say two things about that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: It definitely could. It 

would have to. And that's because what this is trying 

to tax is not total profits. This is trying to tax 

average profits, or what may be the better way to say 

it, is it's taxing profitability and not profits. 

MR. CLEMENT: No. With all due respect, 

it's taxing profits above a threshold, and the threshold 

is determined by floatation value. For most companies 

that the tax applies -- and that is the way you look at 

the creditability of these taxes, you ignore the 

outlier. For most of those companies, it's going to be 

4/9ths of the floatation value. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but the reason why 

this formula was devised in the way that this formula 

was devised was specifically to get at the outlier. In 

other words, it was to get at the company that only 

operated for a short amount of time, but they wanted 

that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the 

company that had operated for a much longer amount of 

time and had made many more profits. 

So the end result is that this company that 

operates for a very short amount of time and makes 

almost no excess profits pays the exact same tax bill as

a company with four times as much excess profits. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, that's not right, Your 

Honor. I -- it really is not. And what they were 

trying to do -- first of all, the outliers, the reason 

they included them in is they figured they had to 

because it fit within their definition of the regulated 

companies they were trying to catch. 

Now, they knew they had -- and this is only 

two companies we are talking about -- they knew they had 

a shorter period, so they knew this would fall 

differently on them as a substantive matter no matter --

no matter how they did it. 

The reason they didn't care much is because 

those companies got something that the other companies 

didn't, which is they got to operate for the next three 

years in a favorable regulatory environment in which no 

Excess Profits Tax would be imposed on them. So it may 

look like they have a higher rate -- effective rate 

under our calculation. 

They do have a higher effective rate over 

a -- over a relatively small amount over the threshold, 

but they make that up, essentially, in the out-years 

because they make money under the favorable regulatory 

regime. 

And, again, the theory of this is, for four

years after floatation, there is a favorable regulatory 

regime in which they make excess profits. Those two 

companies get to make money in the out-years, two, 

three, four, without any excess profits because it was 

really important for them to make this a one-off tax. 

But if I can get back to your question 

because there is this phenomenon --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why -- why 

didn't -- why weren't they subject to a favorable 

regulatory regime in two, three, and four? 

MR. CLEMENT: They were. They weren't --

but they weren't subject to any tax for it because, 

remember, they -- this is very important for Labour. 

They are coming in after 20 years of conservative rule. 

They don't want to be the old Labour party. They don't 

want to put in a new permanent tax, so they want to do 

this once. 

And so that works great for my clients 

because they -- they were privatized in 1990. But, when 

they're doing this in 1997, they get a couple of 

outlying companies that were only privatized in '96. So 

what they do is they hit them with a reasonably tough 

tax in year one, but year two, three, and four, they 

were in a favorable regulatory environment, and they get 

no tax at all. So -- you know, don't -- don't cry any

tears for them. 

Now, the point I thought you were going 

to ask me, though, is, even with the companies with the 

same denominator, it is true that companies with the 

same profits can be subjected to different taxes, but 

that's because it's an Excess Profits Tax. And that is 

what is true of --

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but even companies with 

the exact same profits and the exact same floatation 

value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a 

result of the amount of time, that's a result of the D 

variable. If you were right --

MR. CLEMENT: With respect, that's only true 

of --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. If you were 

right, the D variable wouldn't exist. If this were an 

Excess Profits Tax, it would have been written without a 

D variable because they would not have cared whether it 

was four years or one year or any place in-between. 

MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I disagree 

because, first of all, it's only those two companies, 

from what you said, is -- it could possibly be true. As 

to the rest of the companies, the reason that they were 

trying to use D is because they were trying to capture 

the excess profits during a period in which there is a

particular regulatory environment with -- where they --

where they thought they earned excess profits. 

For all of the companies they reached, that 

period was the D with the exception of the outliers, and 

the reason they had a different outlier is because they 

were recently privatized. But, if you think about the 

substance of this tax, it is taxing -- their term --

value and profit-making terms, but not any abstract 

profit-making terms, profits over a reported period. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: If you were right, it would 

just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th 

of floatation value, and it's not that. It's not 

that -- specifically, in order to get at railroad track, 

which would have paid very little tax under your 

formula, but, instead, pays a great amount of tax 

because they think that railroad track got the same good 

deal at the beginning as all these other companies did, 

but -- so, even though they didn't make very much 

in the way of excess profits, they were going to tax 

them just as much. 

MR. CLEMENT: Because they had three free 

years in the out-years. And, if you are looking at how 

this applies, in the normal circumstances of its 

application, then you don't have the full analysis of a 

railroad track.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with their 

argument, Mr. Clement, is that you are undermining your 

own argument. If they are getting three full years at a 

lesser tax, it's because their floatation value was made 

more equal by this formula. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, that's not right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they don't need to be 

taxed any more, moving forward, because they got it 

right. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, that's -- with all due 

respect, that's not right. The floatation value is 

calculated the same way for each of these companies, and 

the theory of why the floatation value is too low is the 

same for all of them, which is, under the regulatory 

policies, they are going to hold the prices firm for a 

four-year period, and they are going to increase 

efficiencies and reduce costs, and they are going to 

make money. 

That is supposed to incentivize them, and 

then that's the basis for all the regulatory policies 

going forward. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I wanted -- I just wanted 

to hear what you were going to say in answer to the 

second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.

us, which I felt I needed, the second term -- that 

second term. And that just says, "FV," for value. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But I did notice, that if 

you make .23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence, 

happens to be what the companies would have made over 

a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth 

that the value of such companies was, as valued by the 

market, 9 times their earnings because a company that's 

valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point 

something percent per year -- taking aside all other 

factors -- and 2 years' worth is that. 

And I don't know if I've got that part 

right, but, if I do have that part right, then what this 

tax does is it takes the profits the firms actually --

actually made over 2 years -- not quite actually. It 

assumes twice the -- the value of the first year. 

You see, so whatever they made the first 

year -- and, if it's only 6 months, it's twice 6 

months -- you know -- that first part figures out what 

they really made over the first year and then multiplies 

it by two. And you take that, and you subtract from 

that the amount that they would have made over 2 years. 

Now -- so it looked, to me, pretty -- this 

helps you, of course, but -- but it also is calculated

on an average, the average of the first year's profit, 

they consider that the average; and, therefore, they are 

right in saying -- you know, a firm that was only in 

business for 6 months will be taxed -- the whole 2-year 

extra will be taken away, even when there was no 2-year 

extra, you see? So that firm would have paid more than 

their gross income. 

Of course, there is no such firm, and that's 

their problem, but we come to that later. But I want 

your view, if you can -- if I've explained it clearly 

enough, so you get where I'm coming from, and -- and --

if -- if I have explained that clearly enough, I'd really 

appreciate what you think about it. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think so, but I 

think I get there in a slightly different way because I 

guess I don't see the natural relationship between the 

23 percent and the floatation value, but I think I get 

to a similar place, which is, if you think about it the 

way that we formulate it, it's 51.75 percent of 4/9ths 

of floatation value. 

Now, the -- the floatation value is 

calculated based on the initial share price, plus the 

number of shares. And the initial share price for all 

the electrical utilities was 2 pounds, 40 pence. So 

it's just 2 pounds, 40 pence, by however many shares

there were. Okay. So that's floatation value. 

The -- the floor for the excess profits is 

4/9ths of floatation value. Now, if you want to get it 

on an annualized average basis and if you want to -- you 

know, this is at 64a of the petition appendix when the 

Tax Court did it -- but what that means in practice is 

this tax is taxing 51.75 percent of the profits above 

1/9th of the floatation --

JUSTICE BREYER: It will do that for firms 

that are in business for 4 years.

They want to focus on the fact that, well,

cares? I mean, that's just an artificial number. 

This --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go back to my 

initial question. What's the rule? If someone uses 

your actual profits in any way, it's a credit that they 

are entitled to? 

MR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think so because, 

again --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't know how 

you get around it because you seem to be saying to us 

that, no matter how -- what formula you create, so long 

as we can simplify it in math to affect which -- take 

any variables in it and fix them in any way, that's a 

creditable tax. That seems to be what your argument is. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, it's not, 

Justice Sotomayor. Now, there's two things your 

question, I think, got to; one, I thought I already 

dealt with, which is future valuation is not a problem. 

There is no realization of it.

way, you say is wrong. 

MR. CLEMENT: And it's not right or wrong. 

We would say it's creditable, if that's its predominant 

character. So if you want to put that as part of a 

ten-factor test, where past realized profits is one of 

the ten factors, but you also look at real market 

valuation and some other factor, then I'm probably going 

to lose. 

But, in this instance, the only moving 

factor -- the only thing that changes from 

company-to-company, other than the floatation value, 

which is fixed, is their profits. And nobody -- you 

know, nobody doubts --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, the floatation value 

is not fixed. It was different for each company. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They only fixed the 

percentage that they're going to use, but the actual 

amount paid was different for every company. 

MR. CLEMENT: But, again, that is classic 

Excess Profits Tax. So let me try to come at it this 

way, which is to say, suppose you had a country that had 

a tax that said, we are going to tax your value, and we 

are going to measure your -- your -- your value based on 

the income you made in the last year or the last 2

years. 

Now, I would say that that is clearly a 

creditable income tax. If they said the same thing, we 

are going to tax your value, and we are going to 

calculate your value based on your income over the last 

2 years, but we are going to subtract 10 percent of your 

market cap, that would be an Excess Profits Tax. 

The market cap would be different for every 

company, so there would be another thing that was 

different for each company, and the effective rate might 

be different, but that's okay because that's how an 

excessive profits tax works. 

The last thing I'd say before I go sit down 

is that's how the 1917 United States Excess Profits Tax 

worked. In 1918, when Congress said that foreign excess 

profits taxes are creditable, surely, that's what they 

had in mind, and this is very similar to that classic, 

prototypical Excess Profits Tax. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time?

1  The windfall tax is not an income tax. It 

2 tax -- is a tax on an increment of company value. A 

3 company's profits multiplied by a price to earnings 

4 ratio is a typical way of imputing a value on a company. 

Using profits as one variable in that valuation formula 

6 does not transform a tax on company value into an income 

7 tax. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a way of 

9 estimating future value. I -- I don't know that anybody 

values a company that -- that is sold on the market by 

11 saying how much money did they make in the last 2 years, 

12 and we are going to multiply that by 9. You look at 

13 what people were paying you in the market. 

14  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Scalia, the --

what Parliament was trying to do here was to impute a 

16 value on the company for which it should have been sold in 

17 1990. And so using a stock price at some later date 

18 would not have been an adequate proxy to determine what 

19 that value should have been. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If they know what it really 

21 was, I guess they're all billionaires. You've got 

22 triple billionaires. I mean, if you could go and figure 

23 out what companies could really be sold at, as opposed

you. I don't know why either of us is working here.

value, I -- I mean, maybe there is because they did it 

in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next 

day into the market, and, when it went the next day into 

the market, did the market pay a lot more? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, it did.

on the next day, that wouldn't capture all of the 

efficiencies that were realized over the --

it shows up to be in the future couldn't have been the

they are all not geniuses who are -- own the whole 

world, they must not be perfect experts.

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it was a number picked 

by whatever company had -- what is it, the -- the lowest 

price earnings ratio or something like that. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Right. The lowest average 

price ratio. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But that doesn't --

that means whatever company that the shareholders 

thought would deviate the least from whatever the return

What I want is an answer from you, and the 

answer I want from you is this: As I read it and once 

understand that this number is a semi made-up number, I 

did look at that second term, and I thought that .23 

times 9 is about 2 years' worth -- about 2 years' worth 

of profits that would be expected, all things left out 

of it, except profit. 

And so then, once I saw that, I looked at 

the first term. And the first term seemed, to me, to be 

their actual profit -- their actual profit on an annual 

basis multiplied by about the same number, you see? 

And so what we do is we take -- about 

multiplying, you see -- so we take about two years' 

worth of profit that they actually made, and we subtract 

from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they 

should have made as -- on the basis of the original 

market price. The rest is excess profit, and we seize 

all of it, for two years only. 

And, by the way, if a company had only six 

months' worth, well, then -- you know, they might really 

be hurt because, after all, they only earned six months 

at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they 

didn't really earn it over the next 18 months. But the 

reply was there was no such company. And, of course, 

because time periods vary, rates will vary.

But I don't know that that matters for an 

income tax. It's not a question of the rate; it's a 

question on what you impose it. And you impose it on 

income because, as he says, there are two choices here. 

Number is really calculated on the basis of income, and 

there is another number going on, the actual floatation 

value, and this third thing, which is called the number 

9. But, primarily, it is the income that makes the 

difference. 

Now, that's his argument. What's your 

response? That's his argument, as I understand it. 

don't want to put words in his mouth. But you -- you 

explain it to me. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I think the 

problem with -- when we start to reformulate what this 

tax is or is not taxing or what the amount of the actual 

tax is, just shows the danger of trying to reformulate 

what parliament actually did in trying to determine if 

it's an income tax. 

As the professor's amicus brief points out, 

if you reformulated this into an average annual profit 

or left the P over 4 as it was and then divided 

everything else by 9, this would become a 207 percent 

tax on --

you can answer that by saying, no, it's not so what. 

mean, isn't an income tax dependant upon whether it's a 

tax on income, not the rate? And -- and whether some 

companies pay a high rate and others pay a low rate, 

even if that's totally arbitrary, wouldn't make a 

definition to the characterization. 

MS. O'CONNELL: In that characterization --

JUSTICE BREYER: As long as you're not --

they actually have the gross income from which this 

comes. 

MS. O'CONNELL: In that characterization, 

Justice Breyer, the 207 percent of average annual 

profits over 1/9th of floatation value, then, no, it's 

not an income tax and the rate does matter because it's 

completely confiscatory of that profits base. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it will. Wait, wait, 

wait, wait. It is greater than the profit they earned 

during the year, but it is not greater than the profit 

that they earned during the two years -- or whatever the 

period is that everybody's paying this on.

not taxed more than the gross income of the companies. 

Is that -- is that --

MS. O'CONNELL: They have not taxed more 

than the total profits over a four-year period, which 

is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Four-year period. Well, 

that's -- well -- well, is it not going to be an income 

tax if what the U.S. government says, though it hasn't 

said it, it could say, we want -- we want 35 percent of 

what you earn over six years. Okay. That's what we 

want. Now, that's still an income tax, isn't it? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the U.S. income tax --

what the regulation looks for is taxes that have the 

essential features of the U.S. income tax. And, no, the 

U.S. income tax has never been imposed on a multiple of 

profits. It's -- it's imposed as a percentage of --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you say whatever -- if 

they impose it on more than a year, any -- any country 

that calculates the income tax over a period for more 

than a year is outside the tax treaty because it's 

essential to the nature of the American income tax 

system that it be calculated year by year.

if there was a country that imposed an income tax every 

six years and said, every sixth year, you'll pay an 

income tax over the last six years, then that would 

probably still be an income tax. 

But the point is that, here, that's not 

anything close to what they're doing or what Parliament 

has done. Parliament has taken a valuation formula, 

where it takes an actual earnings figure from the 

company -- an average annual earnings figure, and 

multiplies it by a price-to-earnings ratio to impute a 

value on the company. 

It then subtracts out what it actually 

received for the company, which we think shows that the 

substance of this tax is that it's a tax on an increment 

of company value. Parliament is calculating what it 

should have sold the company for, subtracting out what 

it actually received.

MS. O'CONNELL: That's right. I think we 

generally agree with the Petitioner that a tax is -- is 

either an income tax or not an income tax for everybody 

that's subject to the tax and that you look at it in the 

normal circumstances in which it applies. 

But -- but I do completely agree that the 

fact that the D figure changes makes this -- just 

reinforces the idea that the substance of this tax --

again, that's not an argument you've made.

make it. I mean, that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the amicus 

did, but I don't think we should do a better job of 

getting money from people than the IRS does. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the point is that --

the fact that there is a D variable there shows that 

what Parliament was trying to do was to place an annual 

earnings figure on each company to create a value for 

it. A company -- it's not similar to an Excess Profits 

Tax in that way, that where a company that operated for 

only six months is paying the tax at the same level that 

a company would be that was making profits at the same

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's a good 

articulation of the argument you haven't made. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are accepting the 

position the government made in PPL v. Exxon. You're 

not disavowing the position you took there? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Right. But it -- it depends 

on the normal circumstances in which it applies. But --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're -- you're not 

saying that the amicus brief is wrong. The Chief 

Justice is, of course, right, the amicus brief is the 

amicus brief, and the amicus brief develops this 

argument, which I think is the right argument. But 

you're not saying that's wrong? 

MS. O'CONNELL: It's not wrong. We think 

that both the -- the D variable and the flotation value 

variable add extra support for the idea that this is a 

tax on an increment of company value. The D shows that 

it's trying to impute an annual earnings figure on each 

company. 

The floatation value shows that it's not 

concerned just with how profitable any particular 

company is, but with how profitable it is in relation to 

what the UK government received for it as value when it 

floated the company.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you were 

saying that that argument was wrong because you looked 

to the predominant character of the tax and that it's 

either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not. 

It wouldn't be an income tax on the vast 

majority of the companies where it was the same and not 

on the companies where it was a large value or the other 

way around. You look at the predominant characteristic 

and you decide whether it's a tax or not on that basis. 

MS. O'CONNELL: That's right. But I'm not 

saying that the -- that the argument the amicus are 

making is wrong. We're -- we're just saying --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Because they're saying this 

is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this 

doesn't tax anybody's income. It taxes annual -- excuse 

me -- it taxes average profits, not total profits. It 

taxes profitability as a mechanism to tax value. 

MS. O'CONNELL: That particular aspect of 

the amicus brief that says, if it's bad for one, it's 

bad for all, yes, that is not our position. If it -- it 

is not our position, that you look at the tax based on 

the normal circumstances in which it applies. 

So I think we are in general agreement with 

PPL that, if there are outliers, where net gain would be 

totally confiscated, you'd look at it in the -- in the

normal circumstances in which it applies. That's what 

the regulation says. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now, I'm totally 

confused because this outlier is an outlier not because 

the tax hasn't worked. It's an -- it's an outlier that 

the tax is designed to get at, that this formula was 

developed with this D variable, in order to make sure 

that outliers, meaning people -- companies that operated 

for only a short amount of time would still pay a 

significant tax bill. 

So the whole design of this tax was to get 

at the outlier. That seems, to me, to suggest that the 

predominant character of the tax is not an income tax, 

but is, instead, a value tax. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I mean, you could also 

get to that by saying that the predominant character of 

this tax is -- is not an income tax because of the way 

that it applies to everybody else. I think that's our 

principal argument. 

If there were some outlying companies for 

which this didn't look like an income tax, I think the 

regulation allows some flexibility there where it says, 

we look at it in the normal circumstances in which it 

applies. And, if that makes it an income tax, then it's 

an income tax for everybody.

I think an important point here is that the 

Petitioners have conceded that if Parliament had chosen 

a different valuation method, like the stock price, for 

any particular company and then subtracted out the 

floatation value, that that would not be a tax on 

income, that that would be a value tax. 

The fact that Parliament chose a different 

way to place a value on each company shouldn't become a 

tax on income just because profits is one variable in 

that tax equation. That would open up many foreign 

taxes that just use this typical earnings times the 

price-to-earnings ratio for an income tax credit -- a 

dollar-for-dollar credit in the United States, just 

because the tax was written that way. 

We think what Parliament was doing here was 

clearly trying to impute a value on each company and 

then subtracting out what it actually received. In 

substance, it's a tax on value, as well as in form. 

If the Court thinks that both of the 

formulas are equivalent, the tax that Parliament 

actually wrote and the rewritten tax of 51.75 percent of 

your four years of profits over 4/9ths of the floatation 

value, then there is a couple of reasons that you should 

go with the tax that Parliament actually wrote. 

The first is that exemptions from taxation

are construed narrowly, and a business -- a foreign 

income tax that is paid to a foreign -- or I'm sorry --

a foreign tax that is paid to a foreign government that 

is not an income tax is usually just treated as a 

deduction. 

And the IRS has said, throughout this case, 

that it is perfectly happy to treat this windfall tax as 

a deduction; it just would not get a dollar-for-dollar 

credit --

JUSTICE BREYER: On that -- on the question 

of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority, but, I 

mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I 

think the people in the tax court actually, usually, 

know more about it than the judges who are not on the 

tax court. 

And so when I get an opinion and the tax 

court all thinks one thing and then the court of appeals 

is thinking something else and it's highly technical, 

I -- I tend to be tempted to say, well, the tax courts 

deserve something. 

Now, is there anything, really? Am I just 

doing that wrong, if I did that? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Breyer, with 

due respect to the tax court, the tax court didn't even 

analyze any of the three regulatory tests that are set

forth in the regulation. I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you would --

you would answer that, that the Commissioner gets some 

credit, too. This is the Commissioner -- this is a 

Treasury regulation. So one question is: Do we owe 

that regulation any kind of -- any kind of deference? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. I think, to the extent 

that there is any ambiguity about what the regulation 

means, then the Commissioner's interpretation of his own 

regulation is entitled to some order of deference along 

the lines of "our." And all --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there is no 

difference between what the Commissioner says the 

regulation means and what it says. 

MS. O'CONNELL: That's true. Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't seem to 

move the ball much, one way or the other. 

MS. O'CONNELL: That's true, unless you 

accept Petitioner's argument, that what the regulation 

means when it says you evaluate the tax based on its 

predominant character is that that means you can rewrite 

the tax before you start testing it against the three 

regulatory requirements, and, in which case, this would 

be a 51.75 percent tax on four years of profits that you 

are testing against the three regulatory requirements.

In which case, yes, it would probably be an 

income tax, but that's not how the Commissioner views 

the regulation. The Commissioner views that predominant 

character test as, so long as the tax is predominantly 

one where you -- it is on realized income and is 

calculated by starting with gross receipts and 

subtracting out costs and expenses, there can be minor, 

nonconforming elements in the tax base -- like the 

inclusion of imputed rental income that is not actually 

earned by a taxpayer, which some countries include in an 

income tax, and the tax could still be creditable. 

The predominant character does not mean --

the predominant character test does not mean that you 

completely rewrite the statutory tax base before you 

test it against those three regulatory requirements. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you -- go 

ahead. 

What if they impose this -- what you would 

call valuation tax every year, and it was based the same 

way, it's based on profits that year, saying, we're 

going to say, we think the value of this company is now 

this much because they made -- whatever -- $20 million 

last year. And so we impose this -- this set tax. 

The next year, we think its value is this 

because they made -- you know, 10 million, so we are

going to impose this tax. 

MS. O'CONNELL: I think that would not be an 

income tax because they are using a valuation formula 

that is imputing a value on the company and then 

taxing that value. It's like a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Based solely --

based solely on the amount of income? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, if that -- if that 

were the only characteristic, then I think a property 

tax that is calculated that way could become an income 

tax, and that's not what the income tax credit -- the 

foreign tax credit is designed to do. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How could -- a 

property tax calculated that way? In other words, based 

on income from the property? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Times a price-to-earnings 

ratio. If -- if what you are saying is that the -- the 

tax that the foreign government is imposing is just a 

tax based on last year's income, and they are calling it 

a property tax or something like that, I think that is 

what Petitioner was giving as an example. 

That, I'm -- I think, I think would be an 

income tax. If the only variable in the tax base was 

profits, yes. If they --

are going to multiply it by a price/earnings ratio. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Based on how much 

you earned. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which sounds like 

income. 

MS. O'CONNELL: No, that sounds like value. 

And I -- and that's another thing that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the "how much 

you earned" part sounds like income. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, but -- but any 

valuation formula will use some known data from the 

company to determine the company's value. So, if you 

are -- if you just -- if you are applying just to a 

company -- say that the United States was imposing a 

property tax on corporations and it decided to calculate 

the value of the corporation by taking its last year's 

earnings times the price-to-earnings ratio, that could 

be reformulated to look like a tax on the company's --

JUSTICE BREYER: If the reformulation --

think of -- think that first term. Put it in your mind. 

Now, that first term does have a number -- .23 -- and 

let's do times 9, which is that valuation business. And 

what you get is a little over 2. Okay?

And you are going to get that every time. 

That's not going to vary from company-to-company. That 

varies as long as the universe is here. So we know 

we're going to multiply .2 -- rather, 2 point something 

times that first part of the first term. 

And that first part of the first term 

consists of nothing other than, for the four-year 

company, the average one-year profit. So the only --

what you are telling people to do in that first term is 

simply multiply by a little over than 2 -- a little more 

than 2 -- the average profit earned over a four-year 

period. That's what it says. 

So there is nothing there but income. It's 

average income, I grant you. But there is nothing there 

but income. And then what you subtract from that --

what you subtract from that is a quarter -- is a quarter 

of the value, I grant you. But it's a hypothetical 

value used with the number 9 of what one-quarter of the 

value of the floatation price taken in. 

So there's an aspect to it that does have --

unless you do it the way I was doing it initially --

there is an aspect to it that does concern at least a 

hypothetical value. But the heart of the equation, in 

determining this so-called present value, is nothing 

other than taking average income over the four-year

Now, if I'm right -- am I right about that? 

MS. O'CONNELL: No. If you're --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

MS. O'CONNELL: First of all, if the first 

part of the equation is -- is profits multiplied by 2, 

then -- then no. That -- that is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It is -- the very 

first part of the first part is the profits -- the 

average profit over the four-year period. It says P. 

And then P, with all of this day business, that's just 

times 365 because they want to annualize it. 

So, if you have a four years, what you are 

going to have is you -- you will have 365 times -- and 

then it's going to wipe out, and you will have divided 

by 4. So you will take the total profit over the 

four-year period, and you'll divide it by 4. That gives 

you the annual profit. So, now, we have finished the 

first half of the first part. 

And the second half -- and we are going to 

take .23 of that. Okay? 

No, we are not going to take any yet. 

Taking .23 -- you're going to take .23 of the number 9, 

and that leaves you with the 2 -- that brings you to the 

little over 2.2.

point something. Okay? And what that is doing -- and 

then what that is doing is giving you just the average 

annual, two years' worth of average annual. 

And, from that, we subtract a quarter of 

what they received in the initial price, which happens 

to be what the market -- if it really was 9 -- about 

was expecting it to earn during a two-year 

period. That's why I put in the last part. 

But even if I am wrong about that, I am 

right about the first half, aren't I. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well -- and I think what you 

are -- the one point of this that is missing is that, if 

you are going to multiply the other part by 2, you also 

have to multiply the tax rate by 2. And if this is --

(Laughter.) 

MS. O'CONNELL: And, Justice Breyer, I 

just -- I want to address for a minute this -- this 

issue that it wasn't confiscatory of any particular 

taxpayer's net gain. That's not the relevant question, 

and I know there's some discussion about this in the 

briefs. 

But, if all you were to do were to compare 

the final tax bill to the company's net profits over the 

year, there's a lot of things that are not income taxes 

that would then become income taxes, like an excise tax 

that is charged on the number -- or the -- the number of 

products that are manufactured or sold in a particular 

company in any given year, so long as there -- as it 

leaves the taxpayer with a nickel, then it's -- then 

that's an income tax. 

That's not what the income tax means. What 

matters is what the tax base is. That's how you 

determine if it's a tax on income. The realization test 

requires that because you can't impose a tax on income 

that the -- the taxpayer hasn't actually realized. And 

the gross receipts and the net income tax also require

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. O'Connell -- if the 

Court should go the way the Fifth Circuit went -- the 

way the Tax Court went -- could the regulation be 

changed so it wouldn't happen again? 

MS. O'CONNELL: If so, then I -- I think it 

should be changed. And I don't know exactly how that 

would look, but maybe it could make it more clear that 

you're supposed to just look at the tax base -- I think 

the regulation does say that. 

But, yes, I think there would be room for --

for the IRS to -- to make the regulation even more clear 

than it already is, if this Court were to conclude that 

the windfall tax is an income tax. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why should it be 

changed? I mean, why should companies -- American 

companies doing business abroad, in borderline cases, 

have to pay tax on the same income twice? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Breyer, 

they're -- they're not. SWEB, the subsidiary of 

Petitioner, paid the British income tax in the same 

years that it paid this windfall tax, in 1997 and 1998. 

And Petitioner got a dollar-for-dollar foreign tax 

credit for its portion of that British income tax that 

was paid in those years.

For any other tax that's imposed by a 

foreign government that's not the income tax or that's 

not an Excess Profits Tax or a war profits tax, the 

company can get a tax deduction. That's how profits --

or other taxes are normally treated. 

You deduct from the amount of income that 

you are reporting to the IRS, the dollars that you paid 

toward that foreign tax, and the -- the value of that 

deduction depends on the marginal tax rate that the 

taxpayer is paying. 

So you might get 35 cents on the dollar for 

every dollar that you can subtract from your income tax 

base. But the dollar-for-dollar credit in Section 901 

is reserved for foreign taxes that have the equivalent 

features of the U.S. income tax, and the windfall tax 

simply doesn't. 

It's written as a valuation formula, and 

it's not just written that way, but that's the substance 

of what it's trying to do. It's imputing a value on 

each company for what the U.K. government should have 

charged, and it's subtracting out the amount of money 

that it actually received. 

And I think that's an important point to 

keep in mind when determining what is the -- the 

substance of this tax, is that the U.K. government is not

just going out into the world and taxing companies that 

it thinks are particularly profitable, to try to get 

more money. 

The U.K. government used to own these 

companies, and it sold them at too low a price, and the 

windfall tax is an effort to get back some of that value 

that it should have asked for when it sold them. 

Whether that's a good idea or a bad idea, 

it's not an income tax, in the U.S. sense, and it should 

not be entitled to a credit under Section 901. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. CLEMENT: Thank you. Just a few quick 

points in rebuttal. 

First of all, just for the record, if what 

they really wanted to do in the British government was 

to tax value, as we normally understood it, there was a 

ready mechanism available, the London Stock Exchange 

price. 

Now they want to say, well, but we wanted to 

go back and value it in 1990, but, as alluded to, they 

could have done that because, on day one, there was

about a 20 percent pop -- that's -- to use the IPO 

word -- there's about a 20 percent pop in value at the 

end of the first day's trading. They could have taxed 

that. 

If they wanted to be a little less precise, 

but capture a little more value, they could have gone 

30 days out or 60 days out, on the theory that it took a 

while for the information to make it in to the market. 

That would have been a value tax. I wouldn't be up here 

arguing that it's creditable. 

But what they did was something very 

different. They used a sui generis, very unique concept 

of value, not value unmodified, but value in 

profit-making terms. And not profit-making terms in 

some abstract sense that takes into account future 

income streams, but profit-making terms, as measured by 

4 years of reported profits that satisfy every test of 

the regulation. 

They're realized profits, they're based on 

gross receipts, and they reflect exactly to the penny --

to the pence, the net income. That's what they base 

this tax on. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, what do you 

think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour 

government had come in -- not after 4 years but after 2

1 years -- that they had looked at those 2 years of profits, 

2 they said, that's enough for us, to know that these 

3 companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done 

4 this exact same formula, and the result is that they 

would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent. 

6  Would that have been creditable or not? 

7  MR. CLEMENT: I would be here with a more 

8 difficult case, Justice Kagan. I would love to argue 

9 that that is still creditable because I think you could 

live in a country that has an income tax, especially an 

11 Excess Profits Tax on a few disfavored industries, that 

12 has a rate over 100 percent. 

13  But I would run into a regulatory hurdle, 

14 and, if I had had that case, I would have had to 

challenge the regulations. I would have loved to do it. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess what the 

17 hypothetical suggests is that, in some respects, the 

18 fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of 

19 between 0 and 1 is a bit of a fluke -- you know, if they 

had come in a little bit earlier and done the exact same 

21 thing, based on their understanding of how profitable 

22 these companies were, which they would have seen after 2 

23 years, you wouldn't have been able to make the same 

24 argument. 

MR. CLEMENT: Can I just say, though, it

wouldn't have been a fluke because one of the things 

that the people that constructed this tax wanted out of 

this tax is they wanted it paid. 

So it's not a fluke that they didn't impose 

a huge tax in excess of initial period profits on any 

company because they wanted to make sure the incidents 

of this tax was on companies that could actually pay it. 

And, if you do that based on 4 years' of reported 

profits, you're pretty sure that people are going to be 

able to pay it. 

I would like to bring back to the -- the 

concession, I think, that ultimately was made by the 

government, that, if a foreign government has a tax on 

value, that the only measure of value is the past years' 

reported income, that that would be a creditable income 

tax. Well, I don't think it changes if you multiply it 

by 9. I don't think it changes if you divide it by 4. 

I don't think if there is one company, that 

you divide it by 1/4, instead of 4 -- any of that 

changes the analysis, nor does it change the analysis if 

you subtract out some figure that represents a market 

cap or initial floatation value. 

That would make it an Excess Profits Tax, 

rather than a simple income tax, and that is what the 

British government did.

I'll just close by bringing you back 

75 years to the Biddle case. In the Biddle case, there 

was an argument about a British tax and whether we 

should follow the form of the tax or the substance of 

this tax. 

This Court said that we, of course, in 

looking at a foreign tax, don't bind ourselves by 

foreign classifications or characterizations. We look 

to the substance of the tax. 

In the Biddle case, the rule that you look 

to substance, not form, benefited the Commissioner. 

There's no reason for a different rule when the shoe is 

on the other foot. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
