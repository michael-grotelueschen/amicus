 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 

in 06-413, Uttecht versus Brown.

 Mr. Samson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. SAMSON,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. SAMSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that 

Mr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be 

reversed for three reasons. First, under Section 

2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death 

Penalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from 

the jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment 

that is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear 

and convincing evidence. Mr. Brown has not presented 

such evidence because the record before the State court 

supports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially 

since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe 

Mr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his 

removal.

 Second, under 2254(d)(2) the State court 

decision was based on a reasonable determination of the 

facts. Since the finding of fact was correct it is

necessarily reasonable.

 And third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court 

decision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent. 

Since the trial court applied the correct standard under 

Witt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially 

impaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable 

from Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable 

application of clearly established Federal law.

 Mr. Deal did indicate in the voir dire that 

he could impose the death penalty and consider it, but 

his other statements created an ambiguity which the 

trial judge was in the best position to resolve.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Counsel, may I ask you one 

thing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct, 

but I'd like to be sure of it. Is it the case, is it 

correct, that prior to the voir dire questions, no one 

had given a statement to the venire people of what the 

law was with respect to the imposition of the death 

penalty; is that correct?

 MR. SAMSON: Not exactly, Your Honor. Prior 

to the individual voir dire, they were -- there was 

instructions given to the jurors. Prior to the filling 

out of the questionnaire.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Were they told what the --

I forget how many factors are enumerated under the

Washington law? Were they told what they were?

 MR. SAMSON: No, Your Honor, it was more a 

general instruction regarding how the system operates.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. SAMSON: In the individual voir dire of 

Mr. Deal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one piece of 

evidence that -- one piece of information that wasn't 

given apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about 

it, was that life meant life without parole. Because 

when he was questioned, he was surprised, he didn't know 

that that was the law.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, he learned an hour 

before his questioning that that was the law. He was 

not informed of that -- of tht law when he filled out 

his questionnaire. But approximately an hour before the 

individual questioning, he was informed of that, and he 

indicated that in his questioning that he had just 

learned an hour ago.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how did he learn 

that?

 MR. SAMSON: He learned that from the 

instructions given by the trial judge as well as through 

the statements by defense counsel and by the prosecutor.

 And the defense counsel reminded Mr. Deal of

the fact that there was life without parole. She asked 

him if he can consider both options, death and life 

without parole. He said he could. And then defense 

counsel asked why do you think the death penalty is 

appropriate? And he stated again, as he stated in his 

questionnaire, it would be a case where the person was 

incorrigible and would reviolate if rereleased.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He gave that as an 

example. He didn't say and that's the only circumstance 

in which I be willing to vote for the death penalty.

 MR. SAMSON: That is correct, Your Honor, 

but the prosecutor in viewing Mr. Deal's responses 

through the course of the voir dire, the prosecutor 

viewed Mr. Deal as saying the only time, or I would have 

great difficulty in imposing the death penalty, unless 

the person would be released and would be in a position 

to -- to reoffend or kill again.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did he say, "for example," 

with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg 

mentioned? I didn't recall that he said for example.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He was asked to give an 

example. He didn't say for example. But he didn't say 

this would be the only situation in which I would vote 

for the death penalty.

 MR. SAMSON: That is, that is correct. Both

-- both are correct, Your Honors. At Joint Appendix 62, 

he was asked for an example of why he believed the death 

penalty was appropriate, and he says, "I think if a 

person is or would be incorrigible and would reviolate 

if released, then it would be appropriate."

 And, in fact, the only two examples he ever 

gave of when he believed it would be appropriate is when 

a defendant wants to die or a defendant would be 

released on parole and could kill again. And the 

prosecutor specifically asked Mr. Deal, can you think of 

an example, or a situation of when you would be able to 

impose a death penalty now knowing there is life without 

parole, and Mr. Deal at Joint Appendix 71 to 72 said I 

would have to give that some thought. Like I said up 

until an hour ago I did not realize that life without 

parole was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that if we 

grant your position and grant you relief, that it would 

be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in 

that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that 

they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the 

penalty?

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, I would agree that 

the statements given by the jurors in Witt and Darden 

were not exactly what Mr. Deal said. But I think the

general rule that the deference given to the trial judge 

would be the same rule. And we are only asking this 

court to apply the rule.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that. But I 

do think that the views of this juror, Deal, were 

somewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've 

mentioned.

 MR. SAMSON: They were, Your Honor. There 

was not a statement as in Witt and Darden where the 

jurors said that they had an opposition to the death 

penalty and would have difficulty applying it. That is 

correct. The statements were -- were different.

 And certainly if the judge viewing a juror 

of this type determined that the juror was not impaired, 

then that decision would also be entitled to deference. 

In fact, an example occurred in this case, Juror Obeso, 

the judge -- there was a challenge by the prosecutor. 

There was actually an objection by the defense. And the 

judge said Mr. Obeso says that he can follow the law and 

impose the death penalty and I think he can.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing I couldn't 

clearly discern from your brief is the significance you 

attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object. 

How does that enter into our analysis?

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, there's two points

made from the failure to object. The first is it 

explains why there's no evidence, expressed evidence 

regarding demeanor or credibility or even an express 

statement regarding demeanor or credibility or even an 

express statement as to substantial impairment.

 The second is that as the Court stated in 

Witt, it is a significant factor the court may consider 

in its evidence that show the judge acted appropriately.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me on that 

point that the State is somewhat surprised and 

whipsawed. And I understand that the Washington court 

reached the issue. It is not independent State ground. 

I take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. The 

prosecutor had two.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How late in the process 

was -- was Deal considered? Was he one of the early 

jurors or one of the late jurors?

 MR. SAMSON: He was one of the -- the early 

jurors. He was on November 3, which was about five to 

six days into the individual voir dire on the death 

qualification.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This was about a 17 day 

voir dire?

 MR. SAMSON: That is correct, Your Honor.

And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that cuts a little 

bit against the peremptory. I mean, if it was early in 

the game the prosecutor might not have exercised the 

peremptory.

 MR. SAMSON: Well the peremptories were not 

exercised until the death qualification and the other 

for-cause checks are were done.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I see. So the whole 

jury is -- I see.

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. So they, they 

completed all the death qualification. And then those 

jurors that that remained they had further individual 

voir dire, and the defense and the prosecutor then used 

their peremptories interchangeably to remove jurors.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to the 

Chief's question about the failure to object? I think I 

got the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he 

thought that the Washington Supreme Court found that 

with respect to two out of the three jurors at issue 

that there had been a finding that they were 

substantially impaired, but with respect to this juror, 

that the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the 

failure to object as the principal explanation for their 

decision.

MR. SAMSON: I would -- I would disagree 

with that, Your Honor.

 The -- the State Supreme Court on page 171a 

of the Petitioner's appendix specifically was citing to 

Witt and the rules from Witt. And that includes the 

rule that the trial judge's exclusion of a juror 

constitutes a finding of fact.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought 

Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's 

opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in 

response cite us to page 208a where the Washington 

Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including 

Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired 

their ability to follow the court's instructions and 

abide by their oaths as jurors.

 It seems the court of appeals judge 

overlooked that.

 MR. SAMSON: They did, Your Honor. They 

did. And that is a specific finding of fact by the 

State Supreme Court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a finding? It's 

listed under "Summary and conclusions." Under 

"Findings," I thought under "Findings" the -- the 

findings were that he misunderstood the standard. He 

said beyond a shadow of a doubt, rather than beyond a

reasonable doubt. And what other finding of fact was 

there? Because this one is listed under conclusions. 

"From the facts, I conclude that he would be impaired." 

But the impairment is the conclusion from what facts?

 MR. SAMSON: It is from all the facts that 

the State Supreme Court had before it. It's 

one-paragraph analysis of Mr. Deal did not lay out all 

the facts that were before the court. And the statement 

208-A, although it's listed as a conclusion, essentially 

constitute a finding of fact. And even if this Court 

were to say that is not a finding of fact, it contains 

with it the implicit finding of fact.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, aren't we obliged 

under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable 

conclusion from the facts?

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So even if it is just a 

conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a 

totally unreasonable conclusion, right?

 MR. SAMSON: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the point stands that 

the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not 

noting what's there too late. It's just not a fair 

summary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.

MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. The Ninth 

Circuit found that the State courts made no Finding of 

fact and, as Mr. Brown has essentially admitted in his 

response brief, there are two State court findings of 

fact, one by the Washington Supreme Court and one by the 

trial judge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this something 

particular under Washington procedure, this summary and 

conclusions section at the end of the opinion?

 MR. SAMSON: No, Your Honor. I think this 

is more just the style of the justice who wrote the 

opinion and how he writes his opinions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it your position is 

that if the State courts had made or had expressed no 

conclusion other than the final conclusion that he is 

impaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled 

to AEDPA deference if the record could be read to 

support it; is that correct?

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your 

Honor. The AEDPA --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's the case, then 

AEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it? AEDPA 

deference has reached on your view the conclusion that 

if there is any factual support in a record, the

ultimate conclusion of the court will be upheld, whereas 

I thought AEDPA deference went to factfinding and to 

express conclusions that the court drew.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, we're not saying 

that there will never be a case where the deference 

given to a trial judge and the deference given to a 

State court in factual determinations can be overcome. 

Certainly, it's hard to think of one, but there can be a 

case where that deference could be overcome.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't this perhaps just 

such a case? Because this finding by the Supreme Court 

of the State is based only on the written record, so it 

does not get any benefit of observing the demeanor of 

the witness -- I mean, the demeanor of the prospective 

juror; isn't that correct.

 MR. SAMSON: It is correct the State Supreme 

Court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So if we disagreed and 

thought there was not evidence in the written record 

that would support that conclusion, we should not give 

deference to that appellate court finding.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, but the appellate 

court finding also was based on the trial court finding 

of fact, and the State Supreme Court recognized, as this 

Court did in Witt, that deference must be given to the

trial judge, who did have the opportunity to observe the 

juror.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the trial judge made no 

conclusion about demeanor. He didn't say anything about 

demeanor, did he?

 MR. SAMSON: No, Your Honor, and neither did 

the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If we're going to get --

that takes -- it seems to me it takes deference yet one 

further step. We're saying that even if there is 

nothing on the record about demeanor, we are supposed to 

assume that a trial judge drew a conclusion based on 

demeanor. I mean, that is not deference. I mean, 

that's simply imputing fiction.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, there's no evidence 

on demeanor because the defense counsel did not object.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it the defense 

counsel's obligation to object? It seems to me that if 

the State is objecting, saying I want this juror 

removed, and the trial judge is saying, okay, I will 

remove him, that there is an obligation to make a 

record.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't there be? I guess 

my point is if there isn't, then in effect you are

making the defendant responsible for creating a record 

to support what the other side asks for.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, as this Court 

explained in Witt, when there is no objection or no 

dispute as to the factual issue in the trial court, the 

judge has to reason to elaborate on his finding and 

therefore he has no obligation to do so.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that means that the, 

that the argument for sustaining the trial judge's 

action on the ground that the trial judge could observe 

demeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review 

on that subject, because we know that if the venire 

person was present in the courtroom and the judge was 

present in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at 

him, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on 

the grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no 

judicial review at all. I think that's what Judge 

Kozinski said.

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, if there is 

absolutely no evidence to support the trial judge's 

conclusion in the record --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm talking about demeanor. 

I'm talking about demeanor. And there's nothing as I 

understand it on the record about demeanor.

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. In Marshall

versus Lonberger the Court said there is no requirement 

for explicit finding as to credibility.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if there is no 

requirement that there be anything on the record about 

demeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point 

at all, is there?

 MR. SAMSON: Not on demeanor, but there can 

be judicial review on the other facts that are presented 

in the record.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there is on 

demeanor. I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not 

the case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to 

show that demeanor did not make the difference? It's 

the burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable 

determination.

 MR. SAMSON: It is the burden on him to 

present clear and convincing evidence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And secondly, he could 

present such evidence if he showed that there was 

absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements 

said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference. 

But in a case where the statements are seemingly 

contradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is 

very relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of

the Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made 

the difference.

 And besides which, wasn't there some part of 

the record that you referred to where he said "and I 

believe him"?

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor. That's as to 

a different juror when there was an objection, and 

because there was no objection there was no obligation.

 If I may --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any way that he 

can show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the 

record is absolutely silent on demeanor? Is there any 

way he can show that?

 MR. SAMSON: Your Honor, he could attempt to 

bring evidence in a State court collateral -- he 

actually filed a motion for reconsideration as to 

another juror. He did not do that in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask to be sure I 

understand the record, because I did miss something 

before. Did the trial judge say in so many words that 

Deal's views would have prevented or substantially 

impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions 

and abide by the rules of the jurors?

 MR. SAMSON: The trial judge made no such 

express finding because there was no objection raised.

JUSTICE STEVENS: So that's the point of the 

absence of objection. That's why he didn't make the 

critical finding.

 MR. SAMSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the judge didn't 

make the critical finding.

 MR. SAMSON: He would have made a finding if 

there was an objection.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Please finish up the 

thought because you're equally well prepared. How do we 

know the trial judge would have made that a finding if 

there had been an objection?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, this is a 

record in which the trial judge showed that he was

meticulously careful in applying the standard from 

Wainwright versus Witt. In the joint appendix, I 

believe at pages 7 through 9, there's an extensive 

discussion of how the judge is going to apply the Witt 

standard evenhandedly. He's going to eliminate those 

jurors who are like-biased. He's going to eliminate 

those jurors who --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that respond to the 

possible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what 

he really did was act on the basis of no objection, 

rather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to 

make?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, 

Justice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told 

the parties, if you have any question, if you have any 

problem with any of the objections that are made, speak 

up and I will intervene and question the juror myself 

and clarify it.

 And this is a judge who, against the 

background of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a 

good faith effort to apply the Witt standard. There 

were 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors 

that they should be excused for cause because of 

inability to apply the law as Washington gives it. The 

defense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the

prosecution lost on five of those occasions.

 So the judge basically went with the defense 

when the defense spoke up and objected. There were two 

jurors that were excused over the defense objection. 

The transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it 

shows that the defense objected and said these jurors 

can apply the standard under the law, and the judge 

found that they could not and excused them.

 In the case of Juror Deal there is no 

absolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't 

have done exactly the same thing if the defense had 

objected.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is -- I know, 

Justice Breyer; just on this point. The defense 

actually volunteered "no objection."

 MR. DREEBEN: Said "We have no objection." 

And I think that this is one of the three significant 

legal errors that the Ninth Circuit made in disposing of 

this challenge. This Court made clear in Wainwright 

versus Witt that the absence of a defense objection is 

very critical in assessing whether a judge's implied 

finding of bias is to be upheld on appeal. And it's for 

the reason that my colleague mentioned in part: If the 

judge is not asked to give a fuller explanation, there 

is no reason --

JUSTICE BREYER: What has this to do with 

the -- aside from the explanation, when I read through 

the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the 

transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's 

against giving the death penalty. He kept saying yeah, 

in special circumstances, not always. Then they get 

into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who 

will in fact commit a crime again. And then it's put to 

him directly: Have you thought about that he won't be 

committing a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his 

life. He says: You're right; I hadn't really thought 

it through.

 I want to know, thinking it through, could 

you consider the death penalty? Do you think under the 

conditions where the man would never get out again you 

could impose it? Yes, sir.

 So you don't think that if parole was an 

option, etcetera, repeating it. Death penalty? I could 

consider it. Then could you impose it? I could if I 

was convinced that was the appropriate measure.

 And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking 

of the repetition. It is clear he is thinking that it's 

some kind of a mean. And I compare that with Witt, 

where the person just says no, I can't, and I compared 

it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal

to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and 

finally she says: I think I could.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think your 

question goes to the heart of the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's probably 

right.

 MR. DREEBEN: But the reason it goes to the 

heart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and 

every other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked 

at this is dealing with a cold record, but the only 

person who actually saw and heard this juror give the 

responses was the trial judge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is it that he could 

have done? Was he shaking, making faces? Was he 

shaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: If something like that 

happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say, 

I want it noted for the record that the witness while he 

said these words was chortling inwardly or something 

like that?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, there 

were five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir 

dire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a 

misconception about what the death penalty should be

exposed for when measured against Washington law.

 And the overarching point that I make before 

I talk about those five instances is that this is a 

record in which there is confusion and uncertainty about 

whether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law. And in 

those circumstances, the only judge who can truly 

resolve that and determine whether he should be credited 

is the trial judge. And this Court has made that point 

over and over again in describing its voir dire.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If there is confusion, is 

that grounds for excluding him?

 MR. DREEBEN: Confusion alone is not. If 

it's confusion it must rise to a level of preventing or 

impairing the juror's ability to follow the law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But even at this point, 

this juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating 

circumstances. He doesn't know about mitigating 

circumstances. He hasn't been told what the standards 

of -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt.

 And to say that he should be criticized 

because when he was asked to give an example he said one 

thing and not another, it seems if you just read the 

transcript, that there's nothing disqualifying. So as 

you said, everything is the weight falls on the 

demeanor, which an appellate court can't review.

MR. DREEBEN: I think that that's right, 

Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't mean that there is no 

judicial review at all, in response to Justice Souter's 

question and I think the concern underlying your own. 

There has to be fair support in the record for the 

conclusion that the trial judge could have resolved the 

question of a juror's competence to sit in the way that 

he did.

 And if you had a record in which everything 

that juror said was consistent with complying with State 

law, which I don't think this record is, and the 

prosecutor objected, and the judge says granted, and 

there's no explanation, I think that would be difficult 

to uphold, even if it is possible that everyone in the 

courtroom knew that the judge was relying on demeanor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there anything in this 

record to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?

 MR. DREEBEN: What is -- no. There's 

nothing explicit. But this Court has said over and over 

again that there does not have to be because in this 

case, in particular, since there was no objection, the 

judge did not elaborate on his reasons at all. But the 

Court has gone further in Witt and in Darden and 

building on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made 

clear that it is implicit in a judge's action in

response to an objection that he has relied on the 

totality of the law and his observations.

 And here there were two instances during the 

defense colloquy in which the juror specifically said 

that his example of when the death penalty is 

appropriate is a circumstance when somebody is 

incorrigible and will reoffend if released. And then 

three times during the prosecution's voir dire, he 

volunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in 

my mind very obvious that the person would reoffend. 

And this was a particularly significant answer because 

it wasn't given in response to a death penalty question, 

it was given in response to whether he could apply the 

reasonable doubt standard to the crime.

 He again comes back to the reoffend notion 

after having State law explained to him again, and said, 

could you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I 

have to give that some thought.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But he had not been given, 

as I understand it, the explanation of what the -- I 

keep saying nine factors. Whatever the enumerated State 

factors were. He had not been told that at any point, 

had he?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, but I think the important 

point, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law

there were really two alternatives, life without parole 

or death.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but the -- the 

questioning was what grounds are you going to look to 

make that decision; and he had not been instructed on 

Washington law on that at all.

 MR. DREEBEN: The concern that I think the 

prosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this 

juror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate 

is when somebody will get out and kill again. And under 

that analysis, you would never impose capital punishment 

under Washington law, because the defendant is never 

going to get --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it follow that 

his limited cases, the views about when the death 

penalty is appropriate would translate into views of 

whether he could or could not impose the death penalty 

if instructed properly by the court?

 MR. DREEBEN: Not -- not automatically, 

Justice Stevens. I mean, this is an juror --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it have to be 

automatic in order to justify the result in this case?

 MR. DREEBEN: No. What has to be the case, 

and this Court in Witt made clear it is not going to 

apply an unmistakable certainty requirement, is that the

judge has to conclude that juror's views would prevent

the judge had to make a call based on what he saw and 

what none of us did, of whether this juror's views --

difference, at least it has been my experience in trials 

like this of what a juror will do on his own and what he 

thinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth,

proper instructions?

believe this guy wasn't?

there was no objection.

conclude, he made clear at the outset as I think I did

judge who was conscientiously applying the Witt 

standard.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. SUZANNE LEE ELLIOTT,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MS. ELLIOTT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 There were in our view two findings by the 

Washington courts here. The first by the trial court is 

objectively, an objectively unreasonable determination 

of the facts in light of the evidence presented, and 

thus the writ should be granted under 50 -- 28 --

2254(d)(2)? And the supreme court's decision -- and 

I'll get to a moment to where I think their decision is, 

in the record, which conflicts with the State's view of 

where that is -- was an unreasonable application of this 

Court's controlling precedent in Witt versus 

Witherspoon.

 And I would direct the Court to, in terms of 

the State Supreme Court's finding, to page 173a of the 

appendix of the Petition for certiorari. But I would, 

of course, first like to start with the actual record in 

this case.

 In this case, the Washington State trial 

court's decision to excuse juror Deal for cause was be

objectively unreasonable based upon the record, because 

juror Deal said many times on the record, when presented 

with the question of whether or not he could impose the 

death penalty under the sketchy view he had of 

Washington State's statutory capital punishment scheme, 

that he could do so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the 

beginning of the questioning, isn't it? It is not the 

end of it. It is surely not the law that just, whenever 

a juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that 

he's automatically -- has to be seated?

 MS. ELLIOTT: No, Your Honor. But it went 

beyond that. And at page 73 of the joint appendix, the 

very question was put to him by the prosecutor. "Now 

that you know that in Washington, if you find the 

defendant guilty, you're only going to have two choices, 

the death penalty or life in prison without the 

possibility of parole, could you still consider under 

the appropriate evidence imposing the death penalty?" 

And Mr. Deal said, "I could consider it. Yes."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: After several times 

saying the only time he would consider it is if the 

person is going to reoffend. I mean, if he just gets 

the right answer once out of six times and it's the last 

time, is the judge required to ignore the prior

colloquy?

 MS. ELLIOTT: No, Your Honor, but I don't 

think he only said it once out of those times. Judge 

Kozinski identified in his opinion six times, and those 

are found on the record of proceedings at page 62, at 

page 72, and again at page 73. And he was repeatedly 

asked, and one time he was asked first I'm going to ask 

you if you could consider it -- this is on page 72 and 

then I'm going to ask you if you could impose it? Even 

if he would never get out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But look at page --

look at page 262. He says, you know, could -- could 

you -- when do you think the death penalty is 

appropriate? If the person would reviolate if released.

 MS. ELLIOTT: But that is one of, under --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are others.

 MS. ELLIOTT: -- Washington law it's an 

appropriate consideration. And that's the -- and then 

that was the example he gave, but he didn't say but I'm 

never going to do it, if he -- if my only choice is 

death or life in prison.

 And I think that the State's reading of the 

voir dire here actually expands both the objection made 

by the prosecutor and the -- the substance of the 

colloquy with juror Deal.

JUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact 

that twice just before his final statement he's given 

exactly the question whether he could -- whether he 

impose the death penalty in any situation other than 

when the person might get out and kill again, and he --

his answers are at best equivocal. The first time he 

says I would have to give that some thought. That's on 

72. And then he says I do feel that way if parole is an 

option. Without parole as an option I believe in the 

death penalty. Which is totally ambiguous. What do you 

make of those answers?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I make of those answers as 

being entirely appropriate under the questions given and 

also demonstrating that he's clearly not a juror who is 

substantially impaired or whose views would prevent him 

from considering the instructions that would be given to 

him at the end of this case. If fact include him as a

penalty if the only choice is life without and the death 

penalty, I think that would be problematic under 

Washington law.

 But he never said that. That's the reading 

the State gives his voir dire but it's not there. 

Because that would prevent him from making the decision 

that Washington requires.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you -- you 

insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am 

going to be an unreliable juror. That's -- that's not 

the way it happens. And somebody has to evaluate 

whether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and 

whether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service. 

And some of these -- some of these answers suggest that. 

And it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you 

know, unless he comes out and admits yes, I'm going to 

be a lousy juror, nobody is going to say that.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, Your Honor, I agree that 

nobody is going to say that, although in other cases, in 

other records and other cases cited by the State here, 

in fact, trial judges have made records of those kinds 

of situations, which are not present here. And in fact, 

for example, I believe it was Gray versus Mississippi, 

the judge got the feeling that jurors were giving 

answers that would get them off the panel.

answered all the questions the way you expect a, a good 

juror to answer, why was there no objection when the 

State moved to dismiss him?

 MS. ELLIOTT: It is not required under 

Washington law. And, in fact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may well be objected, 

there were 12 instances --

MS. ELLIOTT: That is corrected.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in which the prosecutor 

wanted to excuse; in seven of those, there was an 

objection.

 MS. ELLIOTT: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So he certainly knew how 

to object. And you absolutely trap the trial judge here 

by not indicating to him that he should make some 

further finding. In fact, the -- the -- the lawyer 

doesn't just remain silent. He's standing and says I 

have no objection.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well the question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Kozinski thought 

the reason there was no objection was that this juror 

came across as being pro-death penalty. Isn't that what 

he said?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't go as far

 MS. ELLIOTT: On two points I don't go as 

far as Judge Kozinski. One, I believe that actually 

there has to be some deference to implicit findings; let 

me clarify that, and I know the State has pointed that 

out. I think Judge Kozinski's language was a little 

loose there. I think he probably agrees with me.

 As to the -- the failure to object, first of 

all, if the court says, first of all, are there any 

objections; now again we have admitted that what he said 

was I have no objection. But the -- under Washington 

law, the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense attorney 

all knew that this issue could be raised for the first 

time on appeal.

 The prosecutor -- and I'm not saying on 

habeas review, but in the trial court, a challenge for 

cause, the burden falls on the prosecutor to articulate 

a basis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. But, 

but competent counsel knows that getting something 

overturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it 

done right the first time. And he also knows that if

 I can't imagine why if he thought this 

person was not properly strikeable he would have sat --

indeed not just sat silent but said I have no objection. 

It just doesn't make any sense.

mistake, then.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he made the same 

mistake the judge did. I wonder who else was there that 

made the same mistake. I mean, you know, it makes you 

think maybe, maybe the judge was right.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, Your Honor, the only 

basis we have for the trial judge's ruling is the 

objection made by the prosecutor. And the -- assuming 

he incorporated that as the basis for his ruling. What 

prosecutor said was that -- he had two rulings. First, 

he said I think he's overcome his problem with the 

explanation about reasonable doubt. And so that's not 

an issue in this case. And he said, and I don't think 

he has said anything that overcame this idea that, of he 

must kill again before he imposed the death penalty or 

be in a position to kill again.

 That, it's our position is incorrect, 

under -- an incorrect summation of what happened in the

quoting from?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I'm quoting from page 675. 

Which is Mr. Matthews --

JUSTICE SCALIA: 75 of the --

MS. ELLIOTT: Of the joint appendix. Which 

is Mr. Matthews' objection. And the court makes 

basically an unadorned grant of objection that for 

cause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And incidentally the court 

did not say are there any objections? The court did not 

say that.

 MS. ELLIOTT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. The 

court says -- uh -- the bailiff will excuse you. 

Counsel, any challenge to this particular juror? That's 

at the bottom of page 64. And then what Mr. Mulligan 

says is we have no objection.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the court didn't 

say is there an objection? So you're incorrect.

 MS. ELLIOTT: I'm sorry. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now on the that, 

just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if 

that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the 

court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea

that he must kill again before imposing the death 

penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing 

him?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Under Washington law, I think 

there would be a sufficient basis for excusing juror 

Deal if he said I now know what the statutory scheme is, 

and only if there's some possibility for release of 

Mr. Brown and the opportunity for him to kill again, 

would I impose the death penalty.

 We know that would prevent him from imposing 

Washington's statutory scheme because once finding him 

guilty, the juror will never be released again. So the 

possibility of release would not be there. And so he 

would reject the notion that you must consider 

mitigating factors if there's no possibility of release.

 We argue in our brief that that's not what 

he said. And in fact, Juror Deal was a thinking juror, 

a juror who could, in fact, consider all of the options. 

We disagree, of course, with the prosecutor's summary 

that this concern about recidivism was somehow central 

or pivotal to Juror Deal.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think he could have 

imposed the death penalty in this case?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you don't know 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I would like to hear the 

answer.

 MS. ELLIOTT: My answer is because it's a 

constitutional issue and this juror could also have 

considered the mitigating circumstances that would have 

been proposed by the -- at that stage that were clearly 

on the table for argument in front of the jury at the 

penalty phase.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You, according to this 

structural error, so you have a death case, and so you 

have this kind of error you don't have to prove.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Under Gray versus Mississippi, 

I don't have to -- Mr. Brown does not have to prove that 

it's harmless.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then you're zeroing 

in on this particular juror and the colloquy, but 

shouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the 

jurors, including that there were -- what was it --

seven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause 

excusal?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There were actually 12, I 

think. Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution? 

I was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal 

time of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is 

a large number of challenges by the prosecutor.  Can you 

comment on that? 12? I mean, the defense objected to 

seven, and five objections were sustained.

 MS. ELLIOTT: I can't say in the vast 

universe of capital cases in Washington whether that's 

extraordinary or not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How many days did this 

take?

day. That's pretty good.

basis, Your Honor. In a quality case in Washington, 17 

days is probably pretty average, maybe a little short.

granted five of the -- rejected five of the 

prosecutor's, and how many of those had been where 

defense counsel had objected?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I think seven.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He objected in seven and 

in five of those --

MS. ELLIOTT: No. He objected to 12, and 

seven of those were granted, that's my understanding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. I think the 

prosecution challenged 12 times. There were seven 

objections. Five were sustained.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Excuse me. I'm sorry, Your 

Honor. I misunderstood your question.

 So yeah, I don't disagree that this Court 

should look at the entire record of voir dire, and I 

don't disagree that Judge Martinez is a conscientious 

trial judge. The problem in this case is that when he 

granted the challenge for cause to this juror, he did 

not and he could not find that this juror was 

substantially impaired. He could not -- he was not 

prevented from following Washington law.

were looking at this on direct review?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, yes. I mean, you have 

to view it through the lens of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that makes a 

difference in the standard of review that we apply in 

this case?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, there is -- prior to the 

enactment of AEDPA, there was -- this Court said you 

give deference to the trial court's findings. AEDPA 

has, of course, codified that deference by saying that 

the trial judge has to be objectively unreasonable based 

upon the facts developed at the trial court level.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, does that mean 

we give a greater degree of deference?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I don't think this Court has 

said what, on balance, what the difference between the 

kind of deference that was required under Witherspoon 

is, as laid against the kind of deference now. It's 

clear Congress wanted to provide a substantial amount of 

deference to the trial court and limited habeas review 

of State court decisions. But as Judge Kozinski pointed 

out in his opinion in this case, that didn't mean that 

they were going to completely eliminate Federal habeas 

review.

get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of 

review with respect to deference to the State court is 

different in this respect than it would be on direct 

review?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Yes. I think under habeas 

review, it's a more substantial review, because we have 

to show not only that the findings were unreasonable but 

they were objectively unreasonable, which I think is a 

different standard than saying you give deference to the 

trial court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, one of the most 

troubling parts about this case is the failure to 

object. As I understand, under Washington law, that 

doesn't making any difference, the review is exactly the 

same as it would have been if there had been an 

objection. But under our review as a matter of 

constitutional law, should it make a difference?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I don't think so. I think 

it's one of those peculiarities of Washington law that 

you should give respect to, but it is essentially 

meaningless in the context of this case, because all the 

parties knew this case was going to be reviewed and 

reviewed. I mean, there's automatic appellate review.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you have any response 

to Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for

a mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely 

would have paid less attention to the issue as long as 

any counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that 

this kind of thing is handled?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, I respect his concerns 

about bushwhacking or mouse trapping, but the fact of 

the matter is that that's Washington law and the judge 

was well aware of it, as were the parties.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it to you 

this way: There's no demeanor finding here. Suppose 

the judge had made a demeanor finding. That would be 

different, the case would be a different case, wouldn't 

it?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if the objection is 

what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should 

be able to consider the fact there was no objection, 

even though Washington law doesn't require it before we 

consider the issue.

 MS. ELLIOTT: But there's nothing in the 

record that says that the reason that the judge didn't 

mention the demeanor, or the prosecutor who made the 

objection didn't mention demeanor. Certainly, it seems 

to me that if demeanor had been a concern based upon the 

answers given by the juror here, and because the

prosecutor had the laboring oar at the trial court to 

provide a basis for the challenge for cause, he would 

mention it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

brother made the point that there was a more elaborate 

explanation of the trial judge's determinations when 

there had been an objection.

 MS. ELLIOTT: I do believe that he had a 

more lengthy explanation where there were objections. 

But whether or not that would have -- there was 

something in the demeanor of this particular judge here 

that he simply didn't mention, it can't be found here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but he said for one 

of the other witnesses, I just don't -- I don't believe 

him. And if that had been his problem here, he 

presumably would have said the same thing.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, presumably then, he 

would have said that in response to the prosecutor's 

objections, which was not that we don't believe that 

Juror Deal could be credible.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if there's no opposing 

objection by defense counsel. When there was, and when 

part of his reason for granting the motion to strike the 

juror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.

 MS. ELLIOTT: That's correct, and here he

didn't. So I think the assumption was, he was granting 

the objection on the basis provided by Mr. Matthews, 

which was incorrect both under Washington law and under 

the facts developed in the voir dire.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The law on this, and you've 

read the cases more recent probably -- I've skimmed 

through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you 

have. And the statement of the law that I want to know, 

is it still valid law, is in Witherspoon on 522, Justice 

Stewart in the footnote. And what he says in that 

footnote is, "the most that can be demanded of a venire 

man in this regard is that he be willing to consider," 

and those are his italics, "to consider all of the 

penalties provided by State law, and that he not be 

irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote 

against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts 

and circumstances that might emerge. If the voir dire 

testimony in a given case indicates that venire men were 

excluded on any broader basis than this, the defendant's 

sentence cannot be carried out." Is that still a valid 

statement of the law or has it changed?

 MS. ELLIOTT: That is still a valid 

statement of the law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of what law?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Of Washington law. No,

this is Justice Stewart of the Supreme Court.

 MS. ELLIOTT: This Court, which has been 

shortened into a --

test.

different than irrevocably committed.

impaired to prevent or substantially impaired, the 

ability. And this juror never --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would agree that 

substantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably 

committed?

you could say I favor the death penalty, as this juror 

did, and still sit on the jury.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This doesn't say -- that's 

one of the things it says. But the other is, "the most 

that can be demanded of a venire man is that he be 

willing to consider" -- that's the word that's

him on a broader ground than that, the death sentence

later case that suggests a change in that respect?

 MS. ELLIOTT: No, Your Honor. In fact, the 

cases affirm that. And in fact, this juror was 

precisely the kind of juror that I think was appropriate 

to sit. What he said was, I can consider.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he said that, but 

elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider 

it unless it were a situation in which this person would 

be able to commit the crime again.

 MS. ELLIOTT: But none of those statements 

indicated he would be prevented from voting for the 

death penalty, or that he was substantially impaired 

from doing that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They did indicate that 

unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider 

imposing the death penalty. I think that's precisely 

what they indicated.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, if it means only that he 

would consider the issue of future dangerousness, it 

wouldn't prevent him under Washington law. Because 

under Washington law, first of all, the presumption is 

for life. And second of all, the consideration of 

whether or not a person would recidivate is both an 

aggravating and a mitigating factor. So the fact that 

he's concerned about reoffense is perfectly appropriate.

Where I think he could be prevented is if he 

said, if this -- unless this guy is going to be released 

in the future, and I don't think that's what he said 

here, Your Honor. What he said was, recidivism is 

important.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I like recidivate by the 

way. I'm going to use it in the opinion. It's a very 

useful verb.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If I can get back to my 

concern about the failure to object again. Supposing 

this defense counsel instead of just saying no 

objection, said no objection, I think he's a hanging 

juror?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I think he's a hanging juror?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, he thought 

contrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man 

was that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let 

that be known. Would that make a difference?

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, I think that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it would 

under Washington law. I don't suppose it would.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, if the juror said -- it 

would make a difference under Morgan if the juror said 

I'm not going to consider any mitigating factor.

did what he did, but everybody was evaluating his 

demeanor in the courtroom, and defense counsel's 

evaluation was to mean I don't want that juror, he's 

going to hang my client, and that's what he thought and 

he let it come out when he told the judge no objection.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Oh.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that make a 

difference?

 MS. ELLIOTT: It wouldn't make a difference 

under Washington law because it could be raised for the 

first time on appeal, yes, if that wasn't what the 

record demonstrated.

 Did I understand your question?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You did. Do you think it 

should make a difference to us if we think that he 

didn't really want this guy on the jury?

 MS. ELLIOTT: I don't think there's anything 

in the record to suggest that, but for lack of his 

objection. Because there's no harmless error analysis, 

I don't think it can make a difference to this Court, 

and because in Washington we have this peculiar rule 

which says you don't have to object.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the fact that this is 

structural error, that there's no harmless error 

analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give

substance to the rule that there's deference to the 

trial judge? And in fact, in the Witt case, we said 

that the determination to excuse a juror is based on 

determinations of demeanor and credibility that are 

within the trial judge's province. We said that.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Absolutely. And if there had 

been a mention of demeanor on this record, I think this 

Court's decision would be easy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What presumes that there 

is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or 

not it's mentioned? It was not mentioned in Witt.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, what Judge Kozinski says 

about that is if on the record -- you have a cold record 

here which demonstrates in our view that the juror is 

completely qualified to serve, and nothing about him 

would prevent him from serving. And you have no mention 

of demeanor by the trial judge, but speculation on the 

part of the prosecution, then all substantive evidence 

review of juror challenges in capital cases is dead and 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Should defer to Judge 

Kozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?

demeanor. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's a 

third choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State 

court decision to which we should defer.

 MS. ELLIOTT: The Washington State Supreme 

Court decision?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MS. ELLIOTT: The Washington State Supreme 

Court decision suffers a different problem, I think, 

Your Honor, which is that what the Washington State 

Supreme Court said on page 173 was that on voir dire he 

indicated he would impose the death penalty where the 

defendant, quote, "would reviolate if released," which 

is not a correct statement of the law. And in fact, 

that is -- the considerations about whether or not 

Mr. Brown would reviolate whether in prison or not are 

considerations under Washington law in a death penalty 

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On page 208, though, 

the Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard, 

as I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views 

would have prevented or substantially impaired his 

ability to follow the court's instructions.

 MS. ELLIOTT: But -- I agree that there is a 

summary that says that. But the substantive basis for

the trial court' decision I think is back at page, as I 

said, 173a, where he --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the number of the 

page that you gave telling this is an appeal from a 

capital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made. 

So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one 

paragraph. The defendant raised a host of challenges, 

and so there's not perfect consistency with what these 

two passages in the opinion. But mustn't we take into 

account what this was? It was the defense brought out 

every objection they probably could conceive of and they 

didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out 

this way.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Well, if you're -- you mean in 

terms of the -- in the trial court? Or in the State 

Supreme Court decision?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Supreme Court. 

Now we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court. 

You said they got it wrong because they said in this 

paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an 

incorrect statement of the law because he said he would 

impose the death penalty where the defendant would 

reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement 

of the law.

objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a 

great many.

 MS. ELLIOTT: Yes, and so if you then turn 

to the end of the opinion, if that's what you're asking, 

at 208, there's kind of a summary of their basis for all 

of the challenges made by Mr. Brown to all sorts of 

things in the case.

 There were also challenges to other jurors 

as well. And there are separate paragraphs where the 

court -- those jurors that are mentioned in the summary 

paragraph, where the court then explains the various 

reasons why it's upholding the trial judge as to those 

jurors as well.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my point is simply 

that where the court is faced with so many challenges, 

this particular one, there had been no objection at the 

trial. So an appellate court might think we don't want 

to spend too much time on that one.

 MS. ELLIOTT: That is true. It appears as 

though what they did was to, because this is not what 

the trial judge said, this is the basis for the 

objection by the prosecutor, that they assumed the trial 

judge adopted the prosecutor's objection.

Official - Subject to Final Review 

In sum, there's nothing in the record that 

supports a conclusion here that Juror Deal could not 

subordinate his personal views about the death penalty 

or that he would frustrate the State's legitimate 

purpose in carrying out the State's legitimate interest 

in a constitutional capital death penalty scheme. So we 

would ask this Court to affirm the opinion of Judge 

Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit and grant the writ of 

habeas corpus in this case. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Ms. Elliott.

 Mr. Samson, you have one minute remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. SAMSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SAMSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 In response to the questions regarding the 

Witherspoon language and whether it's still good law, 

the Court in Witt essentially said that is no longer the 

standard. The standard instead is the substantial 

impairment standard, and it is not required to show that 

the juror would never impose the death penalty or 

automatically vote against it by unmistakable clarity.

 And the fact that there were -- in response 

to Justice Ginsburg's question, the fact that there were 

so many claims presented to the State Supreme Court may

explain in part the summary opinion regarding this 

particular issue. AEDPA does not require a perfect 

opinion by the State court to survive review. It only 

requires reasonableness and an objective standard.

 In addition, the arguments presented by 

Mr. Brown are essentially: We disagree and the Federal 

courts should disagree with the factfinding process done 

by the State courts. But the fact that a reviewing 

court reviewing the same transcript may reach a 

different factual determination is not sufficient. If 

the view reached by the State court is supported by 

evidence and is -- thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 2:00 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
