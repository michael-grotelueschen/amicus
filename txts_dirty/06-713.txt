 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Party et al.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. McKENNA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In adopting Initiative 872, Washington's 

voters followed this Court's guidance in California 

Democratic Party v. Jones. They adopted a top-two 

election system. By so doing the voters eliminated the 

crucial constitutional defect of a partisan blanket 

primary because in the top-two system the voters are no 

longer selecting the party's nominees for the November 

election. The Ninth Circuit nonetheless ruled that 

Initiative 872 is unconstitutional, holding that 

allowing each candidate to state his or her personal 

party preference on the ballot would create the 

appearance of association between a political party and 

candidate.

The Ninth Circuit is wrong for at least two 

reasons. First, the Ninth Circuit's appearance-

of-association conclusion assumes that top-two ballots 

will look the same as ballots under a party nominating 

election system. They will not. The top-two ballot --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you give us 

assurance that they will not? I take it we don't -- we 

haven't had an election under this system, so we don't 

know what the ballots are going to look like.

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. That's 

correct. We have not had an election, and the secretary 

of state was enjoined by the district court before 

having the opportunity to promulgate the regulations 

governing the ballot after 872's adoption.

 However, Your Honor, we may look to the 

declaration of candidacy form, which the secretary of 

state did have the opportunity to promulgate, which 

appears in the corrected joint appendix at pages 

592-593. And what we see there, Your Honor, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is that, unlike the old declaration of 

candidacy form, we have the candidates declaring 

themselves as a candidate for the office of blank, and 

instead of saying that they're a candidate of a party, 

they say -- that you have an opportunity to check off 

the box that my party preference is blank or I'm -- I am

an independent candidate; or, under Initiative 872, if 

they check neither box, that will be left blank on the 

ballot.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But you say that the purpose 

of allowing a candidate to declare a preference is 

simply to convey useful information to voters, but once 

you decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was 

not going to indicate party affiliation, why do you 

limit candidates to the names of parties? Why don't you 

allow them to pick some other phrase that better 

expresses their point of view? Somebody may want to 

say, I'm the pro-environment candidate, or I'm the 

no-new-taxes candidate. Why do you limit them to saying 

Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, et cetera?

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, the voters could 

have chosen to allow candidates to include other 

information. In fact, in the State's earliest days 

candidates were given five words they could use for 

whatever expression they wished. But the voters chose 

to allow an expression of party preference, which the 

State is allowed to do. The State is not required to 

allow the ballot to be a form -- forum for political 

expression, but the State is allowed to do so and has 

chosen to do in this way.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is that and wasn't the

purpose that was offered by the proponent of the 

initiative to try to get around the decision in Jones, 

to change the system as little as possible?

 MR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor, because there 

is an immense difference between the top-two system and 

the system that replaces the old blanket nominating 

primary. The immense difference is of course that the 

first stage of this two-stage general election process 

is no longer being used to select the nominees of the 

parties, which was identified as the one characteristic 

in Jones --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Justice Alito can defend 

his own question, but he asked whether or not the Grange 

stated that this was the purpose.

 MR. McKENNA: Well, the Grange was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And then you -- you didn't 

quite answer that question. You said, oh no, and you 

gave an explanation. But just as a matter of the 

historical record --

MR. McKENNA: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Justice Alito's 

question was accurate with respect to the proponent's 

position, was it not?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, but the 

Grange also said in the voters' pamphlet statement,

quote, "This system has all the characteristics of a 

partisan blanket primary save the constitutionally 

crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a 

primary's nominee." That's Joint Appendix 79.

 So, yes, they were campaigning for it, but I 

believe that the relevant State purpose or regulatory 

interest in allowing an expression of party preference 

is the same as we see referenced in Tashjian and in 

Anderson v. Celebrezze.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's your 

position that the parties are not really injured or 

affected by this, and the parties' position is that they 

are, who should we believe? I mean, it's hard for you 

to tell the parties that they don't know what's in their 

best interest.

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, this is a facial 

challenge. All the major cases underlying this one were 

as-applied challenges. The parties were able to bring 

in, in all those cases, evidence. There is no evidence 

in the record that the parties will be harmed by the 

expression of party preference.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We know what -- what it's 

going to be like. We don't know the exact phrasing on 

the ballot, but we do know that a candidate is allowed 

to associate himself with a party, but a party is not

allowed to disociate itself from the candidate.

 I am less concerned about the fact that the 

candidate can't say I'm the -- I'm the no-taxes 

candidate, than I am about the fact that he can 

associate himself with the Republican Party or the 

Democratic Party on the ballot and that party has no 

opportunity on the ballot to say, we have nothing to do 

with this person. That it seems to me is a great 

disadvantage to the parties.

 MR. McKENNA: Justice Scalia, there may be 

an association in the dictionary sense, in the same way 

that a candidate who expressed a preference for one 

public policy versus another may be associated. But in 

the constitutional sense, this Court has found that 

there is a forced association only when the objecting 

party is compelled to speak it or when the objecting 

party is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about a 

First Amendment forced association. I'm talking about 

an association for purposes of making this a fair 

election at which the parties have an opportunity to 

nominate and support their own candidates. And what 

this system creates is a ballot in which an individual 

can associate himself with the Republican Party, but on 

the ballot the Republican Party is unable to dissociate

itself from that candidate.

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, I would refer the 

Justices to pages 2 and 3 of the Grange yellow brief 

where two sample ballots are laid out that incorporate 

the language from the declaration of candidacy 

regulations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you telling us 

that that's what the ballots are going to look like?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 

this is what the ballots will look like. And -- and 

until the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have two choices and 

I think there's another one on page 12, is there not? 

So are you representing, General McKenna, that one of 

these will be what the State of Washington ballot will 

look like?

 MR. McKENNA: Justice Ginsburg, these are 

two examples of what the ballot is likely to look like, 

although it's frankly also likely to have even more 

information stating the difference between expressing a 

preference and expressing a formal association.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Will, will it say whether 

the party that is preferred likes this candidate?

 MR. McKENNA: It will say, Your Honor, if 

you would look to the sample --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you can say yes or 

no to that. Will it say whether the party for which he 

expresses a preference claims or disclaims him?

 MR. McKENNA: It will stay that it is not a 

statement by the political party identifying that 

candidate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Please answer yes or no. 

Will it say whether the party for which he has expressed 

a preference claims or disavows him?

 MR. McKENNA: It will not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: General, as I understand it 

the parties are now free to come up with any scheme they 

want to for selecting an official candidate.

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume the Democratic 

Party decides to have a State convention. If the law in 

Washington provided that the nominee selected by that 

convention could state on the ballot not merely a 

preference for Democrats, but a statement that, I am the 

nominee of the Democratic Party, your position in this 

case I take it would be exactly the same.

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, it would.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

Is there anything in the State law that would prevent 

you from requiring a candidate to be a member of the 

party whose preference he states?

 MR. McKENNA: There would not be, Justice 

Stevens, no.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And under the -- under the 

court's, holding it would be equally unconstitutional if 

he did that, I suppose.

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, it would be 

equally constitutional if we prevented someone, yes, 

sir, from expressing a party preference or affiliation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Indeed, there's -- I'm 

sorry. Go ahead.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Will the ballots necessarily 

be the same in every county?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, because they 

will be promulgated under regulations established by the 

State secretary of state.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Some of the counties have 

paper ballots, some of the counties have -- is that 

correct?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. But in 

Washington State nearly all voters vote by mail now. So 

they -- over 90 percent of voters and eventually nearly 

100 percent of voters will be voting by mail and will

receive the same ballot form, with the same ballot 

instructions and explanations as in the samples that 

I've showed you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- Iis there any, what 

should I say, truth investigation by the State of 

Washington? Suppose a candidate who has been a Democrat 

all his life, has run for office as a Democrat, agrees 

with all the positions of the Democratic Party, chooses 

to state on the ballot: I prefer the Republican Party. 

That's okay?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. I would 

refer you, Justice Scalia to JA-415. Section 9.5(5) of 

Initiative 872 requires the candidate to sign a 

notarized declaration, quote, "stating that the 

information provided on the form is true." So they are 

signing declarations -- a declaration which is notarized 

saying that everything that they have put on the form is 

true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess -- how can you say 

it's false?

 MR. McKENNA: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If he thinks he prefers it, 

I guess he prefers it, even though it's contrary to his 

entire life.

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Justice Scalia, it is

expression of preference. It is a subjective 

expression. It would be difficult to disprove. 

However, if a candidate were to -- let's say the 

chairman of the State Republican Party filed a 

declaration of candidacy and said, I prefer the 

Democratic Party. The Democratic Party would have many 

opportunities to object. And you know, the ballot is 

not even the most important source of information that 

voters have, as this Court has recognized in Tashjian 

and Celebrezze. So there would be many opportunities.

 If there is a concern about false 

statements, Your Honor, it seems to me the correct 

approach is to provide for more speech, not to limit the 

speech of all the candidates by refusing to permit them 

to express their preferences.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence, any 

historical evidence, that any candidate has ever done 

what Justice Scalia suggests?

 MR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor. I'm not 

aware of any specific instance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There just hasn't 

been an election under this, under this law, right?

 MR. McKENNA: Correct Mr. Chief Justice. We 

have not had a chance to even hold an election.

that, in other States, those who preached racial hatred 

have tried to associate themselves with a particular 

party, much to the concern of that party, and I see 

nothing in your position that would prevent that.

 MR. McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, the 

candidates will be expressing a preference, this is true 

if they wish to. But there will be many -- first of 

all, that is not compelled speech by the party; and 

secondly, it is not compelling the party to accept that 

person as a member, as a member. As the emergency rules 

for the declaration and as a sample ballot show, we'll 

be very explicit in explaining to the voters that 

someone claiming a preference, it's not a statement by 

the party that they're claiming the person as a member 

or a formal association.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is the remedy for the 

party, you said, to have more speech for the party, to 

say that this is not their candidate, etcetera?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, that is 

exactly what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this Court has said 

that parties could be strictly limited in the amount of 

moneys they spend to endorse a particular candidate.

 MR. McKENNA: But there will be many

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think the law can 

have it both ways.

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, if I can use an 

example that might help illustrate our point. Imagine 

that Mr. Dale from the Boy Scouts v. Dale case moved to 

Washington State and wanted to run for office, and 

imagine that, instead of saying party preference, the 

voters had said, well, you can choose to list any 

organization for which you have a preference, a 

political organization or another; and that Mr. Dale 

decided to express a preference for the Boy Scouts. 

Mr. Dale would be exercising his own speech, but that 

would not be the same thing as compelling speech by the 

Boy Scouts. Nor would he be compelling --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nobody is voting for 

Mr. Dale perhaps on the misimpression that he is 

affiliated with the Boy Scouts, and that's what 

undermines the Boy Scouts' associational rights. People 

are going to think he's associated with the Boy Scouts 

even though they may want to disassociate themselves 

with him.

 MR. McKENNA: Allowing -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

allowing Mr. Dale to say he has a preference for the Boy 

Scouts I don't think can reasonably be confused with him 

claiming that he is a member, particularly when as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that if 

it were that way, in other words if the ballot looked 

like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange reply brief, 

that that would be unconstitutional?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, it would be 

harder to argue from our side. But Your Honor, the 

Ninth Circuit only assumed that the ballot would look 

like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange yellow brief. 

They assumed that the ballot would look exactly like the 

ballot in a nominating primary, and our point here is 

that it will not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do these preference 

statements continue under the general election?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, they do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you change 

between the primary and the general election? Can you 

say my preferred party is the Republican Party, so you 

get more Republican votes to get you over the hump so 

you are one of the two, and then in the general election 

say, my preference is the Democratic Party, because 

there are more Democratic voters?

 MR. McKENNA: No, Mr. Chief Justice. State 

law would not permit that.

if the purpose is to provide accurate information about 

a candidate's position.  Suppose the candidate prefers 

one party at the time of the primary and then something 

happens. The issues change. The person -- the 

candidate says: Well, now my preference is really for 

the other party. I was close before and I've swung over 

to the other side. If that's accurate information about 

where the candidate stands at the time of the general 

election, why can't that be put on the ballot, unless 

you're trying to indicate affiliation rather than really 

preference?

 MR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, the State could 

have chosen to allow people to change their preference 

expression. But the State did not and the State is not 

required to do so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying --

your argument is that they have a First Amendment right 

to put their preference on the ballot, but somehow when 

the general election comes along that First Amendment 

right evaporates.

 MR. McKENNA: There is also -- Mr. Chief 

Justice, there is also an important practical 

consideration here. And the Court has recognized the 

State has regulatory practical interests --

ask you at that point --

MR. McKENNA: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if that's a correct 

statement of your position.

 I didn't understand you to take the position 

that a candidate has a constitutional right to state on 

the ballot. The State of Washington has chosen to give 

the candidate that option, but is -- I have not read 

anything in your brief that suggests that a candidate 

has a right to do so.

 MR. McKENNA: You're correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. I did not mean to suggest that candidates 

have a constitutional right to have any information on 

the ballot like an expression of party preference. And 

I was about to say, there is a very important practical 

reason to require candidates to decide what their 

preference will be listed as and to keep it the same. 

The reason is that we have to have time to print the 

ballots and produce the ballots in time to send out 3 

weeks before the election, when over 90 percent of 

voters begin voting by mail.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did say that it 

is unlikely voters will be mistaken, that they will 

mistakenly consider a statement of party preference to 

be the equivalent of a party endorsement. You did say

that, and on what basis are you predicting that the 

statement of preference will not be confused with a 

statement of endorsement?

 MR. McKENNA: On two bases, Justice 

Ginsburg. The first basis is that, as we've shown with 

the sample ballots from the Grange brief, the State will 

be extremely explicit in stating that the candidate's 

claim of preference or statement of preference is not 

the party's statement that the candidate is a member, 

endorsee, nominee, or what have you.

 The second basis is I think just the general 

basis this Court has recognized in Tasjian and in 

Anderson v. Cellebreze, where the Court expressed a 

greater faith in the ability of individual voters to 

inform themselves beyond just the balance. There are so 

many other sources of information.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's enough 

that -- that there's no claim of party endorsement. 

There is a claim of associating himself with the party, 

and if he associates himself with the party it seems to 

me the party should be able to disassociate itself from 

him. And I think it harms the party not to permit that.

 MR. McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia, I 

respectfully disagree. This is not an association in 

the constitutional sense. It is merely an expression of

preference, which we -- which Initiative 872 in its open 

language and which the ballot will carefully distinguish 

from claiming a formal association.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know any Democrats 

who go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who 

do not regard themselves and register themselves as 

Democrats? I mean, in the real world I don't know 

that -- I don't know whether this is fatal to your case, 

but in the real world, it seems to me the distinction 

you're drawing is simply not drawn.

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, I think it's 

helpful to think of the expression of party preference 

as a subset of party affiliation. In other words, 

someone might be a party affiliate --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's helpful to your case, 

but, going back to my question, do you know any people 

who go around saying, well, you know, I really prefer 

the Democrats; I'm a Republican myself? I mean that, 

that doesn't happen.

 MR. McKENNA: Well, the example of Senator 

Lieberman comes to mind, where he said I really prefer 

the Democrats and I'm running as an independent.

 (Laughter.)

really think that's -- that's a distinction that anyone 

would recognize?

 MR. McKENNA: I think that we are permitted 

to allow people to express their preference. Many of 

these people who do so would be independents, I think.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that isn't 

responsive to my question. Do you really think that 

that distinction is a distinction which is accepted as a 

working way of thinking in this world?

 MR. McKENNA: Yes. Yes, I do, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You really do?

 MR. McKENNA: In Washington State over 40 

percent of the voters, for example, identify themselves 

by -- as independents. Keeping in mind we have no party 

registration in Washington State, over 40 percent of 

voters when asked say I'm an independent; I may -- and 

that does not mean they may not prefer one party over 

the other, they may not generally vote for one party or 

the other, but they think of themselves as independent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it means that they --

they will prefer the candidate of one party or another, 

assuming they vote and there's no independent candidate 

running. But it seems to me that the very declaration, 

the very assumption of status as an independent says, I

don't as a systemic matter prefer one party to the 

other; a pox on both their houses.

 MR. McKENNA: Justice Souter, it may also 

mean that I choose not to formally affiliate with the 

party, even though I prefer that party's policies, 

goals. You look at the independent --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It could. But do you 

really think, again, in the real world, that that's why 

people register themselves as independents?

 MR. McKENNA: We have no registration in 

Washington State, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, however the statement 

is made.

 MR. McKENNA: There have been a number of 

cases where individuals have run -- have run for office 

as independents and then have chosen to, you know, 

attend the caucus meetings of the Democratic Party, for 

example. So, yes, it does happen. And the point is 

that people are allowed to do this, but they're not 

required to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: General McKenna, I'm 

interested in how this new system meshes with the 

otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election 

laws. For example, the major political parties have a

parties, and the major parties are determined on the 

basis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I 

think it's 5 percent, in a statewide election. How are 

you going to figure out whether the Republican Party 

has, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is 

somebody who expresses a preference for the Republican 

Party, although he's not really a Republican?

 MR. McKENNA: Your Honor, as legal counsel 

for the State we've analyzed that question, and have 

concluded that unless and until the legislature chooses 

to alter the statute to harmonize at a practical level, 

the way that we will apply that statute is to count the 

votes of the party cast for the party's official 

nominee. The person who has been identified the party 

through their separate nominating process, for example, 

through a convention, that person will be identified. 

And they will campaign as "the nominee." They will 

explain that to the voters in every way possible, and we 

will count the votes cast for that person in calculating 

whether the 5 percent threshold has been met.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask the 

counsel for the Respondents, and you can answer as well, 

can you explain to me briefly the existing structure for 

the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, to say 

Mr. Smith is our nominee?

MR. McKENNA: Well, the Initiative 872, 

Justice Kennedy, repealed the old State law which 

required the parties to use the State primary to select 

their nominees. And Initiative 872, in fact, is silent 

on the procedures the parties will follow. So they are 

left as they were back in the early days of statehood to 

decide for themselves how to designate their nominees.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they have not devised a 

structure that we know of?

 MR. McKENNA: No. Actually, Your Honor, 

they have. In fact, the Republican Party after 

Initiative 872 was adopted and before it was enjoined 

adopted rules and procedures for holding nominating 

conventions.

 And they also, for example, adopted a rule, 

which is Rule 5, that they said that if an incumbent 

runs and receives 66 percent of the support at the 

nominating convention, no other Republican can go onto 

the ballot. This is their claim. No other Republican 

can go onto the first stage ballot and claim to be a 

Republican. That is their assertion. Only that one 

person can go on with the "R" after his name -- an idea 

that we basically reject if it means that no one else 

can even express a preference for the Republican Party.

 But we agree that only one candidate will be

allowed to truthfully claim that he or she is the 

nominee of the party if the party has gone through a 

nominating process of its own.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But may not claim that on 

the ballot itself?

 MR. McKENNA: Correct, Justice Souter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not allowed 

to split the ballot in their preference, are they, say I 

prefer one party on domestic issues, I prefer the other 

party's position on foreign affairs?

 MR. McKENNA: No, Mr. Chief Justice, they 

are not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: One of the briefs says that 

the Republicans -- I think the Republicans or the 

Democrats checked with the, with the State election 

officials who said that there's no provision for 

convention, for nomination by convention.

 MR. McKENNA: Justice Scalia, they did not 

check with the State officials. They cite in the record 

letters from a couple of county auditors. But the 

county auditors have no independent authority. They 

operate under the secretary of state's rules.

conduct conventions if they wish?

may.

 I would just like to close this part of my 

argument, if I may, by pointing out that in our view the 

voters have adopted a top-two election system which 

vindicates both the rights of the parties and the 

people. The parties can select their standardbearers 

without any State interference, adopting their own 

nomination process.

 And the people are not limited to candidates 

selected by the parties. They have more choice, which 

is a value that was validated in the Jones decision, 

albeit holding that you can't do that with nonmembers 

selecting the party's nominees.

 The parties, though, argue that no candidate 

can even state an expression of party preference, cannot 

make an expression of party preference on the ballot 

without the party's consent. Taken to its logical 

conclusion, the parties are really claiming they have a 

First Amendment right to require the State to place a 

single candidate of their choosing on the ballot.

 If you look at the joint appendix, page

to think this person is affiliated with the Democratic 

or Republican Party when they may, in fact, not be at 

all.

 MR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, they make 

that claim without the benefit of any evidence. The 

Ninth Circuit and the district court and the parties 

simply assume this will happen, and they assume, for 

example, that ballot looks just like the old nominating 

primary ballot, when, in fact, as we've shown, it 

clearly will not. And, of course, we don't believe 

trademark law applies here in this case, although I can 

address that if you wish.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't suggest it 

would be a trademark violation. I think I said it was 

just like the same analysis. And I don't know why you 

would give greater protection to the makers of products 

than you give to people in the political process.

 MR. McKENNA: They deserve protection, of 

course, Mr. Chief Justice. The question is whether or 

not merely allowing someone to express their party 

preference somehow will mislead the voters. This Court 

has shown more faith in the voters than that.

 I'll reserve the balance of my time. Thank 

you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. WHITE, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. WHITE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Candidates are the party's messengers to win 

over the public on the important issues of the day. 

Initiative 872 converts the established right of 

political parties to select their messengers into a mere 

right to endorse.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you 

say about the fact that you have a right to select and 

designate an official candidate and it's independent of 

this ballot procedures?

 MR. WHITE: As the secretary of state 

pointed out -- and this is at JA-363 -- the secretary of 

state indicated the State would pay no attention to the 

party's nominating conventions and instead would 

continue to allow candidates to use party labels just as 

they had in the primary before.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. If the rationale in 

Jones was that the defect was that the association, 

political association, was being adulterated by the 

method of, of the use of ballots, to select what was an 

official nominee, that problem does not exist here.

MR. WHITE: It does, it does, Your Honor. 

And it does in the manner that this -- the candidates 

who were selected at the Initiative 872, the modified 

blanket primary, are going to be carrying the party's 

standard in the general election.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying in practical 

terms, this is a nomination, even though there may be a 

separate official nomination that nobody pays attention 

to?

 MR. WHITE: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why is one party going 

to the trouble of establishing a convention system to 

make nominations?

 MR. WHITE: We adopted -- the Republican 

Party, the Democratic Party and the Libertarian Party 

all adopted rules governing nomination of our candidates 

by convention. We corresponded with all of the county 

auditors who would be conducting partisan elections in 

2005, and we received identical letters from all four of 

them indicating that they had consulted with the 

Secretary of State and that the initiative contemplated 

no partisan nomination process separate and apart from 

the primary. The Secretary of State received copies of 

those letters; the Secretary of State's public 

statements with respect to those letters was that they

would pay no attention to the nominating process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they will pay no 

attention, I take it, in the sense that there will be 

nothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot 

itself. But as I -- I am also assuming that the parties 

through a convention, or whatever other scheme they can 

come up with, can -- can designate an official nominee 

quite independently of this ballot. And if they do so 

designate, they can campaign on that person's behalf. 

The person in campaigning can say, I am the official 

nominee of the X party. And those facts are true, 

aren't they?

 MR. WHITE: They are, Your Honor, but that 

converts the right to nominate to a mere right to 

endorse, and this Court has recognized that the ability 

to endorse a candidate is no substitute --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying that a right 

to nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from 

the ballot except the nominee -- everyone from the 

ballot under that banner, from the nominee.

 MR. WHITE: To be -- to be a meaningful 

right to nominate, yes, Your Honor. It --

come from? I thought in Jones, the Court had said if 

you had just a blanket primary, with no indication of

party affiliation, that that would be constitutional. 

And if that's so, then parties don't have any right to 

have a candidate.

 MR. WHITE: I'm not suggesting that the 

parties have a constitutional right to place their party 

name on a truly nonpartisan ballot, and I think what the 

Jones Court was hypothesizing was the true nonpartisan 

primary where there are no party identifications. Our 

objection is not to a -- necessarily to a nonpartisan 

ballot. It's to a partisan ballot where the State is 

going to put someone else on that ballot using our 

party's name and competing against our nominee under --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would have no 

objection if this - everything was the same, except no 

party affiliation were shown.

 MR. WHITE: That --

constitutional?

 MR. WHITE: That would not violate our First 

Amendment rights, Your Honor. Washington --

statute is exactly how it is now. Would that be 

constitutional?

 MR. WHITE: No, Your Honor, because the 

State is still then resolving what is an internal 

factional fight between real Republicans using a blanket 

ballot where voters from rival parties are able to 

determine --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In my hypothesis the 

person is a real Republican. He is just not the one 

selected as the candidate.

 MR. WHITE: That's correct, Your Honor, but 

then the blanket is still selecting which Republican 

advances to the general election.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, it's not just a 

rhetorical flourish. It's true; when the State says 

that you take the position that you are entitled to say 

on the ballot who your nominee is, that has to be a 

correct statement of your position given this statute 

and given the issues presented to us here.

 MR. WHITE: I'm -- I'm not --

hyperbolic? It seems to me he is right based on your --

on the position you're now stating.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand you to 

say that you have a right to a partisan process in which 

your -- only your nominee is shown. I thought you're 

saying that if it is a process in which party 

affiliation is shown, then your endorsed candidate 

should be set aside somehow.

 MR. WHITE: That, that -- that is our -- is 

our position, Justice Scalia. We are not suggesting we 

have a right to a partisan process. Washington's 

constitution makes its legislative elections a partisan 

process, but once the State has decided to use partisan 

identification as the sole information that's presented 

on the ballot, it is telling the voters that this is the 

most important thing for you to be considering when you

by statute true, in my hypothetical he must be a member,

Cuomo/Edward Koch race, it is for the political parties 

to be able to resolve that internal party competition.

JUSTICE STEVENS: You're stating to suppress 

information. So the plaintiff says there is nothing to 

prevent the nominee or the convention from publicizing 

widely the fact that the convention picked me as their 

standard bearer. The fact that some other member of the 

party gets his name on the ballot doesn't prevent the 

public from being informed about the truth, does it?

 MR. WHITE: Perhaps I misunderstood your 

question, Justice Stevens. The Republican Party would 

not prevent the unsuccessful candidate from running in 

the election. He could run --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would prevent him from 

running and saying he is a Republican.

 MR. WHITE: On -- having him listed on the 

ballot where the State is indicating that that is the 

most important information to consider, the partisan 

affiliation, and the State has hypothesized through the 

Grange reply brief that there are all these other 

possible formulations to ballot. However, before the 

Ninth Circuit, in the State's petition appendix at page 

24a, the Ninth Circuit squarely put to the State's 

attorney the question: How would candidates be 

designated on the ballot where you had two Republicans 

who had competed against each other in the party's 

nominating process, and one had been selected; and a

third candidate who had absolutely no affiliation with 

the party also entered the race. And the State told the 

Ninth Circuit yes, they would be identified identically 

on the ballot.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were an 

empirical study that Washington voters know about this 

system, and that 80 percent of the Washington voters 

know that the party has not endorsed any one of these --

all of these candidates. That it's just say a statement 

of preference, that that's all it means; the voters know 

this. Is your position the same?

 MR. WHITE: Yes, Your Honor. The notion 

that disclaimers are necessary, and the State indicates 

that they will spend a million dollars to try to clear 

this up, is evidence of the confusion that's likely to 

occur. But even if the State does come forward and put 

all these disclaimers and preferences on, what the State 

is essentially doing on the ballot is masking who the 

Republican Party's nominee is by the presence of other 

candidates --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but my submission, 

or my hypothetical and it's just a hypothetical, is that 

no one is misled by this.

 MR. WHITE: Do we know --

true. Then what's the injury?

 MR. WHITE: The interest then is that you 

still have two Republican-identified candidates who are 

purporting to carry the party's message to the voters, 

and the voters are resolving that intra-party 

competition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have, for 

example, a disclaimer, it seems to me that undermines 

your argument that they are successfully, anyway, 

purporting to carry the party's message.

 MR. WHITE: Well, if you have the 

disclaimer, Your Honor, and the statements that this 

doesn't really mean anything, then you would come to the 

question of what legitimate State interest is being 

advanced by having someone put Republican on the ballot 

as their party preference, when it in fact means 

nothing; it does not mean they are associated with the 

party. It does not mean --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does one associate --

this one -- I think General McKenna told us that in the 

State of Washington people do not register membership in 

one party or the other, so how does the Republican Party 

determine who is a Republican?

Republican candidate? Or --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, who do you consider a 

member of the party? If you say I am a Republican in 

the State of Washington, what does that mean? It 

doesn't mean I registered Republican because Washington 

doesn't register people by party.

 MR. WHITE: The three political parties each 

have different definitions and ways to become -- ways to 

become affiliated with the party. Under the Republican 

Party rules if you identify yourself to the Republican 

Party that yes, I am a Republican, you attend our caucus 

and convention system, you contribute funds to the 

party, you can be a member of the Republican Party. The 

Libertarians --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Any one of those, 

contributing funds is enough? You don't have to go to 

the convention if you are --

MR. WHITE: You don't have to go to the 

convention, but there is also a difference there between 

being a rank-and-file member and being a spokesman of 

the party. I'd like to turn to the Libertarians, 

though, for instance. The Libertarians require you to 

sign a membership application and all members of the 

Libertarian Party in Washington must sign a pledge that 

they oppose the use of force in the resolution of 

political disputes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Libertarians have a 

lot more rules than the other parties.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you have identified 

-- in the course of your argument, you've identified two 

separate problems with the -- with the scheme as you see 

it. One is, as you put it, that it masks the identity 

of an official nominee, and the other is that it in 

effect allows competition on the ballot by a person 

under the same party banner with the official nominee.

 MR. WHITE: Yes. After the party has 

already resolved its internal disputes and determined 

who its spokesman will be, the State allows --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 MR. WHITE: -- any candidate to appropriate 

the name and compete against our nominee.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I -- no, I understand 

that to be your position, but my question is, and I 

realize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we 

-- we've got to face it: If the masking of the identity 

of the candidate is the real flaw, then the -- the 

hypothetical that was included in the -- in Jones, in 

the dictum, of the -- of the party that -- of the ballot 

that has no party identification whatsoever, that would 

equally be bad, wouldn't it?

MR. WHITE: No, Your Honor, because what it 

is, in this instance, Initiative 872 is a partisan 

primary that would mask the identity of the party 

nominee.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if it's the masking 

that's the problem, the -- the nominee is going to be 

just as well masked on the ballot or better masked on 

the ballot that allows no statement of preference at 

all.

 MR. WHITE: No, Justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and I'm not saying 

that that's fatally your case, but I mean it's -- it's 

something we need to be careful about when we're doing 

our thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it.

 MR. WHITE: Well -- and I think it's -- it's 

the masking in the context of a partisan system. The 

State may elect to have nonpartisan offices, and many 

local offices throughout the West are nonpartisan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- but if it's just 

masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're 

making the same argument that you make when you say, by 

allowing statements of preference, we obscure the 

character of the official nominee and in effect allow 

somebody to have a -- a second shot at -- at getting 

Republican support as a Republican.

It seems to me that if it's masking in a 

partisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only 

one objection and the objection is not so much the 

masking as it is the submergence of the official 

nomination by allowing competition under the party's 

name by another candidate. Isn't that fair to say?

 MR. WHITE: I -- I think, Justice Souter, 

that it -- that it is two separate inquiries. First you 

have the difficulty that as a practical matter these 

candidates will be identified as Republican nominees or 

Republican candidates, but even if the State were able 

to posit sufficient disclaimers and caveats, that the 

State has shown no valid interest in allowing a 

candidate to use the name --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but don't you think 

it's relevant information? Wouldn't a voter like to 

know whether a person preferred the Democrats or the 

Republicans?

 MR. WHITE: Well, it's -- it's relevant 

information, Justice Stevens, only to the extent that it 

connects the candidate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Only if true.

 MR. WHITE: To -- to the extent it connects 

the candidate to the political party and its positions 

on the issues. And as the State points out in its reply

brief --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question: 

This is a facial challenge, is it not?

 MR. WHITE: Yes, it is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what exactly -- what 

relief did the district court grant? Did he enjoin the 

entire blanket primary or just the designation of 

parties?

 MR. WHITE: The district court enjoined the 

entirety of Initiative 872 because it determined that 

the party preference provisions of Initiative 872 were 

not severable under Washington State's test for 

severability.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think that was the 

narrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the 

constitutional difficulty that you see?

 MR. WHITE: I -- I think that was the -- I 

think that was the appropriate, and it is a narrow 

relief. The court looked at the structure of the 

initiative, the connection of the party preference, and 

the party preference provisions permeate Initiative 872, 

and determined that severability was not appropriate. 

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it would be 

administerable if it was severed, if the preference

provision was just deleted?

 MR. WHITE: I'm not -- I'm not sure that it 

would, Your Honor. I'm not sure that it would because 

-- and what the State and the Grange argued below is 

that -- they actually argued for severance because that 

would then convert Initiative 872 into a truly 

nonpartisan primary, but that's not what was on the 

ballot. If you take a look at -- it's JA 400.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm confused about the 

difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied 

challenge. On the one hand, it's very helpful to you. 

There's no evidence out there that this has ever -- this 

has ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it 

right away, but then you have this relief that basically 

enjoins the whole -- whole procedure.

 MR. WHITE: Well, the Court asked General 

McKenna a question during his argument about whether the 

problem had ever occurred with a false-flag candidate 

capturing a party's name on the ballot. It has not 

under Initiative 872 because it was enjoined before 

being effective. But at page JA 239 there's testimony 

that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it also seems 

highly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a 

convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know

who the Republican nominee is, that there's going to be 

such confusion that everybody thinks it's one or two of 

the other people who also put an R after their name. 

The likelihood of massive confusion seems highly 

improbable to me. I mean you -- you have your own 

convention where you nominate the Republican nominee, 

your preferred candidate, and that's publicized 

generally throughout the State, and you're concerned 

that somebody going into the ballot box won't -- won't 

understand what's been going on.

 MR. WHITE: Your Honor, it's -- the State 

has indicated that our nominee, the unsuccessful nominee 

and the false-flag candidate would all be listed on the 

ballot identically. The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, again, the ballot's 

not the only information available to voters when they 

go into the polls.

 MR. WHITE: No, but it's the only 

information presented to the -- the voters at the 

critical moment when they're casting their ballot, and 

as this Court has noted in -- with respect to term 

limits or provision of truthful information regarding 

race on a ballot, a State cannot put its thumbs on the 

electoral scales by favoring one group of candidates 

over another.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say the 

same thing about the candidates' party preferences. 

They can make that known to the voters in the newspapers 

when they run.

 MR. WHITE: That's -- that's exactly the 

case, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't have the Republican 

Party endorsement, but I prefer the Republican Party.

 MR. WHITE: And with respect to the 

importance of party designations and party information 

on the ballot, last term the Chief Justice, in Wisconsin 

Right to Life, ordered a study that showed that 85 

percent of voters couldn't name a single candidate for 

the United States House of Representatives in their own 

district, but the -- the voters know the political 

parties. The political parties spent, in our case, a 

century and a half and, in the Democratic Party's case, 

200 years developing a message and developing a set of 

principles with which the parties are associated, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the validity 

or the invalidity, in your view, of a scheme which said 

that the ballot has one candidate who says, Smith, 

Republican nominee, and the other candidates -- other

Honor, is what is the legitimate interest of the State 

in putting that information on the ballot? At -- their 

reply brief at page 6, the State says an independent who 

does share the views of either the Republican or 

Democratic Party may prefer the Republican Party. That 

preference may be because that independent is running in 

a district that's 70 percent Republican.  And the 

question is, what is the legitimate interest of the 

State in providing that information that says, I prefer 

the Republican Party, where it connotes no connotation, 

no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you can't answer my 

question? You can't hypothesize any legitimate State 

interest for doing that?

 MR. WHITE: I -- I cannot, Your Honor, 

because either -- if there is legitimate State interest, 

the interest is in providing information about that 

candidate's positions and linkages to the Republican 

Party by saying, my preference is Republican because I 

believe what the Republicans are, whether that candidate 

is David Duke, in the Republican case, or in the case of 

the Democrats, a Lyndon LaRouche candidate.

writes this opinion, what's the fairest statement of the 

State's interest in this requirement? What do you think

fairest statement of the State interest would be that 

the State has no interest in creating the impression of 

false associations or allowing opportunistic candidates 

to appropriate the political party --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think there's no 

legitimate interest? It's -- it's an unfair question, I 

suppose.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said the 

State's interest was to -- to do what we disapproved in 

Jones without seeming to do what we disapproved in 

Jones.

 MR. WHITE: That -- that would be an 

acceptable phrasing of the State's interest as well, 

Justice Scalia.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm going to ask the 

State the same question.

questions, Initiative 872 is unconstitutional and the 

judgment of the lower court should be affirmed.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT McKENNA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.

 MR. McKENNA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 First of all, Justice Kennedy, the State's 

interest is what we have said it is all along. It is to 

convey some information on the ballot in the same way 

that the party label does. I have noticed that the 

political parties have never objected to having their 

nominees listed on the ballot as -- you know, as such.

 In this case it's an expression of party 

preference, to be sure, and nothing more than that; and 

there is useful information which is conveyed. We are 

not required to allow it, but the voters have chosen to 

allow it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you to clarify 

something you said during your initial argument? I 

understood you to say that the sample ballot on page 1 

of the Grange reply would be unconstitutional.

 MR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor. I did not say 

that it would be unconstitutional. I said that that 

would be a different argument. It might be a more 

difficult argument. The Ninth Circuit assumed that that 

is what the ballot would look like, even though there 

was not basis for the Ninth Circuit reaching that

conclusion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I'm wrong. I 

thought you did say it would be unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I did, too.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And could you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You should have said that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean how would you 

defend that? I mean --

MR. McKENNA: Well, I would defend it, Your 

Honor, by saying that this is a facial challenge. Let's 

apply it. And if there is evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we are 

assuming it is applied in the way that is shown on the 

Grange reply brief at page 1. If it were applied in 

that way, would that be unconstitutional? It just says 

R or D.

 MR. McKENNA: It would -- it could be 

unconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice, if there were 

evidence that the voters were misled or confused.

 Mr. Chief Justice, this is an excellent 

opportunity to point out that the letter after the name, 

whether it's the letter as on page one of the Grange 

ballot or an expression of party preference on pages two 

and three, is not the only information on the ballot.

lots of other information on the ballot which clearly 

distinguishes the expression of party preference.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it also true that, 

by hypothesis, there will be other candidates beside the 

one R and the one D? If there aren't at least two R's 

and two D's, there is no problem.

 MR. McKENNA: In the scenario or the ballot 

on page 1, Justice Stevens, I believe that what would 

happen is the Secretary of State would still provide the 

additional language. If that additional language is not 

provided, if it were just that bare ballot with no 

explanatory language, then, yes, it would be much harder 

to defend as being constitutional. But that, in fact, 

is not the way it's going to work.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But my point is there 

could never be a ballot just like this, what your 

opponents are talking about, because there are always 

going to be at least two or three R's and two or three 

D's. And the sample shows there is only one, which must 

then be the party chosen -- I mean the nominee chosen at 

the convention.

 MR. McKENNA: But the key here, Your Honor, 

is that even under the ballot on page one, what is not 

happening under top- two is that the nominee of the 

party is not being selected. That's not happening any

more. And in Jones the Court said that the top-two is 

the same in all characteristics save one, which is the 

result of the nominee not being selected.

 And that is exactly what is happening under 

top-two: The nominee is not being selected; and, as 

applied, we are going to be providing lots of other 

information on the ballot to make it very clear what the 

expression "party preference" means.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the State have a 

legitimate interest in weakening the influence of 

political parties?

 MR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor, it does not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we found that that was 

the necessary effect of this ballot measure, then would 

it be invalid?

 MR. McKENNA: I think Your Honor you would 

have to find there is a severe burden on the parties and 

subject the provision to party presence to strict 

scrutiny. It would be receiver -- Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the state has no 

legitimate interest it's going to fail any level of 

scrutiny.

indicating something about party on the ballot. This,
