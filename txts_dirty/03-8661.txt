 (11:03 a.m.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in the 

case of Smith against Massachusetts. 

Mr. Nathanson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NATHANSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 The trial judge found Melvin Smith not guilty on 

the merits and unequivocally so. That acquittal entitled 

Melvin Smith to repose. Instead, what he got was a moving 

target. The trial judge's later reconsideration of 

Smith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that same 

offense twice.

 Smith's position on the matter is completely 

faithful to this Court's precedent, and it makes sense in 

the real-world practice of criminal law. 

The State, on the other hand, asks this Court to 

make exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittals 

terminate jeopardy. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Just to say that this --

what happened here was not a final determination.

 Take an analog -- an analogy to rule 54(b). The 

judge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks.

You see, I'm going to give you a separate piece of paper 

that says judgment, but if I don't give you that separate 

piece of paper, even though I said judgment granted, it 

doesn't count until the very end of the case. I can 

always change my mind. Why shouldn't it operate the same 

way on the criminal side?

 MR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, obviously, 

that's a civil case. The Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't 

apply to civil cases. Second of all -- except with some 

rare exceptions.

 What I think the best way to -- to really define 

finality here -- and -- and whatever finality is, I really 

do think we -- we do have it here because this Court has 

said an acquittal under Martin Linen, a resolution, 

correct or not, of some or all if the factual elements --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I looked at Martin 

Linen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of 

acquittal entered. Here we have an endorsement on a 

motion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying --

what does the entry say? Motion granted or something like 

that. 

MR. NATHANSON: Allowed, and it was attested by 

the clerk. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- this 

might be significant. Is there in Massachusetts, when a

motion for acquittal is granted and there are other 

charges still going on, is there a piece of paper that 

says, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?

 MR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor. The -- the 

formal rule, which is not always observed, but the formal 

rule is that it must be recorded on -- on the docket and 

announced in an open courtroom. That happened here. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have a State 

and the State has a statute, and the statute says any 

motion for acquittal may be granted by the -- the trial 

court at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that 

motion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by 

the district court at any time before -- or by the trial 

court at any time before the submission of the case to the 

jury. Then there's no repose element because the -- the 

defendant is on notice that this may not be final. What 

would be the -- your position in that case if a statute 

like that were on the books? And if you say that that's 

different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court 

of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial 

matter. 

MR. NATHANSON: Well, to answer the first 

question, I think that if -- if such a statute were 

enacted, I'm willing to grant, for purposes of this case, 

that it wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem. It may in

a later case -- and you know, I'd be very interested in 

that -- a problem under a combination of Jackson and 

Winship because the defendant may have a -- a right to 

that determination. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, well, let -- let's just 

assume that you've conceded that. Now, you've been 

guarded about it. If we can do that by statute, why can't 

we do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of 

-- Judicial Court of Massachusetts? 

MR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, the Supreme 

Judicial Court of Massachusetts is the one who promulgated 

the rules in this case. Rule 25(a) is promulgated by the 

Supreme Judicial Court of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but they put a gloss on 

the rule by their decision. 

MR. NATHANSON: Well, that was the Massachusetts 

Appeals Court, I might add. 

Second of all, the rule itself requires that the 

motion shall be ruled upon at that time. It says nothing 

about reconsideration, and clearly --

JUSTICE BREYER: They've held that in this case. 

We have a Massachusetts decision. It's their law and 

under their law in Massachusetts, the judge can revise it.

 MR. NATHANSON: Actually --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it isn't their law,

then I don't know how -- why they affirmed this conviction 

rather than reversing it.

 MR. NATHANSON: I'm not sure I know either, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but I mean, I -- I 

take it that it is their law, otherwise I'd see reversal, 

wouldn't I, and not affirmance?

 MR. NATHANSON: Actually I think what they 

did --

JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. NATHANSON: -- Your Honor, is they assumed 

that there was an error in -- in -- when dealing strictly 

with the rule, at the -- at the end of the section dealing 

with this, they assume that there was an error and said no 

prejudice, which I've contended in the brief --

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so in other words, 

they're saying that in this case -- how could there not be 

prejudice? He had another trial. I mean -- how could --

I don't understand this from beginning to end then.

 But let me go back to my original question. 

What rule do you propose?

 MR. NATHANSON: As for finality, the rule I 

propose is, first of all, we have to start with the basic 

foundation, which is an acquittal, under Martin Linen with 

a resolution --

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm saying is, for double 

jeopardy purposes --

MR. NATHANSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- an acquittal in your view is 

an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?

 MR. NATHANSON: There's -- there's three things 

that I think Court should look at. One, first of all, 

because we treat acquittals from the bench for double 

jeopardy purposes the same as acquittals from a jury, a 

prosecutor can poll a jury immediately after the verdict. 

A prosecutor clearly --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm asking you for a --

I'd have to write -- if I agreed with you, I'd have to say 

we have here a judge who changed his mind. Under the 

clause of the Constitution, a judge cannot change his mind 

when. Now, go ahead. Now, fill in the blanks.

 MR. NATHANSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: According -- I know what their 

rule is. Their rule is a judge can change his mind up to 

the point that the jury is dismissed, something like that. 

I understand that. Now, I want to know what your rule --

is your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writes 

the word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says, 

oh my God, I meant to say no acquittal? Too late. Too 

late. Okay, now, so I want to know what your rule is. Is

that the rule? 

MR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What is the rule?

 MR. NATHANSON: The -- your first question --

the constitutional point of no return, shall we say, is 

further proceedings. If there is an acquittal and there 

are further proceedings --

JUSTICE BREYER: There is no further proceeding 

if he writes the word acquittal, I guess until he changes 

his mind. So 3 minutes later, he says I change my mind. 

Now there are further proceedings. 

MR. NATHANSON: Well, then at that point you 

look to other indicia of finality that this -- this Court 

referenced that in -- in Vincent, and that -- that's 

generally compliance with State procedure. Compliance 

with State procedures --

JUSTICE BREYER: I need to write a simple rule. 

All I'm trying to get from you is what is your rule. Is 

your rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal --

an acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing 

left for the jury to do on that charge. That's what it 

means. When he writes the word acquittal, he cannot change 

it. Is that your rule?

 MR. NATHANSON: No. The rule is that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And what is your rule?

 MR. NATHANSON: The rule is that the judge 

cannot change it, as a matter of Federal constitutional 

law, if there are further proceedings. In a multi-count 

case, count A is acquitted. We initiate further 

proceedings on count B and C. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But your answer just isn't 

responsive. When has it become final?

 MR. NATHANSON: It ripens at the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: When? When the judge says 

something, when he writes something? When does it become 

final? At what point in time?

 MR. NATHANSON: What I'm suggesting is --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is your proposed rule? 

You haven't said yet.

 MR. NATHANSON: What -- what I'm suggesting is 

-- is two things. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Just one thing. Just when 

does it become final? Let's limit it to one thing.

 MR. NATHANSON: It -- it becomes final when 

there are further proceedings initiated. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. I don't understand 

that. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That doesn't make sense.

 MR. NATHANSON: The -- the -- that is the line 

drawn by most of the lower courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're not understanding my 

question then. Imagine a case in which a judge writes the 

word acquittal. Now, half an hour later, he thinks, oh, 

my God, what have I done. The jury is still sitting 

there. Of course, they're sitting there because he hasn't 

had a chance to dismiss them yet. They happened to be 

having lunch or something. Is it final?

 MR. NATHANSON: It is not final --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is not final.

 MR. NATHANSON: -- if -- if the defense has not 

been forced at that point to choose to rest or put on a 

case. That is the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Say that again. 

MR. NATHANSON: If the defense is forced to rest 

or put on a case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But he wrote the word 

acquittal. There's nothing more for anybody to do until 

he changes the word.

 MR. NATHANSON: Well, I think we're talking 

about two separate things. Is Your Honor's question 

presupposing a single-count case or a multi-count?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's try single-count. Okay?


 MR. NATHANSON: Okay. 


JUSTICE BREYER: There he is. He writes the


word acquittal and the jury says, oh, what do we do now?

Go home, says the clerk. Now, before they can get out the 

door or anything else happens, before they get out the 

door, he says, oh, my God, I made a mistake. Can he do 

that under your rule?

 MR. NATHANSON: I'm not entirely sure of the 

answer to the question, Your Honor, but I -- I think, 

first of all, we look at compliance with State procedure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What I thought from 

reading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule 

-- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it. 

If he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind. 

Now, that rule to me is inconsistent with most law.

 MR. NATHANSON: If we're talking about a 

clerical error, Your Honor, the Massachusetts rules and 

the Federal rules provide for correction of clerical 

errors. What -- what we're talking about here is not a 

clerical error, but the judge clearly intended to do what 

she did. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, was your client --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But a very plain error --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- was your client prejudiced 

in any way by not putting on some evidence that the -- he 

would have put on?

 MR. NATHANSON: May I begin, Your Honor --

once. 

MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there 

was a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being 

aware that the judge was going to, at some point --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a terribly risky 

defense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I 

didn't do it, somebody else did it. How could he then 

turn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the 

jury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have 

the gun? I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do 

that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the 

other guy, it wasn't this defendant? And then to make 

this defense that he had a right to possess this gun 

because he belonged in the house, that would be 

extraordinary. 

MR. NATHANSON: Your Honor, counsel for co-

defendant, Felicia Brown, presented just such a defense 

and she was acquitted. She presented the defense that 

Melvin Smith did not shoot Christopher Robinson, but if 

Melvin --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody charged her with 

possessing a gun. 

MR. NATHANSON: But what I'm saying is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- look, there were a 

lot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what

is a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of 

events so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses 

doesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to 

the possession of a gun. That's -- that's all that it is.

 MR. NATHANSON: What I'm saying is that it 

wasn't risky, Your Honor, because the -- this jury was 

willing to consider an alternative defense that would have 

otherwise appeared as a concession. They did not take it 

as a concession. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he would be -- the 

defendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and 

the jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law 

pleader. I didn't borrow the kettle. It was broken when 

I got it. Or, I returned it unbroken. To -- to do that, to 

say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then, 

jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that 

I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a 

criminal defense.

 MR. NATHANSON: I'd just respectfully disagree, 

Your Honor. But -- but the -- the larger point is if we 

allow this rule in general, we are going to engender 

serious problems. I'm saying that there -- that there was 

some reliance here, but we're going to engender much more 

serious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps 

presents a defense that is helpful to the remaining

charges, but damaging on the acquitted charge. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if -- if -- you 

know, we shape the expectation by what we say. If -- if 

we say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling 

and as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any 

kind of reliance is -- is misplaced. 

MR. NATHANSON: What Massachusetts law says in 

-- in the Zavala case, they said that there is not a right 

to reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence 

is insufficient. 

Second of all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That is when the case is not 

ongoing. I mean, here we had a case that was continuing 

and -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which 

is common at the trial level. I mean, these decisions --

she made this decision in a split second. Maybe she was 

too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk 

went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial 

Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so 

of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't 

prejudice. 

The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it 

came up at closing. Right? So if the defendant was 

prejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute, 

judge, I want to put on that defense that I really was

there but I had a right to have the gun. 

MR. NATHANSON: He didn't say that, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. So he --

so I don't see that you have a realistic claim of 

prejudice.

 MR. NATHANSON: Well, I -- I don't think 

prejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence. 

Either the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or 

he has not. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to set a --

a point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not 

exactly clear, but there's one point that says when the 

jury is discharged. Then there may be other reasons why 

there's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't 

permit it, other than double jeopardy. But if -- why 

isn't that a sensible place to draw the line?

 MR. NATHANSON: Because if -- if discharge of 

the jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an 

acquittal at any point in a defendant's case. 2 weeks 

into a defense case, the judge could reconsider an 

acquittal. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question -- we're talking 

about a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you 

pointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate 

court. Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

interpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule 

allows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as 

long as there's no prejudice to the defense. That's what 

our rule means.

 MR. NATHANSON: I don't think that's 

permissible, Your Honor. It -- it is -- granted, for 

purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for 

States to order judges to withhold rulings, that there 

shall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence 

prior to the return of a jury verdict. Louisiana, for 

example, does that, and I think Oklahoma. 

But for the Supreme Judicial -- Judicial Court 

of Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is 

simply straight contravening what this Court has said. 

It's -- it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you do agree, I take it, 

that if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't 

a scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm --

I'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do 

it now just in case I have a second thought, but at least 

by the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you, 

I take it, concede that that is permissible.

 MR. NATHANSON: I think that is permissible 

because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that -- if that's

permissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be 

the way trials are conducted when -- when there are mid-

trial motions like yours? Every judge is going to say, 

yes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll 

-- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and 

then I'll rule. That's -- that's the way they're all 

going to respond, isn't it?

 MR. NATHANSON: No, I don't think so, Your 

Honor. I think judges are -- are intelligent people. 

They read the pleadings beforehand. Justice Donovan 

clearly read the pleading beforehand in this case, and she 

-- she was prepared to ask for argument on it. I don't 

think that judges do these things so precipitously that 

they are not going to be confident in their ruling. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but every judge knows he 

drops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to 

guard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating 

an appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious 

and hold onto it.

 MR. NATHANSON: And judges should be cautious, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also important to 

know, though, whether the defendant has to put on a case 

or not? So he can't just reserve judgment. I'll tell you 

after the trial is over whether you should put a case on

or not.

 MR. NATHANSON: That -- that is, in fact, the 

point, Justice Stevens. The Double Jeopardy Clause is a 

constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's 

benefit. He -- that's what this Court said in Jorn. The 

defendant has to know whether he -- he's defending a case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But does -- does --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the defendant here ask to 

be -- to have the right to reopen?

 MR. NATHANSON: He did not. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Did he --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you another question here? 

There -- there were three charges against your client, as 

I understand it. Unlawful possession of a firearm. 

That's the one we're talking about.

 MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Assault with intent to 

murder.

 MR. NATHANSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Assault and battery by means 

of a dangerous weapon. 

MR. NATHANSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The jury convicted on all 

three.

 MR. NATHANSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, he was given concurrent 

sentences. 

MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that correct? 

MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So would you explain to me if 

there's any practical effect to your winning in this case?

 MR. NATHANSON: There is a practical effect. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is it?

 MR. NATHANSON: Firearm possession offenses in 

Massachusetts have restrictions as to parole and good time 

deductions that the other offenses do not have. So there 

is a practical effect, aside from the fact that it's a --

it's a conviction on his record, Your Honor. 

Moving on, Justice Breyer, just to address the 

question that you were asking me, I think perhaps a good 

way to phrase it is -- is if the first factual resolution 

of the elements of -- of the offense results in acquittal, 

there can be no further proceedings. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What I was thinking is -- I 

mean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in the 

trial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is 

there any evidence here that this was less than the 

shotgun -- this was not a shotgun. You know, it had to be

a barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence 

here of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there 

was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there 

aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's 

thinking, something may be missing here. She's a little 

uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few 

minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there 

was all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't 

have done that.

 I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a 

hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she 

supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because 

after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a 

case? Or is she supposed to enter something and think, 

well, I could change my mind before it's over? Or what is 

she supposed to do? She just thinks she made a mistake.

 MR. NATHANSON: So your hypothetical is that 

there's evidence of two guns?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought here there was 

evidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.

 MR. NATHANSON: I'm sorry. Yes, in this case --

JUSTICE BREYER: There was evidence it was a 

pistol. So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that 

there was evidence. That's beside the point, but I'm --

I'm just using it as an example where a judge might think

she made a mistake. She thought there was no evidence 

that it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that 

there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a 

shotgun.

 MR. NATHANSON: She -- she clearly didn't 

forget. The prosecutor said to her the evidence was 

testified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it 

was a .32 --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm quite sure -- not 

quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence 

it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. And now a 

few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is, 

it couldn't have been that good. Or maybe she thinks that 

that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now. 

What's the line? Suppose she thinks of it a second from 

now. Suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal, 

she thought, oh, my God, a pistol is not a shotgun. Of 

course, it isn't. I know that. I better change it. Is 

it a second from now? Is it she can never change it no 

matter what once the pen leaves the paper? What's your 

rule?

 MR. NATHANSON: In a single-count case, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Whether it's single-count or 

double-count or triple-count. I want to know what -- how

you see it, not how I see it.

 MR. NATHANSON: It -- compliance with State 

procedure informs the inquiry and once -- once we have 

what is determined to be a resolution --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once it's final under State 

procedure, right? And you also would add once there's no 

clerical error. She didn't mistakenly say, you know, 

affirm when she meant to write deny. Leaving that aside, 

once it's final under State procedure, it's final.

 MR. NATHANSON: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes it's wrong.

 MR. NATHANSON: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it'd be sometimes wrong no 

matter how you define final. I mean, you know, she 

let's --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's excellent. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let's all the evidence on 

and -- and does it after all the evidence is there, and 

then she -- and then at the close of all the evidence, she 

gives a directed verdict for -- for the defendant, and 

then discharges the jury, and as soon as the jury walks 

out, oh, my God, what a mistake I made. Too bad. Right? 

I mean, we say double jeopardy.

 MR. NATHANSON: Correct, Your Honor. That's 

what --

 JUSTICE BREYER: Excellent. That was an

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I would like to know, 

given that answer, why is this final under State procedure 

because it seems as if the State courts of Massachusetts 

have said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go and 

look into this again. She can change her mind. And 

that's what I'd like you to focus on because I agree that 

that was a good explanation of the rule.

 MR. NATHANSON: If -- if State procedure, as in 

this --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm thinking of this case.

 MR. NATHANSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I took Justice Scalia's 

rule and I said, that's the rule. Now, I would say that's 

the rule of a Federal law. Very well. That turns on your 

decision here being final as a matter of State law, but it 

seems to me we have State courts here saying, at least for 

double jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter of 

State law. And therefore, I want to know how we reach 

your conclusion here. 

MR. NATHANSON: Well, there's -- there clearly 

is a line beyond which the State cannot go, and that's 

what Justice Brennan was talking about in his concurrence

in Lydon. He said the -- the State cannot fashion a 

procedure whereby the judge never discharges the jury, and 

in -- in Kepner, this Court held that the Philippine 

procedure of withholding finality from an acquittal in a 

bench trial also violated the Constitution. So State 

procedure does not control. It is sufficient but not 

necessary. 

If -- if you comply with State procedure to say 

this is -- this is an acquittal, okay, it's an acquittal. 

If you do not comply with State procedure, it can still be 

an acquittal under Federal law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the State have the power 

to say whether -- whether an acquittal under State law 

constitutes an acquittal for purposes of Federal 

constitutional double jeopardy purposes? Is that a State 

law question or a Federal question? 

MR. NATHANSON: No. It -- it is a Federal 

question, Your Honor. This Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was.

 MR. NATHANSON: -- this Court said that in 

Smalis quite clearly.

 If I -- if I may, two things and then I'd like 

to reserve. But the -- the State would have this Court 

draw a distinction between acquittals by a judge and 

acquittals by a jury. That simply has been rejected by

this Court numerous times. Sanabria, Rumsey. An

Again, the -- the State would have this Court 

draw distinctions between acquittals based on law and 

acquittals based on fact. Sanabria unequivocally rejected 

that. Sanabria says that in fact sufficiency of the 

evidence is not a legal defense. An acquittal is an 

acquittal.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like to 

reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHRYN A. NEAVES

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. NEAVES: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 I'd like to start with where the Court left off 

on the notion of reconsideration and finality. The 

Massachusetts Appeals Court here specifically stated that 

a judge's right to reconsider his or her legal rulings is 

firmly rooted in the common law and permitted Judge 

Donovan in this case to reconsider her legal ruling that 

the evidence was insufficient. Certainly that common law 

right of reconsideration could not run afoul of this 

Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals

court specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause 

was not violated because there was no second proceeding 

and that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted 

to reconsider her ruling.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if this had 

been the sole count, the gun possession count had been the 

sole count, and -- and the same ruling had been made by 

the judge? Would you say that there was double jeopardy 

attaching or not?

 MS. NEAVES: Not so long as the jury was still 

there. If the prosecutor had the opportunity to say, 

Judge Donovan, give me 10 minutes, I know there's a 

Supreme Judicial Court case on the point that I'm arguing 

to you, which is that you did not need a witness to 

directly testify that the gun barrel length was less than 

16 inches, I know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take 

a recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the 

prosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and 

the judge said, absolutely, you're -- you're correct, I'm 

going to send the charge to the jury, there's no double 

jeopardy violation there. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what if it's a bench trial?

 MS. NEAVES: A bench trial is a very difficult 

situation. And the Smalis case certainly seems to be the 

hardest case here, but bench trials present different -- a

different situation because the judge is both the fact-

finder and the law-giver. And in that context, it's much 

more difficult --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know it's difficult. What's 

your answer?

 MS. NEAVES: My answer to that is I believe that 

if the judge stated the evidence is insufficient, as -- as 

the judge did in Smalis, as the trier of fact and law, I 

find the evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's over. 

MS. NEAVES: It's over. It's over. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The minute --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if in the case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the minute he --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- we have before us the State 

allowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of the 

prosecution right after the judge's ruling?

 MS. NEAVES: In a jury case, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MS. NEAVES: I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Conceivably they could allow 

an interlocutory appeal from a judgment of acquittal at 

the close of the prosecution's case.

 MS. NEAVES: If such a -- if such a process 

could be put in place where there was an appellate panel

that would be willing and available to hear that while the 

jury remained empaneled, I don't think it would run afoul 

of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: But is that necessary? I -- I 

mean, that's what I think is the difficult question here. 

Can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-

maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court, 

but it's not final in respect to the judge having a right 

to change his mind within the court? That -- that makes a 

lot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible to 

get there. 

Why not? I -- I think, well, the reason is that 

you want judges to be able to reconsider things and you 

don't have that problem when you're talking about an 

appeal. 

MS. NEAVES: That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or is there any -- is there 

any, in other words, to reconcile our case that you're 

talking about, Smalis?

 MS. NEAVES: The Smalis case? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.

 MS. NEAVES: I think there are a number of ways 

to reconcile it. Certainly Massachusetts' position is 

that it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury

trial, but there is also no doubt that the case left the 

trial court and went up on appeal. I think both of those 

factors are significant. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't the 

significance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of 

our continuation of the jury panel, going back to Justice 

Stevens' question? And what if the -- what if the State 

had a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply 

decline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were 

taken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped 

over, it could come right back to the same jury panel? 

Would -- would the -- would the answer have to be 

different? 

MS. NEAVES: I don't think it would. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?

 MS. NEAVES: I think -- I think for a -- I think 

for my -- to my way of thinking about the cases, the jury 

is what matters and it's the defendant's right to his 

particular tribunal, and that's the first jury that's 

empaneled --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but on my hypothesis he's 

going to get the same jury. 

MS. NEAVES: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They have not been discharged.

 MS. NEAVES: Exactly. So I would say that it

would not be a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, 

and that's why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. It goes all the way up on 

appeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I 

guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or 

while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is 

overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and 

recommences the trial? Wow. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that's so, then 

why shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way? Because 

they can send it right back to exactly the same judge.

 MS. NEAVES: Because he -- he is the trier of 

fact, and I think at that point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the jury is the trier of 

fact. 

MS. NEAVES: That's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, on the hypothesis 

before, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and 

it can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem. In 

Smalis, it's going to be the same judge. It was a bench 

trial. It should have come out the other way. 

MS. NEAVES: Well, I think the difference is the 

-- the judge in Smalis was the trier of fact. He made a 

rule -- he is both the trier of fact and the law-giver. 

He's decided that the evidence is insufficient. If that

difference -- and I don't know if this -- is another 

difference that in the hypothetical case with the jury, 

the jury has not yet deliberated --

the count from which he thought his client had been 

acquitted?

 MS. NEAVES: Well, he certainly had some sense 

of reliance, but it wasn't a double jeopardy reliance. 

And I would -- I would point the Court to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if the Double 

Jeopardy Clause did apply, if it were treated as a true 

acquittal, he could just say, well, we can forget about 

that, send your witnesses home, we won't have to worry 

about it. 

I understand under your view they could send the 

witnesses home, and a week -- a week later the judge could 

say, well, we haven't submitted it to the jury, I've 

decided to change my mind. You could bring all those 

witnesses back. That's the way you think it should work.

 MS. NEAVES: Absolutely, Justice Stevens. And I 

think --

JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what about a judge who 

thinks -- should the judge -- should a judge in trial be 

able to change his mind as long as the jury is still 

there? Yes.

 MS. NEAVES: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Should you be able to take an 

appeal in the same circumstance while the jury is still 

there? No.

 Now, suppose a judge thinks both those things. 

Is that judge, like me, for example, hopelessly confused?

 (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is the judge thinking 

contradictory things or is there a way of reconciling 

those two instincts? 

MS. NEAVES: I -- Justice Breyer, I -- I 

certainly believe that the -- that the double jeopardy 

rule that we're -- we're advocating would permit that, but 

I -- I think that most trial judges would not be very 

pleased about doing something like that. And practically 

speaking, there's --

JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, if it's 

constitutional, it's pretty easy to see a State might well 

say, let's do that, what a good idea. I mean, they might 

think it's a good idea. I don't know what people think is 

a good idea. We'll provide for interlocutory appeals 

right in the middle of cases because the prosecution can 

never appeal at the end of the case. That's really 

unfair. And we'll do this little thing here, and that way 

we give the prosecutor a chance. 

MS. NEAVES: I -- I have to stick with the rule 

that -- that --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think it's --

I'm just inconsistent.

 MS. NEAVES: I think it -- I -- well, it's --

it's -- I think if -- I think if you accept the notion 

that jury discharge is what matters for purposes of the 

Double Jeopardy Clause and permitting a trial judge to 

reconsider a legal ruling up to that point, then if a 

State court could fashion an interlocutory review process 

of that legal ruling, that would not violate the Double 

Jeopardy Clause. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the conceptual basis 

for saying that jury discharge makes the difference? Why 

is that the touchstone?

 MS. NEAVES: I think this Court has said over 

and over again that it is the jury -- the defendant's 

right to hold onto his chosen jury that matters in a 

number of different contexts in the double jeopardy area. 

This Court has drawn the line at attachment of jeopardy 

when the jury is empaneled and sworn based on the 

historical value of a defendant having that particular 

jury resolve the government's case against him. And so I 

think that it matters, particularly where a motion for a 

required finding is not constitutionally mandated. It's a 

tool that --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would think prejudice to 

the defendant should be a factor, and if the defendant is 

misled by what the judge says into not putting on part of

the case that otherwise would have been put on, that's a 

pretty serious matter. 

MS. NEAVES: That is a very serious matter, and 

it is the sort of prejudice that falls within the rubric 

of due process and -- and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but we usually don't use --

MS. NEAVES: -- would grant you a retrial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we don't use the -- I mean, 

you could use the Due Process Clause for everything, for 

double jeopardy, for all of the other protections in the 

Constitution. I think our cases say if -- if there's a 

problem that has been created by ignoring the double 

jeopardy rules, you don't solve that problem by -- by the 

deus ex machina of the Due Process Clause.

 MS. NEAVES: No. That's -- that's exactly 

correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So this a problem created by 

the judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had every 

reason to rely upon as being the end of that part of the 

case. I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, in 

fairness it's a -- it's a double jeopardy problem, not a 

due process problem. 

MS. NEAVES: Well, with respect, Justice Scalia, 

I would say it is the sort of reliance that a -- that a

defendant may have, as for example the case in Sanabria, 

where a -- where a judge excludes certain evidence, and 

the case goes forward. And as a result of that -- a 

result of that decision, the judge in that case granted a 

motion for acquittal. And at the end of the case, the 

prosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of 

the evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to 

go ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically 

said if I had let it back in, I would have vacated my 

motion for required finding and allowed the case to go to 

the jury. So that sort of prejudice -- a defendant has an 

expectation of certain things that may or may not happen 

at trial, but the remedy outside of the double jeopardy 

context, if the defendant is acquitted, is a retrial. 

The drastic remedy of double jeopardy is -- is 

used when a defendant has been subjected twice to a trial 

before a second trier of fact. This -- this Court has 

been consistent that when the government subjects the 

defendant over and over again before a second --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you correctly 

to say that if the defendant is acquitted, the remedy is a 

retrial? 

MS. NEAVES: No, no, no. I'm sorry, Justice 

Stevens. No. Only if the defendant is convicted is the 

remedy a retrial because, indeed, if the jury acquits him,

there is no harm at all. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason you didn't 

want a fairly simple rule that I was thinking of? I'll 

tell you what it is and you'll tell me honestly why you 

don't. 

It's final. The word acquittal is -- is final 

if the jury has been discharged or the decision is sent to 

another body for review. One or the other.

 MS. NEAVES: I could live with that rule. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, so you haven't found 

something in your research that suggests that -- that --

MS. NEAVES: No, no. Our position has been 

consistent. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under -- under that view 

of things, suppose in this -- in this case there's a 

motion for acquittal and the judge says, yes, I -- I think 

there's no evidence on the gun. Then the prosecutor says 

I want 10 minutes because I think there's a case on it. 

Then he says, you know, there's a case and I think it 

covers this, and the judge says, well, I think you may be 

wrong. I'll let you reopen to put on evidence of -- of 

the gun. What would -- what would be the result in that 

case?

 MS. NEAVES: I think that because if it's a jury 

trial and the case is still -- and the jury is still

there, it could be done without violating the Double

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you have to say that 

under your view. 

MS. NEAVES: I think so. I think honing -- what 

this Court has talked about in honing is -- is refining a 

case before a second trier of fact. And as a matter of 

Massachusetts' procedures, certainly the prosecution may 

be able to reopen if there's good faith or mistake, but 

for purposes of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did the 

Massachusetts Supreme Court say -- and I thought it did 

say this in its rules -- trial judge, you rule on the spot 

when a motion to acquit is made? We will not allow you to 

reserve judgment. Because the normal thing would be a 

trial judge would say, why should I decide this 

definitively now? I'll wait till the end of the case. 

But as I understand the Massachusetts rules, it says, 

judge, you can't reserve on a motion to acquit. You must 

rule immediately.

 MS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, 

and if I misunderstood the hypothetical, that -- that was 

my mistake. As a matter of Massachusetts law, a trial 

judge does not have that option. She must rule on the 

motion before the defendant decides to put on the case,

and that is what happened here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so part of Justice 

Breyer's question needs editing because it would not be 

possible under Massachusetts law for the judge to say --

MS. NEAVES: That is correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I reserve.

 MS. NEAVES: That is correct. She could not.

 And -- and if I could just highlight a couple of 

points to -- to demonstrate the significance of -- of 

permitting trial judges the ability to reconsider legal 

rulings. In Massachusetts, the fact that there's a 

written motion here is quite unusual. These motions are 

made orally generally. The prosecution is not given an 

opportunity -- does not -- there's no requirement that he 

be given advance notice ever. There's no requirement of 

that. The prosecution argues in opposition to the motion 

on the spot, and the judge rules on the spot. 

And -- and I think that -- that procedure is 

demonstrated quite clearly here. The -- the defendant 

filed the motion. The prosecution did, indeed, argue the 

correct response, legal response, did not have a case at 

hand and as --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Your position would be the same 

if the -- if the Massachusetts law provided that the 

motions at the end of the prosecution's case shall not be

ruled on unless -- after they're written briefs filed by 

both sides and they have 3 days of argument. You'd still 

have the same position.

 MS. NEAVES: That's true. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And in fact, the -- the quick 

and dirty procedure you describe is probably a boon to 

prosecutors because a judge is -- is not likely to take 

the serious step of dismissing a charge on the basis of --

of such a procedure and is more likely to say, well, we'll 

let the trial go ahead and see what the evidence 

discloses. I mean, I can't imagine that this is not a 

boon to the prosecutor rather than, as you -- as you seem 

to paint it here, a disadvantage.

 MS. NEAVES: I -- I wouldn't want to 

characterize --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a very unusual judge I 

would think to --

MS. NEAVES: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to whip it out like that and 

-- and enter an acquittal without -- without letting it go 

forward. 

MS. NEAVES: I would say it is unusual, but it 

happens where -- and I think the trial judge certainly in 

this case who believes that if she's mistaken, can -- can 

correct her ruling and send it to the jury, then feels

somewhat free to -- to do what the defendant asks, if it

JUSTICE SCALIA: You may -- you may regret what 

you've asked for.

 MS. NEAVES: I hope not, Justice Scalia. I hope 

not. 

I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen -- I think 

one of the briefs suggested that suppose you have a multi-

defendant case and the judge says, after the prosecution 

case is done, defendant A, I'm going to grant a motion to 

acquit. He's out of it, but there was enough evidence to 

require the -- the defense to go on for B and C. And then 

after hearing B and C's defense, the judge said, I think I 

was wrong about acquitting A, so I'm -- I'm going to 

withdraw it. Would there be -- could that be done without 

any -- any double jeopardy bar? The jury hasn't been 

discharged. 

MS. NEAVES: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it 

presents a double jeopardy bar, but a defendant has a 

right to be present at his trial, and so it certainly 

would be a reversible error if -- if a trial judge --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the -- he's 

sitting there. Defendant A is sitting there throughout

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess there are a lot of 

rules in Massachusetts that deal with that. They can't --

you have to be fair to the defendant in -- is that right?

 MS. NEAVES: Well, certainly. Rule 25 itself 

specifically states that the defendant shall have the 

opportunity to present evidence after the motion is denied 

or allowed in part without reserving that right. So 

certainly that option is available.

 The trial court in this case was permitted to 

correct its erroneous ruling in favor of the defendant on 

the motion for judgment of acquittal. Because the 

prosecution is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to 

prove its case, that's a value --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same 

question I asked your -- your colleague? Supposing we're 

not in Massachusetts, but we're in another State that 

provided for an interlocutory appeal immediately after the 

judge's ruling in this case. Would -- would you have the 

same appraisal of the case on those facts?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Would we have the same 

appraisal as the State? We don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Would you still say it 

was not final, even though it was sufficiently final for 

appellate purposes?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. We -- we think that the 

Court's holding in Smalis applies equally to jury trials 

and to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory 

appeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be 

permissible. But we also think that there is a sound 

basis for drawing a distinction between --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question is assuming a 

State procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was 

permissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause

would bar that appeal. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, because we read that to 

be the holding of Smalis. 

But we think there's a basis for distinguishing 

between appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings 

before the initial tribunal on the other hand. First of 

all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v. 

Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of 

adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that 

case was permissible because it entailed continued 

proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an 

appeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically 

distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United 

States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate 

review. 

And the other basis for drawing a distinction 

between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the 

trial court on the other is historical tradition. I think 

the Court could look to history and history would show 

that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent 

authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because 

the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial 

courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of 

justice require trial courts to have the authority to 

revisit their mid-trial rulings.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you allow a 

trial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution 

to reopen the case?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Justice Kennedy, but 

it raises a distinct problem because one value that's 

served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's 

interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its 

evidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial 

judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the 

prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate 

that interest. 

Now, we still think that the proper line is jury 

discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would 

present a distinct interest. 

Now, with respect to historical tradition on 

appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the 

government has lacked authority at common law to take an 

appeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on 

that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United 

States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v. 

the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why 

the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the 

government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite 

narrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a 

distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court

and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the 

Court often looks at history to shape the contours of 

double jeopardy protections. And that would afford the 

case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while 

appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court 

reconsideration should be permitted. 

And I think the lens through which the Court 

would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the 

valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and 

fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while 

that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal, 

because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't 

exclude reconsiderations. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why doesn't the -- the 

prosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have 

a rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling 

on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not 

make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've 

done it, it sticks? Why -- why doesn't the prosecution 

have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule? 

Everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are 

going to be careful.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, we think a 

constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness 

of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects.

 First, the line between a definitive ruling and 

a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've 

outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a 

variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases 

where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on 

a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that 

ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which 

page of the transcript you happen to be looking at. 

But even if we're dealing with a situation in 

which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of 

the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court 

might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively 

but still be incorrect. Trial courts make mistakes. 

That's why this issue comes up as often as it does. For 

example, in this case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: All these cases -- we've 

had several, not too many over the -- the whole line of 

cases -- and the trial judge has always committed a rather 

plain error. And we all have the case where if you just 

try to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say 

no. A case just like this. The judge made a mistake, but 

we've always said that's not something we -- we look at.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't -- I'm not quite sure 

I'm following what you're saying, Justice Stevens, 

because --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I say as a typical matter 

these double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the 

judge made a rather plain error, and when you look at it 

later, you say, gee, he goofed. And so I'm not sure we 

should consider the plainness of the error or the fact 

that they -- they do mistakes because they do.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: But -- but I don't -- but the 

reason why the Court accepts errors in some situations is 

because there's some other value under the Double Jeopardy 

Clause. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: The value of finality is what 

is really at stake here. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's not just the value 

of finality. It's that, for example, if the judge makes 

an error and then the jury is discharged, it's the value 

that the defendant has in obtaining a result from the 

particular tribunal. In the circumstances of this case, 

where the trial judge can correct her error within the --

within a matter of minutes, at least in some situations, 

there would be no double jeopardy purpose served --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But here it was not a matter 

of minutes. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: In this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Here it was --

MR. SRINIVASAN: No. I acknowledge in this case

it wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. For 

example, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme 

Court, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the 

same scenario as this case, but the only distinction was 

that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling, 

the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a 

span of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize 

her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the 

charge. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it matter if the -- if 

the ruling is conveyed to the jury even though the jury 

isn't discharged?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would matter, Justice 

O'Connor, but I don't think it would necessarily preclude 

the prosecution from going forward on the charge under the 

Double Jeopardy Clause. The question would be one of due 

process and prejudice to the defendant. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You had three -- three reasons 

you were going to give Justice Souter. One is it's not 

clear always that it's definitive. The other is that 

trial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: And the third is -- it's an 

issue that you raised earlier, Justice Kennedy. It's that 

this case might look different as an atmospheric matter if 

the trial judge at the time she rendered her ruling had

said, I'm ruling in the defendant's favor, but I may 

reconsider this decision at a later point in the 

proceedings. Now, that might be seen to fall on the 

tentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect 

of this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of 

Massachusetts law. And we don't think there's a 

constitutionally significant distinction between a trial 

judge explicitly saying that a ruling can be reconsidered 

and State law saying that the ruling can be reconsidered. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't the distinction the 

right to rely?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- there -- there -- that 

would be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the 

right to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of 

claim and that could be handled in the way that trial 

courts typically handle claims by the defendant that 

they've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the 

trial court has subsequently reconsidered. 

It would be equally the case, for example, as 

the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling 

that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of 

evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the 

proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question 

would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in 

prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had

detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial 

determination. And we don't think that prejudice inquiry 

is meaningfully different when you're dealing with 

evidentiary rulings as when you're -- as when you're 

dealing with the reinstatement of a previously acquitted 

charge. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why shouldn't you have 

-- what's magic about the jury? Why shouldn't you have 

the same rule on a bench trial? A judge in a bench trial 

makes a ruling, thinks about it, and says, you know, I 

shouldn't have ruled that way. Why shouldn't that judge 

be able to change? Just because there's no jury to 

discharge. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would depend. If --

if the bench trial judge were making a mid-trial ruling, 

as -- as in this case, then the judge could change his or 

her mind. But if the bench trial judge were resolving the 

entire case and entered --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the line? I 

mean, is there -- there no point at which he can't change? 

I mean --

MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- the -- I think the 

Constitution would step in and impose a line at some 

point, and probably the best indicator is a rule --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not dismissal of the

jury. We'll have to make up some other line. Right?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It can't be discharge of the 

jury, but I think where the Court would look, first and 

foremost, in defining a line for bench trials, if the 

issue would ever arise, would be a ruling that would 

essentially have resulted in discharge of the jury if the 

trial were before a jury. And for example, the Federal 

Rules of Criminal Procedure --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But how do we -- how does 

Smalis fit into this discussion? I thought in Smalis in a 

bench trial, we said it was final. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: It was, Justice O'Connor, for 

purposes of an appeal, and that's why I think the critical 

distinction between Smalis and this case is that where the 

prosecution might not have authority to take an appeal 

from a ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your line would be something 

like if it -- if -- from all of the transcript, it appears 

that the judge is -- is giving consideration to the entire 

case or something like that in a bench trial.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: In a bench trial, that -- that 

would be part of the inquiry, Justice Kennedy, and I would 

also point, by the way, to -- can I just finish the 

thought, Justice Stevens? To Federal Rule of Criminal 

Procedure 32(k)(1), which says that when a bench trial --

when a judge sitting in a bench trial issues a ruling that 

finds a defendant not guilty, that ruling will discharge 

the defendant. And I think a discharge of the defendant 

would be one of critical consideration. 

Thank you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NATHANSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, may it please 

the Court:

 I'll try to be as brief as I can.

 The argument about inherent authority to 

reconsider an acquittal really has it backwards. Inherent 

authority bends to the Constitution. The Constitution 

does not bend to a judge's inherent authority. 

Second, the -- the Government is trying to 

substitute a standard here of a second proceeding, which 

is not this Court's standard. This Court's standard is 

further proceedings after an acquittal, including 

resumption of the same trial. That's what this Court said 

in Smalis. 

The Government is also trying to move this case 

into the particular tribunal analysis. That comes from 

cases that are mistrials. This is an acquittal. This is

not a particular tribunal case.

 As to the judge resolving all the issues in a 

bench trial and -- and that's why that -- that acquittal 

would be more final than a motion for a directed verdict, 

it was a motion for a directed verdict. It was a demurrer 

in Smalis. It was the exact same standard that the judge 

applied in that case. 

As to prejudice, prejudice has never been a 

factor in this Court's double jeopardy analysis. As a 

matter of fact, in -- in one of the really classical 

statements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of 

that case, that looks like complete gamesmanship. The 

defendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the 

-- the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine. He 

said, oh, I'll pay -- I'll pay the fine. It's a get-out-

of-jail-free card. There's complete gamesmanship, but 

prejudice was not a factor. And in fact, this Court has 

said prejudice is not open to judicial examination in 

double jeopardy cases. 

As to honing, in -- in fact, in Rumsey --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Honing?

 MR. NATHANSON: Honing. Not the name of a case, 

Your Honor. But whether or not the Government has honed 

its cased through -- and -- and they would say evidentiary 

honing. But it's not evidentiary honing. In Rumsey, it

was only argument that was presented at -- at the remand 

after acquittal.

 Justice Souter, I want to heartily endorse the 

-- the way you phrased what the rule should be, which is, 

trial judges, you ought to take this seriously. 

Pretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious 

matter. You cannot take it back. So think about it. Do 

it right the first time. 

As to -- to rule 25 itself, it's true that the 

-- the judges can't reserve. So what they do as -- as a 

matter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny, 

and -- and they deny the first one and they have two more 

opportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case 

and they have an opportunity at the close of -- after the 

jury has returned a verdict. At each of those steps, they 

can make a motion for acquittal.

 As to the full and fair opportunity, this Court 

said in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to 

try the case. They do not have a right to have it proceed 

to verdict. I'm just taking that straight from Martin 

Linen.

 As to, finally, whether or not State law sort of 

insulates this from Federal -- I see my time is up. Thank 

you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nathanson, thank you.
