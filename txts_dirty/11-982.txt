3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first today in Case 11-982, Already, LLC, d/b/a YUMS v. 

Nike. 

6  Mr. Dabney. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The Article III question in this case turns 

12 on resolution of two issues: First, whether loss of 

13 freedom to operate on the part of a direct competitor 

14 qualifies as Article III injury in fact; and, second, 

what party bears the burden of proof of facts that are 

16 contended by it to render a claim moot. 

17  The counterclaim in this case seeks to 

18 extinguish a source of cost, risk, and official 

19 restraint on what footwear products the Petitioner can 

and cannot legally sell. These are classic forms of 

21 injury in fact. 

22  On the burden of proof point, the proponent 

23 of a factual contention always bears the burden of 

24 proving this, and this is especially true when the 

question arises in the context of a claim that a 

3

Official 

1 voluntary act has allegedly ousted a Federal court of 

2 jurisdiction. 

3  Mootness doctrine protects a party seeking 

4 relief from the kind of evasive maneuvering that's 

happened in this case. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if I were to write 

7 an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here 

8 because distributors and retailers will see that there's 

9 been this suit against the -- your client and they will 

be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just 

11 make that up? Or is there something I can read to find 

12 out -- to find that out, or --

13  MR. DABNEY: Injury in fact is a question of 

14 fact, and injury in fact is based on evidence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the -- the evidence 

16 here was that they did need investors, and investors 

17 were reluctant. 

18  MR. DABNEY: That's correct. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It wasn't specific 

evidence, but then I -- anything besides that? 

21  MR. DABNEY: There are three forms of injury 

22 in this case. The first is that the Petitioner's cost 

23 of operation is increased because the disputed claim was 

24 not expunged. When the Petitioner designs and sells new 

products, it has to go through an incredibly costly 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 process to determine whether or not its next line of 

2 shoes might give rise to a plausible claim --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Is that -- is that 

4 in the record? 

MR. DABNEY: It certainly is. The 

6 Petitioner says, through its president, on page 173 of 

7 the Joint Appendix, that he's engaged in new --

8 development of new shoe lines, which by definition are 

9 outside the scope of the covenant document. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you said it's 

11 incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in 

12 the record? 

13  MR. DABNEY: That specific statement is not 

14 in the record. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it makes sense, 

16 but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice 

17 of the shoe business. I mean --

18  MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, I'm glad you 

19 brought that up because, under the mootness doctrine, 

the burden of proof on that and every other fact 

21 relevant to mootness fell on the Respondent. Under this 

22 Court's precedents, the Respondent in this case, in 

23 order to oust the district court of jurisdiction, had to 

24 show two things to a high degree of probability. The 

first thing the Respondent had to show is that it was

1 absolutely clear that the Petitioner could not 


2 reasonably be expected --


3  JUSTICE BREYER: You're right, that's the 


4 standard. And so you said that -- I mean, I feel 


perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is 

6 warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything 

7 here that you -- so you said, by definition, we're going 

8 to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do 

9 not have the appearance of any current and/or previous 

footwear product designs and any colorable imitations 

11 thereof. 

12  So I would like you to refer me to the 

13 record where your president of your client or somebody 

14 else says, we are intending to produce some new shoes 

that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will 

16 look at that, because your opponent says we can find no 

17 reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce 

18 anything or they have any present intent of showing --

19 of producing something that falls outside that 

definition. 

21  But now, you just said, oh, no, we're 

22 definitely going to. So just refer me to those pages in 

23 the record that shows that because, of course, you win, 

24 if that's true.

1 Joint Appendix, states that, "The Petitioner is" 

2 intending -- "is regularly engaged in the design of new 

3 footwear." 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that isn't the 

point. The point is, is the new footwear that you're 

6 designing footwear that is not -- does not have the 

7 appearance of any current or previous footwear product 

8 designs or any colorable imitation thereof? And so to 

9 say you are in the business of producing new footwear, 

at least, to me, suggests nothing because the question 

11 is what the footwear looks like, not that you're 

12 producing new footwear. 

13  MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, in the real world, 

14 a business competitor --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not interested in 

16 the real world. I am interested in the record. 

17  MR. DABNEY: The record does not show that 

18 the Petitioner lacks any concrete interest in entering 

19 the line of commerce that --

JUSTICE BREYER: And does it show anything 

21 at all in respect that would support the claim that you 

22 are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either 

23 resemble, nor is a colorable imitation of anything that 

24 you have previously produced or is the subject of the 

case?

Official 

1  MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, what the record 

2 shows -- and it is what it is -- is that the petitioner 

3 is actively engaged in designing and bringing out new 

4 footwear products and --

JUSTICE BREYER: Period? 

6  MR. DABNEY: Period. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So I take it that 

8 this case really boils down to should you have -- should 

9 they have or you both have another chance to say what 

the new footwear will be -- look like under a new 

11 standard, or is there enough here already to say, well, 

12 really, the judges could conclude that there is no real 

13 likelihood that you're going to produce something that 

14 won't look like what's already been produced. 

MR. DABNEY: We would respectfully submit 

16 that, when you apply the mootness doctrine, since we're 

17 not talking about picking a fight here, we're talking 

18 about someone who was sued once -- once bitten, twice 

19 shy -- that when someone has been sued for alleged 

infringement has asked for a judgment that would 

21 eliminate any need to think about whether or not a new 

22 shoe will attract --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and I assume that was 

24 your point, that you shouldn't be put through the 

trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you

1 produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or 

2 are not. You're at risk --

3  MR. DABNEY: Exactly. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right? 

MR. DABNEY: Exactly. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would think that you 

7 would add this as well, that, for a competitor to demand 

8 that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing, 

9 is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably 

quite injurious, in and of itself. 

11  MR. DABNEY: That would itself be --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, there's -- do 

13 I just know that because I'm a judge? Or is there 

14 someplace I can look for that? 

MR. DABNEY: The law is that, as I stand 

16 here today, the government has registered a claim that 

17 the Petitioner is duty-bound not to bring out the shoe 

18 shown in the registration, number one, which according 

19 to the Respondent is one of the best-selling, most 

profitable shoe styles of all time; and also, as I stand 

21 here today, the law is that Petitioner is at risk if it 

22 brings out a shoe that is going to be giving rise to a 

23 plausible claim --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Dabney, are you 

saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no

1 good, unless it says that you will never be sued for any 

2 shoe that you ever produce? Is -- are you saying that 

3 the covenant is no good or that this covenant is 

4 deficient? 

MR. DABNEY: I'm saying that the Respondent 

6 bore the burden of proving that the covenant completely 

7 and irrevocably eradicated all of that. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- if -- if you are 

9 uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you 

say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate 

11 protection, it should be amended, and then say what you 

12 think you need to be adequately covered? 

13  MR. DABNEY: Because the Petitioner asks for 

14 judgment in accordance with law, and it would prefer not 

to be the involuntary licensee of the Respondent that 

16 sued it. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, does that mean 

18 that, if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-à-vis 

19 your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is 

invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact 

21 duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with 

22 respect to this design; would that be enough for you?

1  MR. DABNEY: Not -- no --

2  JUDGE SOTOMAYOR: -- but why wouldn't that 

3 be --

4  MR. DABNEY: That's -- that's not actually 

right. The reason why -- 70 years ago, Learned Hand 

6 created the metaphor, "the scarecrow patent." And the 

7 reason scarecrows are effective is not because they are 

8 likely to climb down from the pole, but because, from a 

9 distance and being looked at quickly, the way people in 

the marketplace have to react to official government 

11 records of claims, they're deceptive. So --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You get a lot of 

13 what this extra stuff -- you know, that you say, well, 

14 even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me 

for that, there's all the collateral damage. You get a 

16 significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue. 

17 Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and 

18 right because, if they do, they will undermine their own 

19 trademark. 

MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, the -- the covenant 

21 actually reasserts the allegation that these shoes 

22 infringe. The covenant does nothing more than purport 

23 to waive --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it --

where does it do that?

1  MR. DABNEY: It says it right on the -- on 

2 page -- I believe it is 96 of -- of the record, where it 

3 says, in the second whereas, "the actions complained of 

4 no longer infringe or dilute at a level sufficient to 

warrant the substantial time and expense." I mean, it 

6 libels --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So if you 

8 take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or 

9 not? 

MR. DABNEY: There would be one small little 

11 less bit of injury in this case. That's --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess maybe 

13 this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking. 

14 You're -- you're a lawyer in this area. You want to 

write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the 

16 other side, but what does it say? Can you do that? Or 

17 do you have to say, the only way this case can be 

18 rendered moot is if the trademark is totally 

19 invalidated? 

MR. DABNEY: When someone seeks --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, that's kind 

22 of a yes or no answer. Can you write a covenant that 

23 says something other than the trademark is totally 

24 invalidated? 

MR. DABNEY: No.

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what you're saying is 

you --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying 

7 that, in this case, there's no way -- I mean, I thought 

8 it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties 

9 to grant covenants of this sort. You're saying this is 

unheard of, nobody -- nobody can do this? 

11  MR. DABNEY: The practice in this case dates 

12 to 1995. This is a totally recent, controversial 

13 practice that has never been embraced by this Court at 

14 all. In fact, it was articulated in a case two years 

after --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's not the question, 

17 Mr. Dabney. The question is: Is there any covenant 

18 that exists in the world that would make you feel 

19 secure? And I suppose I'm having a little bit of 

difficulty with the answer, with an answer that says, 

21 no, there is no covenant that you can write that would 

22 make us feel secure. 

23  MR. DABNEY: The -- the reason is, Your 

24 Honor, that the registration causes informational 

injury. And what the Respondent is trying to do is to

1 hang on to government action that disadvantages its 

2 competitor, while --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't know why --

4 my solution was that they would give you a covenant 

that I suggested as a possibility that would say, 

6 vis-à-vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this 

7 design, only vis-à-vis you. Why doesn't that protect 

8 you fully? Because what they're saying to you is, copy 

9 the design if you want, so long as you're not using 

another trademark. But that's not the issue. The issue 

11 is whether you're infringing this design. 

12  MR. DABNEY: The question the trademark 

13 practitioners get asked every day is whether something 

14 is available. And so long as that question is asked, a 

covenant that's in the file of a company is not going to 

16 prevent deception and confusion of people who look and 

17 say, oh, this is a protected design. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dabney, that's a 

19 different answer than the one you gave me when I asked 

the same question. You said because we don't want to be 

21 an involuntary licensee of Nike. 

22  MR. DABNEY: That is a second form of injury 

23 that we have now, as Justice Scalia pointed out. Right 

24 now, we cannot just ignore the claim and bring out

2 just explain to me -- you've given a name to this carte 

3 blanche that -- that Nike would give you. What is the 

4 significance of your being an involuntary licensee? 

It's not something that -- that you wear as a brand. I 

6 mean --

7  MR. DABNEY: What we've substituted is 

8 instead of getting a judgment in accordance with law 

9 that expunges the allegedly invalid 

government-registered claim of right to exclude 

11 competition and sale of goods in favor of the chance to 

12 litigate with our arch rival to see whether they will 

13 prove --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're going back to 

saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good. 

16  MR. DABNEY: A covenant that leaves the 

17 covenantor in possession of the unreviewed government 

18 benefit that it got --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: But that look -- I mean, 

maybe you could suggest to me that I -- that we should 

21 change what the law has been or not follow it here, but 

22 where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth. 

23  MR. DABNEY: Yes. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: And in Friends of the 

Earth, it says a defendant -- namely Nike -- claiming 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



 
Official 

1 its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're 

2 claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, 

3 moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the 

4 formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're 

5 quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear, 

6 correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely, 

7 their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of 

8 shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur. 

9  And they say, since we promised in an 

10 enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever --

11 100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur? 

12 How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in 

13 respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to 

14 recur, given our covenant? And your response to that 

15 is? 

16  MR. DABNEY: The claim the counterclaim 

17 seeks to extinguish is not simply the particular rights 

18 of action that they have covenanted not to exert. The 

19 claim that is sought to be extinguished is the much 

20 broader government-registered claim of right to exclude 

21 competition in the sale of shoes that embody that design.

3 Article III standing. 

4  MR. DABNEY: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking at what 

6 you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce 

7 particular shoes. People are considering investing in 

8 your company. Your opponent has intimidated retailers. 

9 If you brought a suit by yourself, is that sufficient to 

establish Article III standings? Are those the sort of 

11 concrete and tangible injuries that we've required? 

12  MR. DABNEY: I would say we have very 

13 distinct and concrete and palpable injury in that --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just because you 

plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can 

16 bring a lawsuit? 

17  MR. DABNEY: No. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Okay. Just 

19 because people are considering investing -- somebody who 

came in and said, I've got this company, people are 

21 thinking of investing in it, and therefore, you want to 

22 proceed with your lawsuit? 

23  MR. DABNEY: It is undeniable, by law, that 

24 the Petitioner's cost of operation -- the petitioner's 

Risk of operation is increased because of -­

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that surely 

2 would not establish Article III standings. Everybody's 

3 cost of operation is increased whenever there's any 

4 trademark at all because you have to check and see 

whether it violates a trademark. 

6  MR. DABNEY: Yes, but we're a direct 

7 competitor, which we say is currently subject to an 

8 unlawful restraint on our freedom to operate. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dabney, suppose there 

had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but 

11 you're in the shoe business and you're -- you're 

12 worried -- could you have brought a declaratory action 

13 or an action for an injunction to have the trademark 

14 declared invalid? 

MR. DABNEY: When our shoes were launched, 

16 it obviously never even occurred to the petitioner that 

17 they could be deemed an infringement of any rights of 

18 this respondent. So the answer is we were not injured 

19 at that point. But now, that we've been sued -- once 

bitten, twice shy -- we now have been told by the 

21 respondent that it claims a far-reaching claim of right 

22 to exclude competition in the sale of goods. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say you could not 

24 have brought a suit to -- to cancel? 

MR. DABNEY: The three-part test of

1 injury-in-fact is universally applicable. So we did not 

2 allege -- and I don't believe we had injury-in-fact when 

3 our shoes were launched. So, no, of course, there would 

4 not have been a suit that could be brought at that time. 

But since we're in a mootness case and we've been sued 

6 and we've been told and have all these defamatory 

7 allegations about and dragged our company's name through 

8 the mud, the situation is different, as Your Honor has 

9 said. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But if that's the case -- if 

11 the difference is that you've been sued, then it should 

12 be adequate protection, if you know that you won't be 

13 sued again. And that's why there's the question of what 

14 kind of covenant would give you adequate protection that 

you won't be sued again? 

16  MR. DABNEY: If the -- as I said before, if 

17 the only injury we were complaining about and trying to 

18 extinguish was the injury that flows from being sued 

19 again by this Respondent, then I suppose you could --

you could conceive of a covenant that would extinguish 

21 that injury. 

22  But in trademark registration practice, it 

23 has been routinely heard by Federal courts -- we cite 

24 two on page 8 of our reply brief -- that the kind of 

injury that Petitioner is complaining about in this case

you have to be stung once. So you can bring it as a 

6 counterclaim, as you did here, once there's an

8 not just walk into court and say, I want an injunction 

9 invalidating the trademark. 

MR. DABNEY: Well, let me clarify. The 

11 Petitioner totally agrees there has to be injury in fact 

12 in all cases. And so my answer to your question in this 

13 hypothetical question is we would have to allege 

14 adequate injury. And the -- the Chief Justice suggested 

that increased cost of capital might or might not 

16 qualify for injury in the -- in the initial standing 

17 case where --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I suggested it 

19 might not. 

MR. DABNEY: Might not. That's right. 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  MR. DABNEY: So we have increased cost of 

23 capital, increased costs of -- of design. And, of 

24 course, we have the legal burden and duty to refrain 

from making shoes now that would give rise to a

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, 

7  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

8  SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND 

9  MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  A trademark holder can moot a declaratory 

12 judgment action seeking to invalidate a trademark by 

13 offering the plaintiff a sufficiently broad covenant not 

14 to sue. Whether the covenant eliminates the controversy 

between the parties should be analyzed under the 

16 voluntary cessation doctrine. 

17  The analysis that the government is 

18 proposing is both a way of determining whether the 

19 covenant has eliminated any concrete dispute between the 

parties and also a framework for the parties to use to 

21 negotiate the appropriate scope of the covenant. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Anders, what --

23 there is a question about why a competitor should have 

24 to produce to its competition its future plans of 

development. I mean, the marketplace, especially in

1 fashion, importantly, likes to keep quiet what it's 

2 doing because what -- it doesn't want other imitators to 

3 beat it to the punch. 

4  So given that interest, why isn't their 

claim that they're being inhibited because of the 

6 requirement to produce their products -- or their 

7 intended products -- enough to establish injury in this 

8 case? 

9  MS. ANDERS: Well, once the -- once the 

defendant offers the covenant, then the question becomes 

11 whether there is anything that the plaintiff is 

12 intending to do, its current activities or its -- its 

13 concrete plans for anticipated activities that would 

14 fall outside the covenant and potentially be infringing. 

Because if those activities exist, then the covenant has 

16 not --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then what did --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could we say there is just 

19 a presumption, that, if you're in the business, that you 

probably are interested in future design, period? 

21  MS. ANDERS: I don't think that -- I don't 

22 think that presumption would establish a concrete 

23 interest. The question here is whether --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Wouldn't establish a --

MS. ANDERS: It would not establish that the

1 plaintiff has a concrete interest. The question is 

2 whether the dispute between the parties is reasonably 

3 likely to recur. And if the plaintiff cannot point to 

4 anything that it's currently doing or that it's planning 

to do --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read this affidavit as 

7 saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make 

8 new shoes regularly, we want to copy their shoe, we 

9 don't think it's protected by trademark, we want to copy 

it -- they don't say -- and that's something on rebuttal 

11 that maybe Petitioner will explain -- that we want to 

12 copy it exactly. But what they're saying is, we want to 

13 copy it because it's a free form. That's really what I 

14 read their affidavit as saying. 

So if -- why do they have to actually -- do 

16 they have to produce their design to prove they're doing 

17 that? 

18  MS. ANDERS: I think what they have to do is 

19 they have to state that they intend to make products 

that may be outside the covenant. And now --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But saying it is enough? 

22 That's what I thought their affidavit said, and I 

23 thought the court below said, no, you've got to show us 

24 the product. 

MS. ANDERS: I think the -- the affidavit

1 says that they intend to produce new shoes as a general 

2 matter. It doesn't tell us what those shoes may be, 

3 whether they -- it doesn't give us a way of knowing 

4 whether they might fall outside the covenant. 

And I --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please, now go back to 

7 my question. Is it enough to just say it? Or do they 

8 have to produce the designs, so that the Court and Nike 

9 can decide -- it is Nike, right? -- the Court and Nike 

can decide whether the shoe is a colorable imitation or 

11 an exact copy. 

12  MS. ANDERS: I think that could depend on 

13 the breadth of the covenant. I think, in some cases, 

14 for instance, if the covenant doesn't cover any future 

products, it may be enough for the plaintiff to credibly 

16 allege, we intend to make future products that aren't 

17 covered. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I agree with you. 

19  MS. ANDERS: So I also think that it may 

depend -- the less far along a party's plans are to make 

21 its shoes, the easier it will be for the defendant to 

22 say, it is speculative that your plans will actually 

23 mature into something that doesn't --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Anders, take this 

case, where Already says -- you know, we're not really

1 going to say anything particular. We're just going to 

2 say that we're in the business of making shoes, and we 

3 might make a shoe. Would that -- would that -- that 

4 would not be enough under your standard; is that 

correct? 

6  MS. ANDERS: I think that's right. I think 

7 if the parties went back on remand in this case -- and 

8 we do think there should be a remand here -- but if the 

9 parties went back and we had the exact same facts, and 

Nike said that anything that was a colorable imitation 

11 of Already's shoes was covered by the covenant, and 

12 Already came back and said, just generally, we're making 

13 new shoes, I think, in that situation, it would be 

14 relatively easy for Nike to show that the possibility 

that Already would be impacted by the covenant -- or 

16 impacted by the trademark, I'm sorry -- would be 

17 speculative. 

18  So that --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Given what Already has said 

in this case, why is it that you think that we should 

21 remand? I mean, it sounds as though we're remanding for 

22 no purpose, given what Already has said throughout the 

23 course of the litigation and, indeed, in this Court 

24 today. 

MS. ANDERS: I think there are two reasons. 

25
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 The first is that, when this Court establishes a new 


2 standard, it often -- it traditionally will remand to 


3 allow the courts -- the lower courts to apply that 


4 standard in the first instance. 


And the second is that there was some 

6 uncertainty about what the covenant meant below. So 

7 Nike represented that the covenant covered the existing 

8 shoes, and Already said, in its motion to dismiss 

9 briefing, that it thought that the covenant did not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But its future -- its 

11 future shoes are clearly -- and I thought the counsel 

12 for the Petitioner might have -- might have added this 

13 in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future 

14 shoes are not covered by this. And the -- if -- if Nike 

has the heavy burden of proof, can it have discovery and 

16 take depositions on what their plans are, what their 

17 marketing plans are, what designs they're thinking 

18 about? 

19  MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way 

for Nike to try to establish that -- that the dispute is 

21 not reasonably likely to recur. It could get discovery 

22 into --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then -- so then the 

24 covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no 

other manufacturer has.

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you mean any 

4 manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask 

Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you 

6 thinking about? 

7  MS. ANDERS: Well, once Already produces --

8 once Already identifies what its future activities may 

9 be -- and, again --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why should Already 

11 have to do that to anybody? 

12  MS. ANDERS: Well, we think it makes sense 

13 for Already to have to -- have to at least identify here 

14 what activities it thinks may not be outside the 

covenant. And I don't think that hurts Already, and the 

16 reason is that if -- if Already's evidence convinces the 

17 court that the case isn't moot, then Already gets its 

18 adjudication on the related --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Nike has an advantage 

over Already that no other manufacturers had. It can 

21 demand what its future plans are. 

22  MS. ANDERS: Well, it will get -- the 

23 trademark will be -- will be adjudicated if -- if 

24 Already convinces the Court the action isn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just ask one

1 question on that, and it's a little bit off of what 

2 we've been talking about. You say, in your brief, well, 

3 now, don't worry, what you can do is you can go to the 

4 trademark -- the PTO board, and they'll -- they'll 

adjudicate this mark. And so -- you know, you can 

6 really go out of the courts and go to the 

7 administrators. 

8  Suppose Already goes to the administrative 

9 agency and loses. Can it have judicial review? And is 

there -- is standing easier to show, once there has been 

11 an adverse action in the administrative office? Or are 

12 we right back where we started? So once you go to the 

13 agency and you try to appeal, the Court says, well, this 

14 is an Article III court, we need a case of controversy, 

and you're right back where we are now? 

16  MS. ANDERS: Well, a couple of points on 

17 that. The first is that we are not proposing that the 

18 Court should dismiss discretionarily every action just 

19 because the TTAB exists and can adjudicate --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was a big part of 

21 your argument. You were telling us, oh, don't worry, 

22 you can always go to the patent level. 

23  MS. ANDERS: What we're proposing here is 

24 that, as a function of the Court's broader discretion 

under the Declaratory Judgment Act and United States v.

1 W. T. Grant, is that when the Court believes that it 

2 probably does -- does have jurisdiction but it doesn't 

3 think that the likelihood of a dispute is -- is really 

4 that great, that in that situation, it can 

discretionarily dismiss. 

6  So that would be a situation in which there 

7 is Article III --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. My -- my question is: 

9 Is the Article III requirement that Already has the same 

in this case as it would be if they sought judicial 

11 review from an adverse order of the administrative 

12 agency? 

13  MS. ANDERS: The administrative agency's 

14 standing rules are broader than Article III, so it 

would -- it is easier to get --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about going to 

17 court. 

18  MS. ANDERS: And so once it goes to court, 

19 there may be rare cases in which Already, as the party 

that lost, if it isn't injured in fact by the TTAB's 

21 decision itself, that it would not have the necessary 

22 Article III injury to seek judicial review. That 

23 hasn't -- to our knowledge, that has not occurred, but 

24 it is possible that that could happen because 15 U.S.C. 

1064 makes the TTAB standing requirements broader than

1 in Article III. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, you did say, 

3 if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as 

4 the preferred form for cancellation proceedings. The --

the statute sets up the PTO proceeding, but it also 


6 allows the claim to be brought in -- in court. So 


7 what -- what shows that Congress meant these claims to 


8 be -- to go to the agency in preference to the court? 


9  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think Congress didn't 


set it up as an exhaustion requirement, so I don't think 

11 it's preferred for all of these claims to go to the TTAB. 

12 But the TTAB is the expert body that -- that adjudicates 

13 cancellation of validity issues all the time. So we think 

14 there could be circumstances in which it would be 

particularly appropriate for a district court to consider 

16 the existence of the TTAB proceeding. 

17  For instance, if there's a related 

18 proceeding pending before the TTAB or there's a 

19 concurrent proceeding, something like that, we think it 

would make sense for the district court in considering 

21 whether to dismiss the action to take that into account. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

23 answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that 

24 the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you 

is an additional injury in fact that gives you Article

3  MS. ANDERS: I think there could be some 

4 circumstances in which the TTAB's decision would create 

injury in fact if it said something about the scope of 

6 the trademark, something like that. So there could be 

7 situations in which 1071 would then allow the losing 

8 party to get judicial review.

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

13  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you 

14 very much, may it please the Court: 

You will want to have available to you the 

16 cert petition and the small volume of the Joint 

17 Appendix. 

18  In our submission, the Court needs to adopt 

19 a rule that has balance to it, and that is there -- it 

has to be possible to resolve one of these cases through 

21 a covenant not to sue of appropriate breadth, but it 

22 also has to be the case that a covenant not to sue can't 

23 just always eliminate the other side's injury. And so 

24 it's going to depend on the covenant and it's going to 

depend on what the other side says about its plans. 

31

1  And our point in this case is that you 

2 should adopt the following rule: And that is, if you 

3 have a covenant not to sue and it covers everything that 

4 the other side alleges an intent to produce, then there 

is no more injury. If it doesn't cover that, then there 

6 may well be injury. 

7  And our point --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you deal with the 

9 point that's been discussed with your adversary, they 

have to show you everything they intend to produce? 

11 What entitles you to that showing? 

12  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely. So one thing 

13 that's very important to recognize -- two things about 

14 trademark practice. First is that, in all of these 

cases -- remember, most of the time the question of 

16 trademark or patent validity will just be a suit for 

17 invalidity. It might be a counterclaim. This happens 

18 all the time. 

19  And in all of these cases, including this 

case, there is a protective order, and there is one in 

21 this case. And the protective order says that a party 

22 can designate its material, so that it's lawyers' eyes 

23 only, and so that no businessperson from the other side 

24 is entitled to see it. 

So that, Justice Kennedy, with respect, it's

1 actually not true that this is an unusual situation or 

2 that we would get some special advantage. 

3  In every single patent or trademark 

4 invalidity case, after this Court's decision in 

MedImmune, the party alleging invalidity, in order to 

6 show its standing, has to say, we intend to make a 

7 product that is regarded as potentially infringing. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if they simply 

9 said --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you have the 

12 trademark, we think it's invalid, we want to copy your 

13 shoe? We want to copy just the form of your shoe 

14 because that's what the trademark involves. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And once we have the 

17 invalidity, that's what we're going to do. 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that be enough of 

a showing? We don't have plans right now because your 

21 trademark stopped us from having the plans, but the 

22 minute your trademark is -- isn't validated, for sure, 

23 we're going to do it because it's going to mean great

1 question is going to be yes, but it has two parts to it. 

2 The first is -- because I really want to focus on 

3 precisely what you said. You said first, what did they 

4 simply say? 

Now, if they were to simply say it, there 

6 could be a factual inquiry into whether they're telling 

7 the truth or not. We could debate -- we could have a 

8 fight about the actual evidence. But let's assume they 

9 could prove it, and that is, the district judge was told 

by Already, or whatever other competitor, we want to 

11 make a counterfeit. 

12  In that case, unquestionably --

13 unquestionably -- there would be a continuing Article 

14 III injury. And let's then go to your understanding of 

what the declaration in this case actually says. 

16  So, first, let me start with how the case 

17 came to you, and that is the court of appeals, what it 

18 understood the record -- and the district court 

19 understood the record to be, and that is going to be in 

the petition appendix at page --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, how the 

22 case came to us -- how this case originated was a 

23 counterclaim. 

24  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at the time the

1 counterclaim was asserted, there was certainly Article 

2 III jurisdiction over the counterclaim, right? 

3  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's absolutely right. 

4 And we accept, for present purposes, that there is going 

to be a reduced requirement under the voluntary 

6 cessation doctrine. We briefed why we don't think 

7 that's true, but I assume, for the purposes of these 

8 answers, that the Court is going to apply the heightened 

9 burden on us to show that the case is over. 

And we believe that we showed beyond 

11 peradventure -- that we really resolved this case, when 

12 we didn't just dismiss our claim with prejudice, but we 

13 affirmatively granted them a covenant not to sue that 

14 covered not only their existing products. But, Justice 

Kennedy, their future products -- and I'm glad to take you 

16 to the language of the covenant -- because they are the 

17 colorable imitations of their current products. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you that this covenant 

19 covers an exact copy of your shoe? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It does not. And if the 

21 other side had said, in the district court, we have an 

22 intention -- and this is Justice Sotomayor's point -- we 

23 have an intention, we have a desire to make a copy of 

24 your shoe, then there would be a case or controversy.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is -- is the 

2 Petitioner -- do you anticipate that the Petitioner will 

3 agree with you, that this covers future products? 

4  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, because although the 

cert petition says that it doesn't, we have quite 

6 stridently pointed out, in our briefing, that that was 

7 completely inaccurate. And I'll just -- let's go to the 

8 covenant. I don't think this is really that hard or 

9 that controversial. 

So if we go to the Joint Appendix, at pages 

11 96 to 97, and so -- and -- and I remind you that the --

12 the question presented is -- is exactly what you're 

13 saying, Justice Kennedy. I'll read it, so you don't 

14 have to turn back to the cert petition. 

And its premise was that the registrant 

16 promises not to assert its mark against the party's then 

17 existing commercial activities. So now, I'm in the 

18 covenant itself, on page 97A, and this is what we 

19 promised not to sue them about. 

We have -- we have promised not to sue them, 

21 and I'm five lines down from the top, on account of any 

22 possible action based on or involving trademark 

23 infringement, unfair competition or dilution, under 

24 state or Federal law, based on the appearance of 

Already's current -- okay, that's not future -- or

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The colorful 

4 imitations -- colorable --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Colorable. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The colorable imitations 

7 are colorable imitations of their shoe? 

8  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't promised to 

not sue them over colorable imitations of your shoe? 

11  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That are not colorable 

12 imitations of --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have two 

14 categories. You have current and previous, as to which 

the covenant runs to everything. Then you have what you 

16 say is future, and that has to be a colorable imitation. 

17  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it -- so it -- so it 

19 does cover some future designs. And they're correct 

about that, and you're incorrect. 

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I -- I may 

22 have confused things. This is the situation with the 

23 covenant: Our covenant not to sue covers everything 

24 they have made in the past, everything they were making 

at the time and every future product of theirs that is a

1 colorable imitation. 

2  Our point is not that it covers every future 

3 shoe of theirs. We're on the same page in that respect. 

4 You are absolutely right, Justice Kennedy, that there 

are shoes that they could make in the future that would 

6 not be covered by the covenant. There could be an 

7 injury about that. 

8  And so my point about the record in the case 

9 and how the case was developed and how we might have 

modified the covenant, if they had told us anything, 

11 suggesting -- suggested anything outside the covenant 

12 they might want to make, is let's look at what they 

13 actually told the district court and the court of 

14 appeals about what their intentions were. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's -- so it's a 

16 question of -- of deficiency in their pleading. Suppose 

17 they amended that counterclaim and said, as soon as we 

18 are able, we want to do a counterfeit. 

19  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. It is not a deficiency 

in the pleading. It's a deficiency in the proof. So my 

21 point about this -- it's very important for the Court to 

22 understand that this case was not dismissed just on the 

23 pleadings. It wasn't just an insufficiency in their 

24 allegation. 

And they said, well, actually, we have more

14 love to return to what actually happened. But in that 

hypothetical, what would happen is that our motion to 

16 dismiss would be denied, unless and until we could prove 

17 that what they were saying wasn't true because it is 

18 absolutely the case -- and it is a strong point in our 

19 favor -- that you can't evade an attempt to invalidate 

your trademark through a covenant not to sue because you 

21 can't give a covenant not to sue over a counterfeit 

22 because you are in real risk of being deemed to have 

23 abandoned the mark because you're just --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Why? I know you 

said that in your brief, but if you give it -- yes, if

1 you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it, 


2 but this covenant would give it to only one 


3 manufacturer. 


4  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why would you 

6 abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount 

7 to abandonment of your mark? 

8  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. It is not a settled 

9 question in the law. There is no case that has 

considered this question. What a party claiming 

11 abandonment would say is that we would have licensed 

12 Already then to increase its production and its 

13 distribution. 

14  But even if one didn't agree with that, 

Justice Ginsburg, my point would be this: And that is 

16 you can't continually evade an attempt to invalidate 

17 your mark because, certainly, the agree -- we would 

18 agree that if you give a second one of these things out 

19 or the third one, you would be abandoning the mark. I 

have some actual facts for you about this, and that --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: What is it -- I would like 

22 to know. I mean, I assume you ask them, do you have any 

23 current or future plan to produce a shoe that would

19 go back to Justice Breyer's question and answer that? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes. So page 173 --

21 because there is a record here. You -- you don't have 

22 to hypothesize. This was all on the table in the 

23 district court. We said, they have no intention, no 

24 desire, no nothing, to make something that is not 

unambiguously covered by the covenant.

2 passing, that if they said something to the contrary, we 

3 would have modified the covenant. So here's what they 

4 said -- and I -- it would take a lot of your time for me 

to read all seven paragraphs on page 173, but they 

6 don't --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. You don't have to 

8 read to us. 

9  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So these paragraphs 

do not say -- they do not suggest, they do not imply --

11 even between the lines -- an intention to make something 

12 that is outside the covenant. They just don't. And 

13 that's --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: What they say is that they 

changed this at the rate of a mile a minute -- you know, 

16 they have -- they have stuff they put out, and we have 

17 the YUMS and the Sweet -- whatever it is and the Jelly 

18 Bean and so forth, and we keep changing it. 

19  And so I don't know. I mean, it doesn't 

seem clear, one way or the other. If it is -- if I come 

21 to that conclusion, is it the case -- I thought perhaps, 

22 in looking at this, that the line I quoted -- remember, 

23 which puts a lot of burden on you, from Friends of the

2 I have two answers for you.  Number one is going -- the 

3 first one is going to be about the facts of the case, 

4 and the second is just going to be jurisprudential. The 

first one is what more could one imagine in such an 

6 opinion that you would ask Nike to do on a remand? 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: I would ask Nike, I 

8 suppose, Nike could say -- you know, I read the page 73 

9 and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and 

we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean, and they're sort of 

11 like our shoe, but we didn't think enough, but you did 

12 think enough, and are some of these changes that could 

13 happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to 

14 think -- you know, that they won't look really colorably 

even like what you just did, but nonetheless, is a 

16 pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our 

17 present trademark. 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: That's a long question, I 

don't know if I'll get a good answer. 

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I hope you'll get a 

22 good answer. The -- my point is this, Justice Breyer: 

23 what you've just said on remand, what we would do is ask 

24 a question. We wouldn't try to prove and anything. My 

point is this: Already has told the district court, the 

46
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 court of appeals, and this Court everything that it 

2 wants to say about its intentions. 

3  It has had every opportunity in every court 

4 to have its lawyers simply say, Justice Sotomayor, this 

is not an accident. The reason they are not saying that 

6 they want to make a covenant of the -- a copy of the Air 

7 Force 1 is that they don't want to make a copy of the 

8 Air Force 1. There is no reason in the world to send 

9 this back to give -- ask Already, again, the question 

that has been asked in three separate courts. 

11  I said I had a jurisprudential --

12 jurisprudential answer to you as well, and that is the 

13 case was presented to you as presenting a question of 

14 law, and that is, can you have a covenant not to sue 

that will end a case like this? 

16  And if you tell the lower courts, we don't 

17 know, you are doing, I think, not as much of a service 

18 to the development of the law as you could. It is a 

19 much more sound approach, we think, to say Already had 

the chance to build its record --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, can you 

22 inform us of when this practice of the unilateral 

23 covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim, 

24 when -- how long has it been around? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is still -- it has been 

47
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 around for at least 20 years. It is still not very 

2 common for the very important reason that trademark 

3 owners know that, if they hand these things out, they 

4 are at risk of having their mark invalidated; and 

second, they know that it doesn't avoid a -- a 

6 determination of the validity of the mark because a 

7 party like Already can always go to the Federal agency, 

8 the TTAB. 

9  So I said I have some actual facts. And the 

facts are these: Although Nike has a broad trademark 

11 portfolio, it has only, once in its history, issued a 

12 covenant not to sue. It is in this case. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's because it usually 

14 sues. Page -- page 114 of the Joint Appendix says, 

"Your Honor, over the past eight months, Nike has 

16 cleared out the worst offending infringers. Now, 

17 Already remains as one of the last few companies that 

18 was identified on that top ten list of infringers." 

19  I mean, that -- that's your company's 

policy. That's your attorney, I take it. 

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- Justice Kennedy, we do 

22 enforce our trademarks. You say we usually sue. I will 

23 tell you that we have filed six trade dress actions in 

24 the company's history. 

Now, you had said, because I think it's the

Official 

1 other side's -- the impression the other side has given, 

2 that we are getting a special advantage over them. I 

3 think it's really important to recognize, for purposes 

4 of standing doctrine and mootness doctrine, that of all 

the shoe manufacturers in the country, the one that is 

6 least likely to be injured by this trademark -- there is 

7 only one. 

8  And it is Already because they are the only 

9 company in the entire world that has a promise that's 

substantial not to be sued under this trademark. We are 

11 the one -- they are the ones that are least likely to 

12 come into conflict with Nike. Now, they --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's because 

14 you gave them the covenant after you sued them. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, that's right, but 

16 we did give them the covenant. That's my point. After 

17 the covenant -- we didn't merely withdraw the case. I 

18 have one other piece of fact. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what -- what's the 

consideration -- I used to teach contract law. This 

21 is -- you know, you can just give a covenant like that? 

22  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, we're judicially 

23 estopped. It's not a contract. We are estopped, and 

24 they have -- the district court acted in reliance on it, 

construed it, and so we are bound by it. It's not a 

49

1 contract. 

2  I did have one other fact for you, because 

3 the other side has given you this impression that, once 

4 bitten, twice shy; that if you are sued once for a 

trademark -- they have a special fear that they're in 

6 the cross-hairs, that we're watching everything that 

7 they do. So when they made this argument --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They are on the top ten 

9 list of infringers. 

(Laughter.) 

11  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. They are on the top 

12 ten list of infringers. But after that -- after that 

13 they, and they alone, got a covenant not to be sued, 

14 under the -- they are the -- they are in the specially 

protected position, not a specially disadvantaged 

16 position. 

17  I did, however -- when they made this 

18 argument in the reply brief -- tried to figure out if 

19 that is true. Is it actually the case that a person who 

is sued once has a legitimate worry that they will 

21 actually be sued again? 

22  So you should lower the -- the mootness or 

23 standing bar still further. So we looked at every 

24 single trademark action between 2000 -- January 1, 2000, 

and December 31, 2004, all of them. There were 593.

1 And over the next eight years, we tried to figure out 


2 how many times did the plaintiff sue the defendant 


3 again. It happened six times, so --


4  JUSTICE BREYER: I see that. But I thought 


your response to Justice Kennedy was a different one. I 

6 liked it because it was that -- the concern that Nike 

7 can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but 

8 it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a 

9 trademark infringement case because that manufacturer 

has to show he is now making the product; or, if not, he 

11 intends to. And if it's a question of intends to, then 

12 the defendant can go and look and see if that's true. 

13  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: And your response, I took 

it, to that was there are procedures that deal with 

16 that. They're called protective orders and so forth. 

17 Is that -- have I got that right with your argument? 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: You could not -- you could 

19 not be more right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what your argument 

21 is, yes. 

22  MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's also the truth that --

23 that it is what happens in every single patent and 

24 trademark invalidity case. If you believe that gives rise 

to Article III injury, then every party has standing to

1 challenge every competitor. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, what about 

3 Federal Rule 41(a)(2)? It says, if the defendant has 

4 pleaded a counterclaim -- and you have recognized that 

there was Article III jurisdiction over that 

6 counterclaim -- the case may be dismissed on the 

7 plaintiff's request over the defendant's objection, only 

8 if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent 

9 adjudication. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So on the face of it, it 

12 seems that this -- that that rule fits this case to a T; 

13 that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn, 

14 defendant objects, and the question is can the 

counterclaim remain pending for independent 

16 adjudication. 

17  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I think the reason 

18 they did not pursue the Rule 41 argument in this Court 

19 and abandoned it is that it's completely understood 

that, if the party that's instituting the claim says I'm 

21 not going to pursue my case at all, there simply is no 

22 Article III jurisdiction. And so even without a Rule 41 

23 dismissal, there is no case or controversy remaining in 

24 the case.

4 They're happy to have our claims gone. And you can't 

say, we'll take the dismissal of the -- sorry -- the 

6 plaintiff's claim, but want to have the counterclaim 

7 remaining. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you referred, just 

9 in a fleeting way, to the fact that they can go to the 

PTO and to the board? 

11  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my question, 

13 and I wasn't -- it was probably my fault --

14  MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I understand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I didn't quite 

16 understand the government's petition. Is the standing 

17 burden any less after there is a -- an administrative 

18 adjudication and you go to court for judicial review? 

19  MR. GOLDSTEIN: The Chief Justice suggested 

an argument that could be made. It is an argument that 

21 we disagree with. We've looked at the cases. We think 

22 that it's a point in their favor, Justice Kennedy, that, 

23 while you can go to the TTAB, they wouldn't be able to 

24 appeal to an Article III court. I think that's a point 

in their favor. 

53

1  A point in our favor, however, is this 

2 notion of scarecrow trademarks hanging out there on the 

3 fields is inaccurate because of the ability to go to the 

4 TTAB in the first instance; they're experts. And 

second, remember what I said to Justice Sotomayor, 

6 anybody in this market can say we want to counterfeit 

7 the Air Force 1 -- we just want to make a copy of it, 

8 it's not complicated -- and they will have the right to 

9 bring a claim to invalidate the mark. So we can't leave 

the trademark hanging out there. 

11  I have kept trying to come back -- and if I 

12 could, in my remaining time, to the understanding of the 

13 lower courts about the record because I said, Justice 

14 Breyer, I think it would be much better for you to 

resolve the case because they had the opportunity to 

16 build a record, the case came to you on two courts' 

17 understanding of the record, and so if I could take you 

18 back to 14(a) and 15(a) of the petition appendix? 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I interject just one 

thing that I would like you to clarify? Justice Breyer 

21 started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of 

22 the Earth. Do you agree? Because, as I recall, your 

23 brief doesn't -- doesn't even cite Friends of the Earth. 

24  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's not correct, Justice

1 Court's decision in Deakins, that this a voluntary 

2 cessation case, but we accept for present purposes, so 

3 you don't think I'm fighting the hypothetical. 

4  Assuming that voluntary cessation principles 

apply, here's how they apply: When you not just dismiss 

6 the case, but you grant the covenant not to sue, and the 

7 covenant not to sue says, I won't sue you over what 

8 you're doing now or anything that I can imagine you 

9 doing in the future because you haven't told me anything 

else, then you have ensured that the controversy can't 

11 arise again, and you've met the Voluntary Cessation 

12 Doctrine. 

13  If, on the other hand, the other side comes 

14 forward with a declaration from an officer or some other 

form of proof that says, no, I'm worried I might do 

16 something outside the covenant, I would definitely want 

17 to make a counterfeit, then the case is going to go on. 

18  But this case is not that hypothetical case. 

19 On 14(a), the first full paragraph, seven lines from the 

bottom, "Given the similarity of YUMS' designs to the 

21 '905 mark and the breadth of the covenant, it is hard to 

22 imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe the 

23 '905 mark and yet not fall under the covenant. YUMS has 

24 not asserted any intention to market any such shoe." 

And then in footnote 5, on 15(a), "Given the

1 absence of record evidence that YUMS intends to make any 

2 arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously 

3 covered by the covenant, this hypothetical possibility 

4 does not create a definite and concrete dispute." 

That's how the case should be resolved. You 

6 should say, yes, there can be other cases where the 

7 covenant is too narrow; yes, there can be other cases 

8 where someone does allege a desire to make a 

9 counterfeit. Those are different cases. But do not, I 

suggest to you, remand when the facts have already been 

11 developed in this case. 

12  If we lose on this record, we lose on this 

13 record. But if we win on this record, we win on it 

14 because the record has been built in this case and it is 

settled. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are saying that 

17 you've met -- if we decide you bear the burden of proof,

the -- the affidavits in this case were prepared about 

11 five weeks after this completely unexpected development 

12 in the middle of a hard-pressed litigation was made. 

13  And the position that the Petitioner made to 

14 the district court was there is obviously subject matter 

jurisdiction here, not just because of the Rule 41 

16 point, but that you can't say, well, we have a case that 

17 raises these three issues. You could, say, enter a 

18 single judgment right now, the plaintiff's claims are 

19 waived because they've waived them, the trademark is 

invalid, and the registration was unlawfully issued and 

21 should be granted. 

22  Courts issue judgments on the basis of 

23 alternative holdings all the time. And the only reason

1 one issue in isolation, and then the other thing came up 

2 separately. So we said, we think there's a case right 

3 now, but if you doubt it, we request leave to amend our 

4 counterclaim to assert claims for invalid procurement of 

registration and other things that could have been 

6 asserted. 

7  So the -- the state of the record reflects 

8 the -- the suddenness with which the -- the plaintiff 

9 most unexpectedly did what it now says, in public, it's 

never done before and dropped its claim so unexpectedly 

11 in the case. 

12  So there's no question, but that if -- if it 

13 turns out that it's not enough to say that we're 

14 actively engaged, and we want to do all of the things 

any person in a normal position would want to do, and we 

16 have a concrete interest, the -- the defendant can 

17 certainly allege more than what it has been alleged. 

18 The -- the --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His challenge, you said 

you had the chance in three different courts to say 

21 directly and unequivocally, if the mark is invalid, 

22 we're going to imitate, and you haven't been willing to 

23 do that. You --

been trying now for two and a half years to establish

1 its right to do that. It was not our understanding 

2 that, under the law, as it stood, that the -- in 

3 addition to staying we have an enormous commercial 

4 interest in doing this, and we are seeking the right to 

do this since --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's your commercial 

7 interest? 

8  MR. DABNEY: The commercial interest is to 

9 partake of this very large and lucrative business that 

the Respondent's evidence shows in this case. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you willing to 

12 make the statement he's asked you for? You keep 

13 equivocating on the answer. 

14  I -- you know, it's like I don't want to say 

it, is what you're telling us. 

16  MR. DABNEY: I -- I think it is -- first of 

17 all, the -- the Petitioner, up until now, has said what 

18 he said. I could stand here and say I believe that, if 

19 the registration were cancelled, it is highly likely 

that the Petitioner would bring out a YUMS shoe. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, look, how are 

22 you hurt then? Because suppose he wins here. Now, you, 

23 if you have the president of the company say, hey, I'm 

24 going to do an exact copy, go bring a -- go bring a 

cancellation action.

1  If you can't quite say that -- you know, you 

2 can start one -- you can't quite say that, but he says 

3 something sort of vague about it that's close, go to the 

4 PTO. And if he can't say anything like that at all, 

well, then, maybe you should lose. I mean, that's --

6 that's -- what's the practical problem with that? 

7  MR. DABNEY: The practical problem here is 

8 that, in the procedural posture of this case, which is 

9 analogous to a summary judgment situation, all 

inferences, all reasonable inferences need to be drawn 

11 in favor of the nonmoving party. The suggestion that we 

12 had the opportunity to develop the record is completely 

13 incorrect. 

14  There wasn't even oral argument on this 

motion. The district court never gave us any 

16 opportunity to put in evidence, other than to come in 

17 and say, we have what we believe is a basis for 

18 jurisdiction now, Rule 41(a)(2) precludes you from 

19 dismissing our counterclaim, but if you think what we've 

alleged now is not enough, we request leave to amend our 

21 pleading. 

22  So to force us to start all over again in a 

23 new suit is -- would be fundamentally unfair to the 

24 Petitioner. And what we're seeking here is simply 

judicial review.
