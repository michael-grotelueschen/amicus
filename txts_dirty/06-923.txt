3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first today in Case 06-923, Metropolitan Life Insurance 

versus Glenn. 

6  Miss Posner. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY K. POSNER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MS. POSNER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court: 

11  For two reasons, the Sixth Circuit was wrong 

12 to hold that a company that is an ERISA claim fiduciary 

13 and that separately funds the plan's liabilities must 

14 always be deemed to be operating under a conflict of 

interest that changes the employer's designated 

16 arbitrary and capricious standard of review under its 

17 plan document. And the first reason is one that we're 

18 on common ground with and that is, as this Court 

19 recognized in Pegram v. Herdrich, ERISA explicitly 

authorizes companies like MetLife to fulfill both 

21 fiduciary and nonfiduciary functions as long as it does 

22 not in actuality commingle those functions. The mere 

23 fact that the potentiality of conflict is inherent in 

24 all of these commonplace dual arrangements in ERISA 

welfare benefit plans is not enough on its own to 

3

1 displace the employer's designated abuse of discretion 

2 standard of review. 

3  And secondly --

4  JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but neither, neither 

does the fact that there may be dual capacities 

6 eliminate the fact that there are contrary tugs on the, 

7 the individual or the, or the organization that has the 

8 dual responsibilities, and there's no reason that the 

9 law should be blind to that.

 MS. POSNER: No, Your Honor, it should not 

11 be blind. And as Firestone recognized, though, if in 

12 fact there is a, an entity that is in actuality 

13 conflicted, a claim administrator, then that conflict 

14 doesn't change the standard of review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by --

16 let's get straight by what we mean by "in actuality 

17 conflicted." Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial 

18 interest in actuality conflicted? 

19  MS. POSNER: We're using the words --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And aren't we talking in 

21 this case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality 

22 conflicted. 

23  MS. POSNER: No, Your Honor. We are using 

24 these terms to designate in actuality a conflicted 

fiduciary is one that has been infected or the decision

1 was infected by the conflict. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's, that's a 

3 conflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its 

4 judgment. But the conflict exists whether you, whether 

you give it effect or not. 

6  MS. POSNER: Yes, that's right, Your Honor. 

7 There is a conflict that we're saying is a potential 

8 conflict. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: So let's call that a 

conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties, 

11 whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his 

12 judgment. 

13  MS. POSNER: Yes. And as this Court 

14 recognized in Firestone, Your Honor, when there is an 

actual conflict, that's --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me follow up on 

17 Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief 

18 really goes astray on that. Think of the many 

19 situations like the remainderman who is the trustee. He 

has to look out for the interests of the live tenant, 

21 but he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants 

22 to be economical. That's not saying that he is. So 

23 I've always understood that the term "conflicting 

24 interests" means just that; you have conflicting 

interests. It doesn't mean that you necessarily slide 

5

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 over into misconduct. And I think that if you would
 

2 keep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting
 

3 interest? Yes, there is. Has the trustee in fact
 

4 slipped and taken unfair advantage because of the
 

conflicting interests? 

6  MS. POSNER: That's exactly the distinction 

7 that we are making by using actual and potential or, as 

8 this Court said, possible and actual in Firestone. And 

9 where that slip occurs in trust law or in ERISA and it 

infects the decision, the Firestone court --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does it have to be just 

12 the specific decisions? Suppose that the company does 

13 not have clear rules of, what do you call them, 

14 firewalls between the profit side and the claims 

processing side. Would that be enough to cause a 

16 greater, more searching standard of review, say de novo? 

17  MS. POSNER: I don't think it would ever 

18 result in a de novo review. I think what it is is a 

19 factor that should be weighed with all the other factors 

that go to the actual benefits decision. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then you're saying, A, 

22 the fact that there is a potential conflict is not 

23 enough; B, the fact that there are no procedures in the 

24 company to ensure that the conflict doesn't affect the 

judgment, that is not enough either.

1  MS. POSNER: No. I'm not saying that. I'm 

2 saying that if --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm positing. Does the 

4 fiduciary at least have the, the burden of production to 

show that it has established clear lines of demarcation, 

6 firewalls, whatever you call them, within the company? 

7 Does it have at least that obligation going forward? 

8  MS. POSNER: No, Your Honor, it does not, 

9 and as the United States --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, I don't know 

11 what effect you're giving to the fact, as the earlier 

12 questions have indicated, that there is a structural 

13 conflict. 

14  MS. POSNER: That's a structural conflict 

that ERISA anticipates and, as the United States said in 

16 its brief to this court in Pegram v. Herdrich, that 

17 ERISA tolerates this dual role and this level of 

18 conflict in order to keep these plans that are so vital 

19 in our country's economic interests in underlying the 

employee's well-being --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write an 

22 opinion to say that it's irrelevant that a company does 

23 not have procedures to insulate the profit section from 

24 the claims processing section? I'll use those terms.

 MS. POSNER: No, Justice Kennedy, absolutely 

7

1 not. But what we are saying is that if there were such 

2 a fiduciary that factor must be weighed, but it doesn't 

3 change the abuse of discretion standard. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does that work? 

I don't understand.  You go through, you've got a 

6 decision, whatever, it's a health insurance decision 

7 that this procedure -- to determine that this procedure 

8 is not covered under the, the plan, that the fiduciary 

9 has the discretion to make that determination. But you 

say, aha, he's got a conflict of interest, so that's a 

11 factor we take into account. Well, how does -- what 

12 does that mean? 

13  MS. POSNER: It means again, remembering 

14 that these are claims under 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B) for 

benefits due under the terms of the plan, it's very 

16 important that the courts remember to look at the terms 

17 of those plans --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, you've 

19 got two cases, one where the person does not have a 

conflict of interest under a particular plan, the other 

21 where he does. It's the same decision: We're not going 

22 to cover this procedure. How is the review different in 

23 each of those cases as a practical matter? 

24  MS. POSNER: As, as in trust law -- and if 

you look at the cases in trust law, what the court needs 

8

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 to look at when the settlor, here the employer, 

2 designates the discretionary authority under the terms 

3 of the trust or the plan is that that conflict comes 

4 into play if it seems that it's been breached. But you 

also have to remember exactly what the purpose of the 

6 trust is, and so you need to protect the employer's 

7 interest in having benefits paid in meritorious cases 

8 and not paid in nonmeritorious cases. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I don't see 

an answer to my question yet. How does the review 

11 differ as a functional matter? He says he looks at it 

12 and says, well, normally that would be within the 

13 discretion, but I've got to remember he's got a 

14 conflict, so I'm going to determine that this particular 

procedure should be covered because of the conflict. 

16  MS. POSNER: It remains in the discretion 

17 because this Court said that that freedom of contract 

18 that's so important to ERISA, to keep the benefits, the 

19 employers interested in offering benefits --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying it 

21 doesn't make any difference. You say you should take it 

22 into account, but if it was a reasoned decision, which 

23 is the test whether or not he's a fiduciary, if it's a 

24 reasoned decision the fact that he's a fiduciary makes 

no difference, right? Isn't that what you're saying?

1  MS. POSNER: No, Your Honor. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: It does make a decision 

3 then. What was a reasoned decision for someone who 

4 doesn't have a conflict becomes an unreasoned decision 

simply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict? 

6  MS. POSNER: Certainly not. Again, it must 

7 be a factor that's weighed with the other factors. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly my question. 

9  MS. POSNER: Yes --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm going to let you answer 

11 this question --

12  MS. POSNER: And I --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: But I want you to work mine 

14 in if you can. The problem that I'm having is what to 

say in the opinion. Now, could I say this? Firestone, 

16 yes, that's the way to put it as a standard. You can 

17 also teach through example. So I look at this case, I 

18 say: You want to know what that means, read the court 

19 of appeals opinion; it's perfect. Okay? So I've got 

Firestone -- my opinion so far is two words: 

21 "Firestone, perfect." Okay? Now, what do you want me 

22 to say other than that? 

23  MS. POSNER: In this case -- and this case I 

24 think presents a very narrow question for the Court, and 

that is where there is the dual role inherent in the

1 plan but no evidence whatsoever that it infected the 

2 decision, if it must be given weight in answer to the 

3 Court's second question, then --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you come to the 

end of the line. You have to prove that the authority 

6 was misused. And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's 

7 decision, what those judges were doing, they say we're 

8 going to look at this with some skepticism because of 

9 the conflict. And let me give you a concrete example. 

This woman got Social Security disability benefits and 

11 she did it at the suggestion of MetLife is; that so? 

12  MS. POSNER: She actually applied herself. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But she got a lawyer that 

14 they recommended that she have.

 MS. POSNER: MetLife recommended a lawyer to 

16 her and also said she could use her own lawyer, which 

17 was consistent with the plan design. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point is they 

19 came to her and said: Get Social Security disability 

benefits. Now, to get those she would have to show that 

21 she is totally and permanently disabled. 

22  MS. POSNER: Correct. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So here is a company that 

24 says: Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and 

permanently disabled, but -- and then we'll recoup all

1 that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get 

2 a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not 

3 disabled. Why isn't it appropriate to regard just that 

4 set of circumstances with suspicion?

 MS. POSNER: Because, Your Honor, at the 

6 time that that letter was written to the Respondent here 

7 in October of 2000, in fact MetLife had granted her 

8 benefits. And the action of helping an employee perfect 

9 their entitlement to Social Security is in fact not a 

conflict at all. It's a fiduciary obligation under the 

11 terms of a plan and it helps the employee as well. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I'm not questioning 

13 that at all. 

14  MS. POSNER: When --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds fine. It's a 

16 question of why, after helping her tell the government 

17 that she was totally disabled, they, after the initial 

18 two-year period, turned around and said she's not. 

19  MS. POSNER: The -- the reason is -- and 

it's unfortunate that often Social Security makes the 

21 same decision that the plan fiduciary has made two years 

22 earlier, and the government is looking backwards at 

23 certain evidence that may not be before the ERISA plan 

24 fiduciary. The ERISA plan fiduciary at that two-year 

point is looking at that evidence at that time and at a 

12

1 change in the terms of the plan. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Posner, it seems to me 

3 that that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether 

4 or not the person making the decision has a conflict. I 

mean that smells bad or doesn't smell bad, as you say, 

6 either way. 

7  MS. POSNER: Justice Scalia --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And I am still -- listen, I 

9 know that we're responsible for this because we said it 

in Firestone. We said that a conflict of interest 

11 should be weighed as a factor. If that means anything, 

12 it seems to me it means that sometimes that weight will 

13 make the difference. So at least sometimes -- but 

14 you're not willing to admit that -- at least sometimes 

you would say, oh, yes, this is a reasonable decision 

16 and had this decision been made by a fiduciary without a 

17 conflict, it would be perfectly okay because it's 

18 reasonable. That's the test. However, since this 

19 fiduciary has a conflict, what was a reasonable 

decision, whoof, the added weight, it becomes an 

21 unreasonable decision. 

22  MS. POSNER: I think --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what you mean by 

24 giving it some weight?

 MS. POSNER: Yes, Justice Scalia --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: You do. 

2  MS. POSNER: But --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: So a perfectly reasonable 

4 decision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a 

conflict? 

6  MS. POSNER: It depends on how close that 

7 reasonable decision is to the line, and in this case the 

8 decision was not one that this mere dual-role conflict, 

9 the lowest level of conflict that can exist, can push 

that reasonable decision over. And I --

11  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, let's assume -- let's 

12 assume that I'm reviewing it, and I -- I don't find it 

13 as clear as you do, and I'm on the fence. Being on the 

14 fence, may I take into consideration the fact that there 

was a conflict of interest? 

16  MS. POSNER: You -- I think under Firestone 

17 you have to take that into account. 

18  JUSTICE SOUTER: And therefore I will say, 

19 okay, I wouldn't know for sure how to go in this case, 

but I see the conflict of interest and that's enough to 

21 make me say more probably than not there was a 

22 reflection of the self-interest of the provider, rather 

23 than the interest of the -- of the insured here; and, 

24 therefore, I'm going to find that the -- that the 

conflict did disadvantage the person insured. That 

14

1 would be, I take it on your view, a reasonable 

2 application of Firestone. 

3  MS. POSNER: Again, depending upon how these 

4 things weigh.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I just told you. 

6  MS. POSNER: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE SOUTER: I just told you how it 

8 weighed. I'm sitting on the fence. I'm not sure what 

9 to do. I take into consideration the fact that there is 

conflicting interest here; and, therefore, I conclude 

11 that the conflicting interest is the reason for the 

12 decision and I hold against the company. Is that a 

13 misapplication of Firestone? 

14  MS. POSNER: No, it would not be. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: But that's not the argument 

17 that I understood you to make in your brief. Is that a 

18 change from the position you took in your brief? 

19  MS. POSNER: No, Your Honor, I don't believe 

it is. The brief acknowledges that there are various 

21 conflicts that exist here. The conflict that ERISA 

22 tolerates and recognizes as being everyday, ordinary 

23 practice that is absolutely necessary for the employee 

24 benefits of this country to remain vital, and that is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I just get this clear?

1 I thought your position in your brief was that there has 

2 to be a demonstration that the conflict had an effect on 

3 the decision before there is any departure from the 

4 standard abuse of discretion --

MS. POSNER: That's correct, Justice Alito. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: -- the standard of review. 

7  MS. POSNER: And I took Justice Souter's 

8 hypothetical to mean that there had been a conflict that 

9 seriously weighed on his view.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. My hypothetical is the 

11 hypothetical of the person making the decision. I put 

12 myself in that person's position and I'm saying I can 

13 think of reasons that might result in concluding that 

14 this was a reasonable decision, period. And I can think 

of reasons that might result in concluding that, in 

16 fact, this was a decision that had been made against the 

17 interest of the insured because the person making the 

18 decision itself had an interest in it. 

19  I'm not sure which way to go, but I now take 

into consideration the fact that there was this 

21 conflicting interest in the person or the organization 

22 that made the decision, and for that reason, I am going 

23 to -- I'm going to break the tie, and I'm going to 

24 conclude that the conflict was to the disadvantage of 

the insured. I'm going to rule against the company. I

1 understood that you said that would be a proper 

2 application of Firestone. Is that still your answer? 

3  MS. POSNER: I think that that could be. 

4 The problem with all of these cases and when you look at 

them --

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why wouldn't it be? 

7  MS. POSNER: Well, again, we're looking at 

8 conflict as if it's the only factor here, and when we 

9 look at these cases --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. In my hypothetical, 

11 I've taken into --

12  MS. POSNER: You're saying that --

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: -- factors that say the 

14 company was right, factors that say the company is 

wrong. I'm not sure which. They seem evenly balanced 

16 to me, until I take into consideration the fact that 

17 there was conflicting interest, and I say that's enough 

18 to tip it. And it does tip it, and I rule against the 

19 company.

 MS. POSNER: I think --

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: And am I right or wrong 

22 under Firestone? 

23  MS. POSNER: Again, I think that it's very 

24 important to look at the employer's plan and this 

employer specifically.

6 right or you could be wrong, but it's --

17  MS. POSNER: Okay, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: As the trier -- I mean 

19 ERISA, yes, it certainly says you can be both the plan 

administrator and the payor, but all it says is that 

21 that's permissible. But it also provides for review of 

22 those decisions, judicial review in court. And here is, 

23 say, a district court is looking at it and says: I 

24 don't understand why the company didn't look at the

1 checkmark. And I also don't understand the suggestion 

2 that she is totally disabled to the government and then 

3 saying, well, she's really not, in this very close time 

4 frame. So it might be okay and it might not.

 I am in equipoise about this case, not the 

6 terms of the plan but the decision that was made to deny 

7 her benefits. So which way do I call it? That's the 

8 question that Justice Souter posed, and you seem not to 

9 want to face up to it and answer it.

 MS. POSNER: Your Honor, the problem with 

11 the hypothetical as you just stated is that you've taken 

12 the employer's contract out of the calculation, and that 

13 the employer has the right to determine its own plan and 

14 design those plans as they see fit in order to keep 

these vital economic safety nets available, affordable 

16 and capable of providing a safety net to the --

23  MS. POSNER: You can't make that

1 Security can be -- can be an offset, estimated or -- or 

2 received. 

3  It says that the plan administrator or the 

4 fiduciary not only has discretionary authority to 

determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the 

6 terms of the plan, but that its decision may not be 

7 overturned unless arbitrary and capricious. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, Justice 

9 Souter's question and Justice Alito's question highlight 

for me what I think is the central issue. Justice 

11 Souter had asked you whether the conflict comes into 

12 play, you know, when it's a tie. And you're right on 

13 the fence, and you say, well, the conflict's a factor, 

14 so it tips over in the employee's favor.

 Justice Alito's question asked you whether 

16 or not the conflict has to play a role in the decision. 

17 I don't know how that would be, but let's say, for 

18 example, the insurance company is doing well and so they 

19 say, well, we allow coverage for this procedure. All of 

a sudden, the insurance company looks like it's not 

21 doing so well, it's not going to meet the quarterly 

22 targets or whatever, so it says, well, we're no longer 

23 going to allow coverage for that procedure. In other 

24 words, it is the conflict itself that affects which way 

it comes out.

1  Now, which is right: Justice Souter's case 

2 in which the conflict tips the scales, no matter what 

3 the reason is; or Justice Alito's case where the 

4 conflict plays a role in the decision process?

 MS. POSNER: We believe that it's the 

6 Justice Alito hypothetical, where it does play a role. 

7 Where it doesn't play a role, it should have -- our 

8 first answer -- our answer to the first question is it 

9 should have no weight. However, I understand that we've 

moved beyond that to the second question. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: But the problem with that is 

12 the Court needs to know what the standard of review is 

13 before it gets to the merits. And how is the Court 

14 going to know whether conflicting interests played a 

role in the outcome of a particular benefits 

16 determination without looking at the merits of the case 

17 unless there is going to be a lot of discovery about 

18 internal processes at MetLife and how you treat the 

19 people who -- who gets promoted among the benefits 

administrators and all of that? And that's what I don't 

21 understand about that position. 

22  MS. POSNER: No -- yes, Justice Alito, and I 

23 think you hit the nail on the head there. The merits of 

24 the case must certainly be scrutinized, and they can be 

scrutinized for an abuse of discretion. And that's the

1 important issue. It's scrutinizing the merits of the 

2 case, whether or not the medical and vocational 

3 information supports the decision. 

4  JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But as I understand 

your brief, you say the conflict of interest is only 

6 relevant if it affected the decision. But how does the 

7 plaintiff prove that it affected? What sort of evidence 

8 would go to that issue? 

9  MS. POSNER: There are cases, Your Honor, 

where can you see that, for instance, when you look at 

11 the medical evidence, that the administrator shows in 

12 its claim file, which, unlike any other area of the law, 

13 the whole process is transparent under ERISA; and there 

14 may really not be any evidence that's supporting it, or 

so little that it's hard to understand how that 

16 fiduciary could possibly have reached that decision. 

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're just saying 

18 that the plaintiff has to have an overwhelming case. I 

19 don't think you'd need the conflict-of-interest point in 

that kind of case. 

21  MS. POSNER: That's actually the standard, 

22 though, Justice Stevens, in trust law also. Because 

23 when you read these cases and you look at the examples 

24 in the Restatement, when the trustee has an acknowledged 

conflict and the settlor nevertheless vests in that

1 trustee discretionary authority, then in order for a 

2 court to displace that trustee's judgment the court must 

3 find that the trustee actually acted from conflict and 

4 in controverse -- in contraverdia -- oh, my goodness --

and did not follow the terms of the plan. 

6  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I can understand 

7 that in normal trust situations, but it's hard for me to 

8 understand how you're going to prove an insurance 

9 company's particular claim adjustment was really 

motivated by a conflict of interest rather than thinking 

11 the claim wasn't valid. 

12  MS. POSNER: That is a problem, but the fact 

13 of the matter is that you -- you read the cases and the 

14 files, as I'm sure you have, and it's apparent that 

there are -- let me use Post v. Hartford as an example, 

16 if I may. In Post v. Hartford there is a majority 

17 opinion that overruled the Hartford's discretion based 

18 merely on minor irregularities. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where, where is this 

decision from that you're --

21  MS. POSNER: Post v. Hartford, Your Honor, 

22 is at 501 Fed. 3d 154. It's the case that -- it's a 

23 Third Circuit case from 2007 that the Respondent very 

24 heavily relies upon, and it's a glaring example of 

what's gone wrong in the analysis here, because in Post

1 v. Hartford there's a majority opinion that overruled 

2 the Hartford's discretion based on minor irregularities, 

3 what it called as minor irregularities, merely because 

4 they existed.

 The dissenting judge looked at the medicals 

6 and, even under the Third Circuit's heightened scrutiny, 

7 which automatically it applies to insurance companies 

8 regardless of the situation, that justice said the 

9 medical -- that judge, sorry -- said that the medical 

evidence very clearly supported the Hartford's decision. 

11  And what we are hoping will come out of 

12 this, Your Honors, is that in fashioning what should 

13 happen in these cases, that the fact that these are 

14 claims for benefits under the terms of the plan must 

really be important, not just minor irregularities and 

16 whether this was done right or that was done right. 

17 That's -- that's a cause of action under -- under 

18 1132(a)(2), and the Respondents are relying very heavily 

19 on the replacement of the fiduciary, of the trustee.

 That's not the issue here. That's an (a)(2) 

21 claim under 1109 where you could replace the fiduciary. 

22 Here we are talking about were these benefits properly 

23 denied or not?

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one feature of 

2 this that I don't understand. It was referred to very 

3 swiftly in Judge Merritt's separate opinion. He said at 

4 one point there was a proposal by MetLife that they give 

this woman a trial run at a sedentary job to see if she 

6 could do it. And he said that that made a lot of sense 

7 to him, and it was MetLife's proposal, but then it got 

8 withdrawn. Could you clarify what that was? 

9  MS. POSNER: Yes. I believe, Justice 

Ginsburg, that Judge Merritt was looking at a provision 

11 of the plan that -- actually, I'll tell you where it is. 

12 It's at 170a of the joint appendix. And that provision 

13 allows rehabilitative employment for a disabled person. 

14 In early 2002, MetLife did refer the file to a 

vocational rehabilitation specialist to determine 

16 whether or not the Respondent was eligible for that. 

17  In doing that, a letter was sent to the 

18 treating physician, Dr. Patel, asking specifically what 

19 she could do in an eight-hour day; could she do 

full-time sedentary work; and if there were any physical 

21 barriers. And that's that March 12th, 2002, letter --

22 it was not a form -- which he filled out and said in an 

23 eight-hour day she could sit for eight hours; she could 

24 stand for four hours; and she could walk for two hours; 

that she could do full-time, sedentary work, and that

1 there were no physical barriers otherwise blocking her 

2 ability to do that. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did MetLife 

4 withdraw that proposal?

 MS. POSNER: Well, there was no proposal, 

6 Your Honor, but it was given to a rehabilitation 

7 specialist to work that up to see if she was disabled 

8 and eligible for rehabilitative employment, because her 

9 treating physician responded to that inquiry by saying 

she could do sedentary work, she retained that physical 

11 capacity, which was consistent with what he said in 

12 January of '02 and again in June of '02. That provision 

13 --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question was not what 

Dr. Patel said, but how did that proposal get dropped? 

16  MS. POSNER: There was no proposal, Your 

17 Honor. There is a provision in the plan -- it's at 170a 

18 of the joint appendix -- which allows for rehabilitative 

19 employment for disabled people who may have the physical 

capacity to do work they were not doing before.

1  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

2  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

3 it please the Court: 

4  This Court got it right in Firestone when it 

said, of course a conflict must be weighed. There's no 

6 reason for this Court to overrode its well-reasoned and 

7 unanimous conclusion which --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Dictum. 

9  MR. ROSENKRANZ: It was dictum, Your Honor, 

but it was very well-considered dictum because --

11  (Laughter.) 

12  MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the only issue before 

13 the Court so far as the parties thought was what is the 

14 effect of this dual role that Firestone had? And this 

Court did not answer that question, but that's what the 

16 parties were arguing about. 

17  So this Court correctly discerned the rule 

18 from trust law. It correctly discerned and balanced 

19 ERISA's policies and, if anything --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't like about the 

21 dictum is I don't know what it means. 

22  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's lovely to say 

24 weigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket 

and it's fine. But what does it mean?

1  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it mean that a
 

3 perfectly reasonable decision that is within the
 

4 discretion -- I mean this plan says that MetLife will
 

have -- knowing that it will have the conflict, that 

6 they will make the decisions and so long as they are not 

7 arbitrary, they are valid. 

8  Now, let's take a perfectly reasonable 

9 decision. It is not arbitrary. Does giving weight to 

the existence of the conflict which the settlor of the 

11 plan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean 

12 that what was reasonable becomes unreasonable? 

13  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the answer --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: If it doesn't mean that, 

then it means nothing. 

16  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

17 The answer is yes in many circumstances. And the beauty 

18 of the Court's invocation of trust law is that trust law 

19 answers the question. Trust law says that when you have 

a fiduciary with a conflict, you apply especially 

21 careful scrutiny. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but trust law 

23 doesn't take into account what we have said repeatedly 

24 in our ERISA decisions, which is we want to encourage 

people to set up ERISA plans. And that has affected the 

28

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 standards that we've adopted, for example, that we even 

2 allow a conflict of interest like this to exist. 

3  And it seems to me that your position is 

4 going to hurt beneficiaries under ERISA plans because 

people are going to say, as they're perfectly free to 

6 do -- people, the employers, are going to say, as they 

7 are perfectly free to do, you know, I'm just not going 

8 to do it; if we're going to have judges looking at these 

9 claims decisions on a de novo basis, who knows how much 

it'll end up costing me, so I'm not going to set up 

11 these plans. 

12  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I understand, 

13 and this Court considered that in Firestone, the 

14 litigation cost and the added administrative costs, and 

this Court concluded en route to de novo review that the 

16 1132(a)(1)(B) remedy is so infused with the interests of 

17 ensuring that the beneficiaries get their benefits due, 

18 that that is the interest that the courts weigh most in 

19 determining the standard of review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- which 

21 position do you adopt? It was only posed as 

22 hypothetical, so I don't mean to attribute the position 

23 to you; but the Justice Souter hypothetical or the 

24 Justice Alito hypothetical?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the answer is 

29

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 both. They can happen under both circumstances --

2 circumstances. But let me explain why. What trust law 

3 does is to say we apply especially careful scrutiny. 

4 And the scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose of 

the scrutiny, which is to ensure that the conflicted 

6 fiduciary does not end up subconsciously or consciously 

7 tilting the scale. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that sounds 

9 like the Justice Alito hypothetical. In other words, 

the extra scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose. 

11 The purpose is to protect against the conflict. So if 

12 the scrutiny doesn't reveal that the conflict played a 

13 role, then it's -- then it's not an abuse of discretion. 

14  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, because 

what trust law says is that you apply especially careful 

16 scrutiny, which entails two things. The first thing is 

17 what this Court called keeping the judicial eye peeled 

18 for conflict of interest in Rush. So that's an 

19 examination of the record of the decisionmaking process. 

You kick the tires, you test the judgments, as the Sixth 

21 Circuit did in this case, and you ask yourself, is this 

22 the work of an unbiased fiduciary? 

23  The second thing is to imagine a zone of 

24 reasonableness within which a reasonably prudent trustee 

might land and then say to yourself at the outer limits 

30

1 of the zone of reasonableness, we will accept the 

2 judgment of an unconflicted fiduciary because there is 

3 no reason for us to suspect that he reached that result 

4 because of the bias. For a conflicted fiduciary you can 

contract that zone of reasonableness. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Trust law doesn't say. 

7 Trust law does not establish a different standard of 

8 judicial review for the conflicted trustee. 

9  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it absolutely 

does, and the 26 law professors in the amicus brief that 

11 they filed with this Court explain exactly --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: But I don't know what to 

13 look to in trust law. I mean, all that's happened here, 

14 every life insurance -- every company, every life 

insurance company has the kind of conflict that you're 

16 talking about. Every company has the kind of conflict 

17 you're talking about. And an automobile company might 

18 make shoddy merchandise so it can make more money in the 

19 short run.

 How does trust law keep that kind of 

21 conflict? Now, it can't be and it isn't, because I've 

22 looked it up, I think, that trust law says that every 

23 distribution by a trustee whose own fee depends on the 

24 size of the trust is conflicted.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: I doubt, since banks are
 

2 trustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here -- -

3  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: -- that banks are
 

trustees -- suppose you were to say, look, the bank has 

6 an interest in maximizing the amount of money in its 

7 account and therefore every decision of a distribution 

8 of such trustee is subject to some special thing. 

9  Now, the problem for me in this case is what 

in trust law do I analogize it to, not -- I don't doubt 

11 for a second the 26 law professors, et cetera -- though 

12 I do really sometimes, but not in this case.

18 this opinion, and the standard, perfect; from the 

19 opinion below, perfect. You want to know what I mean, 

read the opinion below. Okay? 

21  Now, what's your view on all of that? 

22  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So let me break it down and 

23 first turn to the premise. It is simply not correct 

24 that every employer is conflicted.

1  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Take the examples that I 

3 gave. It's an ordinary insurance policy. 

4  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. But the bank 

example, Your Honor, that is not a pressure, which is 

6 kind of a business pressure, that trust law recognizes 

7 as a conflict of interest. Trust law acknowledges that 

8 trustees are often, almost always, in the business of 

9 administering trusts, and they don't -- they make their 

money by doing the job well. The big difference is we 

11 are talking here about a direct impact on the bottom 

12 line. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: But that's, you see, their 

14 point. Their point is this is just an ordinary 

insurance company, an ordinary policy, and it's really 

16 like a bank that's a trustee that in fact takes money 

17 that hasn't been distributed and puts it on its own 

18 account. They make money for that, from that. So there 

19 is a conflict.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: You have that kind of 

22 conflict. 

23  What do you say about that? 

24  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Justice Breyer, it's just

1 everyone knows them to be in the insurance industry.
 

2 The insurance industry makes its money on the
 

3 differential between the premiums that it charges and
 

4 the payouts in claims.


 JUSTICE BREYER: The bank makes its money by 

6 putting money in an account, paying interest and lending 

7 it at more money. 

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: But -- So let me give an 

9 example from real life. MetLife, for example, shells 

out $14 billion a year in ERISA covered claims. If it 

11 denies one out of a hundred claims improperly, we are 

12 talking about $140 million. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and Chase Manhattan 

14 bank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they 

just put in for three days money into an 

16 interest-bearing account and lend it out for five 

17 minutes, they will make $1 billion. Okay. You see, 

18 they are finding these kinds of conflicts everywhere. 

19 And that's what I'm asking you.

 What I think if I were to add something I'd 

21 say, look at this carefully, judge, look at it 

22 carefully; but if all you find is an ordinary insurance 

23 company doing ordinary work and there is no ground for 

24 suspicion, proceed to step two. What about that?

1 thing to say is that -- if that is, in fact, an 

2 authorized transaction, that would fall under the 

3 self-dealing rules of trust law, and trust law 

4 self-dealing rules are situations in which the set law 

has actually suspended the duty of loyalty of the
 

6 trustee -- that's correct -- of the trustee.
 

7  That is absolutely impermissible under
 

8 ERISA. You cannot suspend the duty of loyalty under
 

9 ERISA. There is a clear provision about that.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. -- Mr. Rosenkranz. I 

11 think you set up basically three different kinds of 

12 scenarios. And I want to set -- I want to put them into 

13 my own words and -- and have you tell me whether I 

14 understand your -- your point correctly.

 Scenario number one is the case -- in each 

16 of these scenarios, we have the same relationship 

17 between the -- in effect, the trustee and -- and the 

18 beneficiary that we have here. There -- there is a --

19 there is a built-in conflict. We don't know what its 

effect is. 

21  In scenario number one, the -- the evidence 

22 is that the person making the benefits decision says 

23 let's let this person suffer so that we can keep the 

24 money. That is the easy case.

 Scenario number two --

1  MR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor, says 

2 that explicitly in the claim file? 

3  JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right, the -- the 

4 e-mail shows up.

 In -- in case number two, there -- there is 

6 what you referred to as a decision within the zone of 

7 reasonableness, but instead of being sort of in the core 

8 of the center of the zone of reasonableness, it's close 

9 to the edge. A decisionmaker could look at that 

decision and say if there is no reason to be suspicious 

11 about it, it's still within the zone of reasonableness, 

12 and I don't think there is a conflict. 

13  But if the decisionmaker knows that there is 

14 this kind of structural conflict, the decisionmaker can 

say look, I wasn't born yesterday; the reason it's so 

16 close to the edge is that they were giving way to their 

17 own self-interest in the conflict, and I'm going to 

18 decide for the beneficiary and against the company. 

19  Case number three is the case of the person 

right on the fence, the decisionmaker. The 

21 decisionmaker says, I've -- I've looked at everything 

22 there is to look at and I cannot decide for sure what 

23 this is, whether it was a legitimate decision or a 

24 conflicted one in the -- in the decisionmaker's favor, 

unless I take into consideration the fact that there is

1 this structural conflict. 

2  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the 

3 decisionmaker here is the court reviewing? Or --

4  JUSTICE SOUTER: No the decisionmaker is the 

person who made the beneficiary -- the benefits
 

6 decision. And if I take into consideration the
 

7 structural conflict, that gives the decision to the
 

8 beneficiary and against the company.
 

9  Now, in case number two, it's close but
 

the -- but the fact of the conflict is regarded as, 

11 itself, as substantive evidence and it -- it results in 

12 a decision for the beneficiary. 

13  In case number three, the evidence is in 

14 equipoise, and to get off equipoise, the conflict rule 

is taken as the tiebreaker. 

16  My understanding is that your view is the 

17 proper way to consider the conflict under Firestone is, 

18 as I did in my hypo, in both case number two and case 

19 number three. Am I correct?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: To consider it, yes, Your 

21 Honor, but --

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, when we 

23 take -- it is taken as substantive evidence to -- to get

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the record has 

7 the structural context. 

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, except for 

9 that what would appear to be at a -- right at the outer 

bounds of reasonableness for an unconflicted fiduciary 

11 could knock you over the fence, to use Your Honor's 

12 earlier analogy, for a conflicted fiduciary. 

13  Definitely not for scenario two. If the 

14 decisionmaker is correct in the judgment of the court, 

"Gee, I don't know where to go, this is really close," 

16 well, within the zone of reasonableness, in fact, in 

17 Your Honor's hypothetical, you're right at the -- the 

18 target center of the zone of reasonableness, then no, a 

19 court would absolutely not hold --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But in my hypothetical 

21 you weren't at the center of the zone of reasonable; you 

22 were close to the edge. 

23  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Number three. In number 

24 three, Your Honor --

1 make up our mind. 

2  MR. ROSENKRANZ: But the decisionmaker, you 

3 said, Your Honor, in number three, could not make up its 

4 mind.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. 

6  MR. ROSENKRANZ: And if the -- and if the 

7 court confirms yes; the decisionmaker was right that 

8 this was really close; you're right at the target center 

9 of the zone of reasonableness and the conflict of 

interest doesn't push you over. The only thing that the 

11 conflict of interest could do there is the judicial eye 

12 becomes peeled for other evidence of conflict which 

13 would end up --

14  JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so you -- I guess you 

are saying it may be considered as substantive evidence 

16 but it is not a process tiebreaker? 

17  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, let me rephrase 

18 it. What I'm saying is two things. The first is 

19 especially careful scrutiny, just in the abstract, 

stepping back from the hypothetical, means that you 

21 focus really carefully on the process by which the 

22 decision was made, as the Sixth Circuit did in this 

23 case. "This is strange, they are completely ignoring 

24 this evidence. They are cherry picking. They are doing 

about-faces." That's one.

1  Secondly, if you are at the target center of 

2 the zone of reasonableness, and none of those procedural 

3 irregularities have arisen, to be sure that the district 

4 court reviewing would affirm that judgment --

JUSTICE ALITO: How does a reviewing court 

6 know how far it can go from the outer boundary of the 

7 zone of reasonableness when there is a conflicting 

8 interest? Is it always -- and I don't know how thin you 

9 can slice these standards of review. Is it always, 

let's say 90 percent of the way to the outer boundary; 

11 or sometimes it would be 80 percent; sometimes it would 

12 be 70 percent? 

13  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Does it work like that 

depending on the facts of the case? 

16  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that's 

17 where the Court can't calibrate. What the Court can do 

18 is provide very clear guidance to the lower courts. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what would -- how 

would you verbalize it? 

21  MR. ROSENKRANZ: I --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because everybody talks 

23 about yes, it's a factor, it's a relevant factor. But

1 judicial decisionmakers, what do you tell them?
 

2  MR. ROSENKRANZ: I would say first and
 

3 foremost -- I would say three things to the district
 

4 courts. Number one, this is not just some form of
 

arbitrary and capricious agency review with just a 

6 little bit more bite. This is reasonableness review 

7 under trust law, which is very, very different. 

8  Number two, the judicial eye is peeled, as 

9 this Court said in Rush, for conflict of interest. Kick 

the tires. Here are seven, eight, nine illustrations of 

11 the sorts of things that lower courts should be on the 

12 lookout for as they are trying to discern whether the 

13 conflict tainted the result. 

14  Number three, if -- if you are at the outer 

bounds of reasonableness for an unconflicted trustee, 

16 you can contract that zone of reasonableness because you 

17 don't -- when -- when an unconflicted trustee is right 

18 at the outer edge, there is no reason to suspect his 

19 motive.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that the insurance 

21 company shows or may be required to show, at least by 

22 the burden of production, that it has established 

23 firewalls, very careful procedures, written regulations 

24 that claims administrators are not to consult with the 

people that set policy and prices. Does that suffice to

1 permit, simply, abuse of discretion review? 

2  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. It would 

3 be a factor --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that there is nothing 

the fiduciary can do in order to avoid intrusive --

6 highly -- a high degree of scrutiny in review of every 

7 close case? 

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, first, 

9 just to be clear, we are talking about still a 

deferential standard. It's just not as deferential as 

11 it would otherwise be. 

12  Absolutely. An insurer can come in and say, 

13 look, we've created all these procedures; they have 

14 mitigated the conflict, but it can never get --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that all insurance 

16 company claims adjustors have less deferential review 

17 than independent claims administrators? 

18  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, unless the 

19 insurance company comes in and can demonstrate in a case 

that we've never heard of --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to institute 

22 an industrywide rule differentiating insurance companies 

23 from other --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there an example 

3 in trust law where, say, a bank's a trustee and they 

4 self-insure in some area? Is there ever a case in trust 

law that found that to be a conflict. 

6  MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't understand the 

7 hypothetical, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, you can 

9 easily transpose this to other -- trusts are run by 

banks often that are trustees. They're huge, and they 

11 might self-insure in simple -- in certain circumstances, 

12 in which case you reproduce something like the conflict 

13 that's at issue here. And so --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that -- my

17 there any example where that kind of thing has ever been 

18 held to be a conflict of interest?

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

2  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

3  MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

4 please the Court:

 The Court should not turn a blind eye to the 

6 conflict of interest that exists when an administrator 

7 both evaluates and pays claims. Instead, an 

8 administrator's discretionary decisions should be 

9 reviewed for reasonableness where the conflict of 

interest is considered as a factor. And what that means 

11 --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We've heard a lot of 

13 talk about judicial eyes today, but it doesn't -- it 

14 makes it sound as if abuse-of-discretion review is 

nothing, and with the added factor you want to look more 

16 closely. Courts undertaking abuse-of-discretion review 

17 don't do it blindly. They look at it. It's just a 

18 question of whether they give deference on the judgment 

19 calls. And I'm still not -- I still don't understand 

how the added factor or, in your case, the added seven 

21 factors affects that issue of deference. 

22  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, we agree with the point 

23 you're making, that the question in all of these cases 

24 is the reasonableness, where there's a discretionary 

clause, is the reasonableness of the administrator's 

44

1 determination. That is the ultimate inquiry, and there 

2 are any number of other facts and circumstances that 

3 could suggest that the decision is unreasonable. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: And --

MS. SAHARSKY: And one fact --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that one of the 

7 things that can make it unreasonable is the mere fact 

8 that there exists this -- this conflict. 

9  MS. SAHARSKY: The conflict of interest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That renders what is a 

11 perfectly reasonable decision unreasonable. I --

12  MS. SAHARSKY: In very close cases. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 

14 In very -- what kind of a standard is that, "in very 

close cases"? How is -- how are you going to review a 

16 court? I mean, give it some weight in very close cases? 

17 It slops over. This is not a standard. I don't know --

18 I don't know what you're telling the courts to do. 

19  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, this is a standard that 

comes from trust law, the reasonableness standard, and 

21 this Court has recognized similar standards in all 

22 different areas of the law where they've talked about --

23 where you've talked about reasonableness and abuse of 

24 discretion review --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't mind 

45

1 reasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion. 

2 But you're telling me that even when the reasonableness 

3 standard is met, if there is this conflict, if it's 

4 close -- how close is close? You -- suddenly it flops 

over the edge. I mean, you know, close to the out --

6 it's -- it's beautiful art, but I don't understand how 

7 it turns into law. 

8  MS. SAHARSKY: In every case, the court 

9 would need to make a decision about reasonableness, and 

in the cases where there is a conflict of interest that 

11 needs to be weighed what the court would do is take a 

12 close look at the administrator's rationale --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Then what analogy? I agree 

14 with your basic point. If I encapsulate it, you may or 

may not agree with my encapsulation. This reminds me a 

16 lot of the argument between Learned Hand and Felix 

17 Frankfurter under what "substantial evidence" meant. 

18 And like Learned Hand, your side, I think, or the first 

19 argument, wants to find an absolute standard, a perfect 

analogy, which Frankfurter said you can't do. Very 

21 well. 

22  What's worrying me is what is the analogy? 

23 Because you're not saying it's just conflict-of-interest 

24 law. You are analogizing it to a trustee who himself is 

a remainderman. And it's at that point that I begin to

1 get off this boat because I'm not sure that's the right 

2 analogy. 

3  Now, you've looked through lots of cases. 

4 Your colleague knows it better than you, and he hasn't 

come up with something that's a better analogy. But do 

6 you see what's bothering me? So, therefore I'm back 

7 where I started: Two-sentence, two-word opinion. We 

8 did our best in Firestone and this decision below is a 

9 good illustration of how to do it. What can you add to 

what I just said? 

11  MS. SAHARSKY: First of all, this Court 

12 should say that Firestone correctly set out the 

13 framework for the de novo default standard of review and 

14 what should happen in the case of a discretionary 

determination where the plan confers discretion --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --

17  MS. SAHARSKY: -- that review should be 

18 under the trust law standard. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we look at Firestone, 

it's rather laconic. It's just says -- it says, 

21 ordinarily, if you don't have this discretionary 

22 authority, it's de novo review. And then -- this is on 

23 page 115. It says if the fiduciary has discretionary 

24 authority to determine eligibility benefits, then it's 

not de novo. And what more does it say? I don't see 

47

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 that it says anything more than that. 

2  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, both on pages 111 and 

3 on 115, this Court was looking to the law of trusts. 

4 There's a more extensive discussion on page 111, where 

it says, for example, "If the trustee is given power to 

6 construe disputed or doubtful terms, in such 

7 circumstances the trustee's interpretation will not be 

8 disturbed if reasonable." And then on page 115, using 

9 that abuse of discretion reasonableness standard, the 

Court said "If there is a benefit plan that gives 

11 discretion to an administrator that is operating under a 

12 conflict, the conflict must be weighed as a factor." 

13  And Firestone told this Court to look to 

14 trust law and trust law -- we think the best examples 

there are the situations of a trustee who is also a 

16 beneficiary or a trustee who is also a remainderman. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an insurance 

18 company -- I'll just repeat my earlier question -- has 

19 done the best that it can do to have a firewall, 

independence and so forth. Does that bear on whether or 

21 not the less deferential standard of review is invoked? 

22  MS. SAHARSKY: The standard of review would 

23 be the same, which is review for reasonableness, but --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it makes no difference 

what -- it makes no difference what the policies of the 

48

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 companies are insofar as the standard of review? 

2  MS. SAHARSKY: The standard of review is the 

3 same, but the outcome could be different in that case 

4 because what the insurance company did should be taken 

into account when the court is making a judgment call, 

6 the same kind of judgment call that courts have made in 

7 equity cases for years. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: This --

9  MS. SAHARSKY: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This bears upon the 

11 question Justice Breyer asked, which we never could get 

12 completely answered. Can you tell me what the Sixth 

13 Circuit did wrong here? 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: The Sixth Circuit correctly 

determined that there needed to be greater scrutiny to 

16 -- to the claims determination in this case. We would 

17 quarrel with the Sixth Circuit's analysis calling that 

18 abuse of -- or, I'm sorry, arbitrary and capricious 

19 review because we don't think that that analogy to 

administrative law makes sense. But what the Sixth 

21 Circuit did was correct in this. There were a number of 

22 factors here, for example the Social Security 

23 determination, MetLife's participation in that, that has 

24 suggested that this decision was unreasonable and could 

not be upheld. Conflict of interest was a factor.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you're at all 

2 saying that it's the same standard of review. You keep 

3 saying that, and your friend said it, but it's not the 

4 same standard of review. You say it's still the 

reasonableness standard of review, but then you say, 

6 however, the mere fact of the existence of the conflict 

7 does at the edges make unreasonable what used to be 

8 reasonable. That is a different standard of review. It 

9 means you are not using a single reasonableness standard 

of review. You're arguing for a second standard of 

11 review that is so vague I don't know what it means. Why 

12 not just say that the district court, when there is a 

13 conflict of this sort, has to spend two more hours 

14 considering the case?

 (Laughter.) 

16  MS. SAHARSKY: We think that the answer --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: There's a clear rule, you 

18 know. 

19  MS. SAHARSKY: We think that the answer 

comes from trust law. We think that the answer comes 

21 from trust law, and these are judgment calls that courts 

22 need to make --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under trust law

MS. SAHARSKY: -- about whether a decision 

50

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 was reasonable. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- we don't have --

3 we don't have an established policy of encouraging 

4 people to establish trusts. We do have reflected in our 

decisions an established policy of encouraging people to 

6 set up ERISA plans. 

7  MS. SAHARSKY: That's true, but that's 

8 balanced against the strict fiduciary duties in ERISA, 

9 that in cases of a conflict of interest suggests that 

the plan administrator's determination needs to get 

11 additional scrutiny. I understand that --

12  JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Here are two 

13 ways you could do it. You've spoken of reasonableness 

14 analysis. By "reasonableness analysis," I mean and I 

assume you mean that the person who is judging the 

16 action taken says: Here are the good reasons on one 

17 side that support the action; and here are the reasons 

18 on the other side that in fact are critical of it, 

19 suggest that it was wrong. Which one of these sets of 

reasons is the strongest? That's what I sort of mean by 

21 "reasonableness analysis." All right. 

22  There are two ways that the structural 

23 conflict could be taken into consideration in 

24 reasonableness analysis. One is it could be taken into 

consideration during this -- we'll call it the step one 

51
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 process. We put the structural conflict on the -- on 

2 the side of the scale that weighs against affirming the 

3 decision. A second way to do it would be to go through 

4 reasonableness analysis leaving the conflict aside for 

the moment, and say, on regular reasonableness analysis, 

6 do the reasons support the decision predominantly or do 

7 they go against it, and let it go at that. But when 

8 that kind of "reasonableness" analysis results in 

9 something close to equipoise, then we take the 

structural conflict into consideration; and that's what, 

11 in effect, sort of breaks the tie. 

12  Which of those models do we use? Do we use 

13 the structural conflict as a reason in the step one 

14 weighing, or do we use the structural conflict as a 

tiebreaker. 

16  MS. SAHARSKY: The structural conflict 

17 should be used in the weighing although, for the 

18 purposes of your hypothetical, I see the answer as being 

19 the same in both situations that you posited. That the 

conflict of interest would only make a difference in 

21 close cases, yes. 

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: It's a question of when you 

23 use it; and on the first hypothetical, you may not have 

24 to use it at all.

 On the second hypothetical, you have to use 

52
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 it because you can't make a decision any other way. So 

2 you're saying: Use it at step one as one of the 

3 substantive reasons in your weighing analysis? 

4  MS. SAHARSKY: That, we think, would be more 

consistent with purposes --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you're going to do 

7 that, you have to tell me how much it weighs. You see, 

8 if you use it in step two when things are in equipoise, 

9 it doesn't matter how much it weighs. It's enough if it 

weighs a feather. In the equipoise case you come out 

11 the other way. 

12  But if you're going to use it in the first 

13 structural system to determine, you know, how much each 

14 side -- I have to know its weight. And there is no 

indication whatever as to what its weight is. It's 

16 really up to the district judge, I guess, to decide how 

17 much weight he is going to give to the fact that there 

18 is this conflict. 

19  MS. SAHARSKY: Can I answer the question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 

21  MS. SAHARSKY: I think the problem with this 

22 inquiry is that reasonableness does not have 

23 mathematical standards. It's a determination that the 

24 court needs to make weighing all of the facts and 

circumstances.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not reasonableness. 

6  MS. SAHARSKY: The conflict is one of many 

7 factors like the Social Security Administration's 

8 determination and how it was treated in this case that

unreasonable. I can't tell you that it weighs 10 

11 percent or 20 percent in every case. It is something

21  MS. POSNER: Thank you Your Honor. On

authority and says that the standard of review is an

1 arbitrary and capricious one in court, which is the same 

2 in ERISA as an abuse-of-discretion standard. 

3  And the -- and the fact that's common and 

4 known to the employer in setting forth that standard, 

that there is this dual role, shouldn't change that 

6 analysis at all, nor should it come into play in any 

7 significant way whatsoever in these decisions. But 

8 on question two, if there is a conflict that influence, 

9 that's not what the employer was anticipating. And so 

it -- it changes the size of the permissible field. And 

11 to get to Justice Scalia's point, the actual conflict 

12 there does matter because it changes the size of the 

13 field. It's not what the employer was intending in its 

14 plan. Now, if -- also on question two, if you view this 

as a --

that everybody knows exists --
