3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in case 11-1518, Bullock v. Bank Champaign. 

Mr. Byrne? 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. BYRNE 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. BYRNE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court: 

This case presents one of the most 

11 confounding questions of bankruptcy law, and that is the 

12 meaning of defalcation, which is found currently in 

13 Section 523(a)(4) of the Code. It is an undefined term 

14 in a Bankruptcy Code with more than 100 defined terms 

and it has been in the Bankruptcy Code -- Bankruptcy 

16 Act, excuse me, since 1841 and in every version of it 

17 since then. There is no plain contemporary, ordinary 

18 meaning that we can resort to, with respect to 

19 interpretation of the word because it is not in common 

use. 

21  This case presents both the question of the 

22 action required to establish defalcation and the mental 

23 state that most -- that must accompany it. And on the 

24 mental state issue, the circuits have split in probably 

three ways, at least.

1  The Eleventh Circuit here held that 


2 Petitioner committed defalcation by acting recklessly 


3 and affirmed on summary judgment -- a summary judgment 


4 order that was granted for the petitioning creditor. 


JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before we get to the 

6 various candidates for applicable mental state, if there 

7 is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies 

8 to? Does it apply to facts or does it apply to law? 

9  MR. BYRNE: Your Honor, it should apply to 

both, but it applies -- the act must be accompanied by a 

11 culpable mental state. We will argue that -- and have 

12 argued that mistake of law can be relevant to the 

13 knowledge that the actor has when he commits the act, 

14 and we have argued that in this particular circumstance 

particularly involving dischargeability, that a mistake 

16 of law ought to be permissible in responding to the 

17 claim of defalcation. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what we have here 

19 is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions 

were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the 

21 extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the 

22 investments that were made. So what, in addition to 

23 being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the 

24 government tells us should be enough to make 

defalcation, what else other than that it was not 

4

Official 

1 authorized and it was self-dealing? 

2  MR. BYRNE: Your Honor, we believe that a 

3 showing of extreme recklessness at least is required as 

4 to the self-dealing, and so we have advocated for the 

First and Second Circuit standard, which requires either 

6 extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the 

7 actor. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is a trustee who is 

9 taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life 

insurance making an investment for the benefit of 

11 himself and his mother getting profit from that 

12 investment and not sharing it with the other siblings 

13 who are also. So what more than -- I mean, he did that 

14 all advertently. 

MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, let me go back 

16 to the question, first were -- were the loans 

17 authorized? Now, this case -- the finding of 

18 defalcation here is based entirely on the two Illinois 

19 court orders in collateral estoppel. And the Illinois 

courts specifically reserved the question of whether the 

21 loans were authorized. But let me put that aside, 

22 please, and answer your second question. 

23  And what -- what sets this case apart and 

24 what -- what at least creates a factual question on 

whether Mr. Bullock committed defalcation was what was 

5

Official 

1 his -- what was the overall transaction. This is a 

2 family trust, it was created by his father, involving 

3 his father's life insurance policy. There is 

4 uncontradicted evidence that he did not know that making 

a loan to his mother at his father's request would 

6 somehow run afoul of the law more than a decade later 

7 when this all came -- when this all came to court. 

8  So we say, Your Honor, that there is at 

9 least a factual question that would have entitled him --

should have entitled him to a trial on the question of 

11 the mental state that accompanied his actions. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the two 

13 other transactions which were not done at the bidding of 

14 the father? 

MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, they were done 

16 at the bidding of the mother and also they were -- they 

17 went into the family business. These are two loans that 

18 went into the business created by the father and the 

19 mother, the garage building business. That's where the 

proceeds went. And so it would have been a surprise, we 

21 say, to the average person to learn that there was a 

22 legal problem with those loans. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it's 

24 often the case that -- that children don't want to go 

into the family business and it's often the case that 

6

1 some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that 

2 one of the children who wants to put the money back in 

3 the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think 

4 that was wrong when the other children want to take the 

money out or put it somewhere else. That's not at all 

6 unusual. 

7  MR. BYRNE: Well, it's not unusual to have 

8 some sort of conflict about that, Your Honor. But the 

9 record is very limited in this case as to what the 

preferences of the others were. It is -- it seems clear 

11 that --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Their preference is that 

13 they wanted a piece of the action. They still do. They 

14 want the profits from that investment. Whether they're 

entitled to it is a different issue, but --

16  MR. BYRNE: That -- that position seems 

17 clear now, Your Honor, that -- that background, these 

18 loans were made, please, recall, in the '80s. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I assume the other 

children did not have an interest in the business, but 

21 just the trustee and the mother did. Or is that clear 

22 from the record. 

23  MR. BYRNE: That is not clear from the 

24 record, Your Honor. I think I know the answer to that 

question, but it is not in the record in the case, so -­

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Could -- could you go back, 

2 please, to Justice Alito's question? I -- I don't 

3 understand the answer to that. That is, I don't 

4 understand, and it's just something I don't understand. 

I'm not saying it facetiously. I don't understand the 

6 relationship of mental state to the issue. 

7  I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt 

8 here that the individual, your client, knew what he was 

9 doing. He knew for a fact that he was taking money from 

the trust. He knew he was giving it to his mother. And 

11 he knows where it's going. And he knows it was later 

12 paid back with 6 percent interest. So you don't have to 

13 assume extreme recklessness. He knew it. 

14  Now, what he didn't know was that that was 

unlawful. And therefore, if I look at the accompanying 

16 things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I 

17 don't think any of them require a knowledge that what 

18 you're doing is unlawful. 

19  So if I -- or do they? I don't think -- you 

can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding 

21 the law of embezzlement. 

22  You can be convicted of larceny, it's 

23 saying. And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud 

24 lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he 

doesn't have to know there's a law against it. And -­

1 and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and 

2 comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you 

3 don't need to know that what you're doing is against the 

4 law, where you commit defalcation. 

Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was 

6 driving at. And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear 

7 answer on that. 

8  MR. BYRNE: Your Honor, let me -- let me 

9 try -- let me try to give such an answer. The first, 

with respect to larceny, embezzlement and fraud, a 

11 mistake of law is admissible where it negates the 

12 scienter or the mental state. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: But I didn't think there's 

14 any respect here in which admissing -- mistake of law, 

would negate the mental state as to having taken money 

16 from the trust, used it in the family business and then 

17 paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a 

18 different question I have, but for present purposes, we 

19 are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation. 

Is that right? Where does it, where does 

21 it negative the intent in respect to what happened? 

22  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, the knowledge 

23 of the law, knowledge of wrongdoing I think is what --

24 what you're asking, where does that come into this? And 

it comes into the question A, if you didn't have it; and

1 B, the question becomes was it extremely reckless under 


2 the scienter standard that the First and Second 


3 Circuits -- the First and Second Circuits follow --


4  JUSTICE BREYER: No, it had nothing to do 


with recklessness. He did these three things knowingly. 

6 That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a 

7 weaker one. 

8  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, but he did then 

9 without knowing that they --

JUSTICE BREYER: Were unlawful. So we're 

11 back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have 

12 no answer to the question because there is none. 

13  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, the -- in many 

14 instances, not many, but in some instances, the Court 

has held that not knowing that a practice is unlawful is 

16 a defense to a charge of the crime. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My problem is the 

18 following, which is let's assume he had taken the money 

19 and lost it and he never repaid it. What does it matter 

whether he thought he could take the money or not? I 

21 thought the very basic definition of defalcation in 

22 every dictionary of the time and forever, one of the 

23 three definitions has always been that you cause a loss 

24 to the -- to the trust. Why does mental state matter at 

all, is my bottom line?

1  I think that your stronger argument is that 

2 loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can 

3 direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the 

4 trust? But what does it matter whether I intended to 

lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it? 


6  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, the question 


7 would be whether or not on the mental state and I'll
 

8 get to the actus reus element of this quickly, but 


9 as to the mental state, if the mental state is not 


culpable, then it seems entirely inconsistent --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's Justice 

12 Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost 

13 it, what does it matter? You took it. Unless -- unless 

14 you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking 

the money and somebody else forced you to in some --

16 under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous 

17 question, isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer 

18 came to? If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of 

19 ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required 

to exercise the highest protection of the trust? 

21  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, of course, it 

22 does not save you from liability. Our issue here is 

23 dischargeability, which is a --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should you be 

discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act,

1 the actus reus --

2  MR. BYRNE: Because --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with its concomitant 

4 mental state. You intended to take the money. 

MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, because for 

6 dischargeability purposes, because of Gleason v. Thaw, 

7 and the rule that -- that bankruptcy discharge 

8 exceptions are confined to those plainly expressed 

9 doubts are resolved in favor of the debtor. And if you 

look at the other requirements for exceptions to 

11 discharge in Section 523(a) you see a high level of 

12 culpable conduct. For example, in Geiger the Court held 

13 that reckless torts do not amount --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but you see -- should 

I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have 

16 to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something 

17 about it. And as soon as I look at the other words, 

18 those are words like "embezzlement," "larceny," and 

19 "fraud." Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those 

are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse. It 

21 often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or 

22 some other technical violation. 

23  So I would have to explain why the word 

24 "defalcation" when linked to those three is being 

treated differently. Or I'd have to say Congress used 

12

25

Official 

1 words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse 

2 and meant them differently. Each of those is pretty 

3 hard to say. 

4  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, you're 

alluding to Cheek v. United States and Rasco v. United 

6 States, cases in which ignorance of the law, as an 

7 exception to the general rule, was found to be a defense 

8 in those cases. And what you had in those cases was a 

9 complex legal regime. You had the tax laws and then you 

had the -- anti-structuring statute. 

11  And here, we say that trust law in and of 

12 itself is a complex enough legal regime that a mistake 

13 of law at least ought to be admissible, not for 

14 liability, but for establishing bankruptcy --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have one other question 

16 on a different subject that may be more helpful to you 

17 or not. I think of defalcation as the individual who 

18 has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full 

19 of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of 

the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle 

21 and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to 

22 refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money 

23 belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and 

24 you run off with it. 

Is there anything you would like to say 

13

15

25

Official 

1 about that? 

2  MR. BYRNE: Yes, Your Honor. I would like 

3 to say that defalcation requires a shortage in accounts 

4 at the end of the day. And so there must be -- if it's 

a trust, there must be some res missing when the trustee 

6 is called to account. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there is a 

8 shortage of accounts at the end of the day. It's just a 

9 question of what day it is. When he takes -- takes the 

stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost 

11 opportunity or an increase in the risk to the 

12 beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point. 

13 The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the 

14 money. There is no loss to the bank, but it's still 

a crime. 

16  MR. BYRNE: Well, Your Honor, the deletion 

17 of the word "misappropriation" in 1978 from the 

18 Bankruptcy Code by Congress suggests that 

19 misappropriations that are on an interim basis that 

cause -- that do not cause a loss to the trust and 

21 are -- are never accounted for is not the kind of action 

22 or act that should result in an exception to discharge. 

23  But if you look with respect to defalcation 

24 at the definitions at the time, the definitions that 

were available in 1841 as I believe Justice Breyer has 

14

1 done, the -- the definitions you get are, for example in 

2 Webster's 1828 dictionary, the act of cutting off or 

3 deducting a part. 

4  And the origin of the defalcation exception, 

and I believe the amici for Respondent are correct in 

6 this respect, was the Swartwout scandal in 1838, when 

7 one Samuel Swartwout, who was the -- in charge of 

8 collections for the New York Customs House, which was a 

9 substantial part of the Federal budget at that time, was 

found after he departed the country to have $1.2 million 

11 missing from his accounts. And that was referred to as 

12 a defalcation at the time and it's quite reasonable to 

13 assume that's how it ended up in the statute. 

14  So the loss of res there -- the loss of 

funds to which the fiduciary is responsible for 

16 collecting at the time of -- that he turns over his 

17 office because this really originated with public 

18 officials, is the relevant time. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I guess the question is 

how do you measure this loss? I mean, if you take money 

21 away and then you give it back, or even if you give it 

22 back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe 

23 if that money had remained in the trust and I realize 

24 that this is a strange trust, but we have to think about 

other kinds of trusts, if that money had remained in the 

15

1 trust, there would have been a profit to be made from 

2 that money. 

3  And -- you know, it's not -- if you say, 

4 well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just 

left it there, you would have had that money plus all 

6 the money that that money earned. 

7  MR. BYRNE: Correct, Justice Kagan. But 

8 here, there was never any money taken from the trust 

9 that didn't wind up with the trust at the end of the 

day. The evidence is that the net policy value on the 

11 day Mr. Bullock unwittingly became a trustee in 1978 was 

12 the same as when he, at the end of his tenure --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- what about 

14 the profit from the transactions, the profit that he 

made? Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but 

16 in addition to that, according to the Illinois court's 

17 judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't 

18 put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust. 

19  MR. BYRNE: He was -- he was charged with 

having profited with respect to one or more of the 

21 loans, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: A quarter of a million 

23 dollars in loans. 

24  MR. BYRNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that did not go back

1 into the trust. 

2  MR. BYRNE: It did not. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: As it should. Doesn't the 

4 trustee have to disgorge whatever he makes by improper 

use of the trust funds? 

6  MR. BYRNE: He -- he does for liability 

7 purposes, of course, Justice Scalia. But here the 

8 question is whether there is a bankruptcy defalcation. 

9 And that's a question of Federal law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question 

11 that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he --

12 the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of 

13 this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right? 

14  MR. BYRNE: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Eleventh Circuit 

16 said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but 

17 the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the 

18 collateral. If you could sell the collateral, then you 

19 could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare 

bankruptcy. 

21  Did you bring such a suit, the suit that 

22 suggests that the bank was the culpable party here by 

23 not letting you sell the property which would have 

24 enabled you to pay the debt? 

MR. BYRNE: That -- that action has not been

1 brought, Your Honor. And in that action, let's say it 


2 were brought today, it could do nothing to relieve 


3 Petitioner of the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and 


4 the lower courts here that he has a debt that is -- a 


substantial debt that is excepted from discharge. He 

6 could continue litigating perhaps if he has the 

7 resources in -- in Illinois for many more years perhaps, 

8 but --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, give me your 

best answer to the rule that we should write, okay? 

11 Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental 

12 state, okay? Let's go to just the loss issue. 

13  If I agree with you that you need to prove 

14 the loss, this is a very unusual trust because the 

measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed. It 

16 was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest, 

17 essentially. This is a very unusual trust. In the 

18 norm, the trust just says to the trustee invest 

19 prudently. And the trustee self-deals by taking the res 

out, puts the investment in his or her own name and 

21 takes the profit. 

22  In that situation, how would you measure the 

23 loss? In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just 

24 has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of 

that investment value, would you say in that situation 

18

1 that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity? 

2  MR. BYRNE: Your Honor --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because there is a 

4 difference between what the trust loses and the gain 

that the trustee makes, which under normal trust 

6 principles the gain has to be disgorged. 

7  Are you separating out those two things and 

8 how are you separating them out and how would I -- how 

9 would we write -- the Court write this opinion to give 

loss meaning? What's the -- what's the meaning you want 

11 to give it? 

12  MR. BYRNE: Your Honor, the -- the loss to 

13 the trust should be measured by the economic loss to the 

14 trust between points A and point B. And -- and it's --

it's as simple as that, and of course here there wasn't 

16 loss to the trust. As you point out, it's an unusual 

17 situation perhaps, but of course life insurance trusts 

18 and other kinds of trusts that present this situation 

19 are --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So under your theory, 

21 the profit to the trustee is never a measurement. 

22  MR. BYRNE: The profit to the trustee would 

23 not come into play. It could come into play for fraud. 

24 It could come into play for embezzlement. It could come 

into play if the mental state that we argue for is

1 otherwise met. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume that that is 

3 distasteful because for all the reasons the government 

4 argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee 

could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary 

6 duty. 

7  So give me something that -- that would win 

8 your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation 

9 somehow should, in the norm, include something as 

egregious as self-dealing. You don't think your guy did 

11 because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case, 

12 the guy knew. 

13  MR. BYRNE: Well, for the -- for that worst 

14 case, Your Honor, there is embezzlement in the statute. 

So if a -- if someone comes into possession of property 

16 and misuses it and does so with fraudulent intent, it 

17 sounds like here, then there is a -- then embezzlement 

18 can be established under the statute. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Byrne, I -- I wasn't 

finished asking you about the background of this. It --

21 it seems the simplest thing, if the bank is the culprit, 

22 then why not go after the bank and then get the money 

23 which would make the Chapter 7 unnecessary? 

24  MR. BYRNE: Your Honor, there is a good bit

2 explanation for that. There is in the record a 

3 consistent track of Petitioner trying to get the bank to 

4 sell the collateral in order to pay the debt off over 

time and with an urgency to it because the collateral 


6 was deteriorating in value. But beyond that, there's 


7 not anything else in the record about the practicality 


8 or availability of the remedies in the Illinois court. 


9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was what the 


Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem. 

11  MR. BYRNE: It was, Your Honor. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And were they wrong in --

13  MR. BYRNE: As a practical matter, Your 

14 Honor, yes, and also as a legal matter because the 

Illinois courts cannot set aside the order here 

16 excepting the debt from discharge. 

17  The only -- the only agenda potentially left 

18 for Petitioner would be litigation in the -- in the 

19 Illinois courts against the trustee to create some sort 

of a judgment that might be used in some way to 

21 ameliorate the effect of the bankruptcy court's 

22 judgment, but he still has -- basically, he's been 

23 consigned to permanent insolvency the way that this

1 on your side of the case say, well -- you know, there is 

2 a series of words here: Fraud, defalcation, 

3 embezzlement, larceny. 

4  But really, fraud and defalcation are 

defined in a further way where embezzlement and larceny 

6 are not. Fraud and defalcation, while acting in a 

7 fiduciary capacity, then embezzlement and larceny. 

8  So I'm not quite sure it's fair to say that 

9 all four words must be consulted for the use of 

generous because fraud and defalcation are qualified by 

11 "in a fiduciary capacity" and then a comma. 

12  MR. BYRNE: Well, that is correct, Your 

13 Honor, that -- that that's the way that this particular 

14 version of the Bankruptcy Act is set up. 

In the past however, in Neal v. Clark, in an 

16 important decision by this Court in 1878, the Court held 

17 that fraud should be construed to require fraud with 

18 moral turpitude because of the presence of embezzlement 

19 in the 18 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. In that respect, I 

21 think the word "fraud" gives you some assistance in 

22 arguing your case.

2  Mr. Bensinger? 

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILL D. BENSINGER 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. BENSINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

6 it please the Court: 

7  The Petitioner's act of self-dealing was a 

8 reckless breach of his fiduciary duty of loyalty and was 

9 therefore a defalcation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there a finding of 

11 recklessness in the State court? 

12  MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor. There was 

13 not a finding of recklessness. The State court simply 

14 found that the debtor engaged in self-dealing. That he 

used trust assets for his own purposes and, thereby, 

16 created a split, a conflict of interest between his 

17 interest and the interest of the trust. 

18  The moment that he made those loans, there 

19 is an absolute certainty that there would be a conflict 

of interest and a reasonable person -- a reasonable 

21 trustee in the Petitioner's position would not have made 

22 those loans because the risk was so high, nigh on an 

23 absolute certainly, that there would be this conflict of 

24 interest, and that is when the harm occurred at the 

moment he made the loans, Your Honor.

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the crime of 

2 embezzlement proven if you show recklessness? Or do you 

3 need a further criminal intent? 

4  MR. BENSINGER: Generally speaking, Your 

Honor, embezzlement does require some sort of specific 

6 mental intent, an intent to deceive or to defraud. But 

7 defalcation does not require that same mental intent and 

8 that's borne out by the history. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's 

one of the things we are arguing about here. I don't 

11 think that's conceded. 

12  MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor, it's 

13 certainly not conceded, but it's borne out in the 

14 history of the Bankruptcy Act. Defalcation was first 

added to the Bankruptcy Act in 1841 and it was simply an 

16 exception to discharge for defalcation. There was no 

17 mention of fraud, there was no mention of embezzlement, 

18 there was no mention of larceny. It wasn't until 1867 

19 that Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, that 

Congress added an exception to discharge for 

21 embezzlement and for fraud. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: You think recklessness is 

23 required?

2  MR. BENSINGER: Yes, Your Honor. 

3 Recklessness is required as to the objective act. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Recklessness as to the law, 

as to what the law requires of the trustee. 

6  MR. BENSINGER: Recklessness as to the law, 

7 correct, Your Honor, but also as to the act. This was a 

8 reckless act. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, yes. Wait, wait. You 

say -- you mean either, both? I mean, there is no doubt 

11 here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned. 

12 It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional. So you 

13 don't have to worry about that one. 

14  Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd 

like to hear your answer to. I thought it might have 

16 come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take 

17 it, that there has to be an element in which the person 

18 not only knows what he has done, but that he does it 

19 with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that 

the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and 

21 then fill in the blanks, or? 

22  MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor, and I 

23 apologize if I misspoke. All that is required is an 

24 intent to do the act and that's what --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then if that's

1 your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy 

2 said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement 

3 and larceny are set off. These two concern fraud and 

4 defalcation in respect to the trust. There is a case of 

this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust 

6 requires an element of moral turpitude. 

7  That suggests a knowledge that what you are 

8 doing violates the law. And if we read in pari materia, 

9 we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed 

more so. Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in 

11 respect to embezzlement, which is outside the 

12 parenthesis. 

13  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, fraud, like 

14 embezzlement, does require a specific mental intent, but 

defalcation does not. Defalcation --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Defalcation on your 

17 definition would seem to be more likely to be thought 

18 innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances 

19 than would fraud. 

MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, defalcation must 

21 mean something other than fraud. The statute says 

22 that --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: No. It may mean, for 

24 example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was 

you took some money that belonged to the trust given by

I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct 


6 was as described.

8  MR. BENSINGER: When it's described like

12 reckless act, Your Honor, in that a reasonable

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Where 

does this reckless act come from? Where do you get 

16 reckless act out of either fraud or defalcation?

19 defalcation does require some form of reckless --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps so. Where did they 

21 get it from?

1 the money is missing? What does it matter the reason 

2 why in terms of recklessness or intent? You took the 

3 money. Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to 

4 take the money. So why are you adopting the need for 

recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second 

6 component that the other side's talking about, which is 

7 that you caused a loss to the trust? Because that's 

8 where you have a problem here, where you have a problem 

9 because there really is no loss to the trust in a 

traditional sense. 

11  MR. BENSINGER: Possibly in the traditional 

12 sense there might not have been a loss, but there was a 

13 loss in the context of trust law, Your Honor. The 

14 Petitioner in this case used trust funds for his own 

benefit. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the problem is 

17 that, yes, there was a breach of the trust. But in 

18 terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every 

19 penny that it would have earned if the money had not 

been taken. It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent 

21 that the trust was entitled to. So it suffered no loss 

22 in its traditional sense. 

23  MR. BENSINGER: Maybe not in the traditional 

24 sense, but in the context of a fiduciary obligation a 

trustee is not allowed to benefit from his position as

1 trustee. 


2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the -- why are you 


3 giving away that it's not in the traditional sense? I 


4 think it's a loss in the traditional sense. The trust 


was entitled to whatever profit was made from the use of 

6 its funds, right? 

7  MR. BENSINGER: Correct, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And he made a quarter 

9 million dollars that should have belonged to the trust. 

It's not enough to say, well -- you know, I'll pay you 2 

11 percent interest or whatever the going rate of interest 

12 was. He made $250,000 which should have been given to 

13 the trust. 

14  MR. BENSINGER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And that is what the Illinois State court found, and 

16 that is borne out also by the other exceptions to 

17 discharge in Section 523(a)(4). If a fraudster commits 

18 fraud, he doesn't just remedy that by paying back what 

19 he took. He has to return all of the profits that he 

has obtained. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: But the question here -- the 

22 question here is not whether the trustee is liable. 

23 Yes, the trustee is liable. The question is whether 

24 it's dischargeable. 

MR. BENSINGER: Correct, Your Honor.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: And if you look at the 

2 other, the other words in this list, fraud, 

3 embezzlement, larceny, those are -- those are bad acts. 

4 There is a degree of moral culpability involved and 

maybe there are people who commit fraud, embezzlement 

6 and larceny and don't realize that it's illegal, but 

7 there are not many. It's commonly understood that those 

8 are bad. 

9  So in a very impressionistic sense, there is 

a difference between that and the kind of conduct that's 

11 presented to us here. But you think that's irrelevant. 

12  MR BENSINGER: It is irrelevant, Your Honor, 

13 because a reasonable trustee would not act this way. A 

14 reasonable trustee would know that the moment he makes 

loans to himself he has created a conflict of interest 

16 between himself and his trust. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about a 

18 reasonable trustee who just invests very imprudently, an 

19 unreasonable trustee who invests very imprudently? Any 

reasonable trustee would realize that investing 

21 in -- you know, the widget factory totally unrelated to 

22 him is a really bad idea and money is lost there. 

23  What about that trustee? Is that a 

24 defalcation.

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Is it -- before we leave 

3 this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a 

4 picture of they're being innocent. But we are in a 

court that this Court has described as a court of equity 

6 or akin thereto. 

7  MR. BENSINGER: Yes, sir. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: One principle I used to 

9 learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, 

but not anybody else. 

11  Now, we have two lower courts that are 

12 saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least 

13 they don't understand it. That this, the other client 

14 has tried to get him to sell the property, but they 

write the properties are abandoned and uninsurable. 

16 Even though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't 

17 sell it. And so do you have clean hands? Not you 

18 yourself. You didn't take the money and you do not 

19 have dirty hands, all right? 

But did your client here, does he lack clean 

21 hands because two courts have said he should have just 

22 sold his collateral and he would have gotten the money 

23 and saved everybody a lot of trouble? 

24  MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

Official 

1  MR. BENSINGER: Because, first of all, the 

2 bankruptcy court never made any specific finding of 

3 facts. Those were allegations that were included in --

4 in the record of the district court --

JUSTICE BREYER: Did we remand it so they 

6 could? 

7  MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor, because the 

8 Petitioner had every opportunity to bring those facts 

9 into -- into evidence at the bankruptcy court and he did 

not. There are facts outside the record as there are on 

11 both sides with regard to this issue, why the trust 

12 would not allow subsequent sales. 

13  But it does go back to an important point, 

14 and that's that the Petitioner did have, and retains 

today, an opportunity to go back to State court and seek 

16 a reduction in this judgment should he so desire. 

17  A reduction in the judgment would reduce the 

18 debt, and if there is no debt, then there is nothing for 

19 the trust to collect subsequent to this discharge or 

subsequent to the lack of discharge, as Respondent is 

21 requesting. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there's nothing in the 

23 record that shows why the bank refused to release any of 

24 the collateral? 

MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor, there is

1 not. That was not an issue that ultimately came before 

2 the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court made no 

3 finding of facts. There were only allegations on appeal 

4 to the district court and to the Eleventh Circuit, Your 

Honor. 

6  However, to return back to the point 

7 concerning that the required mental intent or the mens 

8 rea, both in the petition and here this morning, the 

9 Petitioner has not been able to articulate exactly what 

mens rea is required, that is, what mental intent is 

11 required. But the mental intent that he asked is that 

12 it be something greater than extreme recklessness, in 

13 effect. 

14  However, that cannot work in the code 

because it would make other code sections superfluous. 

16 Specifically, if the mental intent required were an 

17 intent to cause an injury, Section 523(a)(6) of the 

18 Bankruptcy Code already accepts from discharge debts for 

19 willful and malicious injury. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a number of 

21 embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully 

22 intend to pay everything back once things turn out all 

23 right. But there's still an embezzlement. But there is 

24 also a criminal intent at the time, or a wrongful 

intent, even if -- even if you plan to pay it back.

1  And it -- it seems to me that you're 

2 standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means 

3 something different than fraud in the first clause, or 

4 embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause. 

MR. BENSINGER: It does, Your Honor. 

6 Defalcation when it was first introduced into the 

7 Bankruptcy Act in 1841 had a known meaning, and that 

8 known meaning, at least according to the Oxford English 

9 Dictionary, is a monetary deficiency through breach of 

trust. 

11  That was when the --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the problem is, as 

13 the -- your friend on the other side points out, that 

14 there's two problems with this. Number one, it's not 

consistent with these -- with the meaning of the other 

16 three terms in the -- in the statute; and two, it's not 

17 consistent with the idea that discharges should be 

18 freely given so that debtors can begin again. 

19  MR. BENSINGER: But, Your Honor, the 

subsequent inclusion of the terms fraud, embezzlement 

21 and larceny cannot retroactively modify or change the 

22 known definition of the word defalcation. This Court in 

23 Schwager v. Northern Burlington considered two sections 

24 of -- or two statutes in the Securities and Exchange 

Act, Section 14(e) and Section 10(b). Section 10(b) was 

34
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 the first enacted statute. Section 14(e) was 

2 subsequently enacted. 

3  Both statutes prohibited a manipulative type 

4 of transaction with regard to securities. Section 14(e) 

also prohibited a fraudulent act with regard to 

6 securities. This Court stated in that case -- while it 

7 wasn't central to its holding -- the Court did state 

8 that the inclusion of the term "fraudulent" in Section 

9 14(e) could not modify the understanding of the term 

"manipulative." 

11  And the same logic applies here. The 

12 subsequent inclusion of the terms "fraudulent" and 

13 "embezzlement" and "larceny" cannot modify the known 

14 meaning, even if that known meaning has been lost, the 

meaning of the word "defalcation." 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bensinger, if I heard 

17 you correctly, you said that the definition was a 

18 monetary deficiency arising from a breach of trust. Is 

19 that -- does that mean that you're conceding that there 

has to be a loss of monetary deficiency? 

21  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, there was a 

22 monetary deficiency in this case when the --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Whether there was or was not 

24 in this case, but you're conceding that there has to be 

a monetary deficiency according to the traditional

1 definitions. 

2  MR. BENSINGER: Yes, Your Honor. For there 

3 to be even a debt, which is what the Bankruptcy Code 

4 discharges, there must be a monetary deficiency in this 

case, or in the case of a defalcation. 

6  And that is what this Court --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are we fighting about 

8 the meaning of loss? That's really the question. 

9  MR. BENSINGER: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are we fighting about 

11 what loss means? 

12  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, that is 

13 certainly an issue that the parties have contested in 

14 the briefs before this Court and in the courts below, 

whether there was a loss. And there was a loss. The 

16 State court recognized that there was a loss in the 

17 amount of $250,000. 

18  That judgment of $250,000 creates a claim. 

19 The Bankruptcy Code in Section 101-5 defines a claim as 

a right to payment. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he made 

22 nothing on the deal, and it just turns out he got 

23 whatever the -- the trust was getting under its interest 

24 rate and gave it back, there'd be no defalcation because 

there'd be no loss in the sense of a lost opportunity?

understood your answer to Justice Kagan to be that 

6 you -- there must be a loss, right? 

7  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, there -- there 

8 needs to be a loss for there to be a debt. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Does there 

have to be a loss for there to be a defalcation? 

11  MR. BENSINGER: No, Your Honor. 

12 If I'm inconsistent in that answer, I apologize. I did 

13 not intend to be. There must be a loss for there to be 

14 a debt. For there to be a defalcation, that merely goes 

to the bad act. The act of, in this case, self-dealing. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So taking the money 

17 out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought 

18 back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity. 

19  MR. BENSINGER: Correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not consistent with 

21 the original meaning of defalcation to which you were 

22 appealing. It's pretty clear to me that the original

11 has to be a cutting off. There has to be a loss, for 

12 defalcation. Not just for -- for a debt, but also for 

13 the defalcation. 

14  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, at that point, 

there was a --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why are you fighting that? 

17 You're going to have to prove the loss anyway. You say 

18 there is a loss. 

19  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, the loss in that 

case occurs -- Your Honor is absolutely right -- at the 

21 time that there is that cutting off, at the time in this 

22 case the Petitioner used the trust assets for his own 

23 benefit. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: And then what's the loss? 

I mean, let's assume the trust was worth $1 million plus

1 6 percent, and every year, they have in their coffer $1 

2 million plus 6 percent. 

3  MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: The only part they don't 

have is the extra money that the trustee made, that 

6 there is no cutting down of the size of the trust. At 

7 least that's an argument. Now, what's the answer? 

8  MR. BENSINGER: Because, Your Honor, the 

9 loss occurred. There was a loss in the amount of the 

loans that he took out. And that loss was compounded, 

11 if you will, Your Honor, by the Petitioner's failure to 

12 return those -- the proceeds of those loans --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But he did. This is the 

14 unusual part of this trust, which is that by the terms 

of this trust, it was only going to grow at principal 

16 plus a fixed interest. Most trusts are not written this 

17 way. 

18  This is the highly unusual trust, where it 

19 never -- should have made more money because taking the 

Chief Justice's hypothetical, which is he had invested 

21 it and just gotten the interest due, why would there be 

22 a defalcation? 

23  What's the loss opportunity or the loss that 

24 you would have suffered? 

MR. BENSINGER: Your Honor, the loss that

1 the trust suffered was that its principal was taken 

2 away, was it invested by the trustee for his own 

3 benefit --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. But let's assume a 

different fact scenario, that he didn't make $250,000, 

6 that he happened to make just the amount of the interest 

7 required, and he paid all of that back just as he did 

8 here, what would have been the defalcation under the 

9 Chief Justice's hypothetical? 

MR. BENSINGER: The defalcation there, Your 

11 Honor, would be that the trustee has split his interest, 

12 has created a conflict of interest, and that causes a 

13 loss. There might not be a monetary -- a straight 

14 monetary loss at that time. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I've never heard of a 

16 defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss. 

17 What would have been the monetary loss in the Chief's 

18 hypothetical? 

19  MR. BENSINGER: In that case, Your Honor, 

there would not have been a strict monetary loss in that 

21 hypothetical had the -- all the proceeds -- had there 

22 not been any benefit that the trustee obtained from the 

23 investment and use of those funds.

9  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

11  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 

12  MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

13 please the Court: 

14  No particular mens rea is inherent in the 

term "defalcation" or the structure of Section 

16 523(a)(4). 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Unlike fraud -- fraud, 

18 larceny and embezzlement? 

19  MR. GANNON: Each of those terms does have 

some mens rea associated with it. It is not, however, 

21 the willfulness requirement that my friend was invoking 

22 on the other side. There is no obligation under any of 

23 those that there be an intentional violation of a known 

24 legal duty.

1 think we know that this can't be -- it can't have that 

2 mens rea because that would make it superfluous. That's 

3 what Judge Hand said in the Herbst decision, and that's 

4 what even the Second Circuit and the First Circuit 

recognized here, that they could not adopt the same mens 

6 rea that belongs with the other terms here and I --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 

8  MR. GANNON: Pardon? 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Because? I mean, I thought 

defalcation is -- supposes that the person does pack his 

11 suitcases with the money and he goes and shows up in 

12 Rio. I take it that would be defalcation. That isn't 

13 fraud. 

14  MR. GANNON: That would probably be 

embezzlement and it would be superfluous in that sense. 

16 I think that the dictionary definitions, if you look at 

17 the dictionary definitions of defalcation that we quote 

18 on pages 10 and 11 of our brief, both the English 

19 dictionary definitions and the legal dictionary 

definitions, they basically --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But you didn't cite to the

1 it was confirmed by my law clerks, it comes from 

2 medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut 

3 down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction. 

4  MR. GANNON: We did quote the Samuel Johnson 

dictionary and the Webster's 1828 dictionary that have 

6 that meaning. If you look at the Oxford English 

7 Dictionary definition, that was an obsolete meaning. 

8  And I think that it's quite clear that the 

9 meaning that Congress was invoking here is what is dealt 

with under heading five in the Oxford English 

11 Dictionary. And my friend quoted it earlier, there is 

12 either a monetary deficiency through a breach of trust 

13 by one who has the management or charge of funds --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, monetary deficiency, 

again, isn't that a loss? But I thought that your 

16 position was that there didn't need to be a loss. 

17  MR. GANNON: Well, there are two questions 

18 there and I think that one of the illustrative 

19 quotations that the OED uses for that very definition 

doesn't actually refer to a monetary deficiency, and 

21 neither do most of the other dictionary definitions. So 

22 I do think that there's probably an open question about 

23 what the purest meaning of the term defalcation, whether 

24 it requires a loss. 

Here, we do think that there is a loss.

1 There is a loss in a very real and traditional sense. 

2 There is no doubt about it that because the Petitioner 

3 took -- engaged in self-dealing and made a profit with 

4 that, with the money that he had taken out of the trust 

corpus and refused to return those profits to the trust, 

6 that is a loss to the trust, just as it would be had he 

7 taken the money and invested it in some great investment 

8 scheme and -- or he decided to bet it at the track --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's certainly 

true --

11  MR. GANNON: -- and he decided --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- in an ordinary trust, but 

13 isn't there a real question as to this trust because if 

14 this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been 

investing this in the first place. All that this trust 

16 was going to get was the principal plus a fixed income. 

17  MR. GANNON: I don't think that's a fair 

18 statement of the way this trust operates. It's not 

19 consistent with Petitioner's own arguments. 

Petitioner's argument in the State court and in the 

21 Bankruptcy Court, the argument that he says is the 

22 reason why there is no -- no determination about whether 

23 this was an authorized use of the money under the trust 

24 instrument is that -- that he was allowed to invest the 

assets of the trust.

1  And so the way the courts -- and the parties 

2 have offered to lodge the trust instrument with the 

3 Court. As I understand it it's not otherwise in the 

4 record. But the point here is that he did --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you just repeat 

6 what you said? Your voice turned. 

7  MR. GANNON: The last part I said, that the 

8 parties have offered to lodge the trust instrument with 

9 the Court, but my understanding is that it's not in the 

record. But I don't think anybody has taken the 

11 position that the only thing that could ever be in the 

12 trust was the life insurance policy plus 6 percent. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I 

14 understood. So you're saying that that is not the case? 

MR. GANNON: I believe that that is not the 

16 case and that is not even consistent with Petitioner's 

17 own position in the State court, where he said he was 

18 taking this money and investing it in some alternative 

19 thing because he thought that would be safer than 

leaving the money with the life insurance company. 

21  And I think if I can go back to explaining 

22 why I think that this is a loss and so I think that this 

23 trust is not as unusual or unique as you think it is, in 

24 part because we don't have the language of it in front 

of us.

1  But secondly, I was trying to say that had 

2 he taken this money for an authorized purpose or not and 

3 decided he was going to go invest it, he had some boffo 

4 scheme, he had some friend who had a great stock tip, or 

he had a tip at the races and he was going to go down to 

6 the track and bet this money, and he made 1,000 percent. 

7  And he decided, well, you know what, had I 

8 not taken the money out of the trust all I would have to 

9 do is return, all I have to do is make it whole in the 

sense of having the 6 percent that it otherwise would 

11 have had. That everybody would understand, that's a 

12 breach of his duty of loyalty. That's a defalcation. 

13 It is an injury to the trust. It is a loss in every 

14 relevant sense. 

And in addition here, the $35,000 that the 

16 State court awarded for attorney's fees and costs is 

17 also another concrete loss to the estate. And this 

18 Court's decision in Cohen v. De la Cruz, which was about 

19 nondischargeability of a fraud judgment, of a debt for 

fraud, said that that debt for fraud included all of the 

21 legal liability associated with the underlying fraud --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there is two 

23 components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the 

24 $250,000 profit. And you're representing to me right 

now that, as a trustee, he was entitled to invest that

1 fund for the trust? And so there was a lost opportunity 

2 here as well? 

3  MR. GANNON: It's not that there -- it's not 

4 the opportunity loss. It's not the fact that the trust 

wasn't already earning the interest in the -- vis-à-vis 

6 the insurance company as it otherwise would. 

7 Petitioner's position is if he already gave back the 

8 money that it would have earned in interest vis-à-vis 

9 the insurance company, my position, the government's 

position, is that the loss here is that he failed to 

11 disgorge the profits that he made by self-dealing in the 

12 assets of the trust corpus. That is a --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: What about the other 

14 argument? I just don't want you to leave without 

addressing the other argument. 

16  MR. GANNON: The other argument --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: In your brief you talk 

18 about and quote "Learned Hand" and say it means -- "If 

19 it doesn't mean a deliberate malversation," said Learned 

Hand --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: "Malversation." 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: -- then it must be the same 

23 as fraud or embezzlement. So I will go look up 

24 "malversation" as soon as I return to my office, and I 

will get that.

1  Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a 


2 loss. Two, done deliberately, but with an innocent 


3 state of mind because he didn't understand the law. 


4 Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that 


fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision 

6 requires some degree of moral turpitude. Well, that 

7 suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to 

8 knowledge that it's against the law. What about that? 

9  MR. GANNON: My response to that is that the 

Neal v. Clark decision that's being discussed here is --

11 and we discuss this in our brief -- is distinguishable 

12 in part because its current descendent is actually not 

13 this provision. It is not this reference to fraud. It 

14 is the exception from discharge in paragraph (a)(2)(A). 

And what makes this different is that this 

16 is fraud in a fiduciary capacity which was not true in 

17 the context of Neal v. Clark, and that's something that 

18 the Court said at the time, that because it did not 

19 actually have the limitations of the fiduciary context, 

they needed to infer some type of limitation. They 

21 inferred it, the Court inferred it, from embezzlement. 

22  And so going back to Justice Kennedy's 

23 question, the way Congress has dealt with that is that 

24 it has put actual fraud in (a)(2)(A), and here it has 

grouped fraud with defalcation in a fiduciary capacity 

48

1 and therefore it includes the type of limitation that 


2 the Court was trying to impose in Neal v. Clark. 


3  We don't think that there is any inherent 


4 mens rea in defalcation and --


JUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain what you 

6 mean, before your time expires, in footnote 18? I 

7 understood your argument until I got there, but then you 

8 said that there was no particular mental state required. 

9 And then in footnote 18 you said, well, there may be 

cases where a particular mental state is required. 

11  MR. GANNON: Well, I think when it gets 

12 further away from the heartland definition of 

13 defalcation, which does -- which, as we discussed in 

14 this Court's 1844 decision in Chapman and in the 1841 

bankruptcy law, the defalcation was equated with 

16 self-dealing in trust assets. And so we think that's 

17 the heart of defalcation. 

18  As you move away from that particular type 

19 of fiduciary breach, and if you move away from there it 

may become more relevant whether there is --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Where are courts supposed to 

22 look to find out what is the border between the 

23 heartland of defalcation and the badlands of defalcation 

24 and whatever else? 

MR. GANNON: Well, to be fair, the 

49
 
Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 dictionary definitions are broad enough to include other 

2 types of fiduciary breaches, but it's not clear that 

3 that means that defalcation needs to be doing all the 

4 work here of potentially putting limits on the scope of 

the exception. 

6  And so if you look at the Ninth Circuit, for 

7 instance, the way it has handled this is it has 

8 recognized, as we do, that defalcation can be innocent 

9 and -- but it has, it has concluded that the essence of 

defalcation is the failure to account for or to produce 

11 funds, and therefore it wouldn't be something that would 

12 just be garden variety mismanagement of the assets. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not? I mean, 

14 it's a -- it's a violation of the trustee's 

responsibility when he makes a negligent investment of 

16 the funds, right? 

17  And so he doesn't turn over as much money as 

18 should be turned over. It's a defalcation. 

19  MR. GANNON: Well, we certainly do think 

that that may well be the ultimate answer. We think 

21 that would be further away from the core of defalcation, 

22 but it's not this case, so we would urge the Court to 

23 affirm.

6 the trust instrument, I think you'll see does not 

7 expressly authorize him to do that. He's making -- he 

8 was making an argument --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume his 

argument that he could. 

11  MR. BYRNE: If the argument is or if the 

12 trust provided that he could invest in other things and 

13 it made him prudent investments, then there could be a 

14 loss to the trust. Then his mental state would -- would 

be poor. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then we have to go back 

17 to -- to the first issue, whether a mental state is 

18 required or not. 

19  MR. BYRNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

Now, to respond to a few things said by Respondent and 

21 by the solicitor, the Petitioner actually did put into 

22 the record when he opposed summary judgment pro se in 

23 the bankruptcy court all of his evidence about what 

24 he -- what should have been done with the money that was 

in the constructive trust, what should have been done 

52
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 with the property that was in the constructive trust 

2 during that period. 

3  He put that in -- in evidence, it's in the 

4 record and his repeated pleas that the assets be sold to 

pay the judgment are reflected by that. 

6  The Respondent relied entirely on the two 

7 Illinois court orders and put in no evidence other than 

8 the original pleadings, if they are evidence, in the --

9 in the Illinois case. So there is that question about 

the record, and Petitioner did track what -- what his 

11 efforts were to try to persuade the trustee to consent 

12 to the sale of the property. 

13  And it's interesting, the constructive 

14 trust, of course, was imposed on the properties that 

were acquired with loans two and three. So if there are 

16 any profit from the loans, they would have been caught 

17 in those properties. And eventually, of course, they 

18 were not sold. 

19  But to determine the amount of the loss 

here, a trial would be needed. And that's really why we 

21 were hoping the Court will give us -- give Mr. Bullock a 

22 day in court here to establish under the proper legal 

23 standard what any loss really was, if there was one. 

24  And it was said earlier that a conflict of 

interest itself is a defalcation, but not if there's no 

53

1 loss. That's just -- that's entirely inconsistent with 

2 the other exceptions to discharge in the Code. 

3  Mr. Gannon read the -- noted that the 

4 dictionary definitions evolved over time, but the 1856 

definition of defalcation from Bouvier's Law Dictionary 

6 that's quoted in the government's brief actually still 

7 reflects the -- the idea that -- or the definition that 

8 defalcation is the act of a defaulter. And a defaulter 

9 is defined as, "one who fails in making his accounts 

correct." 

11  So by 1856, years after the first enactment 

12 of defalcation, that was still the definition that was 

13 prevailing in the day, at least according to that 

14 dictionary, and according to the others that -- that we 

cite earlier. 

16  Petitioner here made a mistake in judgment. 

17 There was never any finding of dishonesty on his part. 

18 There was never any finding that he acted with a 

19 malicious intent. In fact, there was a finding that he 

acted with no apparent malicious intent in the Illinois 

21 courts. This question is one of dischargeability, and 

22 his debt is really what bankruptcy is for. It's for a 

23 fresh start for an honest, but unfortunate debtor. 

24  Unless the Court has any further questions, 

that concludes my argument.
