 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this afternoon in Case 09-400, Staub v. Proctor 

Hospital.

 Mr. Schnapper.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The dismissal of an employee is often the 

result of the interrelated actions and decisions of 

several officials. Whether an employer is legally 

responsible for any particular official and his or her 

actions and decisions turns on agency law. Congress 

legislates against a background of agency law and is 

presumed to have intended agency principles to govern 

that kind of question. Agency law, not the Eleventh 

Circuit's "cat's paw" doctrine, is the controlling 

standard here.

 There are two principal agency doctrines on 

which liability can be based.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before we jump to 

agency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of 

the statute?

MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the statute says that a 

prima facie case is made out if it is shown that 

military service, anti-military animus, was a motivating 

factor in the employer's action.

 The employer's action here was discharge, 

right?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the word "motivate" 

means to provide someone with a motive to do something, 

right?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the person who did 

something here was the person who discharged, discharged 

Mr. Staub, right?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, that's not the -­

JUSTICE ALITO: So why doesn't it follow 

that the motivation that's relevant under the statute is 

the motivation of the person who -- who performs the 

action that is challenged?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, there's a -- there are 

a series of actions and decisions that yield this 

result. The reference in the statute is to the actions 

of the employer, not to any particular official. And 

so -­

right? Not everything that's done, not -- just writing 

up a bad report for a biased reason is not actionable 

under this statute; isn't that correct?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct. But a 

decision to -- the decision to dismiss an official is -­

can be, and is here, the result, the cumulative result, 

of a series of decisions.

 It's not unlike what occurs in -- in the 

criminal justice system. Only a sentencing judge can 

send a defendant to prison, but that decision actually 

is a result of a series of other decisions, all of which 

are government action. We think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but you say 

that those decisions that contribute have to be 

decisions by supervisory personnel. If your theory is 

correct, I don't know why that is so. I don't know why 

a co-employee who has a hostile motivation and makes a 

report to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the 

individual, why that -- that wouldn't qualify as well.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, our standard is not 

whether it's a supervisor, but whether it's an official 

for whom the employer is liable under agency law. That 

would not be every supervisor. If a -- if a supervisor

unrelated to this particular department put a false 

charge in a -- a suggestion box, that wouldn't be any 

different.

 Ordinarily, a coworker wouldn't qualify 

under agency principles as an agent of the employer when 

engaging in that conduct. You have to look at the 

specific conduct and apply the traditional agency 

standards. They are laid out, for example, in the 

Court's decision in Ellerth, which refers to the two 

branches of agency law: scope of employment, and action 

which is aided in, where the actor was aided in the 

conduct by his or her official position.

 And I think those principles would not 

ordinarily apply to a coworker, but they would also not 

apply invariably to a supervisor. This isn't -- we're 

not advocating the supervisor versus non-supervisor 

distinction in Ellerth, but -- but a return to just the 

traditional agency doctrines. And we think those 

doctrines delineate who is the employer for the purpose 

of the statute, which bans action by the employer.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the employer would 

be liable for these lower supervisory employees here 

why? Did they have authority to discharge?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, they had other 

authorities. They had -- well, there are two -- two

doctrines.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do they stand in 

different shoes from a co-employee who also contributes 

to the ultimate decision to fire?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: But it's -- it's the core 

responsibility of -- in terms of scope of employment, 

it's the core responsibility of a supervisor of a 

particular individual to be monitoring his or her 

behavior, reporting on it, perhaps initiating 

disciplinary matters -- measures.

 That wouldn't be true of all supervisors. 

It's only true of Mr. Staub's supervisors. So -- what 

-- the kind of thing they did was the kind of work that 

they were employed to engage in, and that distinguishes 

them from, say, another supervisor who might slip a note 

into a suggestion box.

 Second, the other branch, major branch, of 

agency law is that an employer is liable for actions of 

individuals when their conduct -- when they are aided in 

their conduct by their official position, which would 

not typically be true of a fellow worker. But that 

could be true here.

 For example, Mulally set much of this in 

motion when, on the plaintiff's version of the facts, 

she issued the January 27th corrective order. Everyone

agrees she wrote it. She signed it. She was aided in 

doing that by her position as a supervisor. A coworker 

couldn't do that. And indeed, somebody else's 

supervisor couldn't have done that. So -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I just ask where -­

could I ask where your argument leads? Let's say that 

an employer calls in an employee and says: Now, we have 

to decide who to lay off, and we've looked at your 

record over the last 10 years, and here it is, all the 

evaluations you've gotten over the past 10 years, and 

based on all of that, we -- we've decided that you're 

going to be the person to be laid off.

 Now, if it turns out that one of those 

evaluations was rendered by someone who had an 

anti-military bias, would that make the employee -­

would that be a prima facie case against the employer?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it would. But -­

time did every -- made every reasonable effort to 

investigate the validity of all the prior evaluations,

the statute or in the common law that creates a special

rule for thorough investigation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a sweeping 

rule. I was going to ask a related hypothetical. 

Suppose the -- the officer who's in charge, charged with 

the decision to terminate or not to terminate, says: 

I'm going to have a hearing. You can both have counsel. 

And you have -- who is it -- suppose Buck -- suppose the 

two employees that were allegedly anti-military here 

testified, and they said there was no anti-military 

bias, and the person is then terminated.

 Later the employee has evidence that those 

two were lying. Could he bring an action then?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's sweeping. That's 

almost an insurer's liability insofar as the director of 

employment is concerned.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's respondeat -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: He has to ensure -- he -­

that he has done everything he can. He has a hearing, 

and he has almost absolute liability.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Respondeat -- respondeat 

superior is absolute liability. There -- there's no due 

diligence exception. In fact, if you look to section 

219 of the Restatement of Agency, 219 part (2)(b) 

provides for liability based on negligence, but part

(2)(d), regardless of whether there's negligence, 

provides liability if you're added in your -- aided in 

your conduct by the -- by your position.

 Now, it's possible, depending on the exact 

facts, that the situation you described wouldn't fit 

into scope of employment or aided in. If you just had 

two people whose only role was just as witnesses, then 

they're not acting as agents; they are just witnesses, 

perhaps.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a defense for 

the employer that, no matter that there was this ill 

will, there was enough else to warrant termination of 

this employee. And so the -­

MR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And it's the language of section 4311(c)(1) that's 

critical here. The statute provides that if an improper 

motive was a motivating factor, there is a defense. But 

there's only one defense, and the defense is a showing 

the employer would have fired the plaintiff anyway. The 

language is mandatory. It says if the defense is not 

made out, the employer shall be considered to have 

violated the statute.

error in the Seventh Circuit is the -- is the language 

at page 47 of the Joint Appendix, where the court says: 

Without regard to the jury verdict here, the employer is 

off the hook if the decisionmaker did her own 

investigation. That's an additional defense.

 And it's simply inconsistent with the 

language of the statute. Now, that may not have been -­

that may have been harsh, but it's what the statute 

says.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That isn't what the statute 

says. You -- you jump over the language of the statute. 

It has to be a motivating factor in the decision to 

discharge. And that speaks -- that looks natural -- the 

natural reading of that is that it looks at the 

motivation of the person who actually makes the decision 

to discharge.

 Now, I'm not suggesting that's the right 

rule. That's a very unattractive rule. But the rule 

that you have suggested is also a very unattractive 

rule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt. 

Is there no reasonable middle position here? It's all 

or nothing?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think that the -­

the kind of circumstances that the Court has pointed to 

would be relevant at the remedy stage. The remedies are

-- are discretionary and, whereas 4311(c)(1) says 

"shall," 4323 in describing all the remedies says "may." 

And so a court could take those things into account in 

framing a remedy.

 And certainly the good faith efforts of 

someone in Buck's position, for example, would be 

relevant to a determination whether a violation was 

willful. And that, in fact, reflects what happened in 

this case, which is that the jury found that there was a 

violation -- found that the -- the motivations involved 

here included an improper motivation, rejected the 

4311(c)(1) defense, but then found the violation wasn't 

willful.

 So I think, given the structure of the 

statute, the -- the play here, the ability to adjust to 

those circumstances, is in the remedy provision, not in 

the mandatory language of the 4311(c)(1).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that -- isn't the 

Government's formulation that the discrimination has to 

play a substantial role in the termination a limiting 

principle? I mean, you answered or appeared to be 

answering Justice Alito that in a 10-year history, if 

one report of discrimination existed, that that would 

shift the burden to the employer.

 Is that an accurate statement of law? That

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, in that regard, I 

think we would articulate the standard differently.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Than the SG?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. The language in the 

statute is not "a substantial motivating factor." It's 

"a motivating factor." And that choice of language is 

clearly deliberate. This whole -- this language in this 

provision derives from this Court's decision in Price 

Waterhouse, a very -­

MR. SCHNAPPER: If I could go back to Price 

Waterhouse and explain how we got to this language. It 

was a sharply divided opinion. The plurality standard 

of Justice Brennan said "a motivating factor." Justice 

White's standard would have -- was "a substantially 

motivating factor." Justice O'Connor's standard was 

"substantial." Justice Kennedy pointed out in his 

dissenting opinion that was going to lead to fights

about how much was enough to be substantial.

 When Congress then wrote the 1991 Civil 

Rights Act, from which this language derives, amending 

Title VII, they used the Brennan language, "a motivating 

factor." They didn't use "substantial," and I think 

that was clearly deliberate. Everybody -- anyone who 

read Price Waterhouse -- and that provision was written 

about Price Waterhouse -- would have understood that 

that was a difference within the Court, and they made 

that choice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schnapper, I guess this 

goes back to Justice Alito's question. I find it 

difficult to grasp the distinction that you draw or what 

it seems that could possibly exist between a willful 

motivating factor and a non-willful motivating factor. 

I mean, to say that it's motivating is -- is to say that 

it's willful, it seems to me. But you want us to draw a 

distinction between a willful motivating factor and a 

non-willful motivating factor.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's not our position, 

Justice Scalia. Our position is that, with regard to 

the liability determination in 4311, that any motivating 

factor is what's required. And if you have a number of 

different officials involved, Buck and Mulally and 

Korenchuk, if anyone of -- if anyone who played a role

in this had an unlawful motive, that satisfies 

4311(c)(1), and the burden shifts to the employer to 

show it would have done the same thing anyway.

 Willfulness doesn't have that same language 

about a motivating factor. It just asks whether the 

employer's violation was willful. This Court's decision 

about willfulness in Thurston and Hazen Paper I think 

are broad enough to encompass a situation where you had 

several different officials. And if I might -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want to hold the 

-- the employer liable for the actions of these other 

officials, other than the one who did the firing. And 

if they are liable for -- if you hold them -- the 

employer liable for their contribution to the filing, it 

seems to me you have to hold him liable for their 

willfulness as well.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's our view that the 

language of the statute permits that distinction because 

of the discretionary nature of the remedy provision as 

opposed to the mandatory nature of 4311(c)(1).

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS

 AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 An employer is liable under USERRA when a 

supervisor acting with a discriminatory motive uses a 

delegated authority to cause an adverse employment 

action. The court of appeals held that liability does 

not attach unless that supervisor exerts singular 

influence over the decisionmaker. But that standard is 

inconsistent with the statute for two reasons. First, 

it's incompatible with the statutory definition of 

"employer," which includes not just the ultimate 

decisionmaker, but any person to whom the employer has 

delegated the performance of significant employment 

responsibilities.

 Second, it's contrary to the statute's 

causation standard, which requires only that military 

status be a motivating factor, not necessarily a 

singularly important factor or the determinative factor 

in the adverse employment action. Now -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you regard -- is 

that the same as a but-for cause, the motivating factor?

 MR. MILLER: No. There's two separate 

components to the inquiry. First -- the first is that

it has to be a motivating factor, and that's the 

plaintiff's burden to establish in order to make a prima 

facie case under section 4311(c). And then there is an 

affirmative defense if the employer can show that it was 

not a but-for factor in the sense that, you know, even 

had the person not been in the military, the same action 

would have been taken. That's the -- if the employer 

can show that, then it's absolved of liability.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you using proximate 

cause in but-for, or are you suggesting a different 

formulation of causation?

 MR. MILLER: In our view, the "motivating 

factor" language captures the idea of proximate cause. 

Something can be a motivating factor if it is one of 

many factors, but, in our view, it does need to be more 

than a trivial or de minimis factor, and if you have a 

situation where the bias -- the action of the biased 

supervisor leads through a long and improbable and 

unforeseeable chain of causation to the adverse 

employment action, you might have a but-for cause, but 

you wouldn't have proximate cause, and it wouldn't be a 

motivating factor.

 Now, this case, and I think most real-world 

cases, are quite different from that. Here we have a 

termination decision, and that was made by Buck on the

basis of the January 27th warning that was given to 

Petitioner and the report that Petitioner had not 

complied with that warning. And both parts of that, the 

warning issued by Mulally and the report of 

noncompliance that came from Korenchuk, both parts of 

that the jury could have concluded were in -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In that formulation as 

you've just articulated, where do you place your test of 

a subordinate setting in motion and playing a 

substantial role? What is that test that you proposed 

in your brief -- how does it fit into this?

 MR. MILLER: The -- the discriminatorily 

motivated actions in this case, on the evidence 

interpreted in the light most favorable to Petitioner, 

were the decision of Mulally to write up Petitioner for 

this January 27th incident, and that was motivated by 

her hostility to him because of his status in the Army 

Reserves; and then the decision of Korenchuk to report 

that he had violated the terms of that January 27th 

warning, and that was also motivated by his hostility to 

Petitioner's membership in the -- in the Army Reserves. 

And both of those decisions had a substantial causal

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your -- Petitioner's 

counsel argues that there is no issue of -- in the 

motivating factor test, it doesn't have to be a 

substantial role; it just has to be a motivating factor, 

so that the subordinates -­

MR. MILLER: Well, this may just be a 

semantic disagreement. We don't think it has to be 

substantial in the sense of predominant. It can be one 

of -- there can be many factors, and as long as it's one 

of them, that's a motivating factor. But it needs to be 

substantial in the sense of more than de minimis or more 

than trivial, something that the employer actually took 

into account as one of the reasons -­

JUSTICE ALITO: What happens in the 

situation where a prior evaluation or some disciplinary 

action does have a substantial effect on the decision 

that's -- the employment decision that's made, but the 

employer has no notice that the prior evaluation or 

disciplinary action was based on a biased ground, or any 

reasonable way of finding out that it was based on a 

biased ground? What happens in that situation?

 MR. MILLER: There would still be liability 

just as there is liability in the situation, which is 

quite common, where an employer gives a single official 

the authority to both observe an employee's behavior and

bias, then the employer is going to be liable even if 

the people who hired that official tried very hard to 

make sure that he wasn't biased. And that's consistent

statutory language that says that the motivating -- it 

has to be a motivating factor in the -- in the action 

that is challenged?

 MR. MILLER: It -- it has to be a 

motivating -- the statute says a motivating factor in 

the employer's action.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the employer's action 

here is -- is discharge.

 MR. MILLER: Yes, and the employer -- when 

it's -- the employer is a corporation, and it's -- so 

you have to look at which individuals do you look at in 

figuring out whether it was a motivating factor or not, 

and the statute tells us that. In the definition of 

"employer" in section 4303, it says that the employer 

includes everyone who has been delegated the performance 

of employment-related responsibilities.

people -- everybody who has been delegated authority

JUSTICE ALITO: Does not take the action 

that is challenged.

 MR. MILLER: They are not the last person 

who signs the piece of paper, but they certainly are 

part of the employer's decision.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So maybe then the test is 

whether they were delegated some of the responsibility 

for the challenged action. Were they delegated 

responsibility for making the discharge decision?

 MR. MILLER: They -- they were delegated 

supervisory responsibility by the -- by the employer, 

the authority to observe the people under their 

supervision, to evaluate and report on their 

performance, the authority to initiate disciplinary 

proceedings. And they used that authority in a 

discriminatory manner, and that, that conduct by them, 

was a substantial causal factor in the -- in the 

ultimate action of discharge. And given the -- the 

statutory definition of employer and the motivating 

factor causation standard, that's enough under the 

statute for -- for liability.

what independent intervening cause -­

MR. MILLER: Independent of the employer. 

In this case, we have a number of people, all of whom 

are agents of the same employer. So, under traditional 

principles of -- of an intervening cause, one can't say 

that any one of those agents of the employer was an 

intervening cause that broke the chain of causation from 

misconduct of the other agent of the employer. You have 

a series of agents of the same employer engaging in a 

course of conduct that at the beginning of which is an 

unlawfully -- unlawful discriminatory motive that leads 

to the termination.

 That's quite different from the employee 

deciding to start a fire or engage in some sort of 

misconduct that has nothing to do with his military 

status.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- I'm --

I'm sorry, but I think the end there just kind of glided 

over the whole issue. You say it had nothing to do with 

his military status. It has to do with a procedure that 

was set up because the employer was discriminating 

against him because of his military status. So it 

certainly had something to do with his military status.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but 

the hypothetical is extreme to try to flesh out your 

position. You can certainly imagine an employee 

reacting in a particular way by being put through 

procedures that were set up in a discriminatory manner 

that would seem to anybody to be a basis for 

termination, even though the groundwork was laid by the 

discriminatory procedure.

fire, that a course of misconduct by the employee is a 

foreseeable result of a discriminatory -­

fire goes. That's -- that's a -- it would have happened

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The parties to this case are in total 

agreement with respect to two points. The first point 

is that Linda Buck made the decision to fire Vincent 

Staub. And the second point is there is no evidence 

whatsoever that Linda Buck possessed animus toward Mr. 

Staub on account of his service in the Reserve.

 Applying ordinary tort-related vicarious 

liability rules, Staub's case against Proctor Hospital 

would end right here. But the Seventh Circuit, applying 

what it calls the "cat's paw" doctrine, gives Staub and 

all other plaintiffs like him a second bite at the 

apple.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's look at the 

hypothetical. Take it out of the facts of this case. 

There are two supervisors, each of them have 

anti-military animus, and they both report that this 

gentleman was late when he wasn't.

 MR. DAVIS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's absolutely a 

falsehood. They go in, they report it to Miss Buck. 

Miss Buck does an investigation. There are no 

witnesses. There's no one else to prove that they came

in late. She just takes the supervisors' word. She 

looks at their report -- it was moments after the 

employee didn't show up -- and she says: He's a 

late-goer. I don't know anything about anti-animus; I 

simply fired him because two supervisors who are 

trustworthy -- I've looked at their files, they've never 

lied about anything before, they are pretty honest 

people and -- what happens in that situation?

 MR. DAVIS: I think in that situation, 

consistent with the "cat's paw" analysis, with the facts 

that you set up, the two supervisors so dominated her 

decision that there would be likely a finding that the 

case goes to the jury.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How? She went and 

looked for witnesses, didn't find them. She looked at 

their records. She did what happened here; other people 

have complained about these people, don't particularly 

like them.

 MR. DAVIS: But there being no other input 

whatsoever beyond that, there still is the domination 

issue. If I change your-- your hypothetical just a 

little bit and say that all of what you said is true, 

but in addition to that the fellow who got fired has a 

10-year history of being late, and she looked at that 

history, I think that she's now made an independent

decision, which is what happened in this case. And, 

therefore, under the Seventh Circuit's rule, no 

liability attaches, and that's the right result.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's the 

question, because you just added a very important fact, 

which is a 10-year history of being late. But on this 

day, he wasn't late. On this day, the two supervisors 

made it up.

 MR. DAVIS: And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would she have fired him 

absent that report? Isn't that what the jury has to 

decide?

 MR. DAVIS: I think that is what the jury 

has to decide, but I'm not sure that case in the latter 

extended hypothetical gets that far.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what the -- what 

this circuit's "cat's paw" theory does and what others 

do say, if she engaged in any investigation, there's no 

liability.

 MR. DAVIS: I -- I disagree with that a 

little bit. I don't think if she engaged in any 

investigation, that absolves of liability. I think if 

she engages in a good faith investigation, it absolves 

of liability.

it here? Because the -- when -- what was his name --

office, and Buck hands him the pink slip and says, 

"You're fired," that the jury could have credited that 

evidence. He was given no opportunity to explain the 

situation. What kind of investigation? What -- she 

looked at his personnel file. What else was the 

investigation?

 MR. DAVIS: I will answer that. Before I 

get to that, I disagree with the point about he wasn't 

given an opportunity to explain. I think the record is 

clear he was given an opportunity to explain.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When?

 MR. DAVIS: At the -- two times. At the 

time he was discharged, on the day that Korenchuk brings 

him in, Korenchuk says: "I was looking for you and 

couldn't find you." And in the record, in fact, Staub 

gave an explanation of his whereabouts. Buck was there. 

She heard it.

 The second time is, approximately 5 days 

later, he files a five-page-long grievance stating 

all -­

pink slip. What -- what point -- when Korenchuk takes 

him into -- takes Staub into Buck's office, according to 

his testimony, which the jury could credit, he wasn't 

asked a thing. She just said: Here's your pink slip; 

you're fired.

 MR. DAVIS: I think the record shows he did 

give an explanation of his whereabouts. The record also 

shows that he filed a five-page grievance contesting 

that action.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: After he was fired.

 MR. DAVIS: After he was fired. And that 

Buck carefully investigated that, and, 5 days after it 

was filed, gave him a letter saying: I have looked into 

it, I have considered all your arguments, including your 

argument that you were discharged on account of your 

military service, but I don't credit it. And, 

therefore, I'm sustaining the discharge.

 And that is absolutely -- Mr. Staub knew 

that that works for him, because in 1998 he invoked the 

same procedure when he was discharged the first time for 

similar reasons, and he was conditionally reinstated to 

employment at Proctor Hospital.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did I understand 

you to say that you do agree with the Seventh Circuit's 

"cat's paw" approach to this?

like him a second bite at the apple. But he has to 

demonstrate that the person who possessed animus 

exercised so much control over the decisionmaker that 

that person became the true decisionmaker. And that 

simply doesn't work in this case for a number of 

reasons.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you -­

how is that consistent with the statutory language that 

requires that this discrimination simply be a motivating 

factor?

 MR. DAVIS: The answer to that is the 

statute sets forth five factors, four or five factors, 

and says that one of the four or five employment actions 

has to be a motivating factor in arriving at the 

decision. So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- let's look at 

the statutory factors.

 MR. DAVIS: Okay. It's 4311(a). And it 

says -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, and where -- where 

are you reading it from?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Page 3 of the blue brief.

 MR. DAVIS: It says that there are five 

actions that are prohibited: denial of initial 

employment, reemployment, retention in employment, 

promotion, or any benefit of employment.

 And it says that an employer cannot take 

action, one of those actions, on the basis of four 

factors: membership, application for membership, 

performance, service -- or service of obligation in the 

uniformed services.

 So there has to be something to connect one 

of those factors to one of those five actions. And 

that's the literal meaning of the statute. And I think 

the Seventh Circuit's view is absolutely consistent with 

that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. 

The statute says is a motivating -- one of those four 

things, membership, application, et cetera, is a 

motivating factor in the action.

 MR. DAVIS: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I understood 

your position to be that the supervisor has to have such 

dominant control that it's the "cat's paw."

subordinate's.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess where 

I'm having trouble following you is the total domination 

motivating factor. It seems like a much more stringent 

test that the Seventh Circuit has adopted.

 MR. DAVIS: Well, I think in the context of 

this case, Your Honor, it's not, because the definition 

of "employer" here not only includes Proctor Hospital, 

what you might call the ultimate employer, but it also 

includes the person who made the adverse employment 

decision. And in this case, it's Linda Buck.

 And this statute creates personal liability 

for Ms. Buck or anybody else who makes a decision if 

it's based on one of these factors contained in the 

statute. I don't think there's any way a jury would be 

allowed to consider whether or not Ms. Buck is in 

violation of the statute, because there's an absolute 

dearth of evidence that any of these factors motivated 

the decision she made.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that assumes that 

the employment decision is solely hers. It's hers, not 

based on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on

acting in a vacuum. She's acting on information that

supply that to her in the employment context.

for the two supervisors' discriminatory activities.

 MR. DAVIS: That would lead to a 

never-ending chain of looking backwards all the time 

over the course of perhaps a very long employment 

history to scour the record to determine is there one 

single or two single actions out there that may somehow 

have come forward and caused this termination?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in most 

situations, an employer comes in and says: I fired X 

for X, Y, and Z reasons. And if they don't mention one 

of those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why 

would a court rely on it at all? It's not a motivating 

factor.

 MR. DAVIS: I'm not sure I thoroughly 

understand the hypothetical, but if the true 

decisionmaker there comes forward and says, I didn't 

know about this, I didn't rely upon it -- I don't think 

that the animus can be imputed to the decisionmaker.

of singular influence.

 MR. DAVIS: I think that -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't just sound 

like it was a motivating cause. That sounds like it was 

something really special.

 MR. DAVIS: I -- I think that that is the 

Seventh Circuit's way of saying proximate cause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, okay. So why don't we 

say: Seventh Circuit, if that's your way of saying it 

is just a normal thing like cause, we accept that, but 

please don't use those words. And because you might 

have used -- you might have used them meaning something 

else, we will send this back so we're certain that what 

you are doing is applying the same test to everything. 

In other words, was it a motivating factor?

 MR. DAVIS: I think you could say that.

at all.

 As I understand their opinion, they say that 

the statute requires that the -- let me get the right 

language here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited 

discriminatory factor must have been a motivating factor 

in the employer's action. And they say that means it 

must have motivated the person who took the employer's 

action.

 It's not a motivating factor in the 

employer's action unless the person who took the action 

on behalf of the employer had that as its motive.

 Then the court of appeals makes an 

exception: However, if the person who appears to be 

taking the action on behalf of the employer is really 

not the person who took the action, but was totally 

under the control of a subordinate who -- and the person 

just swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we 

will hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person 

who signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't 

have the motive, if in fact the decision was effectively 

the decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the 

employer.

 It has nothing to do with proximate cause. 

It has to do with the text that it has to be a 

motivating factor in the employer's action; not a

motivating factor somewhere down the line, but in the 

employer's action. That's how I read the court of 

appeals' opinion.

 MR. DAVIS: And I agree with that, and we 

get back to the notion that, in this case, it was 

Ms. Buck who made the decision. She made the -­

MR. DAVIS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mrs. Buck never would 

have made this decision if Korenchuk hadn't come in and 

said: Here's Staub, he's goofing off; he was told to 

tell me when he was going to be absent, and he didn't.

 Korenchuk, who has the animus, is a 

motivating factor certainly in what happened to Mr. 

Staub, because if you didn't have Mr. Korenchuk marching 

Staub into Buck's office he would have retained his job. 

Wasn't his last -- his most recent performance rating 

very good?

 MR. DAVIS: Only on one respect. He 

received a technical "very good," but with respect to 

the narrative portion of that evaluation, it says: I 

want you to stay in the department when you're being 

paid to work, and not to be out wandering around.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In any case, there was no

 MR. DAVIS: I don't think we know the answer 

to that. It was -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's not the 

point. It seems to me you have to -- we're not going to 

second-guess the jury determination here.

 I understood your point to be that there's a 

difference between a motivating factor in the decision, 

which means the person who made the decision on behalf 

of the employer must have had that motive and, on the 

other hand, a factor which was relevant to the decision, 

or a factor which influenced the decision. That's quite 

different from a motivating factor in the decision.

 You -- you have to get us to believe -- and 

I'm not sure we will -- that "motivating factor in the 

decision" refers to motive on the part of the person who 

made the decision. That's -- that's essentially your 

point, isn't it?

 MR. DAVIS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you can't agree 

with me, because my question was why would that be? You 

have two people, A and B; they are both supervisors. In 

the one case, B fires the employee because he's in the 

Army, and he says it: Ha, ha, that's why I'm doing it.

 In the second case, he fires the employee

because he thought the employee was -- in one of Justice 

Sotomayor's hypotheticals or anyone else, he fires him 

for a perfectly good reason, but A has lied about it. 

And the reason A lied about it was because she wanted to 

tell him a lie so B would fire the employee, and her 

reason is because he's in the Army.

 Those two situations -- the second seems to 

me one of 80 -- 80 million situations, fact-related, 

that could arise, and I don't know why we want a special 

standard for such a situation. Why not just ask the 

overall question: Was this action an action that was -­

in which the bad motive was a motivating factor? Forget 

psychoanalysis of A; B is good enough; or vice versa. 

That was my question.

 MR. DAVIS: And in B, the employer could not 

be liable. In B, the person who made the decision, the 

employer, was not motivated by one of the factors in the 

statute; that person couldn't be liable. If that person 

can't be liable, how can that employer of that person be 

vicariously liable? I don't think they can.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because together they 

dismissed the employee.

 MR. DAVIS: Oh, no.

 JUSTICE BREYER: One by supplying the false 

statement, the other by acting on it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They are both agents. 

That's why I made them both Burlington people. I wanted 

to get them in the group. They both have the same 

Burlington status, so we get that issue out of it. And 

together they fire this individual. In the absence of 

either the one or the other, he wouldn't have been 

fired.

 MR. DAVIS: I've listened to the 

hypothetical long enough that I've lost track of who 

made the decision to fire him.

nowhere pursuing this hypothetical further. So I will

 MR. DAVIS: As I understand it, the second 

person in the hypothetical had no motivation whatsoever 

under the statute to cause the discharge, and, 

therefore, the employer wouldn't be liable for that 

decision.

opposition to the Secretary of Labor's commentary on how 

this works. The Secretary of Labor's commentary is it's 

a motivating factor. And if Korenchuk precipitates this 

whole thing, that's a motivating factor.

 Do we -- I mean, this is -- the Secretary of 

Labor administers the statute. Do we give any weight to 

the government's official position on what a motivating 

factor means?

 MR. DAVIS: Normally, you would give weight 

to the government's position, but I think the 

government's position has to be consistent with the 

precise language of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does the Secretary of 

Labor administer this statute? What are -- what are his 

or her responsibilities under the statute?

 MR. DAVIS: There can be a charge filed with 

the Secretary of Labor, which the Secretary of Labor 

would then investigate. The Secretary of Labor has the 

option to bring an action, should the Secretary choose 

to do so. But, coterminously, the individual service 

person can bring an independent cause of action, and 

that's what happened in this case. In this case, there 

was no Secretary of Labor involvement.

concurrent actors? Actor A was not negligent; actor B 

was; they both contributed to the accident. And we look 

to the Restatement of Torts, which is whether or not the 

wrongful actor made a significant contribution. That's 

-- that's the end of it.

 MR. DAVIS: I think that the problem with 

this situation is, is that one of the actors here, the 

decision that she made, being Mulally, and that's with 

respect to whom the most evidence of animus was adduced, 

didn't commit an action that would be actionable under 

USERRA. There -- there's no way that issuing the 

constructive advice record on January 27th violated the 

statute, even if it was motivated by animus.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we're -- but we're 

talking about the test. And the test I gave you is 

quite different from the "cat's paw" test. And if you 

use the test something along the lines that I 

formulated -- I don't know if that's precisely what the 

Restatement says -­

MR. DAVIS: Sure.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but to that general 

effect, the instruction given to the jury was really 

overprotective of your client, under the standard 

concurrent -- concurrent causation analysis.

somewhat protective, but the problem is, prior to 

issuing that instruction, the district court did no 

analysis whatsoever to determine if the instruction was 

warranted in the first place.

 And that was simply our point to the Seventh 

Circuit. Before you allow this to fall into the lap of 

a jury and try and explain to a jury, as opposed to the 

Supreme Court, what it means to be a "cat's paw" in the 

agency theory, the district court should at least make 

an initial determination that that's what we have here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can I turn to the 

Secretary of Labor's regulations? Are what we talking 

about anything more than the following statement in his 

commentary accompanying the final regs, namely that an 

employee, quote, "need not show that his or her 

protected activities or status was the sole cause of the 

employment action. The person's activities or status 

need be only one of the factors that a truthful employer 

would list if asked for the reasons for its decision."

MR. DAVIS: That's certainly the commentary

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me to 

be so damning of your case. I think if this employer 

had been asked the reasons for its decision, it would 

have given Ms. Buck's reasons.

 MR. DAVIS: Ms. Buck would have said: I let 

him go because he has this veritable tsunami of bad 

behaviors. What he is accused of is absolutely 

consistent with it. And I made the decision.

 Is it a truthful statement by her? It is 

absolutely a truthful statement by her, and that was the 

reason for her actions.

 I think Ms. Buck's consideration of the 

discharge decision wasn't limited to one source. It 

clearly was not. No one shaped or directed the scope of 

her determination. Even more important, she gave Mr. 

Staub the opportunity to tell his side of the story. 

And after considering all of that, she decided that his 

discharge was warranted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- could a jury 

find from the testimony before -- before it, that at the 

time he received his pink slip -- let's not talk about

fact that the defendant's account of why he was fired 

has changed. One -- the written explanation was that he 

never obeyed the rule for the 3 months it was in effect. 

The explanation given by Buck was that she had been told 

that he wasn't -- couldn't have been found on the 19th. 

The -- the story that was given to Staub at the time was 

that Korenchuk couldn't find him on the 20th, so if he 

was responding to that, he was responding to the wrong 

question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think anybody 

thought that Buck would have fired him just for that one 

absence. That -- that was the trigger. But it was the 

trigger that followed a long series of prior absences 

for which he had been disciplined before.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see any 

inconsistency between those two versions.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: But those aren't the 

versions in the record -- the written record at the

because he has been breaking this rule ever since 

January. Nobody claims that's true.

We don't think it's as harsh as you do, but we think 

that the intent is particularly clear here. Section 

4301(1) says that the purpose of the -- and this is the 

codified purpose -- the purpose of the statute is to 

minimize the disadvantages to civilian careers that can 

result from service in the military. And -- and that, 

it seems to me, you have to read -- you have to read the 

rest of the statute.

 Secondly, this -- USERRA is unique among 

employment statutes or close to it, because the employer 

has an economic incentive to break the law. It's 

expensive to keep reservists on the book. And Mulally 

and Korenchuk objected to Staub working there precisely 

because it cost them more money when he went to drill, 

and it cost them more money when he was called up for 

operation Iraqi Freedom.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think that the 

standard for employer liability is different under this 

statute than under other Federal antidiscrimination 

statutes? Is that what you're - you were just

purpose isn't in Title VII. So if some -- you could

pointed out, amici on the other side, employers 

typically make a disciplinary decision as a result of a 

bunch of different decisions.

 The Seventh Circuit holds that so long as 

the employer divides up those responsibilities, USERRA 

will not apply to many of the decisions. On their view, 

USERRA applies only to what the last decisionmaker did. 

And the narrower her role, the narrower the protections 

of the statute.

 This statute should not be read in that way, 

not only because of the language that I've recounted, 

but because USERRA, it's reemployment rights, and it's 

antidiscrimination rights play an essential role in the 

national defense. They safeguard the livelihood of men 

and women who safeguard the nation. And Congress would 

have wanted that statute read broadly.
