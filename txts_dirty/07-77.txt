3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next in Riley, Governor of Alabama, versus 

Kennedy. 

6  Mr. Newsom. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 

9  MR. NEWSOM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  This appeal presents two issues, both a 

12 threshold jurisdictional question and a substantive 

13 question concerning scope of section 5. We have 

14 explained in some detail in our briefs why Governor 

Riley's appeal in this case is timely and why this Court 

16 has jurisdiction to resolve the merit. The Solicitor 

17 General has agreed with us on the jurisdictional 

18 question. 

19  I certainly want to answer any questions 

that the Court may have concerning the jurisdictional 

21 issue, but with the Court's permission I would like to 

22 proceed in my affirmative presentation directly to the 

23 merits, and specifically the second of two independent 

24 bases that we have urged for reversal here. Our 

argument under this Court's decision in Young versus

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 Fordice is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward 

2 way to resolve this case. In Young, this Court held 

3 that a state voter registration plan, despite its 

4 promulgation, preclearance and active implementation to 

register 4,000 voters, was nonetheless in force or 

6 effect within the meaning of section 5 and thus was not 

7 a valid section 5 baseline for purposes of measuring 

8 future changes, because the Court said it resulted only 

9 from a temporary misapplication of State law and it was 

immediately corrected upon acknowledgment that it was 

11 unlawful in fact. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's pretty hard to 

13 argue something wasn't in force and effect when they 

14 have an election under it, isn't it?

 MR. NEWSOM: Your Honor, I don't think --

16 Your Honor is correct that the only possible distinction 

17 between Young and this case is the holding of the 1987 

18 election, but I don't think the election can make the 

19 difference here, for this reason: It preceded solely by 

virtue of the vagaries of the State litigation process. 

21 The challenge preceded the election by two months. That 

22 election was conducted under a cloud of litigation that 

23 everyone certainly knew about and it went forward only 

24 because, in the wake of Young, the trial court 

temporarily misapplied State law.

1  If a trial court had gotten State law right 

2 to begin with, Your Honor, and had enjoined the election 

3 as we now all know it should have, then there never 

4 would have been the election to point to as evidence 

that 85-237 ever went into force or effect. And it 

6 seems to me inconceivable, consistent with any 

7 meaningful notion of federalism, that section 5 can 

8 require a world in which a State trial court, as we say 

9 in the reply brief, which exists at the bottom of the 

state judicial hierarchy, can by getting State law wrong 

11 in the first place lock into State law as a section 5 

12 baseline an unconstitutional statute. I don't anybody, 

13 on this side of the podium anyway, to be denying that 

14 85-237 was, is now and was at its inception, 

unconstitutional and thereby strip the Alabama Supreme 

16 Court of its sovereign prerogative to correct the errors 

17 of lower courts. 

18  JUSTICE STEVENS: What if there had been no 

19 challenge to that election, but two or three years later 

somebody challenged the election and then the Supreme 

21 Court said it was invalid. 

22  MR. NEWSOM: Well, Justice Stevens --

23  JUSTICE STEVENS: Then there never would 

24 have been a State statute.

 MR. NEWSOM: I'm sorry?

1  JUSTICE STEVENS: Then there never would 

2 have been a State statute, a valid State statute. 

3  MR. NEWSOM: Right. There are -- we have 

4 pitched two different arguments in this case, Your 

Honor. And under the, I think it's fair, to say the 

6 broader of the two arguments, contained in Roman II of 

7 our brief, that, the later action, nonetheless would not 

8 be a change under section 5. But under the argument 

9 that I was talking about specifically under Young versus 

Fordice, I think it does make a difference that the 

11 Alabama Supreme Court stepped in at the earliest 

12 possible opportunity to invalidate this statute, again 

13 as part of litigation that preceded the first and only 

14 implementation, attempted implementation, of the 

statute. 

16  And I think the question at bottom here in 

17 this case is whether section 5 provides State courts 

18 with any breathing space whatsoever in which to conduct 

19 this exercise of judicial review, and our submission is 

that at the very least that it ought to extend so far as 

21 to allow State courts to step in, as they did here, at 

22 the earliest possible opportunity. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the respondent prevails 

24 in this case and you have a case similar to this one 

that begins in the trial court, how do you think it 

6

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 would work, that the plaintiffs in the trial court 

2 action have to get preclearance either way? They have 

3 to get preclearance in the event that they prevail? And 

4 then the other side has to get preclearance in the event 

that it doesn't. I mean, is that the way it would work 

6 in your view? 

7  MR. NEWSOM: I'm not frankly --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I'm in State trial 

9 court, how can I make a ruling if -- assuming the 

respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be 

11 preclearance? 

12  MR. NEWSOM: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

13 that's certainly part of the point that we've emphasized 

14 here as one of the key federalism issues in this case, 

is that this case really does in a very functional way 

16 strip State courts of their jurisdiction to exercise 

17 judicial review, whether at the trial court stage or at 

18 the supreme court stage because on Appellee's theory 

19 once the statute is precleared it is effectively locked 

in place and that the trial court or the supreme court 

21 needs permission from the Executive Branch in Washington 

22 to exercise the authority to --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose States get --

24 State courts get preclearance all the time with district 

changes, don't they? Or how does it work? They just

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 hold the judgment in abeyance until there is 

2 preclearance, and couldn't -- and if so, couldn't do you 

3 that here? 

4  MR. NEWSOM: Well, to be sure the Appellees 

are correct that it is the administration of the change 

6 itself that requires preclearance. So I don't want the 

7 Court to think that our position here is that courts are 

8 having to -- to render sort of provisional judgments 

9 that are then subject to preclearance in Washington. 

The point is that, so I think in the redistricting 

11 example, Your Honor, it would be the implementation of 

12 the redistricting that would require preclearance. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any other 

14 district cases that require preclearance except those 

that redistrict the, the State? 

16  MR. NEWSOM: No Your Honor, and the point is 

17 that no one here denies, certainly the State does not 

18 deny, that a State court order redistricting, redrawing 

19 a map, in essence, and giving rise or exercising what is 

functionally, as this Court has said, a legislative 

21 power requires redistricting. No one doubts that. But 

22 the question here is quite different: Whether if there 

23 is a spectrum of State court decisions with 

24 redistricting at one end, my case has to be at the other 

end of the spectrum.

1  JUSTICE SOUTER: Are there district court --

2 there must be -- district court cases in which the State 

3 trial court has invalidated on some State constitutional 

4 ground legislation redistricting that has been passed by 

the legislature? When that happens, have those opinions 

6 been precleared? 

7  MR. NEWSOM: Not to my knowledge, Your 

8 Honor. And I will confess that I'm not aware of any 

9 right off the top of my mind that fit that paradigm. 

But not to my knowledge. The only --

11  JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the reason that 

12 there would be no reason to preclear them? I mean, if 

13 the State court invalidates legislative redistricting, 

14 and does so before there has been a preclearance 

request, in other words, if it gets into State court 

16 right off the bat, then there's no State law 

17 subsequently to ask the feds to preclear. 

18  MR. NEWSOM: That might be right, Justice 

19 Souter, but I'm not sure that I understand the 

implications for this case. If you could --

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I guess what I'm 

22 saying is your "No" answer does not prove much. In 

23 other words, you're trying to make the case here that 

24 there is something extremely unusual about this. And I 

thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of 

2 these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a 

3 State law that is then subject to some kind of 

4 preclearance review. And my only point was, if I 

understand the situation, as long as the preclearance 

6 review had not preceded the State constitutionality 

7 judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment 

8 there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it 

9 be to -- to the Justice Department or to -- or to the 

Court, and ask to have precleared. So the fact that 

11 there are no such cases doesn't prove anything. 

12  MR. NEWSOM: Well, I think the point that I 

13 was trying to make, Your Honor, is that this Court has 

14 said in construing section 5 that it will not construe 

it so as to exacerbate federalism costs. And one of the 

16 reasons that the federalism costs are exacerbated here 

17 is that this is -- this scenario is simply unlike any, 

18 as we say in the brief, that this Court has --

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you said in answer to 

21 Justice Souter that this is your case. There is no law 

22 that's precleared. 

23  MR. NEWSOM: Well, it's certainly true, Your 

24 Honor, that when a state Court, as any court -- as this 

Court made clear only last month in Danforth, when a

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 court exercises judicial review to invalidate a practice 

2 that's unconstitutional it is not changing or making new 

3 law as it goes along, but declaring what the law has 

4 always been.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is a law to be 

6 cleared if you -- if you assume that the existence of a 

7 law to be cleared occurs before that law has been tested 

8 in the courts. In the hypothetical we've been 

9 discussing, just as in this case, there was a State law 

and if you assume the State law is valid before it's 

11 gone through the judicial clearance process, there is a 

12 State law change when the clearance process results in 

13 striking down the law. I don't -- it seems to me that 

14 the two situations are pretty parallel.

 MR. NEWSOM: Well, with respect, Justice 

16 Scalia, my case is the latter situation, where there was 

17 technically a law in place. 85-257 to be sure was in 

18 place. Now, whether it was in force or effect within 

19 the meaning of this Court's decision in Young is 

different, but it was in place. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was precleared at 

22 what point? The 1985 law was precleared before the 

23 litigation? 

24  MR. NEWSOM: Yes, Your Honor, it was 

precleared virtually immediately, so let's say in '85.

1 I don't remember the month specifically, but it was 

2 precleared in '85. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was submitted by? 

4  MR. NEWSOM: Submitted by the State of 

Alabama.
 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And then the
 

7 litigation came.
 

8  MR. NEWSOM: Right. The litigation was
 

9 commenced in April of 1987.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so your point is that 

11 if the circuit court -- there are only two levels of 

12 court in this, the circuit court and the supreme court? 

13  MR. NEWSOM: For purposes of this 

14 litigation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the circuit 

16 court had gotten the State law right, then there never 

17 would have been an election? 

18  MR. NEWSOM: Well, that's right. 

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: There never would have been 

perhaps preclearance if it got it right soon enough. 

21  MR. NEWSOM: Well, that's true, but of 

22 course courts don't get to reach out and grab the 

23 disputes and bring them into courts. 

24  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but if the -- if the 

challenging parties go into court at the first

1 opportunity and you don't have an election sort of 

2 coming up next week, I would suppose that in cases like 

3 that, the State would at least allow the State 

4 litigation to proceed to some level. And if in point of 

fact that State litigation resulted in a declaration
 

6 that the new statute was unconstitutional in some
 

7 fashion, one would not expect the State then to bull
 

8 ahead and ask for preclearance, as opposed to trying
 

9 either to appeal at the State level or to correct the
 

statute. 

11  MR. NEWSOM: That's right, Your Honor, but 

12 it -- but the challenge here would not have been ripe 

13 until 1987. There was no vacancy on the horizon. And 

14 so the challenge here was brought at the earliest 

conceivable opportunity when the vacancy became a 

16 reality. 

17  JUSTICE SOUTER: I will assume that. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even in the hypothetical 

19 Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in 

Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying: Well, 

21 this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should 

22 I pass on the validity of something that might not be 

23 precleared? 

24  MR. NEWSOM: Well, I think that's entirely 

possible, Your Honor, and --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: On the other hand, I can 

2 also see the attorney general saying: Why should I 

3 preclear it? It hasn't even been determined to be law 

4 in Alabama yet.

 Does the Justice Department preclear stuff 

6 that is -- that is in the midst of litigation? 

7  MR. NEWSOM: The Justice Department's 

8 regulations at 51.22, Your Honor, say that they will not 

9 preclear things that are not final and that are subject, 

it says, to revision by court -- by court judgment. But 

11 that regulation is specific, the Federal Register 

12 says --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: How does that apply to a 

14 State statute which is fully enacted and then there's 

going to be a challenge? 

16  MR. NEWSOM: The truth is the regulations 

17 don't speak specifically to that question, and the 

18 reason is that the regulations are quite clear in the 

19 Federal Register at 46 Federal Register 872 that they 

don't deal with changes, so-called, brought about as a 

21 result of court judgments. The regulation that I was 

22 referring to, 51.22, refers specifically to State courts 

23 having an administrative role to play in --

districting or --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any cases 

4 where -- where a piece of State legislation has been in 

the middle of litigation where the Justice Department 

6 has precleared it? 

7  MR. NEWSOM: No, Your Honor, not right off 

8 -- not as I'm standing here, I don't. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems like an exercise 

in futility. 

11  MR. NEWSOM: But the point -- Justice 

12 Ginsburg, getting back to your point so you'll 

13 appreciate the timeline, in April of 1987 the challenge 

14 is brought. In June of 1987 the election goes forward. 

So the challenge here preceded the election by two 

16 months. And the point that I've been trying to make is 

17 that the -- had the trial court gotten State law right 

18 to begin with and enjoined the election, as we now know 

19 it should have, there never would have been an election 

to point to, to show within the meaning of Young that 

21 the -- that the statute was ever put into force and 

22 effect. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: What happened -- I have a 

24 factual question. In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is 

sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I

1 guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then 

2 the Governor appointed him. Well, he must have gotten 

3 paid during that year. 

4  MR. NEWSOM: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And then when the Governor 

6 appointed him, what does the appointment look like? 

7 Does it say it's retroactive? No. I would be 

8 surprised. I mean, you're not going to tell me it is. 

9 So my guess is he's appointed as of -- let's say he's 

appointed by the Governor. It must have said as of 

11 when, and it probably said as of September '88. 

12  MR. NEWSOM: The truth is, Your Honor, I do 

13 not know what --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think it's 

important to me because, for this reason: I would guess 

16 they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and 

17 therefore we -- we have more. We have the facts, the 

18 following facts, as to whether -- and this is what 

19 Fordice says; it says this is a practical question. 

It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional 

21 or not unconstitutional. The question is as practical 

22 matter was it in force and effect? And, as a practical 

23 matter, one, there was an election under it; two, 

24 somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he 

held that office for a year and was paid for it. All

1 right? Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter, 

2 we do not say that special election law was in force and 

3 effect for about a year and two months? 

4  MR. NEWSOM: Your Honor, the difference, or 

what makes this case just like Young versus Fordice, is 

6 that the relevant -- the relevant implementation in 

7 Young was not election. The relevant implementation in 

8 Young was registration. And this Court's opinion makes 

9 clear that 4,000 real, live flesh-and-blood voters were 

registered. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, their registering is a 

12 precondition of voting. Not one person had ever voted. 

13 Moreover, they all had to register again. So the net 

14 practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young 

v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch. And the practical 

16 effect here is that somebody is elected under the law, 

17 holds office for a year and two months, and is paid. It 

18 seems to me quite a big difference. 

19  MR. NEWSOM: With respect, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I mean, that's 

21 what I wanted to know. I mean, maybe it's different if 

22 this was a retroactive something or other, but I --

23 you're not aware of that. 

24  MR. NEWSOM: No, I can't --

1  MR. NEWSOM: -- tell you as I'm standing
 

2 here that the --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
 

4  MR. NEWSOM: -- that the appointment was
 

retroactive, but I do think that, given the nature of 

6 the implementation, the relevant implementation in Young 

7 being registration, the fact that 4,000 people were 

8 registered does bring this case pretty close to Young. 

9 And the fact that --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I 

11 reject that on the ground of what I said. I'm not 

12 saying I would, but suppose I did. Isn't that the end 

13 of this case? Because then, if I reject that, there is 

14 a plan. The plan is called "the special election plan." 

It is in effect for a year and two months. People hold 

16 office in election and they're paid. And then a new 

17 plan comes along, the governor's plan. Now that seems 

18 to me a change, and the statute says that if you have a 

19 change, which this would be, you've got to preclear it. 

End of matter. 

21  Now, what's your argument about that? 

22  MR. NEWSOM: With respect to that, Your 

23 Honor, it's that I don't think it is accurate to say 

24 that this was the governor's plan. The Governor was not

1  JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm just using that as 

2 shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the 

3 officeholder is appointed by the government -- by the 

4 governor.

 MR. NEWSOM: Right. And --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: And I'm saying if we start 

7 from the base that the plan is special election which 

8 was in force and effect for a year and two months, then 

9 for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the 

State has to preclear the change. Now, what's the 

11 answer to that? 

12  MR. NEWSOM: The answer to that, Your Honor, 

13 is that the shorthand misses the fact here that what 

14 we're talking about is that the change results here from 

a State court exercising judicial review. And this is 

16 -- that is different in kind from any sort of decision 

17 that this Court has ever rendered about --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're 

19 saying that if the cause of a change is a court 

decision, then you do not have to preclear. So that if 

21 in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a 

22 court which said segregationist plan number one here is 

23 no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse 

24 plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to 

have been precleared?

1  MR. NEWSOM: The point, Your Honor, is that 

2 that --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: You see where I'm going, 

4 and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it 

anyway. 

6  MR. NEWSOM: So the point, Your Honor, is 

7 that the result of that court decision would have been 

8 immediately enjoined under the Fourteenth Amendment, the 

9 Fifteenth Amendment, or section 2. The point about 

section 5 --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: It would have been able to 

12 be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory 

13 intent, certainly. 

14  MR. NEWSOM: Absolutely. This Court would 

have cert jurisdiction if there were -- if you have the 

16 --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: But what my question is, is 

18 there any authority for the proposition that between 

19 1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a 

change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five 

21 members of a court -- of a State court -- or whether it 

22 was a legislative decision. Because that's what I think 

23 you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports 

24 you on that?

 MR. NEWSOM: If I -- if I may, Justice

1 Breyer, as a preface it's important that I emphasize 

2 simply as sort of a superstructure point here that as --

3 not only as the plaintiff in this case, but as the party 

4 asking the Court to exacerbate federalism costs, within 

the meaning of Bossier Parish, over what they have been 

6 to this point, I think it's my opponents' burden to show 

7 you that Congress clearly intended to include these 

8 provisions, as opposed to my burden to show you that 

9 Congress intended to exclude them. That's essentially 

what this Court said in Gregory versus Ashcroft. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they argue in their 

12 brief that there were instances in which State supreme 

13 courts participated prior to the enactment of the Voting 

14 Rights Act in changes in election requirements for the 

purposes of disenfranchising African-Americans. Are 

16 they wrong on that? And if they're right on that, what 

17 reason is there to think that, without any text in 

18 section 5 to making an exception for changes that are 

19 made by State courts, what would be the reason for 

reading that in? 

21  MR. NEWSOM: Well, I think there are -- if I 

22 can answer in two parts. First with respect to the 

23 legislative history, to be sure the Appellees and their 

24 amici have brought forward a number of examples of State 

court judges, principally southern State court judges,

1 doing some pretty despicable stuff, and I'm not here to 

2 defend that. But with respect to the specific question 

3 at issue here, whether Congress was in enacting section 

4 5, was clued into this question and it had reason to 

think that State Court exercises of judicial review 

6 would give rise to the sorts of problems that section 5 

7 was designed to inhibit, there simply is nothing to 

8 support that suggestion. 

9  Section 5, of course, was intended to do 

something very specific. It was designed to prevent or 

11 to catch government conduct that the more traditional 

12 remedies in place at the time under the '57, '60 and '64 

13 Civil Rights Acts, what we would today I think call a 

14 section 2 suit, couldn't get. And the point here, in 

addition to the Danforth that at some deep 

16 jurisprudential level courts don't change law, the more 

17 important practical point is that courts exercising 

18 judicial review are institutionally incapable of 

19 changing the law specifically in the way that Congress 

was concerned about when it enacted Section 5. 

21 Congress --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, counsel, since 

23 you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at 

24 it. It says that you have to preclear standards, 

practices, whatever, different from that in force or 

22

1 effect on November 1st, 1964. 

2  Now, the Respondents in their brief accused 

3 you of making the argument that since this isn't 

4 different from what was in effect in 1964 you don't have 

to preclear it. And you said, no, that's not what we're 

6 saying; we take no position on that. 

7  Why in the world did you say that? It says 

8 quite clearly the standard has to be different from that 

9 in force or effect on November 1st, '64. At that point 

these people were appointed. 

11  MR. NEWSOM: That's right, Your Honor. 

12 There are two sort of different things going on here. 

13 One, as a matter again of the Appellees' burden to show 

14 you that these decisions are clearly included within the 

text, quite clearly they are not, because November 1, 

16 1964, as Your Honor quite correctly points out --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in your reply 

18 brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that 

19 question.

 MR. NEWSOM: With respect, what I say at 

21 page 8 of the reply is that there is no need for this 

22 Court to determine specifically how the November 1, 

23 1964, language ought to operate in the legislative and 

24 administrative change scenario. This Court in Presley 

and again in Young versus Fordice has suggested in dicta 

23

1 that perhaps the baseline might float, notwithstanding 

2 the November 1, 1964 --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there wouldn't 

4 be a different baseline for judicial changes than there 

would be for legislative or executive changes, would 

6 there? 

7  MR. NEWSOM: No. You're -- I think you're 

8 right, Your Honor, perhaps not. And this again goes to 

9 the burden point that I was trying to make earlier. My 

-- the sole purpose in citing the November 1, 1964, 

11 language is to show that at the very least, to the 

12 extent you're looking for some clear indication that 

13 Congress intended to get these decisions, the text 

14 cannot provide that clear indication.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take it it's your 

16 position -- and I noticed this in the question put to 

17 you by Justice Breyer -- tell me if this is wrong, but 

18 that it's not just the fact that the court makes a 

19 decision, because the court may have discretion to 

choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the 

21 court makes a decision to show that the prior practice 

22 was invalid, was void under State law. 

23  MR. NEWSOM: That's right, Your Honor. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the distinction, I 

take it.

1  MR. NEWSOM: That's right, Your Honor.
 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Not the fact that it's
 

3 just the court, but the kind of decision the court
 

4 makes.


 MR. NEWSOM: That's right. There are 

6 different lines the court might choose to draw. This 

7 case at most presents a question where a court is 

8 exercising the power of judicial review to invalidate a 

9 previously precleared statute. It might decide the case 

more narrowly, as I said, under Young versus Fordice, on 

11 a more fact-specific basis. But at the very most, the 

12 Court would need to decide in this case is that the 

13 State court exercises a judicial review to invalidate 

14 previously precleared practices as compliant with 

section 5 do not give rise to section 5 changes. 

16  And, Chief Justice Roberts, just to get back 

17 to the textual piece of this, we have, pointed, in 

18 addition to the "in force or effect" language, which we 

19 think -- which we think requires judgment for the 

Governor on Young versus Fordice grounds and the 

21 November 1, 1964, language, we have also pointed to the 

22 provision in section 5 that we have referred to as the 

23 savings clause, which I think provides good reason at 

24 the very least to think that Congress was thinking about 

court decisions enjoining existing baselines differently

2 legislative and administrative changes that have been
 

3 the grist of this Court's section 5 jurisprudence.
 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Newsom, before you
 

finish I would like to ask you a question about what 

6 action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the 

7 law? That is, a mistake by the Alabama Circuit Court 

8 can't invalidate a law that the Supreme Court says on 

9 judicial review of -- on review of the circuit court, 

that the circuit court got it wrong. 

11  The first time around, when Jones was 

12 elected and then the Governor mooted any controversy by 

13 just appointing him. Now we have a similar situation. 

14 We have somebody who has won an election overwhelmingly 

against the person that the Governor appointed. There 

16 are, what, five months left in the term? If your 

17 position on the law is correct, would the Governor in 

18 fact oust the person who was a four-to-one 1 winner in a 

19 popular election and install the person who was a loser 

in -- would that happen? Could we project based on what 

21 happened the first time around that the Governor would 

22 not so thwart the will of the people? 

23  MR. NEWSOM: It would be the Governor's 

24 option, Your Honor, whether to -- to do what was done in 

1987 or '8, I suppose, and to install the winner of the

1 election or to reinstate Juan Chastang to his position. 

2 I have not discussed with the Governor what his specific 

3 intentions would be with respect to that. But it would 

4 be his option to take one of those two courses under the 

law. 

6  I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

8 Mr. Newsom. 

9  Ms. Karlan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES 

12  MS. KARLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

13 and may it please the Court: 

14  I want to turn initially to two cases that 

weren't mentioned yet by the Court that I think dispose 

16 of the question of whether the law was in force or 

17 effect. And I would like to direct the Court's 

18 attention to page 101 of the joint appendix, because the 

19 language I'm going to be talking about appears there in 

the course of the Governor's request for reconsideration 

21 of DOJ's objection. This is the language from this 

22 Court's opinion in Young against Fordice. And it starts 

23 midway down the page, where the Court says that: "The 

24 simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under 

State law does not show entirely by itself that the 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 practice was never in force or effect." We agree.
 

2  And then the Court goes on to say: "A
 

3 State, after all, might maintain in effect for many
 

4 years a plan that technically or in one respect or
 

another violated some provision of State law," citing 

6 Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against 

7 United States. 

8  All that Young against Fordice does is 

9 explain that that case is a sport that deviates from the 

general rule that this Court has had that when a law is 

11 in force or effect its constitutionality under State law 

12 doesn't matter. 

13  I'd also like to direct the Court's 

14 attention to page 114 of the joint appendix, where Act 

85-237's text appears, and direct you to the bottom of 

16 the page in section 4, which says: "This Act shall 

17 become effective immediately upon its passage and 

18 approval by the Governor upon its otherwise becoming a 

19 law," which it did in June of '85 when the State 

obtained preclearance. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that the 

22 lawsuit to invalidate it was filed as soon as was 

23 feasible? 

24  MS. KARLAN: I don't honestly know the 

answer to that question, Justice Scalia, because Alabama 

28

1 law has different views, for example, on ripeness and 

2 the like than Article III does. And this also goes to 

3 the question that Justice Ginsburg asked at the very end 

4 of the argument about the remedy in this case, because 

Alabama law here is quite peculiar. And since we filed 

6 our brief there have been two opinions by the Alabama 

7 Supreme Court, in a case called Roper against Rhodes and 

8 a case called Wood against Booth, that reiterated under 

9 Alabama law once an election has been held, if no 

contest litigation was timely brought, the fact that the 

11 person is unentitled to remain in office does not allow 

12 contest after the fact. 

13  So we have a peculiar problem in this case, 

14 which is, even if this Court were to reverse, there was 

an election held here pursuant to Alabama Act 2006-342 

16 that was conceivably valid under Alabama law. And the 

17 question whether to replace Merceria Ludgood who won 

18 that election, as you noted, by a four-to-one margin, 

19 with either Juan Chastang or somebody else is quite up 

in the air. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't the Alabama 

22 Supreme Court say that in this very case? 

23  MS. KARLAN: Well, in this case, the 

24 election hadn't been held yet, Justice Scalia. That is, 

the Alabama Supreme Court in the Riley decision here

1 ruled in the Governor's favor before we brought our 

2 preclearance action, so there was no election on the 

3 table. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it was the district 

judge that made Alabama go to the preclearance after the 

6 second --

7  MS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But still, if you take 

9 this case at its essence, a circuit court got Alabama 

law wrong and that's what you say counts as to make the 

11 law operative. 

12  The law becomes operative because an Alabama 

13 intermediate court or trial court made a wrong decision 

14 about Alabama law; and then when the supreme court 

corrects it, that doesn't count. That's essentially 

16 your position, that they're locked, Alabama is locked 

17 into a mistake that was made about Alabama law by that 

18 circuit court. 

19  MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We're not 

saying that Alabama is locked in by the mistake of the 

21 circuit court. What we're claiming here is that in 

22 April of 1985, Alabama passed Act 85- 237. As a matter 

23 of Alabama law, it went into effect. In 1985, Alabama 

24 received preclearance. That law was on the books; an 

election was held; a man served for three years. But

1 it's not just that, Justice Ginsburg. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I don't think 

3 -- I don't think I follow you that, as a matter of 

4 Alabama law, it went into effect. Just because the 

statute said it went into effect does not prove that it 

6 went into effect. I think the Alabama --

7  MS. KARLAN: Your Honor --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Alabama Supreme 

9 Court would say it never went into effect because it was 

unconstitutional. 

11  MS. KARLAN: No. No, Your Honor. If you 

12 look at page 5 of the defendant's trial brief, which is 

13 -- I think it's Docket No. 16 -- you'll see that there 

14 in footnote 5 the State says: We asked for the Alabama 

Supreme Court to hold Act 85-237 void ab initio. They 

16 did not do that, but we think they ought to have. 

17  And so even as a matter of Alabama law, I 

18 don't think this is 100 percent clear. But if I can 

19 turn to the 2004 Act, because we think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose they didn't 

21 have that footnote. Suppose they said: We hold it void 

22 ab initio. Then, what's your answer to Justice Scalia's 

23 question? 

24  MS. KARLAN: My answer to his question is 

Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against

1 United States still compel the result of finding that 

2 this law went into effect as a matter of Federal law, 

3 because the question of whether a law is in force or 

4 effect is a question of construing section 5 of the 

Voting Rights Act, which is Federal law. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you're saying that if 

7 a State passes a statute -- a State legislature passes a 

8 statute that's flagrantly in violation of the State 

9 constitution, it immediately is precleared, it's locked 

into place? 

11  MS. KARLAN: Yes, I am. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: That rule of law renders 

13 constitutional under State law an act that would 

14 otherwise not be constitutional.

 MS. KARLAN: No, it does not render it 

16 constitutional. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what you're 

18 saying. 

19  MS. KARLAN: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that's the 

21 effect: It locks it in. 

22  MS. KARLAN: It locks it in until the State 

23 comes up with a constitutional cure, in the same way --

1  JUSTICE SCOUTER: It locks it in. 

2  MS. KARLAN: Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't 

3 require that they stay with that law. It simply says 

4 they cannot make a change without obtaining 

preclearance, because that's what section 5 does. It's 

6 a clear, bright-line rule. 

7  JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask: You're not --

8 correct me if I'm wrong. I didn't think you were 

9 arguing that because of the preclearance followed by the 

State determination of unconstitutionality, that the 

11 State was required to follow that unconstitution law. 

12  I thought your argument simply was that, in 

13 effect, there was a stalemate at that point, and the 

14 State was going to have to come up with some new law 

that would be precleared. Am I correct? 

16  MS. KARLAN: It's a little trickier than 

17 that, Justice Souter, for the following reason. Let me 

18 give you a hypothetical that will --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: For the reason that, absent 

their coming up with a new law, what law would be in 

21 effect? 

22  MS. KARLAN: That's what I was about to 

23 explain. 

24  JUSTICE SOUTER: And isn't the answer that 

no law would be in effect? I mean, you're in the same

1 situation then that you would be in if there had been no 

2 judicial litigation going on, the law had been brought 

3 to the Justice Department or the D.C. court, had --

4 preclearance had been refused. The State at that point 

didn't have the old law because it had been repealed. 

6 It couldn't apply the new law because it wasn't 

7 precleared, and somebody in Alabama would have to do 

8 something. 

9  Aren't we in essentially the same position 

here? 

11  MS. KARLAN: Well, we are, but as I 

12 suggested, it's a little trickier than that. Because, 

13 of course, the existing practice is for purposes of 

14 section 5 the law that's in force or effect. So, for 

example, suppose you had a State that --

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was in force and 

17 effect. 

18  MS. KARLAN: Excuse me? 

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: Does the theory require 

that we assume it remains in force and effect by virtue 

21 of the preclearance even when there is a subsequent 

22 determination of unconstitutionality? 

23  MS. KARLAN: I think the answer to that 

24 question, candidly, is yes, and the State can cure that 

quite quickly. But let me explain it with a 

34
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 hypothetical that might make this clearer, which is: 

2 Suppose you had a State in which people were voting in 

3 an election, and then the State supreme court held that 

4 that part of the county had never been properly annexed. 

The State would be required to continue letting those 

6 people vote in the election unless and until it received 

7 preclearance from the Department of Justice. That's 

8 what Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart 

9 require.

 So the State has to, once it adopts a 

11 practice, continue using that practice unless and until 

12 it receives preclearance for a new practice or -- and 

13 this is somewhat --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that in those 

cases you had what you had here, which was a 

16 declaration, let's assume, of invalidity ab initio. 

17  Let me give you this hypothetical. A county 

18 council goes to the board of commissioners or the board 

19 of supervisors of the local county or legislative branch 

and says: The legislature has just adjourned; it passed 

21 a lot of laws, and one of the laws it passed is that 

22 that you now have to set the qualifications locally for 

23 certain officials, so we have to act on this right away. 

24  They pass the legislation. Three weeks go 

by. The county council says: You know, I made a

1 mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed 

2 by the governor. What rule? What result? 

3  MS. KARLAN: Well, in your hypothetical 

4 there would be no problem at all, and this goes back to 

Justice Souter's hypothetical that he asked Mr. Newsom, 

6 which is: That law hasn't been precleared. Therefore, 

7 it's never in force or effect as a baseline. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it had been 

9 precleared?

 MS. KARLAN: Then it would be Perkins 

11 against Matthews. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, is it? Because -- I 

13 mean, what they're saying is let's use a little common 

14 sense here. And you look at Fordice and there it was an 

instance where it just didn't take effect at all as a 

16 practical matter. 

17  And then we cited those two cases you're 

18 talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion 

19 -- there was a ward system that was in fact in force or 

effect. But I don't know how long that ward system was 

21 in effect. It might have been for a long time, and 

22 people might have taken action under it. 

23  And the same thing is true in City of 

24 Lockhart. I can't tell. You may know. But my point is 

they are saying: Here we have a middle case, and what 

36

1 we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't 

2 really in effect. People challenged it the minute they 

3 could. They -- everybody knew it was unconstitutional, 

4 or a lot of people believed it. And the Governor then 

did something to make up for it. 

6  If you're going to say that that little bit 

7 counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what 

8 we're going to have? We're going to have every 

9 municipality all over the country that doesn't always 

know what the rules are, and they pass something, and 

11 people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong, 

12 and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law. 

13 That's going to be a mess. 

14  They're saying something like that, so I'd 

like to hear your response. 

16  MS. KARLAN: Well, there are two factual 

17 points in response to your question, Justice Breyer. 

18 The first is, with respect to Perkins against Matthews, 

19 the Mississippi statute that required the use of 

at-large rather than district elections was passed in 

21 1962 and used precisely once before the preclearance, so 

22 it was on all fours with this case. It was a three-year 

23 lag between the unconstitutionality of the City of 

24 Canton's practice and the preclearance. So if we were 

to ask what does our case look most like that this Court 

37

1 has already decided, it would be Perkins. 

2  The second point which I want to direct the 

3 Court to is we are not actually talking in this case --

4 and this goes as well to the Court's judicial function 

-- about just Act 85-237. We are also talking in this 

6 case about Act 2004-215, which was the attempt by the 

7 Alabama Legislature to revise the constitutionality of 

8 Act 85-237. Because the central problem in this case 

9 was a provision of the Alabama Constitution, Section 

105, that said you couldn't pass local legislation 

11 unless the act -- unless the general act made that very 

12 clear. 

13  So in 2004 the Alabama legislature thought 

14 it had solved the entire problem here by amending the 

section of chapter 11 of the Alabama election law to say 

16 unless a local law provides otherwise you can use 

17 gubernatorial appointment. That law was intended to 

18 revive Act 85-237. We know this because, among other 

19 things, our clients were the sponsors of the act, among 

the sponsors of the act. 

21  Now, the Alabama legislature --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: If I could just ask you, in 

23 making that argument, aren't you asking us to say that 

24 the purpose of this act -- that the intent of the 

Alabama legislature in passing that act is different

1 from the intent as determined by the Alabama Supreme 

2 Court? 

3  MS. KARLAN: Yes, but if I can explain why I 

4 think this is important in a sense. It's because the 

claim of the State is that this is a case about 

6 fundamental constitutional provisions of Alabama law, 

7 but in fact in its current guise, which is whether the 

8 2004 Act revived the 1985 Act, this is purely a matter 

9 of statutory construction and what the Alabama Supreme 

Court said is: We don't think the legislature meant to 

11 make this law retroactive; we think they meant to make 

12 it only prospective. But that's not the same thing as 

13 talking about fundamental Marbury against Madison 

14 judicial review of the kind that the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a review of a lower 

16 court by a higher court. That's what higher courts do. 

17 They review for correctness, and the Alabama Supreme 

18 Court said the circuit court got it wrong. It 

19 misconstrued the law, and we are correcting that. And 

that's -- that's correct. 

21  MS. KARLAN: That is correct, Justice 

22 Ginsburg, which leads to the second pair of cases that 

23 we think this Court has already decided that provide you 

24 absolutely clear guidance as to why preclearance was 

required here. And that's this Court's decision in

1 Hathorn against Lovorn and this Court's decision in 

2 Branch against Smith. 

3  In both of those cases as well, you had the 

4 question, quite acutely in Hathorn against Lovorn, of 

whether or not the chancery court in Mississippi, which 

6 is a trial-level court, got the law right or wrong on 

7 whether elections should be conducted in a particular 

8 way in Warren County. The Mississippi Supreme Court 

9 said they got it wrong.

 But this Court said that decision and the 

11 implementation require preclearance because the presence 

12 of a court decree doesn't exempt a contested change from 

13 section 5. 

14  So in this case, had Governor Riley decided 

completely by himself that he, having taken an oath to 

16 support the Alabama constitution, could not in good 

17 conscience let a special election go forward here, it 

18 would be no different from having the Alabama Supreme 

19 Court decide that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the Alabama 

21 Supreme Court preclear? Where it was redistricting and 

22 it had a redistricting plan, I can see it would send 

23 over to the attorney general the new redistricting plan.

Alabama or, in this case, the governor must come before

3  MS. KARLAN: Exactly what was submitted

decision to appoint rather than to elect someone to 

6 District 1 of the Mobile County Commission. The Alabama 

7 Supreme Court didn't have to submit anything, and the 

8 Federal court could not have been clearer in this case. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal court told 

the Alabama --

11  MS. KARLAN: No, it told --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It told Alabama. I 

13 thought -- I thought that one of the reasons was 

14 adjudication wasn't complete when the district court 

made its first ruling, so the district court said, now, 

16 go off and get those two Alabama Supreme Court decisions 

17 precleared. 

18  MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. That's not 

19 what they said.

21  MS. KARLAN: If you turn to the August 18th 

22 final judgment, which is on page 9a over to page 10a of 

23 the jurisdictional statement, they said judgment is 

24 entered in our favor -- that was the declaratory 

judgment -- and then said the State of Alabama has 90

2  The State was free to come to the DDC and
 

3 seek judicial preclearance if they wanted. The State
 

4 was free, as Justice Scalia suggested, to try and use
 

the quick way. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the State's position 

7 was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the 

8 State's highest court --

9  MS. KARLAN: But it -- it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- saying that the State 

11 lower court got it wrong. 

12  MS. KARLAN: Justice Ginsburg, this does not 

13 say the State has to preclear the decision of the 

14 Alabama Supreme Court. It simply says -- and if you 

look at page 8a, which is the end of the district 

16 court's opinion -- you know, it's enjoining enforcement 

17 of those decisions; it's not enjoining those decisions. 

18 You don't have to spin the Alabama Supreme Court here. 

19 But they literally sued only the governor in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did Alabama have 

21 to preclear anything? On November 1st, 1964, this was 

22 an appointed position. This is not a change from what 

23 was, quote, "in force or effect" on November 1st, 1964.

3  MS. KARLAN: But let me go then straight to 

4 a factual point, which is this is not the same practice 

as they were using on November 1st of 1964, because that 

6 practice was a combination of two things. It was 

7 gubernatorial appointment under Alabama Section 11-3-6, 

8 and it was gubernatorial appointment in the context of 

9 at-large elections, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So something else 

11 changed --

18 made in your brief was that this was already decided in 

19 Reno versus Bossier Parish. I didn't see the --

22 this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You quote in your
 

brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case. 

6 I'm thinking of one other. 

7  MS. KARLAN: I think you're probably 

8 thinking about Young against Fordice, itself. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. And you raised 

the argument -- you criticized them for raising this 

11 argument; that this wasn't any different; but you did 

12 not say that it wasn't any different. 

13  MS. KARLAN: Well, their claim there was 

14 that -- not that this wasn't any different, but part of 

our explanation is that, in context, we think there is a 

16 difference between what was going on in 1964. 

17  They actually, I think, want to go back to 

18 the 1977 to 1985 practice, which is the post -- the 

19 post-election practice in Alabama once Brown against 

Moore had been decided. 

21  Now, the other thing is I will say that the 

22 Department of Justice regulations on this, which are 

23 quite clear, have been in effect since 1987. And in the 

24 2006 -- in the 2006 re-enactment of the Voting Rights 

Act, if you look at the House report, they talk about

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're quite 

6 right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I 

7 just don't see how that squares with the statutory 

8 language. 

9  MS. KARLAN: Well, Your Honor, if I could 

just make an observation about section 5 more generally 

11 in Allen, and I'll start here. In Allen, itself, this 

12 Court recognized that the text of section 5 doesn't 

13 provide for private rights of action, and yet it found 

14 them.

 It recognized that the text of section 14 of 

16 the Voting Rights Act suggests that the only place that 

17 can be -- that the only place that can litigate section 

18 5 --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So because we've 

ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget 

21 about it here? 

22  MS. KARLAN: No, because that's -- that's 

23 the -- those sets of decisions by this Court have been 

24 ratified by Congress and have been the longstanding 

practice under section 5. You should continue that.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that --

2 they ratified -- these cases were ratified by Congress, 

3 but Congress did not change the language in the statute. 

4  MS. KARLAN: Because it thought that the 

purpose of section 5 -- if I could spend just one 

6 sentence on this -- the purpose of section 5's November 

7 1st language was to prevent a sort of game of 

8 Whac-A-Mole in which the States would keep changing the 

9 practice. And the idea of that freeze was to hold it in 

place so that it could be challenged as a constitutional 

11 matter before the State switched again. It wasn't to 

12 create a safe harbor against attacks on the November 1st

1 jurisdiction to seek preclearance whenever it seeks to 

2 administer any change in its voting practices. And 

3 there is no basis in either text or policy for carving 

4 out an exception for all or some changes precipitated by 

State-court decisions. The judgment of the district 

6 court should, therefore, be affirmed. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any problem 

8 with the republican form of government provision of the 

9 Constitution?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Absolutely not. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand what's 

12 going on here, the -- the legislative process of the 

13 people of Alabama, whereby something is invalid as a 

14 law, suddenly becomes a law because the Federal attorney 

general has given it preclearance. The people have 

16 never voted for that properly under their Constitution. 

17 Yet, it becomes law in Alabama. And that's a republican 

18 form of government? 

19  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't think, with 

respect, Justice Scalia, that that's actually happened 

21 here. What happened in this case was that the practice 

22 of special elections actually went into effect while the 

23 litigation was ongoing. 

24  The Alabama Supreme Court then held that the 

statute adopting that practice was invalid as a matter

1 of State law, to be sure, and, therefore, was void ab 

2 initio as a matter of State law. 

3  As a result of that decision, the remedy in 

4 some sense was to revert to the practice of 

gubernatorial appointments. And what happened then was 

6 that it was then incumbent on the attorney general under 

7 section 5, the Alabama attorney general, to seek 

8 preclearance of that practice. And the Federal attorney 

9 general made the determination that it would be 

retrogressive to go back to that practice. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: From an Alabama law that 

12 had never been adopted by the people of Alabama? 

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: It had been adopted by the 

14 people of Alabama.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not validated, so --

16  MR. SHANMUGAM: It was invalid, to be sure, 

17 as a matter of State law. And then -- and then what 

18 happens at that point is that the Alabama attorney 

19 general is in very much the same position as he would be 

if the Federal attorney general had held that some 

21 statutory provision that had been enacted by the Alabama 

22 legislature was improperly retrogressive. He would be 

23 faced with a choice: He could either proceed under a 

24 practice that was invalid under State law, or the State 

could pass a new law providing a --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That all depends on there 

2 having been a change. What there was was gubernatorial 

3 appointment. Then the legislature passes a law. 

4 Suppose that the circuit court had said, sorry, 

legislature, you got it wrong, general prevails, you 

6 can't do it this way, the law is invalid. Suppose the 

7 circuit court had said that. Then there would not have 

8 been an election, right. 

9  MR. SHANMUGAM: That's exactly right, and 

under our view there would not have been a change, 

11 because it was the fact that there was a special 

12 election that was critical. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there becomes -- there 

14 becomes a change only because the circuit court has made 

the mistake about what the State law is. That's very 

16 odd. 

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: There becomes a change, 

18 Justice Ginsburg, because the practice of special 

19 elections actually went into effect by virtue, at a 

minimum of the fact that an election was held. And to 

21 be sure --

1 I'm not going to disrupt the election, there isn't time; 

2 so this election can go forward and during that period 

3 I'll be considering the law. We do that all the time, 

4 or three-judge district courts do, saying we're going to 

look at this question, but we don't have time to stop 

6 the election so it's going to go forward. In that case, 

7 would that lead to the same result? 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, with respect, 

9 Mr. Chief Justice, I think what a State court might do 

in that circumstance would be to enter a stay until it 

11 could adjudicate the validity --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but not 

13 always. You know, if it's a week before the election or 

14 something, even if they think it's a serious claim, they 

sometimes say: We're going to allow the election to go 

16 forward because we're going to look at this and perhaps 

17 the State Supreme Court has to look at it, and we don't 

18 want to hold up the election. 

19  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it is certainly the 

implication of our position that if the law actually 

21 goes into effect and an election is held and if 

22 preclearance has already been granted for, in some 

23 sense, the contrary position, then, yes, if the State 

24 Supreme Court or the State trial court subsequently 

gives State law a different interpretation, then that

1 change is going to require preclearance. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not just an 

3 implication. That's your whole theory. 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it is our theory as to 

what the "in force or effect" requirement means. And we 

6 believe that that follows from this Court's decision in 

7 Young versus Fordice, which sets out the parameters for 

8 determining --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, Young versus Fordice, 

that's Young versus -- I mean, if it never went into 

11 force and effect, of course we don't reach questions 

12 like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors 

13 and so forth. And so I think it's an important matter. 

14 And as I read Fordice, we have over here an instance 

where nothing happened. You know, some people 

16 registered and then immediately they were told the 

17 registration was no good. So it wasn't in force and 

18 effect. 

19  When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that 

was not a case where the law was challenged immediately. 

21 Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been 

22 in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they 

23 had an election under the ward system. So even if it 

24 might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still 

in effect for three years.

1  In the other case, City of Lockhart, Justice 

2 Powell says this statute has been in effect, we assume, 

3 from 1917 to 1973. That's not exactly a fleeting 

4 matter. So -- so here we have a case where they 

challenged it instantly, where it was litigated as fast 

6 as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice 

7 Ginsburg just said, a different decision of the circuit 

8 court would have led to the opposite of it never would 

9 have even had it. So what harm does it do to the 

enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United 

11 States if the holding of this Court were, well, under 

12 these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et 

13 cetera, it never took force and effect? 

14  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Breyer, the harm is 

that there would be actual retrogression. And I think 

16 that there are two critical and distinct legal issues 

17 that this Court needs to address. The first is whether 

18 this practice was in effect for long enough for it to 

19 have been in force or effect. The governing precedent 

on that issue is Young versus Fordice. 

21  And we believe that there is more here. 

22 There is not simply the partial implementation of voter 

23 registration procedures for a very brief period of time, 

24 a matter of weeks. An election was actually held and if 

that is not sufficient to satisfy the "in force or 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 effect" requirement, it's hard to see what would be. 

2  The second question is whether a practice 

3 can be said to be in force or effect when it was void ab 

4 initio as a matter of State law. And we do respectfully 

submit that the City of Lockhart and Perkins answer that 

6 question because in both of those case the Court held 

7 that the relevant question was whether the practice was 

8 actually in effect. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you talk 

about force and effect. Of course, the statute says 

11 "force or effect on November 1st, 1964." Do you have 

12 anything to add to Ms. Karlan's response on my quaint 

13 fixation on the language of the statute? 

14  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it isn't quaint at 

all. I would say that I do think that as a textual 

16 matter one could perhaps make the argument that where a 

17 covered jurisdiction changes its voting practice after 

18 the statutory coverage date and then enacts basically a 

19 new version of the pre-existing practice, that the new 

practice could as a formal matter be said to be a new 

21 practice. 

22  But I want to make two additional points. 

23 The first is that the question of whether the statute 

24 covers reversion to coverage date practices is really 

not properly before the Court. Appellant seemingly did

1 not raise it before the district court and it is not --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that can't tie 

3 our hands in properly interpreting the statute. 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it's not within the 

scope of the question presented, either. The question 

6 presented focuses solely on the question of whether 

7 changes precipitated by State court decisions require 

8 preclearance. And that's a question that this Court has 

9 answered twice in Hathorn and Branch.

 The only other thing that I would say is 

11 that it has been not only the consistent interpretation 

12 of the attorney general, but also the consistent 

13 interpretation as far as we are aware of the lower 

14 court, that the statute does reach reversions to 

preexisting practices as well. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how --

17 regardless of how consistent the interpretation is, how 

18 can you read "November 1st, 1964," to mean anything 

19 other than that date?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I do think that a 

21 textual argument could be made, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

22 the practice that was in effect as of the coverage date 

23 in some sense ceases to exist when the jurisdiction 

24 adopts an intervening distinct practice. And certainly 

there is enough ambiguity, I believe, to get us into the

1 realm of deference, and this Court has repeatedly 

2 recognized that the attorney general's interpretations 

3 of section 5 are entitled to substantial deference. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugan, what does 

the attorney general do when he gets -- I mean, does he 

6 just preclear any old thing that somebody shoves under 

7 his nose? Does he look to see whether there is 

8 litigation pending on it? Was this litigation pending 

9 when it was --

MR. SHANMUGAM: I think this bears --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the plan was 

12 submitted --

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: This bears on a critical 

14 point, Justice Scalia. And this Court has a line of 

cases in the section 5 area that says that it is really 

16 incumbent on covered jurisdictions when they seek 

17 preclearance clearly to identify the relevant change in 

18 their voting practices when they come to the attorney 

19 general for preclearance. And when the 1985 act was 

submitted for preclearance, there was nary a word in the 

21 Alabama attorney general's submission that there was any 

22 potential difficulty with the statute under State law. 

23  And so, the attorney general precluded on 

24 the understandable understanding that the statute simply 

affected a shift to special elections. And I do think

1 that the great price of Appellant's interpretation is if 

2 the court were to adopt it, it would suddenly shift the 

3 burden to the Federal attorney general or the D.C. 

4 District Court to when they receive a preclearance 

submission, essentially assess the meaning and validity 

6 of any State statute, lest the State statute be 

7 construed differently by a State court, and thus, lock 

8 in the preclearance court or attorney general. And we 

9 believe that that problem along with this Court's 

decision in Branch and Hawthorne support our 

11 interpretation. 

12  Thank you. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

14  Mr. Newsom, four minutes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Newsom, I hate to 

16 intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like to ask 

17 you this question. Supposing a State after 1964 and 

18 before 2000 made 35 different changes of all improved 

19 voting rights, could they always go back to the practice 

in effect of 1964 and not have to preclear? 

21  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM 

22  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 

23  MR. NEWSOM: Your Honor, if we are talking 

24 about a legislative or administrative change, the answer 

may well be no under this Court's dicta.

1  JUSTICE STEVENS: It could be any kind of
 

2 change, legislative, administrative, judicial, could
 

3 they always go back to 1964 and have a safe harbor?
 

4  MR. NEWSOM: I think that, Your Honor, if
 

you're going to treat all forms of changes together, 

6 then they may well be able to. Although I would say 

7 this, that that will very rarely, if ever, be the case. 

8 This is sort of the odd ball case in which the reversion 

9 happens to be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. I'm just 

11 trying to understand how much teeth there is in the 1964 

12 date. Is it safe harbor or isn't it? 

13  MR. NEWSOM: Well, I think the explanation 

14 for 19 -- for November 1, 1964 is section 5 was 

implemented as a five-year stopgap measure. It's now 

16 been extended through 2031 with no amendment of the 

17 language. So it might have made some sense as a hard 

18 requirement in 1964. It makes much less practical 

19 sense, I recognize, today. But the language is what the 

language is I'm sorry. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 

22 Ms. Karlan's response that this is not the same practice 

23 but it's different because the underlying method of 

24 election has been changed.

 MR. NEWSOM: With respect, Your Honor, I

1 think the plaqueities is gubernatorial appointment. It 

2 doesn't strike me that the underlying method of how the 

3 election might have operated if the rule were election 

4 should matter, the rule was gubernatorial appointment. 

The rule is by virtue of these decisions gubernatorial 

6 appointment. 

7  If I may, just a couple of housekeeping 

8 items. 

9  Justice Ginsburg, the question of what DOJ 

was asked to preclear here is crystal clear from the 

11 district court's opinion. On August 18, 2006, this 

12 three-judge court held that two Alabama Supreme Court 

13 decisions Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy must be 

14 precleared before they can be -- so the notion that the 

State was not asked to preclear judicial decisions is 

16 simply incorrect. 

17  The second thing I'd like to mention just 

18 briefly is that the Federalism exacerbation here exists 

19 in a very real way for this reason. The entire 

legislative and litigation history of section 5 has been 

21 about legislative and administrative change. Even with 

22 respect to those sorts of changes, this Court has said 

23 most recently and most forcefully in Presley that that 

24 application of section 5 even there works an 

extraordinary change of the traditional course of 

59

1 relations between the states and the Federal Government. 

2 So the -- to this point to be sure the Court has been 

3 willing to accept that extraordinary departure. The 

4 question in this case, however, is whether this 

extraordinary departure ought to become this
 

6 extraordinary departure to account for this new
 

7 category, this new universe of changes.
 

8  JUSTICE SOUTER: Why as a matter of
 

9 Federalism is it more extraordinary to review a court
 

determination than the determination of a popularly 

11 elected legislature? 

12  MR. NEWSOM: Well, Your Honor, there are two 

13 pieces of this, really. That's more extraordinary 

14 simply in a quantitative sense. We are talking about a 

lot more changes, so in sheer numbers we have got an 

16 exacerbation. 

17  But it's also in a qualitative sense the 

18 sense that we are living in a post Marbury, post Cooper 

19 versus Aaron, post Bernie world in which State courts 

just like Federal courts are tasked with finally 

21 deciding what State law means. And so, there is a very 

22 real difference, I think, in upsetting the considered 

23 judgment of a State court with respect to what State 

24 court -- with respect to what State law means than there 

is --

1  JUSTICE SOUTER: But they are not saying 

2 State law is different from what it means. They are 

3 saying that you cannot put a change in effect until you 

4 get it precleared.

 MR. NEWSOM: Right, Your Honor. But with 

6 respect I think that that doesn't do justice to the 

7 functional reality of what's going on here. In 1988 the 

8 Alabama Supreme Court says, may I, says in Stokes versus 

9 Noonan that 85-237 is and always was unconstitutional. 

We have an issue of doctrine that's simply part of 

11 Alabama law and, again, I don't think anybody here 

12 seriously disputes that 85-237 was unconstitutional. 

13  And 20 years later DOJ steps in and refuses 

14 to bless that determination, and to be sure, is not 

meddling around in the intricacies of state law but the 

16 functional equivalent is the same. They set that 

17 judgment aside, and notwithstanding the Stokes court 

18 invalidation of that, DOJ says very clearly in its 

19 objection letters that 85-237, despite its invalidation, 

remains in full force and effect. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel. 

22 The case is submitted. 

23  (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 

24 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
