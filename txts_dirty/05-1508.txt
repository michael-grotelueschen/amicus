 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in case 05-1508, Zuni Public School 

District, et al. vs. Department of Education. 

Mr. Van Amberg.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice and may 

it please the Court:

 In 1994, Congress enacted the equalization 

formula under the Impact Aid Act. It did so clearly and 

decisively, and described a methodology which was 

unambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized 

statistical standard, and assisted in actually 

promulgating -- and -- the intent of the Impact Aid Act, 

which is to benefit impacted local educational agencies 

or school districts and not fund the general educational 

program of the States.

 In so doing, Congress removed from the 

Secretary the previously delegated authority to 

establish by regulation the equalization formula. The 

Secretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations 

in response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he 

was engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any

interpretations of statutes. Instead, the Secretary 

sought and announced that he was proceeding under an 

exception to the public notice and comment laws, 

5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely 

reflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory 

language.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, they were 

essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they 

not? And those regulations had gone through the notice 

and comment process.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Yes. That is correct, 

Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg. Those were essentially, 

except for a few words here and there, those were the 

same regulations. But they were in response to a 

congressional directive back in 1974 that the Secretary 

is to create the equalization formula. In 1994, 

Congress came in with legislation and established that 

formula.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the 

formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of 

Education, which is not something that Congress did in 

other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was 

doing. But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's 

own language that Congress enacted?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: The contention is made that

this 545-page omnibus education bill --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, just as to that, 

the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you 

say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: I don't think we know 

exactly who it was drafted by. I think there is --

there is some references in the Congressional --

Congressional Record that this is an administration 

bill. But I would, I would like to respond, Justice 

Ginsburg, based on the assumption that this was the 

Secretary's bill.

 Under the statutory formula, the language is 

clear that what is disregarded in -- in ranking LEAs and 

eliminating percentiles of LEAs is those LEAs which fall 

above the 95th percentile --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get into the 

substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem, 

whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill. 

Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94 

legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the 

prior regulations?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: No. This --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The prior regulations were 

promulgated when?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: The former regulations were

 MR. VAN AMBERG: 

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's a long time.

With a different Secretary 

MR. VAN AMBERG: And a different agency. 

There wasn't even --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no reason to 

believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary 

continued to have the same view of what was proper, is 

there?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: We view that it did not 

and, and also, Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, we 

also view that if this was the chief educational officer 

of the Federal Government, he was more than capable of 

developing a statute which reflected his methodology 

of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed he could have copied 

the regulations that were on the book and just put them 

in the statute, couldn't he?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, even in the same act, 

Your Honor, under when they had the EFIG statute, there 

Congress was able to reference the regulations of the 

Secretary. They didn't do so when they were, when they

enacted the impact aid part of it. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as -- as far as the 

difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the 

later Secretary's decision to retain, as you 

acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation. You 

said it didn't go through notice and comment the second 

time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in 

MR. VAN AMBERG: He didn't -- if I could, 

Your Honor, he did not retain the second regulation. 

This was supposed to be a new regulation which was 

promulgated by the Secretary because the Impact Aid Act 

had been repealed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes --

MR. VAN AMBERG: -- and re-enacted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and I appreciate that. 

But the text of it, what the regulation said was not 

significantly different from what the earlier regulation 

said.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: No. But it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was this the same 

Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the 

new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office 

when the new legislation had been proposed?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: The new legislation was

'94. Secretary enacted it in '96. I think it probably 

was. I -- I -- it was the same administration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why would the 

Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he 

deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula 

should be? Which is the power he had before. I mean, 

one must think that there must have been some pressures 

from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take 

some power away from me, please.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, that, and I would 

agree, Justice Scalia, that that is not a, a usual event 

where an administration intentionally disgorges from 

itself its own authority. And, and I would also point 

out the fact that again, there is a dramatic difference 

between what, what the statute proposed and, and the 

methodology described in the regulation. And what's, 

what's very significant is if you go back to 1976 when 

the original regulation was promulgated, there was a 

debate that went on in the public notice and comment 

portion of these proceedings where they discussed 

whether you eliminate percentile of LEAs directly or 

whether you add this extra step of eliminating 

percentage, percentages of pupils and then eliminating 

LEAs as these pupils are eliminated.

 I mean, it's a totally different process,

totally different philosophy behind them and as we can 

see in this particular case, in New Mexico and in 

Alaska, totally different results.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the 

statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest? 

It says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th 

percentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile 

of local education agencies or below the 5th percentile 

of local education agencies, does it?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, Justice Alito, I, I 

think what you, I think it is clear and unambiguous. 

And the reason is that if you, in order to run a 

percentile calculation you need units against which to 

run that, and then you need these, an identified set of 

variable standards such as they provided here, the 

average per pupil expenditures of each set of these LEAs 

or districts.

 So you rank the, the LEAs. You've got the 

variable values and then it, it's, the statute provides 

that you find that you eliminate those LEAs which are 

above the 95th percentile. And then if you go back to 

what "such" means and referencing back to other portions 

of the statute, it's 95th percentile of the revenues and 

expenditures of the LEAs in the State. It's a very 

similar process for --

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you distribute? I

something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and 

each one has a number on it. What are you distributing 

-- the cards? Are you, are you -- what's distribute --

a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution. 

What's it a distribution of?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: It's the distribution of 

the percent of the, what is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it a thing?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Like a thing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Like a -- like a set of 

things that you're distributing, what are they?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: The thing that you're 

running the percentile against is the total number of, 

of expenditures and revenues in the State.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, you take 

all the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a 

different number and the characteristic of each number 

is there some school district that spends per, or takes 

in per pupil, revenue equal to that number. So we write 

each one on a card. Is that what we're, is that our

distribution? We have like, let's say we have a, a

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, you know, in New 

Mexico's case you have --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I'm not, I'm 

saying what do you think it has to be? What do you 

think it should be? What are, what is it we are 

distributing? A simple question, I guess, for a 

statistician. I unfortunately am not one and can't find 

one, so I have no idea what this statute means.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, the, the -- the value 

against which --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not a value. I want to 

know what I'm distributing. And if you don't know I 

would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much 

better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I thought you said 

that you did know what it was. I thought you simply 

quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such 

expenditures or revenues in the State. That's what's 

being distributed.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Yes, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Such revenues or 

expenditures in the State consist of, the word "such" 

obviously refers you back to some prior reference to 

revenues in the State, and that prior reference in 

subsection A is a reference to district by district, not 

pupil by pupil.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: That, that's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, so in other words we 

are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers? If 

you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute 

is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, I'm sorry, Justice --

I'm -- Breyer; I'm having a little trouble understanding 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I thought not. 

Is there a --

MR. VAN AMBERG: -- the question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not certain 

about the hypothetical but you're certain about the 

statute, aren't you?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: I'm certain about the 

statute. You're provided the variable values that are 

attributed to each of the LEAs; you rank them; and you 

provide a percentile. It's a methodology which was 

described in 1976. It's a methodology employed every

day in ranking students and schools.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah -- that -- right. But 

I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so 

I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you 

referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, 

a set of things that's being distributed in a certain 

order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And if that's what 

percentile refers to, I just want to know what those 

things are that are being distributed. And - and that's 

where I find the ambiguity. And if there is an 

ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the 

agency at least as I understand it. So -- so that's why 

I asked the question.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: All right. And, and I 

think I understand the question now, Justice Breyer. 

Thank you.

 The units that are ranked or distributed are 

the LEAs or the school districts. And they are ranked 

in order of their per pupil expenditures and revenues. 

Those are the units and the component parts of this 

calculation that are provided for us by Congress.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And does the statute say 

you have to do it that way? It has to be the group

that's distributed?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: It's my understanding under 

-- under Brown and Williamson is if Congress speaks to 

an issue, Congress is to be obeyed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Clearly.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: There is nothing mysterious 

about this type of a methodology. And this is the one 

that Congress chose.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, you could do it that 

way and the reason the Government, I think, says that 

you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an 

absurd result.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: All right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That the object of the 

statute is to catch the outliers. And if you, for 

example, had one giant school district like New York 

City which was at the top of the list and another giant 

school district that was at the bottom of the list you 

would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half 

the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be 

outliers would they? I mean, that's the problem.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: And you have a similar 

infirmity associated with the other methodology. That 

is, if you have a number of LEAs which are small in 

numbers, as in New Mexico, particularly if you had a

number of small LEAs at the bottom, which is I think a 

huge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and 

let them to float off in their poverty. I think, I can 

understand where there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't, doesn't 

subsection b(ii) address outliers? I was surprised 

there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and 

maybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of. 

That says that the Secretary in making this 

determination can take into account particular types of 

LEAs where there is extra, additional costs. I would 

have thought for example if you had a very small LEA 

with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high 

because you don't have economies of scale, that you 

haven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that 

reason. Is that not how that works?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Yes. And this is the, the 

whole problem, that we can argue philosophically how 

whether Congress's methodology or the Secretary's 

methodology is better, but the backdrop of this is that 

the, the statute and also the regulation allows for 

school, for the States to back out all these 

disequalizing expenditures so that you, you make an 

adjustment to more or less end up with a baseline per 

pupil expenditure. And there is really no reason after

you do that for having a wide disparity, even between 

the top and the bottom LEA.

 The Secretary's formula, and I don't think 

we should be arguing whose formula is better, because if 

they are different, Congress wins, but nevertheless, the 

Secretary's formula, it eliminates 26 percent of the 

school districts. And under New Mexico, if you, if you 

look at the top and the bottom school district even 

after the eliminating of these funding differentials, 

you've got a 244 percent disparity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It, it eliminates 26 school 

districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 

percent or 10 percent of the pupils. And I guess what 

we are interested in here is not school districts; they 

are not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we 

are interested in students, real people who get money. 

And so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of 

the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not 

a bad thing, because what we are really interested in 

are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: And Justice Breyer, I think 

Congress and in its methodology has disagreed with that 

view, because it does not rely strictly upon pupils, and 

pupils are not necessarily the driving force in how we 

work this formula.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the problem was 

disparity in school districts. Since much of the 

funding for education is local funding, in some places 

there are very rich school districts and very, very 

poor, poor school districts. And I thought that the 

purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an 

enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to 

district. It makes perfect sense, it seems to me.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: And that is correct. 

Because these districts particularly in New Mexico serve 

a unique purpose. New Mexico has pockets of, of urban 

and populations, and then they have got small 

traditional villages; they have got farming communities; 

they have got Indian lands; they have got military 

bases. And a school district whether it educates 100 

children or 1,000 children or 5,000 children has a 

special value in the State and in our educational 

process. And simply because a child in New Mexico 

attends the school district that does not have 

particularly many students in it doesn't mean that he 

has to suffer a poorer education than his brethren and 

brothers and sisters in the metropolitan area.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, if there 

is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant 

consideration might be how would this work across

States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your 

reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different 

results from State to State depending on whether they 

have large districts or small districts at the top and 

the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils 

rather than school districts regardless of size, you 

would get uniformity going from State to State.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Justice Ginsburg, the 

Secretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies 

have their problems, depending on how your districts, 

the number of districts that you have in a State, their 

relative populations, how they line up. And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in 

understanding that at the end of the line here, if you 

win the Federal money will go to your two districts, 

whereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go 

to the State? Is that what the bottom line is?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: That's the bottom line.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: And I would point out, 

Justice Stevens, that Congress has made it clear that 

the impact aid is supposed to go to the impacted 

districts. It is not supposed to fund the general 

educational program of a State. The money that the 

State, that the State of New Mexico seeks to retain is

under a limited exception that has been created and it 

is, it is not that we are trying to take the State's 

money as the bottom line. It is that the State has 

taken the impact aid dollars and doesn't have an 

equalized system. New Mexico could equalize if it wants 

to. It established its equalization formula.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask another general 

question. If it were true, and I don't think it is in 

this case, that the biggest district was the one that 

got the most per pupil money -- the two biggest 

districts that were at the opposite ends of the 

spectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they, 

under your view?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, it actually 

depends -- you get into statistical approaches, but if, 

let's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just 

had let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you 

do the percentile against, if you work the percentile in 

that particular setting, nobody gets eliminated.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have the same 

problem if it's students, I take it? You'd have the 

same statistical question whether you, you use districts 

or students?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Correct, because you would 

run -- because if you had districts, big districts at

both ends, you run your 5 percent on both ends with the 

students, you end up not eliminating anybody.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right. I 

wouldn't think that was a problem. But what about 

Justice Stevens' question. There are 20 districts in 

our State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it --

and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the 

students, and the poor district has another quarter. So 

our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating 

from our calculation are the rich district and the poor 

district. One's at the top, one's at the bottom. And 

now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether 

they're equalized. But those 18 districts account for 

less than half or about half of all the students. 

That's the problem. It seems that isn't very 

representative and we're trying to get 

representativeness.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Well, Justice Breyer, I, I 

would respectfully like to go back, not to what we are 

trying to accomplish through judicial decision, but what 

Congress accomplished through its decision.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. If the 

language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, 

and you win. But if the language does permit it, the 

reason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect,

in my view to get to the Government's result. It might 

just barely permit it. But one of the things on their 

side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd 

result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because 

there is such variation in the number of pupils among 

school districts in different states.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Right. If I could address 

that, Your Honor. The only argument I see the State has 

is the argument about absurdity. This debate that we're 

having now is the debate that took place in 1976 in 

front of the Secretary. He recognized that there were 

two methodologies that he was considering. He 

recognized that they both had their problems. But in 

1994, Congress had before it at least or had available 

to it information as to the, whether, what, how this 

particular formula would work. There were only three 

and perhaps -- three States, Kansas, Alaska, New Mexico, 

and perhaps Arizona -- that had -- that were trying to 

take advantage of the, of this narrow exception. So 

they knew the configuration and the composition of these 

school districts.

 And so they could look if they wanted to --

and there's no legislative history to this, but they 

could have looked if they had wanted to, to exactly what 

the practical effect would be of these two formulas.

And the practical effect is that in New Mexico the 

formula which the Respondents contend is absurd reduced 

only 11 percent of the LEAs. And with the backdrop that 

this, that these LEAs should have been more or less 

equalized anyhow because of removing the disparate 

funding, that's, that's much more reasonable and 

certainly doesn't reflect an absurdity, and when you 

compare that to the Secretary's approach which 

eliminates 26 percent and cuts loose 23 school districts 

out of 89 from any consideration and you end up with 

kind of a core block in their 14 or 15 percent 

disparity, I think there may be those who could argue 

forcefully that that's an absurdity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your white light is 

on. I don't want to take -- would the other States make 

that same answer that you just made?

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Kansas equalizes under any 

formula, as New Mexico did, could do. Alaska, you 

eliminate 22 percent in order for them to just kind of 

squeak by. If they applied Congress's formula they 

would just equalize. This is an option I contend that's 

available to every State that wants to take advantage. 

If you give them a 25 percent disparity allowance, you 

allow them to back out disequalizing expenditures. 

There's really no explanation that's been offered why

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, ESQ.

 ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, you don't 

want us to stretch the language, do you?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think you 

need to stretch the language, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't urge us to 

do either, would you?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it depends on what 

you mean by stretch.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SRINIVASAN: The question, the question 

before the Court is whether the Secretary's formula is 

unambiguously foreclosed by the statutory test, not 

whether it's the better reading, but whether it's 

unambiguously foreclosed. And we happen to think it's 

the better reading, but we certainly think it's not 

unambiguously foreclosed. And maybe the clearest

indication that Congress did not unambiguously foreclose 

the Secretary's methodology --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the case that 

says "unambiguously foreclosed"?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Brand X says that, 

but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry 

under Chevron. And we can use "foreclosed" if you like, 

Your Honor.

 But the clearest indication that the statute 

does not foreclose the Secretary's methodology is a 

provision that I think hasn't been addressed thus far in 

the argument and that's that in the very same act in 

Congress in which Congress enacted Section 7709, the 

provision at issue here, Congress also explicitly 

endorsed and incorporated the Secretary's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You begin with an 

argument that directly cuts against your position. They 

knew how to do it under the -- I assume you're referring 

to the education finance and incentive grant program?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I am.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they did it 

there, they didn't do it here. To me that suggests the 

opposite of the inference you're trying to draw.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Mr. Chief 

Justice, with respect. There are two education finance

incentive grant program, or EFIG, provisions that we 

identified in the briefs and one of them I would 

acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument, 

although I don't think it's persuasive. But it's the 

other one that I'm focusing on, and what the other one 

does is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's 

regulations and so what Congress said in 1994 is that 

for purposes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which they did not 

say in this act.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: They didn't, but I think it 

would be very odd to attribute to Congress the intention 

on one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so 

that we want to use it and we want you to continue to 

use it for purposes of the EFIG program --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Different purposes.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: They're not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They're for different 

purposes.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: They're not different 

purposes at all, Justice Scalia, with respect. They're 

the exact same purpose. In both programs what Congress 

wanted to do was to get an assessment of the extent to 

which education expenditures were equalized in a State 

among school districts. They're the very same purpose.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But for different 

purposes. In the one case, in this act we're worried 

about an extensive Federal presence that has an effect 

on the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG 

program it's an entirely different question of 

equalization.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, at that level of 

generality you might be right, but with respect to the 

purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those 

acts the purpose is exactly the same. In impact aid, 

just like in EFIG, the question is to what extent has 

the State equalized expenditures across school 

districts. It's the very same question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe let me 

ask it directly. If they could so easily just say we 

incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why 

didn't they do it here?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They instead went to 

the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not 

mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation 

methodology is.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they didn't mimic it. 

They incorporated it. And so far as the argument is 

that they incorporated just the regulation qua

regulation and not the appendix to the regulation, I 

don't think that that argument can be squared with the 

statutory text or the regulatory text.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask, is there 

a difference legally between a regulation and an 

appendix to the regulation?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, at least 

not in the circumstance of this case, where the 

regulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix. 

And so when Congress incorporated the regulation it 

necessarily incorporated the appendix.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you say 

"incorporated," though. What it did was it took the 

language and it did not take --

MR. SRINIVASAN: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think so, Your 

Honor. The text of the statute in 1994 is set forth at 

the top of page 30 of the Government's brief, and I'm 

quoting from the second line of page 30 and what 

Congress said in the EFIG statute in 1994, again in the 

very same act that enacted this language --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the EFIG statute?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: In the EFIG statute.

the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. 

Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it 

took language from the regulation; it didn't take the 

part that said look to the appendix.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it didn't take the 

part that said look to the appendix because I don't know 

that that would have been a sensible thing to do when 

you're enacting a statute. But the point I'm trying to 

make is that when Congress in the EFIG statute 

incorporated the regulation it specifically referred to 

the regulation that the Secretary had in place at that 

time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it didn't do 

that here?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It didn't do that here, but 

it didn't have to. It makes sense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I still think it cuts 

against you rather than for you, the fact that they 

could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have 

this case.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let me just make one 

more point on this, Your Honor, and then I'll move to 

the text of Section 7709, because I do think that this 

point has a great deal of force. The reason that 

Congress would have incorporated the regulation

specifically in EFIG but not in impact aid is because 

we're dealing with an impact aid regulation. So the 

Secretary ordinarily wouldn't have thought that he 

should apply the impact aid regulation for purposes of 

EFIG unless Congress told him to do that and that's what 

Congress did. But with respect to impact aid, there's 

no reason to incorporate the regulation. The regulation 

already existed, and the question is did Congress in 

this act foreclose the Secretary from continuing to 

apply that longstanding regulatory methodology. And I 

would suggest that if Congress really wanted to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, if we could 

come to the, to the text that you're talking about.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't understand 

about the Government's position is why you use this, 

this per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't 

use it for purposes of (A). You, you don't -- in the 

major computation portions, namely for purposes of 

paragraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes 

expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second 

fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures 

made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it 

agency by agency, don't you? You DON'T apply this, you 

know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency. Why

don't you do for both?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if you look at 2(a), 

Your Honor what that says is that the disparity, the 

disparity standard at its broadest level deals with 

whether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked 

local educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues 

for the lowest one by 25 percent.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would make no difference 

if you take into account pupils for that part of the 

analysis, and here's the reason why. When you take into 

account pupils with respect to a local educational 

agency and you weight the local, the figure by the 

number of pupils served by the local educational agency, 

the per pupil figure that you're going to attach to each 

of those individual pupils is the same. It's the same 

per pupil figure for each one. It's just that you 

multiply it by the number of pupils.

 So for purposes of this part of the statute, 

where you're comparing the highest to the lowest, 

whether you took into account the number of pupils or 

not you'd still be dealing with the same two figures. 

You'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the 

highest ranked local educational agency and you'd be 

dealing with a figure that applies to the lowest ranked

local educational agency.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it comes to 

the same, but the fact remains you don't use that 

methodology in A, because you don't think the language 

requires that methodology. And it is the same language 

in B.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, there would be -- I 

don't know that we use one or the other. It's just that 

there would be absolutely no purpose served by using 

pupils with respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the purpose would be 

to follow the language of the statute, and if you think 

that the language in B requires this kind of an approach 

you should take the same approach in A, especially if it 

makes no difference.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, no; especially 

because it makes no difference, because with respect to 

the B part of it, the 95th and 5th percentile 

exclusions, it makes all the difference in the world 

whether you take into account --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have a conceptual 

difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way 

you do it. You take students and you assign a per-pupil 

number to each individual student.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I would have 

thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're 

dealing with LEAs. They have a per-pupil number because 

they've got a bunch of pupils. You take individual 

students, and you know for example in that school 

district you don't spend the same amount of money on the 

kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader. And 

yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and 

the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same. 

It's an artificial association. It makes sense to speak 

of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs 

because they have so many pupils, they get so much 

money, you can do the calculation. It doesn't make 

sense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has 

a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars. He may 

have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you 

creating this artificial association and then using, 

using that methodology?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's an approximation 

to be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal 

with approximations across the swath of students that 

are covered by local educational agencies.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's only -- the 

reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a 

swath of students, the district, that's the way it

should be ranked. When you're ranking it by pupils, 

maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the 

actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your 

methodology would make sense.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think what we're 

really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by 

the amount of pupils in the school district, and the 

reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate 

picture of the extent to which any one school district's 

per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall 

revenue pictures in the State. And if I could use one 

example which I think might help to crystallize why it's 

necessary to do this sort of weighting and why education 

finance practitioners routinely prescribe that you have 

to do this sort of weighting in order to avoid distorted 

results, if you consider the example of a State that has 

two school districts, and I'll use real examples from 

New Mexico. One would be the district that has the 

highest per-pupil revenues in the state, the Mosquero 

district, in which there's 57 pupils. And the other 

would be the Albuquerque school district, the largest 

school district in the State, which serves 84,000 

pupils.

 Now the per-pupil revenues for Albuquerque 

are roughly $3,000 and the per-pupil revenues for

Mosquero, the smaller school district, are roughly 

$7,000. And if you imagine a State that consists of 

just those two districts, and you ask the question to 

pair with the statutory language, what is the 50th 

percentile, and I'll use 50th just for ease of analysis, 

what is the 50th percentile of such per-pupil revenues 

in the State? One answer would be that you take the 

number for Mosquero, the 7,000 and you take the number 

for Albuquerque, the 3,000, you split the difference and 

you say the 50th percentile of per-pupil revenues in the 

State is $5,000. But I think that would present a very 

misleading picture of what's actually going on in the 

State.

MR. SRINIVASAN: Hawaii. Hawaii has one 

which is a special case but there are states that have a 

relatively small number of school districts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the, in the 

hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary 

address that disparity under (b)(ii)? In other words, 

the school district which has only 57 students, it seems 

to me could be taken out of the calculation under 

(b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more 

representative school districts, not the special case of 

the particularly isolated school district or whatever.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Two points on (b)(ii), 

Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that by -- by the 

statutory text, (b)(ii) is over and above what you do in 

(b)(i,). The 95th and 5th percentiles exclusions. So 

you first have to do that. But the more relevant 

point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have to 

do that? Why do you have to do it first? It says you 

can take into account this -- extent to which the 

program reflects additional costs in particular 

districts.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, my point is simply that 

under (b)(i) the statute says the Secretary shall 

disregard local education agencies that are above the

95th and below the 5th percentile. So I think the 

Secretary has to do that. Now (b)(ii) in some sense 

could be seen as an additional option for the Secretary 

over and above the exclusion, but there is a more 

fundamental point which is that with (b)(ii), it says 

take into account the extent to which a program of State 

aid reflects the additional costs.

 And so what that does is a piggyback on the 

way that the State approaches the situation. So this, 

as -- this provision as the Secretary understands it 

allows it to give effect to a State that gives effect to 

those sorts of considerations, but it's not an 

independent grant of authority for the Secretary himself 

to take those considerations into account.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you 

may have convinced me. I'll stipulate that you have 

convinced me that the argument that you're arguing for 

would probably be a better method, but you haven't 

touched the text of (b)(2)(b)(i) yet, and that's where 

some of us at least are, are having our -- our problems.

 Do you agree that in the absence of the 

other program, I forget the, the acronym for it -- that 

you really would not have any argument that there is 

ambiguity in the text here?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. No. Absolutely not.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then would you 

address the text?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, I will.

 It's at page 4a of the appendix of the 

Government's brief, b -- (b)(i). And what the text says 

is disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil 

expenditures or revenues above the 59th percentile or 

below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or 

revenues in the State.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Now one point I make --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So what is supposed to be 

disregarded are educational agencies?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And the agencies 

are identified how? How do we identify the agencies 

that would be disregarded?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: You identify the agencies 

to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th 

percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State. And 

then you disregard --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And we identify their 

per-pupil revenues, too, don't we? Agencies with 

per-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below, 

right?

MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, but -- and -- but the 

critical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile 

of such expenditures or revenues in the State.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that critical test is 

being applied to an agency which is being identified by 

reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues, 

correct?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It is. I mean there is no 

doubt that the per-pupil revenues or expenditure figures 

that lie on the spectrum are associated with the local 

educational agencies. That's how --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not merely that 

they are associated with. The very definition, the very 

identification of LEA here is exclusively in terms of 

per-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's not merely in 

association. It is a definition, isn't that so?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so. The --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then, then what does the 

phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 

or below 5 mean?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's true that each 

local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or 

revenue. But the critical part of the statute which has 

59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures 

or revenues doesn't foreclose weighting. And I think

the point that Justice Alito made bears, which is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why doesn't it? It 

seems to me that the only identification of an entity or 

person, if you want, to be disregarded is the 

identification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in 

terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues. So 

why doesn't that foreclose your position?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we -- two parts to 

the answer, Justice Souter. First the Secretary's 

formulation, no less than Petitioner's formulation, does 

disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil 

revenues above the 95th and 5th percentiles.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. Obviously --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Where we disagree is in 

identifying the 95th exactly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: After identifying them in 

terms of the expenditures or revenues. That's what 

you're supposed to do.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly. And I'd --

exactly. And I'd reiterate the point that Justice Alito 

made earlier, which is that Congress could have 

compelled the approach that Petitioners compelled --

contend, if it would have said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There are lots of things 

that Congress could have done differently from what it

did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an 

ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection 

of the LEA that we are talking about. And it doesn't 

create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what 

is to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think it does, Your 

Honor, because there are two different ways of ranking 

the LEAs. One is to take the per-pupil revenues 

associated with each LEA and simply take that list into 

account. Another is to take the same list but then 

weight it by the number of pupils in each LEA.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, that's another way to 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Nothing in the statute 

forecloses that approach.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do it, but tell me why 

that is consistent with the text.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because the text refers to 

the 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or 

revenues in the State, and the list that includes the 

weighting does represent a list of expenditures or 

revenues in the State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would such be -- of such 

expenditures or revenues. That refers back to local 

educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or

revenues. It's referring you back not to the totality 

of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil 

expenditures or revenues.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And I don't, I don't 

dispute that the per-pupil revenue figures belong to a 

local educational agency. But again that doesn't mean 

that you can't take into account the relative extent to 

which a particular school district contributes to the 

overall State picture, and the way you do that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't the statute 

have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according 

to the ranking? It does tell you to disregard LEAs, 

which suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the 

ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it is, it is a 

ranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's, 

each of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of 

pupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding 

LEAs. But as Justice Souter pointed out the first step 

is identifying the 5th and 95th percentiles, and on that 

step we take into account the number of pupils. It's 

only at that step that we take into account the number 

of pupils.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a rather basic 

question? What if I'm convinced that your opponent's 

reading is really only the fair reading of the statute, 

but I'm also convinced by you that that's not what 

Congress intended. What should I do?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, one way or another I 

think your should rule in our favor.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well no. Accept, accept 

my premises. What do you think I should do?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think in that 

situation you sort of have the sliding scale that we 

often confront with textual analysis. And if you really 

think that Congress would have compelled an absurd 

result, and I think it does verge on that, then you 

would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it has to be 

absurd, it's just, I would measure it by what Congress 

actually intended. Assume there two permissible 

readings, and two -- both of them make sense. And I'm 

convinced, assume I'm convinced by you, that they really 

intended to perpetuate the prior method of procedure.

 May I take that, may I come to that result

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if the language

think it goes, goes to that degree.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

your office had answered that question in countless 

briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of 

the statute and not some unexpressed intent.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's why I said, if 

you think that the statute unambiguously actually 

compels that reading, then I don't know that we would 

have a position.

number of cards, ultimately, under your hypothetical, 

Justice Breyer.

that have the same cards that have the same number? You 

have a lot --

MR. SRINIVASAN: They have the same cards,

reflect the extent to which each LEA contributes to the 

overall picture.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as I know it was 

the same Secretary of Education when the statute came on 

the books and when the regulation was kind of readopted, 

I think it was --

MR. SRINIVASAN: I think that's right, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a peculiar 

proposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to 

drop the bottom five. So it was a different proposal, 

and what was the reason for that? Why keep, keep the 

95th percentile but not the 5th?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, as we point out in a 

footnote in our brief there was some education finance 

experts that suggested there would be no reason to 

retain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and I 

think that's because when you have low per-pupil 

revenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures.

 But the important point is the material 

important part of the language, which is 95th percentile 

of such expenditures or revenues in the State, is 

exactly what the Secretary proposed and the Secretary of

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEIGH M. MANASEVIT,

 ON BEHALF OF STATE RESPONDENT

 MR. MANASEVIT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 I'd like to begin with Justice Ginsburg's 

question, because I think that that is very illuminating 

to where we are today. This statute began against a 

history, an 18-year history where the agency had been 

delegated by Congress virtually carte blanche authority 

to devise equalization tests. That was the earlier 

statute. The agency had three tests at the time. One 

was the 25 percent disparity test that we see today and 

there were two other tests.

 In 1994, what happened was the Secretary 

proposed to the Congress and the Congress following the 

Secretary's lead eliminated the two other tests. 

That's, that's what was happening. And Justice Scalia 

asked well, why would the Secretary tie his hands? What 

happened was the Secretary no longer was satisfied or 

liked the other two tests and eliminated those and

proposed the test that he had been using for 18 years to 

the Congress. Congress adopted that test and that's the 

test that we have today, the 25 percent disparity test.

 The difference is that whereas the Secretary 

had the free rein to develop that disparity test, 

however he wanted, previously, the Secretary -- the 

Congress now told the Secretary in disparity, do the 

following things. First of all 25 percent is the 

maximum disparity that we are going to allow you, number 

one. And number two, take out the outliers in a range 

of 5 to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- I'm 

sorry. Go ahead.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I really don't 

care what the Secretary thought he was doing. I mean, 

it seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a 

member of Congress who voted on this thing have thought 

he was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this 

history you're giving us. And more importantly, what 

would a citizen to whom this language is promulgated 

think the language means? I don't care what the 

Secretary had in the back of his mind. Why should that 

make any difference to us?

 MR. MANASEVIT: Fair question, Justice 

Scalia, and that brings us back to the language of the

statute, where of course we begin, and we have to look 

precisely to the language of the statute. The language 

of the statute, what Petitioners mistake is that the 

language of the statute here has a two-part process. We 

don't look at LEAs first. It doesn't say 5th percentile 

of LEAs. We have to first rank expenditures or revenues 

in the State. It's above 95th percentile or below 5th 

percentile of the expenditures.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of such expenditures or 

revenues.

 MR. MANASEVIT: Of such.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you've got to find out 

what "such" refers to.

 MR. MANASEVIT: And "such" would refer just 

to the previous usage of that precise term, which is 

disregard local education agencies with per-pupil 

expenditures or revenues. So it's that "with per-pupil 

revenues" that the "such" would refer back to, the most 

immediate prior reference, so we're still looking at 

per-pupil revenues or expenditures in the State which we 

have to rank first. We don't identify LEAs first. It 

doesn't say 95th percentile of LEAs. It tells us rank 

per-pupil revenue. The only difference --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It says disregard LEAs; it 

then identifies certain LEAs which are to be

disregarded. Nowhere does it say disregard pupils.

 MR. MANASEVIT: No. It says -- it says --

we are disregarding the LEAs. That's the end of the 

process. But we have to identify the range of value 

that 5 percent and 95 percent applies to. The range --

the percentiles apply to a range of values. We have in 

New Mexico, we have 89 amounts of per-pupil revenue per 

district, we have 89 of those. But we also have 377,000 

per-pupil revenues, because a per-pupil revenue repeats 

for every time that there's a student, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. See, 

that's my conceptual difficulty. It is only per pupil 

when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils. 

If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which 

is what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number 

associated with each pupil. You have a number. Nobody 

knows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend 

on each individual. We know how much you give to this 

district, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil 

number, and therefore, I would have thought a reference 

to per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according 

to district.

 MR. MANASEVIT: Mr. Chief Justice, we are 

not saying that it can't. We're -- all we're saying is 

that it equally carries both meanings. School finance

is an extraordinarily technical area, which is precisely 

why Congress left this issue to the agency to work this 

out. When Congress -- when Congress used the terms 5 

percent and 10 percent, and again I'm not, I'm not 

reading Congress's mind to say that when Congress used 

those terms, those percentiles, Congress must have 

intended some national uniformity. This is a national 

program and Congress expects these programs to be 

applied somewhat uniformly across -- across the country.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you the same 

question I asked -- I asked the Government. Why don't 

you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply 

it to, to 2.A? You don't even think of doing that in 

2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but 

it's the same language in 2.A.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: In 2.A, 2.A calls for a 

different type of comparison. And I also note that in 

2.A it refers to percent instead of percentile, which 

refers to two numbers being compared. Percentile refers 

to an entire ranking of value, so the processes are 

somewhat different. Now we're not, I'm not contending 

that this statute is absolutely clear and a model of 

draftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th

percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or 

revenues is a broad enough term.

 JUSTICE BREYER: To include the words 

per-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're 

saying?

 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, to --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do you want to say it, 

per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?

 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, I believe --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or how do you want to say 

it then?

 MR. MANASEVIT: I believe simply that the 

word per-pupil revenue can mean the dollar amount per 

each agency 89 times, or it can mean repeated each time 

a student generates --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is attached to each 

pupil? You say the word such is broad enough to include 

per-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil?

 MR. MANASEVIT: Yes. Correct. Remember --

look to discover if you're right or wrong.

people use the words?

 MR. MANASEVIT: That answer I couldn't 

answer, but I can tell you that typically in an 

education statute, funding is distributed on the basis 

of numbers of pupils. So if the statute says $3,000 per 

pupil shall go somewhere, the -- the statute means you 

take that dollar amount and you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that must not 

be right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any 

disparity to worry about equalization in the first 

place. Right?

 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, we always -- we always 

will have disparity in the real world and that -- and 

that's because lots of things cause disparity. In this 

case actually, local tax revenues are not the cause of 

disparity because there are no significant local tax 

revenues at issue here. But disparity happens -- in the 

top three or four districts in New Mexico you have under 

100 students, or slightly over 100 students. In a 

district that small, minor things, an insurance recovery 

for example, a couple hundred thousand dollar insurance 

recovery in a district of 87 students will generate 

$3,000 of revenue per member for that year. It's a 

distorting figure. That's precisely what Congress is 

trying to get rid of.

But when Congress says 5 percent, presumably 

Congress intends that 5 percent to have some uniform 

applicability across the country and not vary with a 

State like New Mexico where it would just eliminate five 

districts. Or in our -- in our neighboring State of 

Maryland, Montgomery County has the highest per-pupil 

revenues in the State. It has 16 percent of the 

population. Under petitioners' view, that -- and it has 

24 districts, so that district would be eliminated under 

petitioners' view. It would completely be eliminated. 

Yet under our view, the 10 percent would fall within 

that and we would keep it in. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you think 

Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this 

provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and 

your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to 

go to those particular districts from actually reaching 

the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read 

it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant 

it to go?

 MR. MANASEVIT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because that was on the list of things that I 

wanted to cover, and I'm sure that petitioners 'counsel 

inadvertently misspoke. Impact aid never ever gets 

diverted from the district. Impact Aid goes from the

Federal Government pursuant to a formula --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but then 

the question is whether the State can consider it when 

they're figuring out how much money to give it. So in 

effect it's diverted.

 MR. MANASEVIT: Well, remember, the State 

figures a total cost of program for every district 

starting from zero, number of students and dollars 

needed to manage those number of students, and the State 

supplies that amount of money. So where the district 

gets some of that necessary money from another source, 

the State under equalization is allowed to just consider 

that that amount of money, in addition to what the State 

is going to provide, will provide the entire amount.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. MANASEVIT: Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Van Amberg, you

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice had a 

question as to whether or not the, an appendix is 

something different from a regulation or carries a 

different weight, and I haven't found anything 

determinative. But I would refer the Court to Young

versus Community Nutrition Institute where it identifies 

something similar to an appendix as an example, and the 

Court says an example is just that, an example.

 And I don't think we need the argument to 

prevail, but we would submit that it is at best 

confusion, it's confusing that the Secretary would take 

the body of the methodology proposed by Congress, put it 

in his, in the body of his regulation, and then refer 

the public to an appendix in order to, how to work the 

methodology. And in this appendix, he then flips what 

Congress intended and what he had in the body of his own 

regulation.

 I would also suggest that Congress cannot be 

presumed even in this instance to not be, at least have 

some input as to what was happening. In the Senate 

bill, my understanding is that there was a suggestion 

that the disparity figure would only be 10 percent and 

not 25 percent. That didn't make it through but the 

statute as it was written, and I think lasted for about 

a year or so, had the disparity amount going from 25 

percent to 20 percent. That was subsequently amended 

and kept back up at the 25 percent level. So the idea 

that this was not a bill where Congress paid attention, 

I think, is not a warranted assumption.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Van Amberg, could a

State get to the same result? Let's say your reading of 

the statute is the only permissible one. By combining 

school districts, it's no longer going to be the X 

school district and the Y school district, it will be 

the XY school district, and then the population would 

increase. Still only one LEA.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: There is a provision, 

Justice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think 

it's 7113, in which it basically says that if the 

Secretary of the Education perceives that a State is 

manipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take 

advantage of the, of this limited exception, it can 

disregard that action. So I think there is built -- I 

think Congress was one step ahead of us and recognized 

that possibility and addressed it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.

 MR. VAN AMBERG: Thank you. With that, 

thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
