 (10:12 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-479, Safford 

Unifed School District v. Redding.

 Mr. Wright.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. WRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The search of Savana Redding in this case 

was constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to 

suspect that she possessed contraband which posed a 

health and safety risk. Therefore, searching any place 

where she might be reasonably hiding that contraband was 

constitutionally permissible.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any place, even 

though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect 

that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, 

as long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe 

the evidence does show, he was entitled to search any 

place where the contraband might be reasonably hidden.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any place? I mean, 

prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more

intrusive searches. Are you suggesting that would have 

been justified in this case?

 MR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor. I'm -- I'm 

suggesting that where it might be reasonably hidden is 

based on an administrator's experience and certainly is 

proven out by the reported cases that we've cite in the 

reply on pages 8 and 9, which are that students often 

will secrete items in and under their clothing. That is 

not an uncommon thing to happen, although these kind of 

intrusive searches are rare.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I think you're 

really caught in -- in a dilemma here. Your answer 

suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search 

in this case.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But people have been known 

to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities. What is 

the -- what is the principle under which you would allow 

a strip search but disallow a cavity search?

 MR. WRIGHT: The principle is, Your Honor, 

is that the common experience with schoolchildren, as --

as school officials have a relation to schoolchildren, 

is such that they might hide things, and they do hide 

things, in and under their clothing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there --

MR. WRIGHT: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there prior 

experience in this particular school? Were there prior 

occasions on which students had been strip-searched and 

contraband found?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I don't know, and 

that's not in the record, but I can tell that you that 

that would not be the threshold requirement under this 

Court's prior rulings to justify the search.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I thought your 

answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the 

school's experience, children do hide contraband in 

their underwear but not in their body cavities.

 MR. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. To be more 

specific, in the nationwide school experience, based on 

the reported cases that we see, which are contained in 

the reply at pages 8 and 9, we find that they hide them 

in and under clothing, but I don't know of any case of 

which I'm aware where there would be items secreted in 

body cavities.

 And I -- and I feel, Your Honor, that that 

is a bright-line area because that -- that is -- that is 

something that the Court can clearly say is off limits. 

And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you about

another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming. 

You -- you said in the course of describing the 

justification for this search that one -- one of the 

points of justification was that there was a health and 

safety risk. And I assume from the way you put it that 

you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the 

counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that 

correct?

 MR. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why should we accept 

that -- that blanket assumption? I mean, at some point 

it gets silly. Having -- having an aspirin tablet does 

not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an 

over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have 

gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that 

was conducted here.

 MR. WRIGHT: For the very same reasons this 

Court noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that 

is that the school officials have deemed, in their 

judgment, that this is an important rule with regard to 

health and safety. So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, and I agree with you, 

and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a, 

let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in 

determining what is a risk and what isn't. But at some

point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do 

think we have to raise it. And if your rule would 

criminalize -- I shouldn't say "criminalize" -- would 

put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the 

kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached 

the questionable point. And I -- my question to you now 

is, why haven't we?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, if -- if an 

administrator in their judgment, in their reasonable 

judgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a 

potential health and safety risk, because they have the 

custodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids 

-- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're 

trying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying 

to protect -- because they have those kinds of 

obligations to provide for the safety of children, to 

provide an orderly educational environment, it is best 

for this Court to defer to their judgment when they 

believe that certain rules are important and not 

second-guess those rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Had it been --

MR. WRIGHT: So long --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Had it been the case that, 

as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping 

ibuprofen, weren't they?

MR. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess they might pop 

aspirin as well. I'm not aware that one gets a high on 

either one of those. Somebody in -- in the school had 

gotten almost fatally ill about a year before this 

incident; isn't that right?

 MR. WRIGHT: Precisely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: On over-the-counter drugs.

 MR. WRIGHT: On a prescription medication 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A prescription, not over-

the-counter.

 MR. WRIGHT: -- that a student brought to 

school and that a student ingested, another student 

ingested, and then was airlifted out in an ICU in a 

near-fatal experience.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was --

MR. WRIGHT: But just 7 days --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was -- what was the 

drug involved in that case?

 MR. WRIGHT: I don't know, Your Honor, and 

it's not in the record.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it certainly was not 

ibuprofen?

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it was a 

prescription drug.

 MR. WRIGHT: It was a prescription drug. 

And -- and 7 days before this event, Your Honor, just 7 

days before, the student informant Romero had taken a 

prescription drug. Again, I don't know what the type of 

drug was, but he became violently ill, which caused he 

and his mother to come talk to the administrator. So we 

had those two recent events.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but he -- he was not 

the one who identified Redding. It was her classmate.

 MR. WRIGHT: Her friend Marissa Glines, yes, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on that classmate's 

say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did 

you get this pill? Where did she give it to you?

 MR. WRIGHT: Where -- the question, where 

did this pill come from, was asked by the administrator.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, what place. I 

mean, the child is caught with the pills. She blames it 

on her classmate. She says: She gave them to me. Did 

the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave 

them, where in location she gave them?

 MR. WRIGHT: No, but that's clear from the

record, Your Honor. The reason for that is Jordan 

Romero said to Mr. Wilson that morning: I just received 

this pill from Marissa Glines. The plan is that a group 

of these kids are going to take these pills at noon. So 

it's contemporaneous.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's contemporaneous 

with the -- with the student who blamed the other child. 

I'm asking if there's any link other than one child 

caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone 

else? The tip from the young man had nothing to do with 

Redding; it had to do with Glines.

 MR. WRIGHT: But the tip from the young man 

goes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable 

when Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said 

she would have, plus other pills.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe it becomes reliable 

as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.

 MR. WRIGHT: But, Your Honor, then it ties 

in with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the 

planner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he 

subsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to 

him that that was her planner, but she denies any 

knowledge of the contents. So did Marissa Glines. So 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the school know what --

what particular pills it was searching for?

 MR. WRIGHT: Not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did it know that -- what --

what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or 

some prescription drug?

 MR. WRIGHT: Not comprehensively, Your 

Honor. What they knew was there was IBU 400s in an OTC 

pill that was later identified. But he also knew there 

was a variety of pills. What Mr. Wilson did not know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How did he know it was an 

OTC pill?

 MR. WRIGHT: Because he --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just by looking at it?

 MR. WRIGHT: -- called poison control.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. WRIGHT: And -- and once that was 

assessed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What was in it? Did he say 

MR. WRIGHT: It was Naprosyn 200 milligrams.

 And -- and, Your Honor, what -- that's a 

good point because what Mr. Wilson doesn't know is what 

other pills might be out there. He knows there's a 

variety of pills, but he doesn't know of what type. He 

doesn't know what amount.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Have you ever made -- has 

your side of the case ever made the argument that it 

needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug 

over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill 

is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what 

it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule 

or they simply cannot act effectively? I did not see 

that argument in the briefs. Has that argument been 

raised at any point?

 MR. WRIGHT: Precisely, Your Honor. We have 

argued that our administrators are not pharmacologically 

trained?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where did you argue it? I 

mean, I want to know whether that argument is in the 

case.

 MR. WRIGHT: It's in the briefs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it? I don't remember 

it. Do you remember a page? Do you have a page 

reference offhand?

 MR. WRIGHT: I don't have one offhand, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you say it's in your 

brief?

 MR. WRIGHT: I'm fairly -- fairly certain 

it's in the brief.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I'll go back.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the case, this case, 

the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school 

nurse and she identified what they were.

 MR. WRIGHT: Precisely. And she called 

poison control to figure that out, though, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask 

you this question. There may be an issue as to what the 

assistant principal could reasonably infer from the 

facts that were known by him, whether he could 

reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable 

suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the 

plaintiff's undergarments. Is that a question for --

for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it 

can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either 

side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the 

contrary?

 MR. WRIGHT: The problem with that is, Your 

Honor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need 

to shield administrators from lawsuits and legal 

liability.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, not on the question of 

qualified immunity. On the issue of whether there is a 

Fourth Amendment violation.

 MR. WRIGHT: Whether or not that would be a

factual determination, as to whether he could reasonably 

suspect that the pills would be there?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Right.

 MR. WRIGHT: I think -- I think it could 

lend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that 

the Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our 

position that the Court would lay down a bright line 

rule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute, 

and that bright line rule is this. Once you had reason 

to suspect a student is possessing any contraband that 

poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place 

where that contraband may reasonably be found is 

constitutional, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Any contraband, like the 

black marker pencil that -- that astounded me. That was 

contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker 

pencil?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, for sniffing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, is that what they do?

 MR. WRIGHT: It's a permanent marker.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They sniff them?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm 

a school lawyer. That's what kids do, Your Honor, 

unfortunately, Your Honor. But --

MR. WRIGHT: But the point was is that the 

rule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the 

notion that when there's a health and safety risk 

because these people are charged and tasked with the 

responsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to 

have the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and 

effectively when they're dealing with these risks.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there has to be -- I 

mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and 

T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search, 

was there was a teacher said: I caught those girls; 

they were smoking in the bathroom. Here we have nothing 

but this Glines identifying her classmate. And nothing 

is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow 

up on it at all. And the search is quite different from 

the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's 

person.

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor seems to be 

concerned about the reliability of the tip in this case. 

Your Honor, I would submit to you to that student tips 

are the very thing that officials rely on probably the 

most.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But an official could 

follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is 

a basis for what she said. But there were no questions

asked at all.

 MR. WRIGHT: There was additional 

corroborating evidence, Your Honor. There was -- there 

was suspicion by direct implication and there was 

suspicion by circumstantial corroboration. These two 

kids could, in Mr. Wilson's mind -- he believed that 

they were working together to conceal other types of 

contraband.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the school could keep 

records on its students, like the police keep records on 

confidential informants. So if -- unless this student 

had a proven record of having accurately ratted out a 

certain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't 

be believed.

 MR. WRIGHT: Except that, Your Honor, 

there's a different incentive here. Students can be 

disciplined if they -- if they tell tales. And so if 

she tells a lie she faces the risk of discipline. In 

addition to that, there was evidence that these kids 

were friends, and he had reason to rely on that. He had 

reason based on their association at the opening dance. 

He had reason to believe that because --

tipster receive? What discipline was the erroneous 

tipster given?

 MR. WRIGHT: Was the person Marissa Glines, 

the person who gave the tip?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I come back to your 

distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search. 

What would you require before you would allow a cavity 

search?

 MR. WRIGHT: Nothing at all. A bright line 

rule. I would not allow it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No cavity search in school, 

no matter what?

 MR. WRIGHT: We're not even clinically 

trained to do that, Your Honor. I would submit that if 

a child has something stuffed up one of their cavities 

-- and I assume we mean private parts, the very private 

parts -- that the first thing to do would be to send 

them to the hospital. I mean, we just don't have that 

clinical training.

for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical 

one, we don't know how to do that type of thing. So far 

as the legal principle on the basis of which you 

justified this search, you could justify that search, 

too, couldn't you?

 MR. WRIGHT: On the legal basis I could see 

that, Your Honor. I could see that result. But 

practically --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if we hold in 

your favor in this case and the next school district 

says, all right, we're going to have classes in body 

cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if 

we accept your principle, for saying that's out of 

bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that 

correct?

 MR. WRIGHT: I see your concern. That's to 

be left up to the local governments, Your Honor. As you 

have mentioned, this Court has mentioned, in Ingraham 

and Wright --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it would not -- it would 

not be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. WRIGHT: Technically, but it will be 

controlled by the community. It would be controlled by 

the local board. The community would never --

in the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body 

cavity search can be conducted without a warrant? I 

thought a warrant was required under the Ninth Circuit 

rule. I could ask the government.

 MR. WRIGHT: I just know that there has been 

concern expressed over body cavity searches, even in the 

prisoner environment and even in the border environment. 

I can say to this Court you will not restrict or in any 

way inhibit the discretion of an administrator by saying 

you can't go there on a body cavity search, nor would 

they want to, nor are they clinically trained to.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask just a 

follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier 

question about whether the informant was subject to 

civil suit. When you said no, did you mean she hadn't 

been sued or that she could not be sued?

 MR. WRIGHT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. That 

she had not been sued.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one aspect of 

this considering the reasonableness of the school 

administrator's behavior. In addition to not following 

up with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing 

was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice 

principal's office for over 2 hours and her mother

wasn't called. What was the reason for that 

humiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, that is not a 

matter of the record, but the inference is that the --

that the investigation was still ongoing because there 

was a group of kids, and at that time the administrator 

was making efforts to try to make sure that he had 

gathered all the drugs that might be on campus. And in 

any event that wouldn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how were they 

investigating her when they did nothing but put her in a 

chair outside the vice principal's office?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, I can see 

where it might have been more reasonable in that sense 

to have let her go back to class, but it certainly is 

not a standard that would affect the constitutionality .

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume a school can 

assign a student to study hall. That's not considered a 

government seizure. Isn't that an obvious part of the 

parental supervision that a school exercises, sit here 

and stay there.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Schools do that all the 

time, don't they?

MR. WRIGHT: Yes. In fact, there was a 

Ninth Circuit on the docket at the time, the Smith 

versus McLaughlin case, where the plaintiff argued the 

very thing, that she was detained for hours. And the 

court recognized there -- I believe there was a 

concurrence by Judge Kozinski -- that that's entirely 

appropriate, that's where they are.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When was the -- when 

was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime 

period, which was when the other student had said that 

all the kids were going to take these pills?

 MR. WRIGHT: I believe it went through the 

lunchtime period, Your Honor, the detainment.

 In addition, Your Honor, I would like to 

point out also that trying to restrict any more the rule 

that I've laid out, as the United States Government has 

suggested, respectfully, would cause more problems.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But aren't there things 

here that are a little extreme? I mean, if she's to be 

believed, then she was really naked, and the two 

administrators deny that, but you have to take her side 

of the facts. So taking her side of the facts, why 

couldn't the school administrators just do what they 

said they did? That is, you leave her in her underwear, 

tell her: Go shake her underwear. No reason to do any

more than that. Or if she is really embarrassed about 

that, say: Go put on a swimming suit, you know. Shake 

the swimming suit, no problem. People see you at the 

beach all the time. Or call your mother.

 I mean, you know, we can think of another --

a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than 

her version of what went on here.

 MR. WRIGHT: May I offer two principles?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. WRIGHT: First, this Court has 

recognized that the least intrusive means is not a 

threshold prerequisite to a constitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I mean, here 

she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened 

happened. There seems no reason for that, and it seems 

so easy. Put on your gym clothes, okay? I mean, she 

does that every day. It is just such obvious 

alternatives to having her be really naked.

 MR. WRIGHT: Very true.

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 So that's what I -- I don't see any basis 

for saying to the school administrator, you know, you 

can do that. You can just turn her naked. I mean, it 

just embarrasses her. What's the need for it?

 MR. WRIGHT: In the record, Your Honor, she

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but she says in the 

record that they went further and required her to be 

partly naked beyond just her underwear. They say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose you could 

say that about any strip search, couldn't you: That 

there is never a need for a strip search? You could 

always give the -- you know, the suspected felon, you 

know: Here, change into this suit. And -- and we 

haven't adopted some such rule, have we?

 MR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor. You have 

specifically said the fact that other reasonable 

alternatives are available doesn't mean that the 

alternative that was used or the actual search that was 

done was unreasonable.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So that was my 

question. My question was: Why wasn't it? I wasn't 

asking about the law. I was asking: Why didn't they 

choose one of these alternatives?

 MR. WRIGHT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't 

-- I can't answer that question for Mr. Wilson, but I'm 

sure that in the heat of the moment that that issue 

wasn't thought through. And, of course, he wasn't 

involved in the search because he's a male. Only the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING REVERSAL

 MR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Intrusive body searches in the school 

context implicate fundamentally different expectations 

of privacy than other -- other kinds of searches. For 

that reason, they require greater justification under 

the Fourth Amendment.

 In the government's view, the best way to 

give effect to that greater showing is to adhere to the 

basic reasonable suspicion standard of T.L.O., but to 

elaborate on that standard in two ways. First --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get 

started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or 

can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?

 MR. O'NEIL: The government agrees with the 

parties and all amici in this case that this Court

should address the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Should -- should, 

but must?

 MR. O'NEIL: This Court could decide the 

case on qualified immunity grounds alone.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, one of the defendants 

doesn't have qualified immunity.

 MR. O'NEIL: That's exactly right, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So don't we have to, for 

that defendant at least, decide the constitutional 

question?

 MR. O'NEIL: Well, this Court could remand 

on Monell grounds for a hearing on that, which was not 

addressed in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be, Mr. 

O'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim? That would be 

against the school district?

 MR. O'NEIL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would the plaintiff 

have to show to establish a claim under Monell?

 MR. O'NEIL: The plaintiff would have to 

show that this search was conducted pursuant to a -- an 

official policy or that the vice principal was a person 

who was acting with that authority. There are a number

of grounds that -- that the plaintiff could establish 

the Monell claim on the basis of, but in this case the 

Ninth Circuit did not address that. And, therefore, we 

believe that this Court should not review in the first 

instance, but if the Court were inclined to remand on 

that ground to allow the Ninth Circuit to address it 

before this Court reaches that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you criticized the 

Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale 

standard, which is a bad thing in your view. But it 

seems to me that your standard comes close to that. You 

call yours a differential level standard or something 

like that?

 MR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Kennedy. Our 

standard is one of greater specificity in the 

information, not a standard that rises and falls 

depending on the level of intrusiveness.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to, under 

your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion 

specifically that -- that the student is hiding the 

contraband in the student's underwear?

 MR. O'NEIL: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if you have a 

reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you 

search every other place, you search in the student's

pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you

don't you have, after conducting all these other 

searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in 

her underpants?

that you don't --

 MR. O'NEIL: -- without -- without --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your logic fails me.

 MR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you reasonably 

suspect the student has drugs. You've searched 

everywhere else. By God, the drugs must be in her 

underpants.

 MR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice Scalia, you 

posited that the teacher began the search with 

reasonable suspicion. And in that case, if you searched 

the obvious places like a wallet, a pocket, a desk, a 

locker, and you didn't find it in those places, the 

logical conclusion would not be that it must be in the 

student's underwear, but perhaps that the information 

that you had --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds to me 

like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth 

Circuit.

 MR. O'NEIL: No, because we believe that 

where you have reasonable suspicion that there is 

contraband in the underwear, then you could go directly 

to that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the 

outside in. But, Justice Scalia, it takes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, surely not. You 

are saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in 

the underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the 

pack or the pockets. You should go straight to the 

underwear. That can't be right.

 MR. O'NEIL: Well, to take T.L.O. as an 

example, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed 

that there was reasonable suspicion that the student had 

cigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious 

place to find them. Now, if the -- if the school 

principal in that case had searched the purse, searched 

the student's pocket, searched the locker, searched the 

desk, I don't think this Court would have said that 

there was reasonable suspicion to believe that the 

cigarettes were in --

you think is missing here? They need -- the school 

needed to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines 

that -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her 

undergarments; is that correct.

 MR. O'NEIL: The particularized suspicion 

could come from information from students that reliably 

adverted to the location of the contraband. That's the 

JUSTICE ALITO: But you have to have direct 

evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on 

inferences?

 MR. O'NEIL: No --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is that the distinction you 

are drawing? The location has to be supported by direct 

evidence. Somebody has to say that that's where it is.

 MR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Alito. We believe 

that if teachers were aware of the general practice and 

it was common knowledge that students did hide 

contraband in this way and -- that would be relevant to 

the totality of the circumstances in determining whether 

this student was following that practice.

 But we don't believe that the examples that 

were provided in Petitioners' reply brief establish 

anything like that practice. Petitioners cite 8 cases

over the course of approximately 30 years in which 

contraband was found in those locations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are -- you are 

saying basically there is -- there is no general 

understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their 

undergarments.

 MR. O'NEIL: That is -- that is true. There 

was no experience at this school. There was no 

reasonable -- no reason to suspect that based on 

experience in the world. And, in fact, by the time the 

officials had conducted their -- this search, they had 

searched Marissa, who was Respondent's friend. And they 

had conducted a search of her pockets and her wallet and 

they had found pills in her pockets and her wallet. But 

they had not found pills in her underwear.

 So even if that had been a suspicion that 

one might have had even before beginning the search, 

they certainly wouldn't have had that suspicion by the 

time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if your --

accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable 

suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who 

gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are 

going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at 

lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a

difference in the level of concern that the school 

should have?

 MR. O'NEIL: We believe that the schools may 

take seriously any information they receive and must 

take seriously any information they receive about the 

presence of prescription pills on campus. And the fact 

that the teacher believed that these pills were going to 

be consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously 

wasn't simply intended to get rid of the students' 

headaches, we believe that that would give rise to 

reasonable suspicion to initiate some search.

 But we believe that without some 

particularized suspicion or some specific indication 

that this, the location, was a likely one to contain the 

drugs, that this search was excessively intrusive. And 

this is not a new standard. This is essentially the 

same standard this Court adopted in the Montoya De 

Hernandez case for intrusive body searches in other 

contexts. It has proved workable in that context and we 

believe that it would prove workable here.

 We believe that it is also better than the 

alternatives of a higher level of suspicion, which does 

not bear any necessary logical correlation to the 

likelihood that the --

specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on 

her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch 

in the cafeteria, would this be a different case?

 MR. O'NEIL: It may well, Justice Alito. In 

that circumstance it would likely be the reasonable 

thing for the teacher --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference 

between that situation and this situation? The 

differences are slight. Wouldn't that at least be a 

question that has to be decided by the trier of fact?

 MR. O'NEIL: That may present a triable 

issue. Here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That 

wouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just 

given us. I thought you said there had to be specific 

indication that she was carrying it in her 

undergarments. And what Justice Alito posed was not 

that, just specific indication that she had it on her 

person. Is that enough? Do you want to revise your 

test so it's not just specific indication that it's in 

her undergarments, but specific indication that it's on 

her person? That's enough?

 MR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Scalia. We believe 

that there must be information beyond that. And I may 

have misspoke, and I think the answer to that question

is that in that circumstance, a teacher would almost 

certainly ask, well, where on her person is it? And if 

the student doesn't know, then, yes, Justice Scalia, 

that would not satisfy the standard that we would urge 

this Court to adopt.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, the student says, 

she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and 

she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch 

hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they 

don't find it. And you're saying that they cannot then 

go ahead and search her undergarments --

MR. O'NEIL: The nature of the contraband --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- because --

MR. O'NEIL: The nature of the contraband 

could be relevant in the totality of the circumstances 

to the suspicion that the student has -- is hiding it in 

some illicit place as -- Justice Souter, as you noted, 

certainly there is no practice anywhere, that I'm aware 

of, of hiding ibuprofen in underwear.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So there is a sliding scale 

for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?

 MR. O'NEIL: No. It simply means that it's 

relevant to whether in the totality of the circumstances 

that school official could have reasonably suspected 

that the student was hiding it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is a school 

administrator supposed to know? Marissa says: She gave 

me these pills. What are they? I don't know. And so 

how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous 

drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a 

different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on 

that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?

 MR. O'NEIL: My point was simply with a drug 

like crack there is a more common understanding that a 

drug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in 

underwear.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is the 

school administrator supposed to know when he sees a 

white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly 

harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength 

ibuprofen? You say in the former case he can search 

undergarments, in the latter case he can't. So how is 

the administrator supposed to know what he's dealing 

with?

 MR. O'NEIL: Well, we believe that, as I 

said, school administrators have to take seriously all 

medication like this on campus. My point was simply 

that where a particular type of contraband is known to 

be carried in a certain way, that can be relevant to the

question to you is, what is the administrator supposed 

to do? He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what 

it is. Is he allowed at that point to search the 

undergarments or not?

 MR. O'NEIL: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He's not?

 MR. O'NEIL: He is not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if it turns out 

to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?

 MR. O'NEIL: Mr. Chief Justice, we do not 

believe that this Court should get in the business of 

deciding that searches are okay for, for example, 

heroin, but not okay for cocaine.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what you just 

told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's 

question.

 MR. O'NEIL: No, I simply -- the point was 

simply that if there is some common understanding that a 

type of contraband is generally secreted in a certain 

way, and the example is crack, and there is a known 

understanding that crack can be hidden in that way, that 

that would be relevant to the totality of the 

circumstances.

JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't see why your 

answer might not be different if, under the Chief 

Justice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen. 

All he knew was that it was a white pill. He's not a 

pharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it. Wouldn't 

the reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of 

reasonable search at least potentially be greater for 

the undifferentiated white pill than for the known 

ibuprofen?

 MR. O'NEIL: It may, Justice Souter, but I 

think that the question would be whether the school 

official has some reason to believe, based on a 

practice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in 

a student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear. 

Again, the example was crack, and that is a situation 

where there is an understanding that that is -- can be a 

place in which suspects will hide that type of item.

 But, again, there was no indication in this 

case whatsoever and no basis for the school official to 

suspect that that was a likely location.

MR. WOLF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We agree with the Federal Government that 

before conducting an intrusive strip search a school 

needs to have location-specific information. And while 

this case can begin and end with that well-accepted 

proposition, it's also important to recognize that a 

school needs greater -- a greater degree of suspicion to 

conduct a strip search than to conduct an ordinary 

backpack search.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't think the 

case can begin and end with that because we have the 

separate issue of qualified immunity. Can we take that 

off the table?

 I mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth 

Circuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet 

you say the rule is so clearly established that you can 

make these school officials personally liable.

 MR. WOLF: Your Honor, I don't think a head 

count of the judges is the standard by which this Court 

measures qualified immunity. That's what this Court, 

you know, held, for instance, in Groh v. Ramirez. But I 

do understand that it sort of gives one pause.

 It says: Well, what did they miss here? 

And what they missed here is that this search violated

the clearly established point that in order to conduct 

an intrusive search of one's body, the searching 

official needs to at least reasonably believe that the 

object is located underneath the undergarments. The 

Fourth Amendment does not account -- it does not 

countenance the rummaging on or around a 13-year-old 

girl's naked body --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if --

MR. WOLF: -- without any suspicion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if what Marissa 

has is heroin? The school administrator recognizes 

heroin. She says: This is what the student gave me? 

Search the undergarments or not?

 MR. WOLF: The nature of the infraction --

no. The nature of the infraction, as T.L.O. would put 

it, is a nonstarter in this case, because we don't even 

have the suspicion to get underneath Savana's 

undergarments, even if you had -- regardless of the 

substance.

 Now, in T.L.O., the question was whether 

there were drugs to be found. There was marijuana in 

that case. And this Court set a relatively low 

standard, that you need more than a hunch, and you need 

particularized suspicion. Now, that's where the Court 

set the balance for ordinary searches for drugs.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure where 

we are in your answer to the question of the Chief 

Justice's question. He asked you a hypothetical case. 

And you said that's a nonstarter because in this case. 

And the hypothetical is that there is a very 

dangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and 

consumed that afternoon.

 Does that make a difference in the 

permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of 

the search and the scope of the search?

 MR. WOLF: No, it does not. It does not in 

this case, because without a suspicion that you're going 

to find the object --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you don't mind our 

judging this case as if they were searching for meth?

 MR. WOLF: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way -- we 

should -- we should judge this case as though they were 

searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen, 

have I got that? The fact that it was ibuprofen is 

irrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were 

meth?

 MR. WOLF: I think we all understand that 

this -- that this case, you know, involves ibuprofen. 

But our argument --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think I understand 

that based on your answer. I'm -- I'm asking you -- you 

said that the nature of the drug makes no difference, 

It's a nonstarter.

 MR. WOLF: Not in in this case, correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Insofar as the rule that 

we -- that's because in this case you don't think 

there's a reasonable suspicion to begin with. But that 

doesn't answer the hypothetical. We're trying to 

announce a rule. And your rule, your submission, as I 

understand you and as I understood the government, is 

that the nature of the substance they're searching for 

is irrelevant.

 MR. WOLF: I think it's irrelevant when 

you're making distinctions between drugs. If -- if the 

question is whether you can strip search a child for 

gum, for instance, because that might prohibit school 

policy, I would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that goes back to my 

earlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the 

case as if this were a search for meth that was going to 

be consumed at noon?

 MR. WOLF: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.

was no suspicion -- and I think Justice Alito was 

perhaps getting to this -- there was no suspicion that 

these objects were going to be found inside Savana's 

undergarments. And without that suspicion you cannot 

conduct such an intrusive search.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, to play the devil's 

advocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal 

reason as follows: that he has information from -- from 

Ms. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs. He has 

information from another student that drugs are going to 

be consumed during the lunch hour. Putting those two 

together, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person 

who has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so 

that they can be distributed at lunch. And then having 

searched every other part of -- having searched Ms. 

Redding's outer garments, what's left are her 

undergarments. So therefore there's a reasonable 

suspicion that the drugs are -- are located there.

 MR. WOLF: Justice Alito --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's wrong with that?

 MR. WOLF: Justice Alito, I don't think that 

accurately describes the record. Even if it did, it 

wouldn't satisfy this Court's standard. Two things 

about the record: one, I think the hypothetical 

supposed that she had drugs, and in fact what the record

reveals is that it was allegedly Savana provided these 

drugs at some point. It's not that she currently had 

them on her.

 Second, that they searched every other part, 

and it's an important -- it's an important point in this 

case. Where did Marissa have her planner? It was in 

the desk. Did they search the desk here? No. We know 

that. It's not in the record, as Mr. Wright said, but 

they have lockers in the school. Did they search any 

locker? No.

 Can students keep drugs anywhere else on 

school grounds? Perhaps, probably so. Did they search 

everywhere? They absolutely did not. But I want to get 

back to the legal answer, too, which is that this Court 

said in T.L.O., and it's on page 342 of T.L.O., that a 

search is reasonable only when there are reasonable 

grounds for believing that it will turn up evidence. 

There were no reasonable grounds for believing that this 

search would turn up evidence, none at all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the whole 

search, not just the search of the undergarments. 

You're saying they couldn't even have searched her 

backpack, right?

 MR. WOLF: I think they could have searched 

her backpack. And what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

 MR. WOLF: What that speaks to is the low 

degree of the suspicion and the nonspecific suspicion 

that's needed to conduct an ordinary search.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want a sliding 

scale?

 MR. WOLF: It's not a sliding scale, Your 

Honor. This is a two-step framework, and that is it. 

We have ordinary searches, backpacks, pencil cases, book 

bags, that kind of thing; and then you have a search 

where you require a 13-year-old girl to take off her --

take off her pants, take off her shirt, move around her 

bra so she reveals her breasts, and the same thing with 

her underpants to reveal her pelvic area.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I think there's a 

dispute in the record about that. So -- so we have, I 

mean you would have the right to prove your version, 

obviously. But suppose you fail to prove that and that 

the jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact, 

concludes the school board's right on that; all they did 

was ask her to strip to her underwear, period. Nobody 

saw anything else.

 Now, what's your view of that one? I mean, 

let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove --

to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in

the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette 

lighter, and a cigarette. And who gave you the planner? 

Well, Savana gave it to me. And they find some pills. 

Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like 

meth or something. And she says well, where did you get 

those? Savana gave them to me.

 Okay. That seems to be possibly reasonable 

suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills. And 

they're going to distribute them at lunchtime. At that 

point they go look, whatever they did here. But then 

they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the 

female official say: All right, Savana, strip to your 

underclothes and shake your underclothes. That's what 

happens, period.

 Now, is that latter part a violation of the 

Fourth Amendment?

 MR. WOLF: It is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. WOLF: It is because that is an 

intrusive, traumatic search.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But it would be 

okay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym 

clothes? Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker, 

they're about the same size, shape; go do that.

 MR. WOLF: It -- it might be different if

they asked Savana to go into the other room and to 

change where you're not revealing your body to 

any government official.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, they didn't -- she 

didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes. She --

that's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out 

here, because I'm not certain.

 MR. WOLF: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to work out why 

is this a major thing to say strip down to your 

underclothes, which children do when they change for 

gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and 

there are only two women there. Is -- how bad is this, 

underclothes? That's what I'm trying to get at. I'm 

asking because I don't know.

 MR. WOLF: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolf, one thing 

should be clarified. I don't think there's any dispute 

what was done in the case of both of these girls. It 

wasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear. 

They were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake, 

stretch the top of their pants and shake that out. 

There's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is 

there?

 MR. WOLF: There is none at all.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no dispute that 

they asked her to shake her pants and her bra. Nobody 

said that they touched -- the school officials didn't 

touch her, that's a given. But they did ask her to 

shake out her underwear.

 MR. WOLF: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

has to do with accepting --

MR. WOLF: Yes.

I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it

it.

 MR. WOLF: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I want to know why 

that search, if that's what happened, would violate the 

Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think 

she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.

the Fourth Amendment, and the question is why. Because 

even that slightly less invasive search still implicates 

legitimate and serious implications of privacy. The 

National Association of Social Workers, for instance, 

filed an amicus brief in this case, and what they showed 

is that -- or they cited studies showing that when a 

child undergoes a strip search -- and Justice Breyer, 

your -- your hypothetical involves a strip search --

that that produces long-lasting and traumatic 

consequences for a 13-year-old child.

 Now, why does that matter? Because the 

Fourth Amendment requires a balancing. On one side you 

have legitimate expectations of privacy, and on the 

other side you have the governmental need to conduct 

that search. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe the psychologists --

"strip search" has a lot of meanings. And do the 

psychologists focus on the situation with the child 

involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is 

that what they're talking about?

 MR. WOLF: I believe it is, Your -- Justice 

Breyer. And I believe that we cite such a study in --

in our brief, the red brief, where we say that it 

doesn't require a student to take off his or her 

undergarments so long as the shirt and the pants are

taken off, that that produces trauma.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me just, not 

so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple 

of different aspects of the facts.

 Assuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a 

moment ago and assuming the following thought process on 

the part of the principal -- I -- strike that.

 I will vary the facts in one way. Let's 

assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the 

principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not. 

He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other 

kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person. 

The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact 

that one student got sick, violently sick, within the 

past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what 

it was. We also know within a reasonable period of time 

from where we are now that there have been kids who died 

from ingesting dangerous drugs. I've got suspicion that 

some drug is on this kid's person. My thought process 

is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip 

search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to 

have some other kids dead because the stuff is 

distributed at lunchtime and things go awry.

 Is that the basis? Is that thought process, 

that reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip

search?

 MR. WOLF: And to make sure I understand, 

it's that there's reasonable belief -- there's a 

reasonable belief that a student has drugs on his or her 

person?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.

 MR. WOLF: And by his or her person, 

presumably it could be the pockets or it could be in the 

backpack that he or she is holding?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Somewhere between the 

surface of the clothes and -- and the body.

 MR. WOLF: Right. And in that instance it 

still would not be appropriate. There needs to be 

suspicion that the object is located underneath the 

clothing. And if that isn't there, then you can't 

search there. Now that should be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you say that the --

the point of my question, this is what I'd like you to 

focus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that 

argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if 

the stakes are lower. If the risk of a mistake is going 

to be less traumatic. In the hypo that I gave, the risk 

of the mistake may well be violent sickness or death. 

And the thought process in the principal's mind is, the

better embarrassment than violent sickness or death. 

What's wrong with that reasoning under the Fourth 

Amendment?

 MR. WOLF: Well, I mean, to start, that's 

not what T.L.O. said. T.L.O. said that there needs to 

be a reasonable --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm saying it.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We -- We've got a new case.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I'm saying to you, why 

isn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the 

concept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?

 MR. WOLF: Because in order to conduct that 

intrusive search, it seems like it that case you would 

have to be doing guesswork, if you will, about where 

those pills are located.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You've got reasonable 

suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.

 MR. WOLF: That's right. And presumably, if 

they're -- if it doesn't show up in a pocket search, 

then you can do a strip search; and if you don't find it 

in the strip search, you could do a body cavity search; 

and if it's not in the body cavity search --

mind, why isn't it reasonable? In other words, there --

there is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my 

hypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth 

Amendment analysis?

 MR. WOLF: Because -- it all comes back to 

the balancing of the Fourth Amendment. And here, where 

you're conducting a traumatic search without a belief 

that you're going to find it underneath the 

undergarments, it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't have a belief; I 

simply have a reasonable suspicion. That's what I've 

got all along the way. And it seems to me, when -- when 

you take the position that you -- you were taking, you 

are saying, better to have the risk of violent sickness 

or death than the risk of embarrassment. Isn't that 

what you're saying?

 MR. WOLF: No, it's not what I'm saying, 

Your Honor. There are many things that -- that this 

principal could -- or the assistant principal could have 

done here that would have mitigated any risk, and at the 

same time not caused the trauma of -- the trauma 

associated with a strip search. Sit the child down --

reasonable, I take it?

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now the -- we 

get to the point as in prior hypos, in which it does --

they find nothing in the pockets. They find nothing in 

the pocket book or other garments. The only thing 

that's left is a strip search, and that's where you draw 

the line. Why do you draw the line there, on the risk 

analysis?

 MR. WOLF: Well, the hypothetical supposes 

they have searched everywhere. And I suppose if you 

have -- if you are certain that somebody possesses a 

drug and you have searched everywhere, perhaps you have 

generated location-specific information. I would 

readily agree to that.

 But in this case, they certainly did not 

search everywhere.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Mr. 

O'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and 

it's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear, 

that then this would not run afoul of the Fourth 

Amendment? He gave an example of a drug where there was 

a custom of carrying it in a certain way.

 MR. WOLF: Right. I think if it were 

readily known that this student had previously been 

suspected of -- to use the term that's used in the court 

of appeal cases -- "crotching" that drug, well, then,

perhaps that would have been appropriate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be that 

student. It can't be that it's customary among 

students?

 MR. WOLF: And it may be that if this 

becomes so customary, that that somehow differently 

calibrates the equation here, but it -- it's sort of 

strange credulity to think that you would have loose 

pills concealed against a student's genitalia. That's 

what you'd have to think was the custom here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As -- as I understand your 

- your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any 

search that requires the outer garments to be taken off. 

So it didn't really matter whether they required her to 

shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her 

underwear?

 MR. WOLF: It certainly added to the trauma 

-- trauma, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But is a strip search and 

-- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the 

student to even take off the outer garments?

 MR. WOLF: That's -- that's right. That's 

what the studies say, and that seems like a reasonable 

calibration to me. You know, anything --

with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are

even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for 

justifying the preliminary search is that the student 

has heroin?

 MR. WOLF: Without any location-specific 

information, that's correct, and anything else would 

send a shudder down the spines of little boys and girls 

around this country.

about spine shuddering.

Souter's question. We assume that there's meth, 

something very dangerous, going to be smoked at noon, 

there's very strong suspicion of this student. The 

assistant principal says I'm going to give you a choice: 

we're going to engage in an intrusive search, same sex 

people, like what went on here; or we're going to call 

the local police department, we'll have probable cause 

to book you and they will search you at the jail house. 

Which do you choose?

 Would the school administrators be violating 

their duty if they did that?

 MR. WOLF: If -- if they called in the

police officers?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They give the student the 

choice. They say we'll do it here with a nurse right 

here, where you know everybody, and there's nothing 

wrong' or we'll call the police, and they'll do it down 

at the police station.

 MR. WOLF: I don't think that would violate 

the Fourth Amendment, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which -- which would be 

the less traumatic of the two choices for the student?

 MR. WOLF: Well I'm not sure that there's a 

lesser or more traumatic. Both -- both are fairly 

traumatic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't the 

police --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think it's less 

traumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have 

uniformed police officers take the person to the police 

station and conduct the search there?

 MR. WOLF: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to decide the 

case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for 

the student?

 MR. WOLF: I'm saying both are remarkably

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The police would require --

MR. WOLF: I'm not putting them one above 

the other.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The police would require 

probable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?

 MR. WOLF: They would require probable 

cause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the hypothetical wasn't 

there a probable cause?

 MR. WOLF: Well if there's probable cause 

and they want to call the police officers in, then they 

can do that. But that's not what happened here. What 

this school official did was act on nothing more than a 

hunch, if that, that Savana was currently concealing 

Ibuprofen pills underneath her underpants for other's 

oral consumption. I mean there's a certain ick factor 

to this.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've made 

that point several times. In fact the issue here covers 

the brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish 

as the underpants, right?

the prison context, the rules are different. They are 

different, because this Court has --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I'm -- maybe 

I'm not articulating this. You keep focusing on the 

fact that it's unlikely that the pills would be 

concealed in her underpants. That doesn't go to the 

brassiere at all.

 MR. WOLF: Well it -- the brassiere I think 

as well. I mean there -- there was nothing in this 

record that even the principal or assistant principal 

said I suspect that it was there.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not like you have any 

studies on this. But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it 

seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent 

child has some pills or something, they know people are 

looking for them, they will stick them in their 

underwear. I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean, 

somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for 

some adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I 

don't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?

 MR. WOLF: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any studies on 

this? I doubt it.

 MR. WOLF: No, but neither -- neither do 

they.

people did sometimes stick things in my underwear --

(Laughter.)

Whatever. Whatever. I was the one who did it? I don't 

know. I mean, I don't think it's beyond human

 MR. WOLF: But the "not beyond human 

experience" standard is not the standard that governs 

whether the Fourth Amendment is violated.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it's supposed 

to be what's reasonable.

 MR. WOLF: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And a teacher is there 

thinking what's reasonable? And I've already got the 

thing sort of away from -- I see your point. I'm not

supposed to say, look, school -- school officials who 

think that children could hide things in their underwear 

when they know they're not supposed to have them, is 

that school official really unreasonable except in a 

special case? That's what's bothering me.

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, it -- it is unreasonable, 

and at the end of the day, it has to be unreasonable. 

To think that -- for school officials to think that this 

student was hiding -- this honor student was hiding 

pills underneath her undergarments based on nothing in 

the record that supports that, not a single thing. What 

does the school official know? That there was an 

accusation that Savana had provided pills at an unknown 

time and at an unknown location, that Savana's backpack 

search yielded nothing, not only pills, but no suspicion 

that she possessed pills underneath her undergarments.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is that a question of law or 

is that a question that goes to the trier of fact, 

whether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the 

presence of the pills in those locations?

 MR. WOLF: That seems like a factual 

question to me, Justice Alito. I mean, there's nothing 

in the record to -- to indicate otherwise. And we 

haven't moved for summary judgment here, but all 

inferences are resolved in our favor when Petitioners

have moved for summary judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is probable cause a jury 

question too?

 MR. WOLF: Whether something rises to the 

level of probable cause?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, probable cause in the 

ordinary criminal investigation cases. Is that a jury 

question?

 MR. WOLF: It strikes me as a factual 

question, Your Honor, that may or may not -- I -- I 

don't know the answer to that --

JUSTICE ALITO: In a 1983 action, wouldn't 

it be a jury question?

 MR. WOLF: I think in this case it certainly 

is a jury question, without anything else in the record 

that that -- that that is a reasonable inference, and 

without it being self-evident -- and I would actually 

argue that it was self-evident that those pills were not 

located there and that that's not a reasonable 

inference.

 But if there is some doubt about that -- and 

I was hearing some doubt from Justice Breyer and perhaps 

other members of this Court -- well, that strikes me as 

a factual question. And if that's a factual question to 

be resolved by a jury, there must be a principle behind

that, which is that if it is not a reasonable inference 

that those objects were located there, then it would be 

an unreasonable search. And if that's true, then 

qualified immunity, at least at this stage, was properly 

denied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's a 

question. You can -- even -- even in a 1983 action, I 

don't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether 

there was probable cause for an officer's search or 

seizure. That's new to me.

 MR. WOLF: Well, whether something was a 

reasonable inference or not, it might strike one as a 

reasonable inference --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Ninth Circuit --

MR. WOLF: -- and another as not a 

reasonable inference.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Ninth Circuit 

treat this as a jury question? I'm looking at page 38a. 

They were quite definite that that was a Fourth 

Amendment violation.

 MR. WOLF: Right, because for the Ninth 

Circuit, this -- it was self-evident to the Ninth 

Circuit that the -- that there was not a reasonable 

inference. And without that reasonable inference, there 

was no reason to treat it as a jury question, but if

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor.

 The reality is that we've gotten past the 

reasonable at its inception prong, and we're now on the 

scope. And I think everyone concedes that. And, as to 

the scope, I can tell you that if they found uncut 

heroin or small-caliber bullets in this case, they would 

have to reach the same results. And that is 

unacceptable in the school setting. There's too much at 

risk here when you're talking about the custodial and 

tutelary responsibilities this Court has time and again 

recognized as the most important elements in upholding 

the three search cases, student search cases, that this 

Court has upheld.

 The other thing about the government's 

proposal is -- is really troubling. It's because they 

do not justify why they would pass a rule that would so 

much stunt the administrator's discretion to respond,

even in the most serious situations that confront the 

health and safety of kids. These -- these principles 

are principles that have been restated by this Court. 

You need the flexibility to act immediately and 

effectively to keep kids safe.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless the people feel 

differently.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Some school districts have 

rules against --

MR. WRIGHT: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- simply forbidding strip 

searches on any -- right?

 MR. WRIGHT: There is an amicus brief that 

cites 189 school districts which have substantially 

limited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v. 

Wright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at 

the local level.

 But administrators, for now, need a 

bright-line rule. And as to the scope, that bright-line 

rule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is 

processing contraband that poses a health and safety 

risk, then searching any place where that contraband may 

be reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible. 

And in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly

could have believed that the Constitution permitted it, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone 

conclusion in my opinion.

 But I would ask the Court to rule on the 

constitutional question in the affirmative because it 

would further the interests of judicial economy. There 

would not be any more Federal action in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, there would. 

There's a Monell claim against the school district 

because there is no qualified immunity.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's correct, Your Honor, but 

if you ruled in the affirmative on the constitutional 

question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. WRIGHT: -- the case is over.

 The additional issue, Justice Alito, on the 

factual question is I understand you're not talking 

about immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able 

to make decisions, and if we get sued on factual 

questions because somebody questions whether or not it's 

reasonable for us to search where contraband may be 

reasonably located, then we're going to end up in court 

anyway on those factual questions, which is going to --

you know, deter officials from acting immediately and 

effectively in those situations. So, I do not think it
