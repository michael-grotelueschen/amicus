3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-1351, Levin v. United 

States. 

6  Mr. Feldman? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  As the language and structure of the 

12 Gonzalez Act demonstrate, Congress did not completely 

13 eliminate the long-recognized tort remedy that's 

14 available to essentially everybody else in the country 

when doctors perform surgery without a patient's 

16 consent. 

17  By abrogating the intentional tort exception 

18 to the FTCA for the class of cases covered by the 

19 Gonzalez Act, Congress both preserved a remedy for the 

victims of that tort, and, by virtue of the Gonzalez 

21 Act's exclusive remedy provision, they made certain that 

22 the Federal employees themselves would not be sued. 

23  As everyone understood at the time of the 

24 enactment, that was the meaning of the terms of the 

Gonzalez Act. The Act has two clauses, an operative 

3
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 clause and an introductory clause. 

2  The operative clause says, in simple 

3 declarative terms, that the intentional tort exception 

4 to the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any 

cause of action arising out of a wrongful act or 

6 omission in the performance of medical functions. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, but it says, 

8 first, "for purposes of this section." And, as I -- I 

9 understand your argument, those words don't count. In 

other words, you would be making -- you would interpret 

11 the statute the same way if the sentence started with 

12 "the provisions of Section 2680(h)." 

13  MR. FELDMAN: No, Your Honor. That's not 

14 right. We -- we -- that -- that -- the part after the 

introductory clause says, "The provisions of the 

16 intentional tort exception shall not apply to medical 

17 malpractice cases." And that would make it apply across 

18 the government to any government employee who is 

19 performing those medical functions. 

By saying, "for purposes of this section," 

21 Congress limited it in accordance with the case -- the 

22 agency by agency approach that it had adopted in this 

23 area and limited it to just the cases that are covered 

24 by the Gonzalez Act; that is, by malpractice that's 

committed by doctors of the Department of Defense, the 

4

5

25

Official 

1 National Guard, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and so 

2 on. 

3  And so the -- each clause serves quite an 

4 important function. Congress had before the Gonzalez 

Act -- they had already passed the statutes dealing, for 

6 example, with the Public Health Service that's 

7 essentially written in the same terms, with the Veterans 

8 Administration -- although part of that was then added 

9 later -- with the State Department doctors, and so on. 

And so they were proceeding on an agency by 

11 agency basis, and the way to accomplish that was to 

12 first say, we -- we think that the intentional tort 

13 exception should not apply to these cases because in 

14 medical batteries of the sort that we -- as alleged in 

this case, are so close to the kinds of medical 

16 malpractice cases that are going to be brought against 

17 the government anyhow. 

18  But then, in each statute, they say, "for 

19 purposes of this section," because it's only the 

agencies, only the personnel covered by those sections, 

21 and the torts covered by those sections. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Veterans 

23 Administration, it doesn't say that, does it? 

24  MR. FELDMAN: The Veterans --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

Official 

1  MR. FELDMAN: The Veterans Administration, 

2 originally -- the original Veterans Administration 

3 statute, which was from about 1965, doesn't have this 

4 1089(e) intentional tort exception at all in it. 

But then they added it later, about 10 years 

6 after this statute, and then they added a provision that 

7 was slightly worded differently, but it achieves exactly 

8 the same result. Instead of saying, "for purposes of 

9 this section," it says, "by the personnel named in 

Section A," which accomplishes exactly the same thing. 

11  And, actually, if you look at the history of 

12 that statute, the Senate report on that statute, quite 

13 clearly, recites that Congress understood that 1089(e), 

14 the statute here, has exactly the effect that I said. 

And they said, we are modeling it on that provision. 

16 And then they did tinker with the wording, and there's 

17 actually no explanation for the specific change. 

18  But it's not uncommon that, in statutes that 

19 have been reviewed by different committees and passed 10 

or 12 years apart, that Congress would have a -- they 

21 would use slightly different language to achieve, 

22 essentially, the same purpose. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: What would -- what do you 

24 do, if anything, about those of us -- I hope more than 

one -- who actually look at legislative history, and the

Official 

1 House and Senate Report -- the Senate Report says 

2 Subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort 

3 Claims Act, which would otherwise exclude any action for 

4 assault and battery, then the House says about the same 

thing. 

6  So, when I look at those two things, I think 

7 the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the 

8 other side says, it was to get rid of assault and 

9 battery as an exception and said the government of the 

United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery. 

11  That's what the two reports say. That's why 

12 they passed it. 

13  MR. FELDMAN: Right. I believe, actually, 

14 that's our -- that -- that's the way we read it, exactly 

like that, which is the -- by nullifying the intentional 

16 tort exception -- what the intentional tort exception 

17 provides is -- actually, what it says, is, "The 

18 provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not 

19 apply to any case arising out of assault, battery," and 

so on. 

21  And, by eliminating that, the -- the 

22 provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are otherwise 

23 totally applicable to cases of medical battery, like 

24 this, or other kinds of intentional tort. 

And so, for cases, covered by the Gonzalez

Official 

1 Act -- that is, cases of medical malpractice committed 

2 within the scope of employment by the doctors of the 

3 certain specified agencies that Congress has named --

4 for those cases, there is no intentional tort exception, 

and, therefore, you can bring an action against the 

6 government. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't quite 

8 understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the "for 

9 purposes of this section." 

What the section does is provide that the 

11 remedy against the United States is exclusive. But what 

12 the 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 26 -- the 2680(h) 

13 provision doesn't apply. So I don't see how that -- I 

14 mean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to 

the waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts. 

16  MR. FELDMAN: Well, I don't think that 

17 that's right. I mean, I think, for purposes of this 

18 section, you have to read it in context. And the fact 

19 is that 2680 -- the term "2680(h) of Title 28" doesn't 

appear elsewhere in the Gonzales Act. 

21  The only work that that provision does in 

22 the law, section -- the intentional tort exception, 

23 2680(h) of Title 28, the only work that that does is to 

24 make the -- is in the Federal Tort Claims Act, is to 

make the -- the Act inapplicable to those kinds of 

8

1 cases. 


2  So when they say, in simple terms, that 


3 shall not apply, all that could mean -- all that could 


4 possibly mean is you eliminate that, and then you have 


the Tort Claims Act how it is. And then what the four 


6 purposes of this section does is say, but we're not 


7 doing that across the board for every Federal employee 


8 everywhere or even every malpractice case. We are just 


9 doing it for the claims that are covered -- for the 


cases that are covered in this section -- for purposes 

11 of this section. 

12  In this section, if you look at (a), then, 

13 (a), which is the -- you know, basic exclusive remedy 

14 provision that Your Honor mentioned, what (a) does is 

deal specifically with -- intent with medical 

16 malpractice committed by doctors and personnel. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, one of the 

18 strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the 

19 incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling 

by this Court. It's more a policy argument than a 

21 language argument, but how do you address the fact that 

22 we will be interpreting, essentially, two statutes that 

23 are almost identical, but with different conclusions now, if 

24 we were to adopt your view. 

MR. FELDMAN: Right. I -- I think there 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

20

25

Official 

1 are -- there are a few reasons why the statutes have to 

2 be construed differently. I mean, one is that, if you 

3 look at the Court's decision in Smith, where it 

4 construed that provision of the Westfall Act, it -- the 

Court never suggested that the language -- the part of 

6 the Westfall Act whose language is the same as this 

7 supported its conclusion there. It was relying on other 

8 provisions in the Westfall Act. 

9  In particular, there was a provision that 

said, "Once the government substitutes itself for the 

11 defendant, the case shall proceed, subject to all the 

12 exceptions and limitations in the Tort Claims Act." And 

13 the Court said, well, yes, that -- that gives us a clear 

14 understanding that, whether there's exceptions or not, 

we want that case to proceed -- to proceed. That 

16 provision isn't here in the Gonzalez Act. 

17  And there was another provision in the 

18 Westfall Act -- in the Smith case, in the Westfall Act, 

19 that dealt with making a specific exception for Bivens 

cases. And, again, that provision isn't here. And 

21 that --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why would 

23 Congress want to treat them differently? 

24  MR. FELDMAN: Right. I think the reason is, 

when they were dealing in this case with this area in 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 1976, they were dealing with a specific problem of 


2 medical malpractice, and they were looking at that --


3 that problem, doctors, doctors had to get insurance, 


4 what are we going to do about that for Federal 


employees? 

6  And they were -- when they focused on that 

7 problem -- actually, as the Executive Branch itself said 

8 in a letter that was sent to the Senate committee, it 

9 said there's an urgent need, both, to assure adequate 

remedies for tort victims and to protect Federal 

11 employees. 

12  And that's what they were trying to do here, 

13 and I think you see it throughout the Gonzalez Act. 

14 But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why did they 

16 feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort 

17 victims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act? 

18  MR. FELDMAN: Well --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- you know, injured 

tort victims are injured tort victims. It does seem --

21 you know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance, 

22 Congress would be concerned and, the other, not 

23 concerned. 

24  MR. FELDMAN: Right. I think the difference 

is that, here, they were dealing specifically with the 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 problem of medical malpractice. 12 years later, when 

2 they got around to the Westfall Act, they weren't 

3 looking at medical malpractice. 

4  They were looking, generally, at a whole --

the whole problem of government employees being sued 


6 after this Court's decision in the Westfall case, a 


7 problem that particularly affected, actually, lower 


8 level government employees who were -- it's clear, 


9 couldn't take advantage of the discretionary function 


exception. 

11  And, when they are looking at the broad 

12 universe of employees, they took a different approach 

13 and decided, well, we're just going to -- some people 

14 are just going to be out of luck because this is the --

the determination that Congress made -- felt was 

16 appropriate there. 

17  But, when it was looking at the specific 

18 problem of medical malpractice in the Gonzalez Act, it 

19 definitely took the position, as everybody said at the 

time and as the structure of the Act itself showed, that 

21 they wanted to preserve remedies. And there are two 

22 provisions in the Westfall Act that make that clear --

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe we could address 

24 this in slightly more concrete terms. You have two --

two situations. In one case, a Federal employee who's 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 driving a car deliberately runs somebody down. And, in 

2 the second case, a government doctor grabs somebody who 

3 doesn't want an operation and performs the operation 

4 anyway. 

Now, as -- under your reading, there 

6 would -- there would be a claim against the government 

7 in the second situation, but not in the first situation; 

8 is that right? 

9  MR. FELDMAN: That -- that's correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why would Congress want 

11 that? 

12  MR. FELDMAN: The reason they'd want it is 

13 this: In the first situation, that -- that really 

14 arose -- that -- that problem came with the Tort Claims 

Act when it was first enacted in 1946. And, when 

16 Congress was looking at the universe of Federal 

17 employees, they felt -- and, especially, given the law 

18 at that time and that continued really up to the 

19 present, that, when a Federal employee or average 

Federal employee, for the types of intentional torts 

21 that they commit, especially a battery, it's 

22 extraordinarily unlikely that that's going to be within 

23 that scope of that employee's employment. 

24  And Congress felt, well, we want to just 

eliminate that altogether. It's not just to hold the

Official 

1 government responsible for that kind of a claim, when 

2 some Federal clerk slugs someone or something like that, 

3 and that was the determination they made. 

4  When they got around to 1976, to dealing 

with the particular problem of medical malpractice, 

6 the -- it doesn't actually usually happen -- these kinds 

7 of claims don't arise -- I'm not aware of anywhere a 

8 doctor just grabs somebody and throws him, physically, 

9 into the operating room. They happen when the doctor is 

performing some procedure and performs a different 

11 procedure or a procedure that was not authorized by the 

12 patient. 

13  And that -- that is very closely related to 

14 core medical malpractice claims of exactly the sort that 

they were dealing with here. It's very closely related 

16 to informed consent claims, which I believe the 

17 government -- I read the government to be conceding, 

18 could be brought against the government. 

19  And they thought there was no reason to 

distinguish -- to distinguish one type of medical 

21 malpractice from another. We want all of these claims, 

22 we want to provide a remedy, and they all should be 

23 brought against the government. 

24  I would add one other --

1 and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it 

2 fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize 

3 the battery-negligence distinction as being productive 

4 of litigation and not really making a lot of sense? 

MR. FELDMAN: I think that is fair to say, 

6 and -- you know, States -- a lot of States have dealt 

7 with this by dealing with -- in statutory -- in 

8 statutes, not in common law development, so they 

9 could kind of rationalize the system and say, look, this 

is the kinds of claims you're going to have. 

11  But the key thing is that everybody in the 

12 country, I think, under every State's law, if a doctor 

13 performs an operation that you didn't consent to, you 

14 have an action in tort. And that protects both you and 

provides an incentive -- an important incentive, to 

16 doctors and medical personnel, to be sure that they are 

17 only doing what they are authorized to do. 

18  There is not a hint that, when Congress was 

19 dealing with the Westfall Act -- I keep saying, "the 

Westfall Act" -- when Congress was dealing with the 

21 Gonzalez Act, there is not a hint that they were trying 

22 there to say, well, we want to save money or something 

23 by eliminating those kind of very, very traditional tort 

24 claims from those victims, and we don't want those 

people to have compensation.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, do I 


2 understand the mechanics of this right, that, if the 


3 injured person sued the United States directly, that 


4 suit would fail because the battery exclusion would 


apply, but it's only by suing the officer -- the doctor 

6 and then getting the United States substituted that the 

7 battery exception is abrogated; is that right? 

8  MR. FELDMAN: No, I don't -- I don't believe 

9 that that's correct. There is nothing in this Act that 

says it should make any difference. There is nothing, 

11 certainly, in Subsection (e) or anywhere else in the Act 

12 that says it should make any difference, whether you are 

13 suing the government or suing the -- or suing the -- or 

14 suing the doctor. If you sue the government, the 

government says, well, we have a defense that the 

16 intentional tort exception applies. 

17  You would say, no, it says here, for 

18 purposes of this section, the intentional tort exception 

19 does not apply. And what that means, "for the purposes 

of this section," is for claims that are covered by this 

21 Act, which is claims that are medical tort claims 

22 brought against personnel of the affected agencies who 

23 are acting within the scope of their authority. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are there any -- I'm 

sorry.

1  Are there any other tort claims besides the 

2 lack of consent battery claim at issue here that could 

3 be encompassed by the Intentional Tort Act, as it 

4 relates to medical malpractice? 

Let's assume that it's not an operation, but 

6 sexual behavior with a patient in their hospital room, 

7 something of that nature. 

8  Is that covered under the Gonzalez Act, as a 

9 claim against the United States? 

MR. FELDMAN: If it would be an assault or 

11 battery that was committed by -- within the scope of the 

12 professional's employment, then it would be. But it's 

13 always the question of whether it's within the scope of 

14 employment. 

And I think, usually, the -- the case law --

16 I mean, I think, usually, the cases are that a doctor 

17 who commits a sexual assault on a patient or something 

18 is not acting within -- in the kind of circumstances you 

19 are talking about, is not acting within the scope of 

employment. 

21  But that would be a case-by-case 

22 determination. There might be some kind of case 

23 where -- you know, it would depend on the facts of the 

24 case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This exception you're --

this determination is regularly made? 

6  MR. FELDMAN: The -- the scope of employment 

7 determination is made every day because that is made --

8 that is applicable throughout, in any kind of respondeat 

9 superior situation, whenever the employer of the medical 

professional is sued and that kind of thing -- or -- or 

11 nonmedical professional, for that matter. That --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, when the 

13 government removes the case, it concedes that point, 

14 doesn't it, normally? Where a case is removed from 

State court, the government -- the Attorney General must 

16 certify that it was within the scope of employment, no? 

17  MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. That's 

18 correct. And that is actually one of the two -- one of 

19 two of the key provisions of the Act, that kind of 

establish -- that could make it very clear that what 

21 Congress was trying to do was preserve remedies because, 

22 in that very provision, after it talks about removing 

23 when the Attorney General has certified that it's within 

24 the scope of employment, it says, "The case can be 

remanded if the removed case is one such that" there --

4 brought against doctors. And they actually wanted to 

provide for that, right there, and say it should be --

6 those should be remanded to State court, and then they 

7 will proceed against the doctor in State court. 

8  Then there is -- so that there would be --

8 there would be -- really, if their sole purpose here was 

9 to say, we don't want any actions to be brought against 

Federal employees, they should -- they could have just 

11 said, we don't want any actions to be brought against 

12 Federal employees. But, instead, they are providing for 

13 what happens and for the continuation of the action 

14 against the doctor. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Now, the government has an 

16 alternative interpretation, and I know you think it's 

17 wrong. But would you go further and say that it's not a 

18 plausible interpretation? 

19  MR. FELDMAN: I would. I think that 

because, as the court -- when the courts used -- you 

21 know, a number of different formulations to -- to talk 

22 about that -- I think you are referring to a kind of 

23 strict construction rule that -- that applies to waivers 

24 of sovereign immunity, which we don't think is 

applicable here.

1  But, even where that rule does apply, 

2 really, the question is, is it a reasonable degree of 

3 clarity that Congress intended to waive immunity? Is it 

4 -- as the Court has said, is it clearly discernible from 

a fair reading of the statute that they intended to 

6 waive? 

7  And it has to be clear, and I think it is 

8 clear here. And that was what everybody at the time of 

9 the statute thought. It's what the government itself 

thought up through the time of the -- of the Smith case, 

11 15 --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: But was the 

13 interpretation adopted by the district court and by the 

14 Ninth Circuit, but you still say is implausible. 

MR. FELDMAN: I think so. I would add 

16 that -- I am not here to defend the Ninth Circuit's 

17 judgment, but I would add that they had a pro se 

18 litigant before them, and I don't think they had access 

19 to the full degree of presentation that they might have 

had, if -- if it had been more fully developed. 

21  But I do think that, when the Court is 

22 making that determination of what's clearly discernible 

23 from a fair reading of the statute, the Court has also 

24 made it clear, though, that what you don't do is take 

each word in the statute and say, we're going to take

1 the most pro-government meaning of this word, and then 

2 you add them altogether. 

3  What you do is you look at the statute as a 

4 whole, you look at the context of the statute, you look 

at the structure of the statute, and then you say what 

6 is plausible, what is clearly discernible from a fair 

7 reading. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, when the 

9 Westfall Act, which doesn't abrogate the intentional 

tort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there 

11 any reason why Congress kept these five or six separate 

12 acts, like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, well, we 

13 did this piecemeal for particular agencies, and, now, we 

14 we’re dealing with Federal employees across the board, so 

there is no reason why we should have these five or six 

16 that go another way? 

17  MR. FELDMAN: Well, I can give you the 

18 answer that the government gave in its brief in Smith, 

19 which is the Gonzalez Act and the other four or five 

statutes continue to serve two -- at least two vital 

21 functions, and one is specifically this: That they 

22 eliminate the -- the intentional tort exception and, 

23 therefore, allow relief for victims of intentional tort 

24 in this medical malpractice context, just like victims 

of other kinds of malpractice. 

22

1  The other thing is there are some cases, for 

2 instance, foreign torts, where there is another 

3 provision of the Gonzalez Act, 1089(f), that provides 

4 for indemnifying or holding harmless doctors, when 

judgments are against them in certain -- when there's a 

6 foreign tort, when the doctor has been detailed to a 

7 non-Federal agency, or if the circumstances are such as 

8 are likely to preclude a remedy under the Tort Claims 

9 Act. 

So, again, Congress in that -- that 

11 provision remains important because there could be a 

12 foreign judgment against the doctor or something, even 

13 after the Westfall Act, and that would -- that gives the 

14 authority to reimburse the doctor, if the agency 

determines that -- that that's appropriate. 

16  But that provision also shows that Congress 

17 intended that to preserve remedies here because it would 

18 have made no sense for Congress to say, we want to 

19 provide for the indemnification or reimbursement of the 

doctor, if what they really were trying to do was 

21 eliminate all the cases against doctors. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feldman, is --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it --

1 thing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am 

2 strengthening you -- your last point -- that provision 

3 ends, "if the circumstances are such as are likely to 

4 preclude the remedies of third persons against the 

United States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28." 

6  That clearly envisions that, in the ordinary 

7 case, those remedies against the United States would not 

8 be precluded. 

9  MR. FELDMAN: That's right. And the -- and 

the choice that Congress had -- had here, really, was 

11 between taking intentional tort cases and allowing them 

12 to be continued to be brought against doctors and then 

13 subject to this kind of reimbursement provision, which 

14 they had provided for, or saying, no, we want these to 

just be brought against the government and to protect 

16 the Federal employees much more fully. And so that was 

17 the purpose of 1089(e). 

18  They said, we want to steer this into the 

19 same channel that all the other malpractice actions are 

going into. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feldman, as I understand 

22 your argument and -- and the differences that you have 

23 with the government, you have one set of differences 

24 about the meaning of 1089(e), but then another set about 

this question of, if it were true that the government 

24

25

Official 

1 was immune from suit, could you bring a tort suit 

2 against the doctors? 

3  And the government said -- says no. And you 

4 say, yes, you might be able to do that. But do you have 

to answer that question, at all, in order to say that 

6 you're correct on 1089(e)? 

7  MR. FELDMAN: No. I mean, that's -- that 

8 question isn't at issue in this case. That would really 

9 only be directly at issue if somebody brought a suit 

against the doctor. But --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: So there is a lot of going 

12 back and forth about this question of what would happen 

13 if the government were immune, would the individual 

14 doctor be immune? But that is, essentially, irrelevant 

to the question before us; is that correct? 

16  MR. FELDMAN: I -- I just wouldn't say it's 

17 irrelevant because what the -- the provisions that I 

18 have been talking about show is that Congress --

19 Congress was not trying, in this Act, unlike in the 

Westfall Act, which doesn't have either of these two 

21 provisions, the reimbursement and remand provision that 

22 I've talked about -- unlike in the Westfall Act, 

23 Congress wasn't trying to save money or other -- do 

24 something else by just eliminating remedies for victims. 

It was trying to -- as the Executive Branch

1 said, as I said, to assure remedies for all tort victims 

2 and to protect doctors in a variety of different ways. 

3 And given that that's what they were trying to do in the 

4 Gonzalez Act, which is clear from the structure, that 

also helps clarify what 1080 -- or makes more clear what 

6 1089(e) means. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Saying it a different way, I 

8 don't have to accept your broader argument; I can remain 

9 ambivalent about your broader argument and still accept 

your narrower argument. 

11  MR. FELDMAN: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that correct? 

13  MR. FELDMAN: Yes. That is correct. 

14  I would add that, with respect to the strict 

construction standard, I don't think it does apply in --

16 in this context. The Court has never applied it in the 

17 Federal Tort Claims Act context. In the Gonzalez Act, 

18 1089(e), specifically, refers to the Federal Tort Claims 

19 Act. It says, "Section 2680(h) of Title 28." 

Each of the other provisions of the Gonzalez 

21 Act, for their operation, also depend on the Federal 

22 Tort Claims Act. The exclusive remedy provision talks 

23 about the Tort Claims Act. The reimbursement provision, 

24 the remand version, each of them -- the whole statute is 

really part of the Federal Tort Claims Act machinery.

4 rule that it applied in the Dolan case, which is 

construing the words in accordance with their reason and 

6 normal tools of statutory construction, without a strict 

7 construction rule. 

8  Although, as I said, I do think that it is 

9 clear what the meaning of -- of the provision is, if 

they do -- you do apply the rule.

21 which refers to the Gonzales Act, "the FTCA's

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 

2 "unequivocally" -- we have a lot of cases that say you 

3 don't get -- you certainly get the benefit of the 

4 "unequivocally" standard, when you are talking about a 

waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, but 

6 you don't keep getting the benefit over and over again 

7 when you are talking about, as in this case, an 

8 exception to an exception to an exception. 

9  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think the --

the canon actually applies most strongly in this set of 

11 circumstances. And let me talk about Dolan and the line 

12 of cases which recognizes a very narrow exception to the 

13 normal presumption against waivers of sovereign 

14 immunity. 

Dolan and the -- and its predecessor cases 

16 recognize that the narrow exception to the canon, when 

17 construing the scope of exceptions that were enacted 

18 alongside the broad waiver of sovereign immunity in the 

19 FTCA itself. And the purpose of drawing that exception 

to the canon was it didn't want -- the Court didn't want 

21 to defeat Congress's purpose as manifest in the broad 

22 waiver itself. 

23  Those exceptions were cutting back on the 

24 contemporaneous waiver of sovereign immunity. The Court 

said, we don't want to cut back, given the uniquely 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 broad waiver that the FTCA enacts. It's a narrow rule 

2 exception limited to those circumstances that hasn't 

3 been applied outside those circumstances. 

4  Unlike those cases, this case is not 

construing the scope of an exception that was enacted 

6 alongside the FTCA that was trying to cut back on the 

7 waiver of sovereign immunity. 

8  To put it more concretely, on the day before 

9 the Gonzalez Act was enacted, there was no question that 

sovereign immunity barred the type of claim at issue; 

11 that is, no one had any dispute that the FTCA's baseline 

12 of sovereign immunity applied and would have blocked 

13 this claim. 

14  The question is whether --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was 

16 because, at that point, there was an exception to the 

17 exception of sovereign immunity. 

18  MR. SHAH: Correct. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're going 

even a step further, to say you get the benefit of the 

21 unequivocal test that you've set forth at even the next 

22 stage. 

23  MR. SHAH: Here's --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you've already --

you've already used up your benefit of an unequivocal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 requirement when you've got the interpretation of the 

2 FTCA itself, which is the waiver of sovereign immunity. 

3  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we haven't used 

4 it up because of the scope of interpreting Section 

2680(h). You wouldn't apply the waiver because of the 

6 exception that was enacted in Dolan. That's Dolan 

7 itself. If we were just talking about construing the 

8 scope of Section 2680(h) itself, I would agree 

9 completely with you. 

What we have here is, some years later, we 

11 have a baseline of sovereign immunity. Everyone agrees 

12 that the FTCA and its exceptions have struck the 

13 appropriate balance. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait a minute. You 

agree with me that you don't get the benefit of your 

16 higher standard of interpretation with respect to 

17 2680(h)? 

18  MR. SHAH: With respect to the terms of 

19 2680(h) as enacted at that time. The difference --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the -- then 

21 the heightened standard of use sort of resurrects again, 

22 when you get to considering an exception to 2680(h). 

23  MR. SHAH: The reason, Your Honor, is that 

24 you have a baseline of sovereign immunity. What 26 --

1 1089(e) has to waive sovereign immunity.

apply most strongly, when -- when the other side is 

6 saying that Congress --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you need more 

8 clear than "(h) doesn't apply"? 

9  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor --

12 nullified. 

13  MR. SHAH: Sure. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What more does it have 

to say; the exception doesn't apply, and then what's 

16 left? 

17  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, if all it said is 

18 that the intentional tort exception does not apply, I 

19 would agree with you, that that would be enough. And 

that's exactly what Congress said in the 1988 --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: But it didn't -- it didn't 

22 want to say it shall not apply for everything. It 

23 didn't want to eliminate the intentional tort exception 

24 for everybody, right? It only wanted to eliminate it 

for the people covered by -- by the Gonzalez Act.

1  MR. SHAH: That -- that may well be true,

3 the most direct way. It said, "The intentional tort 

4 exception shall not apply with respect to personnel 

employed by the VA." But it --


6  JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have said that, 


7 but, if it wanted to be more parsimonious in its 


8 language, it could simply say for purposes of this 


9 section. 


MR. SHAH: Well --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Which section applies only 

12 to these particular individuals. 

13  MR. SHAH: Justice Scalia, I think it might 

14 be helpful to take a step back. We have four statutes 

starting in 1965, then 1976. The Gonzalez Act was part 

16 of that chain. All four statutes in this relevant 

17 subsection, the analogue, the Subsection (e) here, said, 

18 "For purposes of this section, the intentional tort 

19 exception shall not apply." 

Then we get to 1988, the last one in the 

21 line, which is the VA amendment. It changes that 

22 language. It eliminates that opening proviso for 

23 purposes of this section. The legislative history 

24 accompanying it says, look, we want to allow intentional 

tort remedies for veterans.

1  It does so -- the only reason I can conceive

3 think that the prior four model statutes did it clearly 

4 enough. And I think that is the reason. And -- and if 

we were in a normal statutory --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: It was a -- it was a 

7 different Congress. They don't always use the same 

8 language. Come on. 

9  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, they used the 

identical language --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're lucky they 

12 even remember the earlier statutes.

14  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, they use the 

identical language in every other provision of that

17 the language of Subsection (e). Now, if this were an 

18 ordinary --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, what do you do with 

Justice Breyer's point -- or with your adversary's 

21 point? I know you'll tell us don't look at the 

22 Congressional Record because it suits you right now, 

23 because when it doesn't, you point to it extensively. 

24  But what do you do with the Veterans Act 

record that says, we are modeling ourselves after the

1 Gonzalez Act, including its nullification of the 

2 intentional tort? 

3  MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, it said 

4 the first part. It did not say the second part. There 

is nothing in that legislative history that says it 

6 is -- it thought 1089(e) nullified the intentional tort 

7 exception. It says it's patterned after the Gonzalez 

8 Act, and then it changed the main language, the opening 

9 proviso of that provision. 

Now, if this were an ordinary case of 

11 statutory interpretation, this Court would have to 

12 figure out whether, by changing that language, did 

13 Congress just want to tinker with the language to 

14 clarify its intent? Did it intend to have a dispositive 

change by making that change in language? 

16  But this is not an ordinary case of 

17 statutory interpretation.

history, but -- but, if I did --

21  (Laughter.)

6 know, I -- I don't care. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it is patterned 

9 in the sense it does use the operative language. It 

takes out the key opening proviso, which is the entire 

11 dispute in this case. 

12  But legislative history, while it might be 

13 important if this were a normal statutory interpretation 

14 case, this Court has said, time and time again, you 

cannot look to the legislative history to supply an 

16 unequivocal waiver that is not present in the text 

17 itself. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's go back to the 

19 text then, Mr. Shah. As I understand your argument, it 

goes something like this: This provision is there to --

21 to prevent people from drawing a mistaken inference. 

22 And the inference would be that the doctors were liable 

23 because the government was not. Now, there are a 

24 thousand ways to do that pretty clearly. 

You could just say, irrespective of whether

1 the government is liable, the doctors are not -- or some 

2 such thing. 

3  MR. SHAH: Sure. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, instead, what Congress 

did was it enacted a kind of "let's pretend" provision, 

6 right? Let's pretend that the government is liable, so 

7 then the inference won't arise. Now, that has to be not 

8 just not the best way of achieving Congress's objective; 

9 it has to be the worst, right, because, then, you're 

raising the inference that in fact the government is 

11 liable. 

12  Why would Congress have wanted to do that? 

13  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I agree with 

14 you, Congress could have written this provision in a 

different way and more clear ways, but I think it's 

16 helpful --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm saying something more 

18 than that. 

19  MR. SHAH: Sure. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: It could not have written it 

21 in a worse way. 

22  (Laughter.) 

23  MR. SHAH: Well, I would disagree with that. 

24 But let me -- let me take a step back here, on sort of 

the landscape in which Subsection (e) was enacted. 

36

1  Both sides agree that, without Subsection 

2 (e), covered medical personnel would have faced the risk 

3 of personal liability for medical battery claims. Both 

4 sides also agree that Subsection (e) was enacted to 

obviate that risk and, in fact, successfully does so 


6 under either side's construction. Everyone agrees on 


7 that. 


8  The dispute here is whether Congress 


9 accomplished that objective by, A, assuming the 


existence of an available tort remedy for purposes of 

11 the Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity, as the text of 

12 the provision suggests; or, instead, whether it takes 

13 the substantial further step of actually amending the 

14 FTCA, which is a separate -- an entirely separate 

statute and, thereby, provide a remedy against the 

16 United States. 

17  The latter construction, I don't think is 

18 unmistakably correct, it's not unavoidable. And -- and, 

19 because of that, the unequivocal waiver requirement 

favors the government --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: You're -- you're -- I'm 

22 picking up from -- I find Justice Scalia's hypothetical

4  JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the thing where we 


are in this -- it' -- we have a -- we have a statute, 

6 1089, basically, and it says you can sue the government 

7 for the tort of an employee -- I'm oversimplifying, I'm 

8 oversimplifying so. And we should interpret that narrowly, 

9 okay? We should interpret that -- absolutely has to be 

definite, and it is pretty definite. 

11  Now, what we have is an exception to that. 

12 And the exception is an exception for battery, but not 

13 battery. Can't sue the United States for battery. And 

14 we're supposed to interpret that, I guess, as broadly as 

possible. If you have a plausible argument that it 

16 could be broader, you get it, as long as it's plausible. 

17  Then what we have -- because, after all, 

18 after these two things, you can still sue the person who 

19 hit you over the head, you can go sue him in a State 

court, can't you? Now, oh, now, we bring a new Act 

21 there. And this new Act says, we are going to have a 

22 little exception to the exception. Right? And we are 

23 supposed to interpret that one, I guess, as narrowly as 

24 possible. 

You see -- so, now, what we are -- because

9 words in these things. And -- and so given all these 

words and -- this is where the Chief Justice started --

16 has made quite clear you cannot look at the 

17 legislative history. And the fact that, if you find 

18 this confusing --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

1 and you don't look to the legislative history for 

2 clarity. That's the point of what --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't find it all 

4 that confusing. What it says is that this battery 

exception, which is in (h), is not supposed to apply 

6 when we look at the military doctors. That's what it 

7 says. 

8  MR. SHAH: Your Honor --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: And if -- and you say, ah, 

but it says, "for purposes of this section." Okay. I 

11 look at "for purposes of this section," and the purposes 

12 of this section -- the very first whole sentence has to 

13 do with 1089. It has to do with the scope. It has to 

14 do with the general waiver. 

MR. SHAH: Well, the "for purposes of this 

16 section" language, I think, is the key phrase, and this 

17 section refers to the Gonzalez Act. What the Gonzalez 

18 Act primarily does -- what Sections (a) through (c) are 

19 all about, are about conferring personal immunity. So I 

think --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think those are the 

22 key words. I think the key words are "shall not apply." 

23 "Shall not apply." 

24  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't shall be deemed

2  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think, when we are 

3 reading it --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not a hypothetical. 

It says, "They shall not apply to any cause of action," 

6 etc. 

7  MR. SHAH: I think, when we are reading it 

8 against the canon -- the sovereign immunity canon, I 

9 think we would expect Congress to speak more clearly. 

And Congress gave us two examples of how it spoke more 

11 clearly in this very context. 

12  One is, in 1974, the sole -- the only time 

13 it amended Section 2680(h), it amended it within the --

14 the provision itself; that is, it amended the language 

of 2680(h) to add a law enforcement proviso that said, 

16 "This exception applies except with respect to law 

17 enforcement in certain circumstances." 

18  That's one way --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But why? Why would 

they have wanted to do that? That is to say, look, if 

21 you cut the exception to the exception to the exception, 

22 the presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got 

23 on your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a 

24 battery committed by a government official, given your 

interpretation, has no remedy at all. I mean,

2  MR. SHAH: Well --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what you're saying is 

4 Congress tried to do with this language is say, hey, you 

can't sue in State court; and, by the way, when you try 

6 to sue the Federal government, we are not going to give 

7 you your suit, either. Why do that? 

8  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't 

9 think -- I don't think that's true. I think before --

before the Gonzalez Act came along, there was a split in 

11 the circuits. That's why the Gonzalez Act came along. 

12 There were -- there were circuits that did not allow a 

13 claim to proceed personally against the physician. 

14  There were circuits that recognized absolute 

immunity against a personal suit, even while it was 

16 undisputed that battery claim could not proceed against 

17 the government. 

18  That -- and what -- what Congress said, if 

19 you want to look at legislative history, what the Senate 

Report says is, in light of this D.C. Circuit decision 

21 that went the other way, Congress enacted the Gonzalez 

22 Act because it was primarily concerned about conferring 

23 personal immunity. 

24  Every time the Senate Report talks about the 

purpose of the bill -- it's on page 1, heading, "Purpose

1 of the Bill" -- it says conferring personal immunity, 

2 nothing about expanding the government's tort liability. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, this is not 

4 always the government's position. In fact, in a brief 

to this Court, in the Smith case, the government took 

6 the position that Mr. Feldman is presenting to us. 

7  What occurred to turn on the light for the 

8 government, to see that it was wrong in the Smith case 

9 and come up with this -- the interpretation you are now 

advancing? 

11  MR. SHAH: Sure, Justice Ginsburg. Well, 

12 the first thing I would say is that Section 1089(e) was 

13 not directly at issue in Smith, and the issue had really 

14 been litigated quite sparsely, both before and after 

Smith. 

16  Once this case presented itself, the 

17 government revisited its position. I think there were 

18 two --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: But this is not a side 

issue, Mr. Shah. In fact, you used your understanding 

21 of 1089(e) as an argument to produce that the result this 

22 Court reached in Smith, so it was -- it was not a very 

23 large issue, but it was -- it was an argument. 

24  You said -- you know, we should reach the 

result that we -- that you wanted in Smith because

1 1089(e) would continue to have this effect. 

2  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't agree 

3 with that characterization. The government's argument 

4 would have been identical, with or without 1089(e). But 

I don't want to quibble about -- 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: It was a supportive 

7 argument. I am not saying that it was the but-for 

8 argument, but it was clearly a supportive argument in 

9 your brief. 

MR. SHAH: Your Honor, if you want to read 

11 it that way, I think that's fine. I think --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why else was it 

13 there? Just for fun? 

14  (Laughter.) 

MR. SHAH: No, I agree. It was in order 

16 to --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: It was obviously there to 

18 support your position. Now, your position would have 

19 been the same. Now, that's true. Your position would 

have been identical, but the only purpose of that 

21 argument was to support that position. 

22  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I agree. It -- it 

23 supported that position --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that was 

successful. The Court relied on that argument several

1 times in its opinion. 

2  MR. SHAH: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

3 I don't believe the Court -- 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We certainly -- we 

certainly cited Smith. 


6  MR. SHAH: Yes, but the Court did not 


7 interpret 1089(e). I think Smith -- what Smith 


8 hopefully said, Your Honor -- and this is one of the 


9 reasons why the government revisited its position --


what the Court said in the Smith decision -- you don't 

11 have to take my word of what the legislative history 

12 says. 

13  What the -- what the Court in Smith itself 

14 said is that the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- not 

the primary purpose, not a purpose, not a chief 

16 purpose -- the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- and 

17 it's talking about the Gonzalez Act as a whole -- was to 

18 confer personal immunity and not to create malpractice 

19 rights in favor of plaintiffs. 

What Justice Ginsburg --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend -- your 

22 friend says that, in Smith -- I'm sorry for the 

23 confusion -- the Court addressed your argument on the 

24 meaning of the Gonzalez Act several times. 

MR. SHAH: Your Honor, it did not address 

45

20

25

Official 

1 1089(e) at all, and -- and I think that's plain as day 

2 from -- from the opinion. What the Court said in Smith 

3 is that the purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- the sole 

4 purpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer personal 

immunity. And what it also said is the Gonzalez Act 

6 does not create malpractice rights in favor of 

7 plaintiff. 

8  That was one of the things that the 

9 government looked at in reformulating its position and 

adopting its current position, was the decision in 

11 Smith, which came after our brief. The other thing we 

12 looked at --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you did -- you did 

14 say, in the reply brief, that the point of the Gonzalez 

Act, it says, "would enable plaintiffs to pursue those 

16 claims against the United States." 

17  MR. SHAH: You are correct. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know you would have been 

19 disappointed if we didn't ask you about this. 

MR. SHAH: Yes, you are correct. We said 

21 it. This is a change of position. We revisited it. 

22 There were a couple things we looked at in coming to 

23 our --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- but it -- and 

Justice Kagan indicated, this wasn't just an aside.

1 This was rather a central theory for your interpretation 

2 of the Act; maybe not the only theory, but a central 

3 theory. 

4  MR. SHAH: I -- again, I -- I disagree, 

fundamentally, with that characterization. It's two 

6 sentences in our brief. It's at the back end of the 

7 brief. It was not fundamental to the position in Smith. 

8 The Court did not rely on it at all in Smith. 

9  But, even if all that were true, I think the 

important thing is why we changed our position. The one 

11 is -- the first and foremost is the statements in the 

12 Court's decision in Smith itself, which, obviously, 

13 post-dated our brief --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't find that 

inconsistent with the position argued. There -- you are 

16 talking about the statement that the sole purpose was --

17 was to --

18  MR. SHAH: The two statements, the sole 

19 purpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer immunity, 

not --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it is the 

22 sole purpose, even if you -- you accept your friend's 

23 interpretation. 

24  MR. SHAH: But, no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. The sole purpose 

47

Official 

1 is to assure immunity to these doctors. Now, in 

2 assuring immunity to these doctors, we -- we are not 

3 going to leave these people without any remedy, and so 

4 we allowed them a remedy against the United States. 

That's subsidiary to the sole purpose of the 

6 Act. Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to 

7 help these doctors. But, in order to do it and be fair 

8 at the same time, you have to allow suit against the 

9 United States. I think you could still say the sole 

purpose was to help the doctors. 

11  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I would 

12 disagree with that. The other side's brief says, all 

13 along, the sole purpose of this Act was not just to 

14 confer personal immunity, but it had a dual purpose. 

The dual purpose was to confer personal 

16 immunity -- and this is, time and time again, in the 

17 other side's brief -- to -- to confer personal immunity 

18 and also to provide adequate remedies to tort 

19 plaintiffs. That was not, we submit, a purpose, let 

alone a primary purpose, of the Gonzalez Act. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would -- why would 

22 Congress -- I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came 

23 after the four or five others, and Congress thought it 

24 was patterning that Act after the Gonzalez Act. 

Why would Congress want to provide this 

48

1 battery remedy if a Veterans Administration medical 

2 person messed up, but not if it was an armed service 

3 doctor? 

4  MR. SHAH: Of course, Congress doesn't say. 

I think there are two potential reasons, Justice 

6 Ginsburg. One might be the -- as -- as this Court has 

7 recognized, the special solicitude that Congress pays 

8 veterans, and it may have wanted to open up remedies to 

9 veterans that were unavailable to others. 

I think the second potential reason is the 

11 defense side reasons. The defendants in Veterans Act 

12 cases are civilian Veterans Administration employees. 

13 In a Gonzalez Act case, by and large, the defendants are 

14 going to be active military personnel. Congress is 

often hesitant to create -- expand judicial remedies 

16 against active military personnel because of the risk it 

17 poses to interfering with military function and order. 

18  So I think those are two reasons why 

19 Congress may have decided to -- to change course in the 

Veterans Act in 1988, after it had four provisions that 

21 said exactly the same thing, using the four purposes of 

22 this Act provision, it changed it, and it must have 

23 changed it for a reason. 

24  Two potential reasons are to change the 

result, which, of course, under which the government

1 would win; or because it think -- it thought it needed 

2 to speak more clearly, in order to waive sovereign 

3 immunity. And, under the presumption against sovereign 

4 immunity waivers, the government would also prevail. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, your basic theory 

6 of the case, which is that, in order to make absolutely 

7 certain that everyone gets the benefit of the 

8 intentional tort exception, both the government and 

9 individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely 

clear, Congress writes a provision saying that the 

11 intentional tort exception shall not apply. 

12  Now -- I mean, the -- the position, I have 

13 to say, seems to refute itself. If Congress wanted to 

14 make absolutely clear that the intentional tort 

exception would apply, it wouldn't have written a 

16 provision saying that it doesn't apply. 

17  MR. SHAH: Well, the provision that you 

18 describe, Justice Kagan, is not this provision. It's 

19 the 1988 Veterans Act amendment, which says the 

intentional tort exception shall not apply. This 

21 provision says, "for purposes of this section," that is, 

22 for purposes of the Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity 

23 in Subsection (a), that the -- the intentional tort 

24 exception shall not apply. 

Now, sometimes, when Congress uses the four 

50
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 purposes of this section's formulation, sometimes, it 

2 uses words like "assume that" or "consider that," as 

3 it -- as cited in the other side's brief, in footnote 4, 

4 on page 18. However, other times, when it uses "for 

purposes of this section," even though it intends 

6 somewhat of a counterfactual inquiry, it eliminates 

7 those words. 

8  In Title 10 itself, Section 10 USC 335 says, 

9 "for purposes of this section" -- the exact language is, 

"For purposes of this chapter, the term 'State' includes 

11 Guam and the Virgin Islands." 

12  Now, there's no dispute that Congress was 

13 not trying to add Guam and the Virgin Islands as the 

14 51st and 52nd States of the Union. What it meant is, 

when applying the provisions of this section, treat Guam 

16 and Virgin Islands as if they are States. So --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Would you -- are you 

18 finished there? 

19  MR. SHAH: Yes, sir. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Would -- would you go back 

21 for a minute and think, before this Act was passed --

22 the Gonzalez Act -- and think of the millions of 

23 government employees, and they're in different parts of 

24 the country, and some of them commit batteries. 

Now, you told me before that, where an

1 injured person -- a plaintiff sues a government 

2 employee, and they sue under State tort law, and they 

3 say, this government employee committed a battery, okay, 

4 in the course of duty, you say there was an immunity 

there. 

6  Where did the immunity come from? 

7  MR. SHAH: It was -- it was a common law 

8 absolute immunity. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: From what? 

MR. SHAH: One -- one case is the 

11 Martinez --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what was the theory 

13 of it? I mean, here it's just -- it's a person, he's at 

14 work, he does happen to work for the Federal government, 

instead of working for someone else --

16  MR. SHAH: Sure. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: -- and everybody else, you 

18 have to respond, and you -- if liable, you'd have to pay 

19 damages for the battery. Now, where -- where did the 

immunity come from --

21  MR. SHAH: The theory was --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: -- if the Federal employee 

23 did it? 

24  MR. SHAH: The theory behind the individual 

immunity was the same -- essentially, the same theory

Official 

1 behind the Westfall Act immunity that this Court 

2 rejected in the Westfall Act decision. So, up until 

3 Westfall, there was an argument that there was absolute 

4 immunity, that -- that the individual government 

employees had absolute immunity. 


6  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 


7  MR. SHAH: It was a common law immunity 


8 that -- it was an offshoot of the sovereign immunity, 


9 and it conferred it on the individual employee. This 


Court, of course, in Westfall, rejected that notion and 

11 said -- you know, that immunity doesn't apply, unless 

12 you are talking about both beings in the scope of 

13 employment and that apply -- that involve discretionary 

14 policy decisions at a high enough level. 

The last point I would make, Your Honor, is, 

16 even if you believed -- and I think you do -- that the 

17 texts were more naturally read to favor Petitioner, that 

18 is not enough. And I think you can look at this Court's 

19 decision in Nordic Village. 

The statutory provision in that case made 

21 certain Bankruptcy Court determinations binding on the 

22 government, "notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign 

23 immunity." The relevant language is reproduced on 

24 footnote 10, on page 41 of our brief. 

That language, "notwithstanding any 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 assertion of sovereign immunity," sounds awfully like a 

2 waiver of sovereign immunity. It seems pretty explicit. 

3 But what this Court said, in applying the unequivocal 

4 waiver requirement, in finding that there was no waiver 

of sovereign immunity, despite that very explicit 

6 language, was that the statute, nonetheless, performed a 

7 significant function. 

8  Here, the same is true. Section 1089(e), 

9 though not authorizing monetary relief, still 

undisputedly performs a function here. It performs a 

11 function of securing the personal immunity conferred by 

12 Section 1089(a), that is, for purposes of the Gonzalez 

13 Act, the conferral of immunity under Section 1089(a). 

14  Just -- just as in Nordic Village, that is 

enough to construe the statute against a waiver of 

16 sovereign immunity. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want us to 

18 decide the case with the unequivocal question before us, 

19 in other words, deciding whether that benefit to the 

government applies in this type of case. 

21  MR. SHAH: Yes. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me to be 

23 you are really upping the ante here, and it may well --

24 I have no idea why the government took the opposite 

position below, but that's -- that's putting a lot more 

54

1 at stake in this case than the particular statutory 

2 position. 

3  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, there are four 

4 courts that have decided -- conclusively spoken -- to my 

knowledge, four courts, in the history, that have 

6 interpreted this provision, Section 1089(e). All have 

7 come out in the government's favor. There were two 

8 district court decisions before the Smith case. Both 

9 came out in the government's favor. 

The only two decisions I am aware of are the 

11 two decisions in this case, conclusively interpreting 

12 1089(e), the district court and the court of appeals. 

13 Both courts in this case relied on the unequivocal 

14 waiver requirement. And I think that that's -- it's not 

a stretch, at all, to apply the unequivocal waiver canon 

16 here. 

17  In fact, this case is far afield from Dolan. 

18 It would be a substantial expansion of the narrow 

19 exception in Dolan to say that the unequivocal waiver 

requirement didn't apply. There was no dispute that 

21 sovereign immunity applied the day before the Gonzalez 

22 Act was enacted. 

23  So the only question is whether the Gonzalez 

24 Act enacts a new waiver of sovereign immunity. That is 

the type of situation in which the canon applies most 

55

1 strongly. 

2  And Congress did it in a separate statute. 

3 Again, in Dolan, we were interpreting provisions that 

4 everyone agreed were part and parcel of the FTCA that --

that altered the balance of sovereign immunity. Here, 

6 the question is whether it even affects or amends the 

7 FTCA in the first place, whether it means to affect the 

8 sovereign immunity balance in the first place. 

9  That's an especially strong case in which we 

would want an unequivocal waiver requirement. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, does it make 

12 any sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice, 

13 negligence and this unconsented operation, to split 

14 those two and say the government is liable for 

malpractice, but not for this unconsented action. 

16  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think it makes a 

17 lot of sense, and here's why: When Congress enacted the 

18 intentional tort exception itself in 1946, one of the 

19 principal reasons it -- it did that was because 

intentional tort claims are sometimes easier to allege 

21 but more difficult to disprove. 

22  That is particularly true with respect to 

23 these sort of lack of consent claims, where you have a 

24 patient who has signed consent forms, agreed to a 

surgery, and says -- and the facts of this case, I 

56

1 think, are illustrative -- says right before the 

2 anesthesia kicked in, "I said I don't want the procedure 

3 anymore." 

4  Now, here, the government was successful in 

winning on summary judgment dismissal of the actual 

6 medical negligence claim, that the doctor's standard of 

7 care didn't -- that the doctor's care didn't meet the 

8 standard of care. 

9  The government won summary judgment on that 

because there -- there was no evidence -- no expert 

11 testimony that supported Petitioner's claim. But his 

12 claim that, "I said no right before the anesthesia 

13 kicked in," survived summary judgment. 

14  And I think it was correct to survive 

summary judgment, but the problem is that that survived 

16 summary judgment, even though the deposition testimony, 

17 as pointed out in the government's brief, everyone else 

18 in the operating room, including the doctor, said that 

19 this patient did not so object, just shows that these 

claims --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shah, can I ask you 

22 why -- if your interpretation is correct, Subsection (e) 

23 did not read -- not for purposes of this section, but 

24 rather for purposes of Subsection (a), the provisions of 

2680(h) shall not apply?

3  For -- this section -- Subsection (a), (b), 

4 and (c) all work in tandem. (D) is a settlement 

provision that really doesn't really have anything to do 

6 with this. So, when it says, "for purposes of this 

7 section," "Subsection (a)" and "this section" are 

8 essentially the only operative provisions of the Act. 

9  The only other provisions that do any work 

are (e) and (f), which come after, obviously, Subsection 

11 (e). So, when Congress used the term "for purposes of 

12 this section," I think the fair statement is it was 

13 referring to Subsections (a) through (c).

22 standard at any time in the Tort Claims Act, not just 

23 when it's dealing with exceptions, but, if you go back 

24 to the very early cases, the Aetna case, the Yellow Cab 

case, really, right after the Act was passed, you can

1 see that the Court is saying there, no, we want to 

2 interpret this Act to -- consistent with Congress's 

3 intent, the way it wanted it interpreted, which is with 

4 a fair reading of its words, not in one direction, not 

in the other. 

6  I just also wanted to clarify, in the Smith 

7 case because, of a possible misunderstanding, the Court 

8 definitely addressed the Gonzales Act, repeatedly, in 

9 its opinion in the Smith case, but it didn't -- the 

Court did not actually address 1089(e). 

11  The reason the government, though -- this 

12 was important to the government, and, actually, the 

13 government's reply brief in the Smith case was, I think, 

14 a hundred percent about the Gonzales Act -- was that the 

other side of the Gonzales Act was saying, if you 

16 construe the Westfall Act the way the government wants, 

17 that will be an implied repeal, but the Gonzales Act 

18 will have nothing left to do. 

19  And it was important for the government --

that's why they kept saying it. It was important for 

21 the government to say, no, the Gonzales Act does have 

22 things to do, this is not an implied repeal. And one of 

23 the things it does is exactly what we say Section 

24 1089(e) does. 

If there are no further questions?
