 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-582, Federal 

Communications Commission versus Fox Television 

Stations.

 Mr. Garre. Solicitor General Garre.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 This case involves a challenge to the 

efforts of the Federal Communications Commission to 

carry out its statutory mandate under 18 U.S.C. 1464, 

and more even-handedly address indecent material that is 

broadcast directly into the home during the time of day 

when children are likely to be in the viewing audience.

 After reconsidering its policy in this area, 

the Commission determined that an enforcement action may 

be appropriate in the case of indecent language that is 

isolated as well as repeated. Because the Commission 

provided a reasoned explanation for that change in 

course, the court of appeals erred in invalidating its 

action under the Administrative Procedures Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did it -- did it reconsider

its policy? In the first order, I would -- I would have 

gathered that it had, but its second order said 

basically, we've never had a policy that single use of 

these expletives is okay. Which is it? Are they 

changing their policy or not?

 GENERAL GARRE: They did change the policy, 

Justice Scalia, and the Commission directly acknowledged 

that in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order, 

which is not reprinted in the petition appendix. In 

that paragraph, the Commission said, "We now depart from 

cases holding that isolated or fleeting use of the 

F-Word was not indecent."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The latest order, the one 

that's up here, says that all of the statements to that 

effect in the past were simply staff statements and that 

the Commission had never held to that effect before.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, the court of appeals 

recognized, and we think correctly so, that the 

Commission did change its position on that. The 

Commission had never brought an enforcement action 

against a broadcaster for the isolated use of an 

expletive, and the Commission made clear in the orders 

it issued in this case, beginning with the Golden Globe 

Awards order and the particular omnibus and remand 

orders before this Court, that it was taking a change in

regulatory course in determining that it was appropriate 

to bring an enforcement action where there was an 

isolated incident of an expletive if the context 

suggested that it would be indecent in that situation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the agency's 

position that its policy has changed or that it has not 

changed?

 GENERAL GARRE: That it has changed, 

Justice Kennedy, and the court of appeals recognized 

that at pages 20a to 21a of the decision. And we think 

this Court has recognized --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the court 

recognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is 

what Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the 

remand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, I think there were 

some statements, we would acknowledge that, in different 

places. But if you go to the heart of where the FCC 

grappled with this, paragraph -- paragraph 12 of the 

Golden Globe Awards order, it specifically disavowed its 

prior decisions in which it had said that isolated 

expletives would not warrant an enforcement action under 

1464, and it specifically said, "we are departing from 

our policy." We -- after all, it didn't impose --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But I think it rewrote that

in its last order, and I think it even explained away 

the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as 

categorical as it might appear.

 GENERAL GARRE: I think if you look at maybe 

pages 82 to 83 of the petition appendix here, where we 

discuss that as well, I think it made clear with respect 

to the indecency finding involving the 2003 Billboard 

Music Awards and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, that 

in applying its contextual analysis in the past it 

focused on whether or not expletives were repeated or 

dwelled upon. In this case, the Commission determined 

that it was not going to be guided exclusively by that 

consideration and that it was going to take into account 

all contextual factors, including the explicit and 

graphic nature of the language used.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think, in 

terms of our legal review, it makes a difference whether 

it's a change or whether it's a continuation of a prior 

policy?

 GENERAL GARRE: Certainly, I would be 

defending it if the Court thought that it wasn't a 

change, and it would have been inappropriate for the 

Second Circuit to invalidate that as arbitrary and 

capricious. We have -- we think it was a change. The 

language that the Commission used indicated that it was

departing from its prior understanding, and we are here 

defending -- either way, we are here defending --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question 

is, do you think a different legal standard applies when 

an agency changes a prior position as opposed to 

articulating its position for the first time?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, this Court has said 

that it's desirable for agencies to reconsider and to 

change its policy from time to time, but when --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't the Commission --

the Commission asked the Second Circuit, said: We've 

changed our policy; we want you to remand the case to 

the Commission so the Commission can explain what its 

new policy. I mean, isn't that how this whole thing 

arose? The case was in the Second Circuit and the 

Commission said it wanted to have an opportunity to 

explain its position more fully?

 GENERAL GARRE: It is, and it did in the 

remand order reprinted in the petition appendix.

 Mr. Chief Justice, I think either way the 

ultimate standard is arbitrary and capriciousness. Now, 

the Respondents have focused on whether or not we have 

complied with the criteria that the Court has looked to 

in determining whether or not a change in agency 

position is arbitrary and capricious. And we think that

there are three factors here that must lead to the 

conclusion that it was not arbitrary and capricious.

 One, we think that the Commission did 

directly acknowledge its change in position. Two, the 

Commission provided a concrete explanation for that 

change. And, three, that explanation is at a minimum 

plausible and consistent with the Commission's statutory 

mandate. This Court has never invalidated a change in 

agency position where those three factors have been 

present.

 And if you look at the three principal 

justifications that the agency used in explaining its 

change in position, I think it's absolutely clear that 

this was at a minimum a rational policy choice that the 

agency was committed -- was permitted to take under the 

Administrative Procedures Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the problems is 

that, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme 

or reason for some of the decisions that the Commission 

has made. I mean, the "Saving Private Ryan" case was 

filled with expletives, and yet the film about jazz 

history, the words were considered a violation of the 

Commission's policies. So that there seems to be very 

little rhyme or reason to when the Commission says that 

one of these words is okay and when it says it isn't.

GENERAL GARRE: Well, we do think, of 

course, that there is rhyme or reason to its 

determination. First, let me say that much of the 

vagueness type of arguments that the Respondents are 

making similar to your question could be made equally 

with respect to the Commission's policy with respect to 

repeated utterances as well as isolated utterances.

 If you take the "Saving Private Ryan" and 

the blues documentary example, those were repeated-

utterances cases. We are here because they challenged 

the Commission's change in policy to go from repeated 

utterances to consider enforcement actions in the case 

of isolated expletives where they met its contextual 

analysis and where it was explicit, graphic, shocking or 

pandering in the context.

 Now, I think certainly there are going to be 

situations and this Court has indicated that the 

vagueness inquiry doesn't turn about coming up with 

hypotheticals at -- at the outer margins of the 

standard.

 I think in the Pacifica case our reading of 

the Court's decision is similar to the D.C. Circuit's 

reading of that decision in the Action for Children's 

Television case, that implicit in the Court's decision 

in Pacifica was that it rejected a vagueness challenge

to the Commission's definition of "indecency," which is 

the same definition that the Commission is applying 

today.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the most 

difficult case for you is the "Early News" case where 

you have just a fleeting expletive, unlike "Saving 

Private Ryan" and the others. I mean, how do you 

distinguish the "Early News" case from the ones before 

us?

 GENERAL GARRE: The Commission has 

determined that news programming would be treated 

differently, with greater restraint, because of the 

different values present in that situation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the same -- if 

you had a news report about Nicole Richey and the Cher 

exhibits, they -- they could use the actual language, 

even though they can't during the -- the awards shows?

 GENERAL GARRE: Yes. And, similarly, if 

there were a news report about the argument today in 

this Court and there were reports about the actual 

language used, that's right. The Commission has 

exercised restraint in that area, recognizing that there 

are different values at stake than in the -- in the 

utterance of indecent language during a prime-time 

broadcast where are a substantial number of children in

the viewing audience.

 For the broadcast in this case, up to 24 to 

28 percent of the viewing audience comprised children 

under the age of 18. This language was concededly 

gratuitous in the context it was used. In the Nicole 

Richey example in 2003, there was an element of 

pandering as part of the dialogue consisted of Paris 

Hilton saying, "Watch your language," before Nicole 

Richey launched into dropping the S-Word and the F-Word 

in -- in a context that was, the FCC reasonably 

determined, was shocking and gratuitous and explicit and 

graphic; and, therefore, in the context in which it was 

presented, indecent under the agency's longstanding 

definition of "indecency."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there only those two 

words in the FCC's new policy or are there other words 

on the list?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, certainly, the FCC's 

action in this case focuses on the use of the F-Word and 

the S-Word, and I think everyone acknowledges that a 

word like the F-Word is one of the most graphic, 

explicit, and vulgar words in the English language for 

sexual activity. And I think even the networks here 

concede that it was -- its use was gratuitous and 

inappropriate here. And that would control --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that --

isn't it true that that is a word that often is used 

with -- with no reference whatsoever to the -- the 

sexual connotation?

 GENERAL GARRE: It can be -- it certainly 

can be used in a non-literal way. It can be used in a 

metaphorical way, as Cher used it here, to say "F them" 

to her critics. But the -- the non-literal/literal 

distinction is not unique to the isolated expletives 

versus the repeated effort -- expletives.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think it's equally --

it's equally subject to being treated as indecent within 

the meaning of the statute regardless of which meaning 

was actually apparent to everybody who listened to it?

 GENERAL GARRE: I wouldn't say equally, 

Justice Stevens, but what we would say is that it can 

qualify as indecent under the -- under the Commission's 

definition, because even the non-literal use of a word 

like the F-Word, because of the core meaning of that 

word as one of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit 

words for sexual activity in the English language, it 

inevitably conjures up a core sexual image.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is, indeed, why it's 

used.

used as an intensifier or as an insult, and it's why the 

networks themselves -- and this is reprinted, I believe, 

at 86 of the petition appendix -- have a 24-hour rule 

that the F-Word generally should not be use on TV.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is an 

entirely voluntary -- I mean, the Commission would have 

no objection if the F-Word were used on a regular basis 

after 10:00 o'clock?

 GENERAL GARRE: Outside of the safe harbor 

under this Court's decision, the -- the Commission 

recognizes that networks can use indecent language.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Although they don't, I 

gather.

 GENERAL GARRE: Although they don't. Their 

policies are not to use indecent language.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because they find it 

offensive, I gather.

 GENERAL GARRE: Because I think they 

recognize that it contravenes community standards for 

appropriateness in the broadcast medium, and that --

those policies are reprinted at pages 86a to 88a of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How are the contemporary 

community standards determined in this context? Does 

the FCC survey any particular audience to find out what 

their standards are?

GENERAL GARRE: Well, first of all, the 

community standards are community standards for the 

broadcast medium. This is set out a little bit at page 

33 of the joint appendix at footnote 13. Second of all, 

they look to community standards for the average 

listener. And, third of all, the -- the Commission 

applies its expressly -- collective experience here, 

looking to statements from lawmakers, from courts, from 

broadcasters, from public interest groups, and from 

citizens to determine what is consistent with community 

standards. And certainly the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the 

broadcasters' own voluntary determination not to use 

that -- that language 24 hours is a reflection of what 

they think about community standards.

 GENERAL GARRE: Absolutely. I think it is 

an irrefutable reflection of what they think the 

appropriate community standards are.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you talking about 

community standards for broadcasting?

 GENERAL GARRE: Community standards for 

broadcasting, that's right. And, in that respect, this 

case is much different than the Reno case, for example, 

where one of the criticisms this Court had was 

uncertainty about what community standards would apply.

Another difference is -- is that here you 

have the Commission, an expert agency, making these 

determining -- making these determinations, drawing in 

part on the policies and practices of the regulated 

industry itself; for example, the self-imposed rule not 

to use the F-Word at particular times of day.

 And, of course, you have the fact that 

broadcast television has always been subject to a lesser 

standard of First Amendment scrutiny. Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Still, I gather 

that's at issue with the constitutional questions. Does 

that still have the same force today when the broadcast 

medium is only one of several that are -- that are 

available? In other words, it seems to me that the 

Commission might not be accomplishing terribly much if 

it regulates a particular medium when all sorts of other 

media, media, are available that don't have the 

Commission's oversight.

 GENERAL GARRE: We think it is, and we think 

it is reflected in the Court's cases. Let me -- and let 

me explain why. But let me first say that obviously we 

think that this Court does not need to, and should not, 

delve into the constitutional issues in resolving the 

case before it today.

 The only issue that we have presented and

the only issue decided below is whether or not the 

Commission has provided a reasoned explanation of the 

Administrative Procedures Act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I ask? You 

can go ahead. Are you finished?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, if -- if I can answer 

the question as to the force of the Court's precedents, 

this Court has repeatedly affirmed in cases like Sable, 

in cases like Reno, in cases like Turner and Denver 

Area, that broadcasting is subject to a different and 

lesser First Amendment standard.

 The Commission in this case looked to the 

considerations that underlie that jurisprudential 

doctrine and concluded that they were still apposite, 

and that is at pages 108 to 110 of the petition 

appendix.

 Most Americans still get their information 

and entertainment from broadcast TV. Most children --

broadcast TV is extremely accessible to children because 

all they have to do is turn it on, and then they have 

network shows that they can have access to. And 

broadcast television is still broadcast in a way that 

invades the home, the place -- the one place where 

people typically don't expect to have uninvited, 

offensive --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but wasn't the 

rationale for the lesser standard largely the scarcity 

of the frequencies?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think that was the 

rationale in Red -- Red Lion. This is Court in Pacifica 

didn't rely on that rationale.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it relied on it in Red 

Lion?

 GENERAL GARRE: Yes. I -- as we read the 

decision, Justice Stevens -- and I understand that you 

wrote the plurality decision there. But, as we read the 

decision, the Court did not rest so much on the scarcity 

rationale, but, yet, on the unique pervasiveness of 

broadcasting, the unique accessibility to children, and 

the fact that broadcasting invades the home in a way 

that other technologies do not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was before the 

Internet. Pacifica was in 1978.

 GENERAL GARRE: It was, Your Honor. Now, in 

the Turner case this Court said at page 190 that 

broadcast medium is still the principal source of 

information in entertainment in affirming the lesser 

standard that this Court applies.

 We actually think that the fact that there 

are now additional mediums like the internet and cable

TV, if anything, underscores the appropriateness of a 

lower First Amendment standard or safety zone for 

broadcast TV, because Americans who want to get indecent 

programming can go to cable TV, they can go to the 

Internet.

 But broadcast TV is, as Congress designed 

that to be, the one place where Americans can turn on 

the TV at 8:00 o'clock and watch their dinner and not be 

expected to be bombarded with indecent language, either 

in an isolated basis or repeated basis. That's a 

societal expectation that has grown up over the last 

30 years since Pacifica. And it would be a remarkable 

thing to adopt the world that the networks are asking 

you to adopt here today, where the networks are free to 

use expletives, whether in an isolated or repeated 

basis, 24 hours a day, going from the extreme example of 

Big Bird dropping the F-bomb on Sesame Street, to the 

example of using that word during Jeopardy or opening 

the episode of American Idol --

JUSTICE BREYER: I just have a practical 

question. I'm just curious about this. What are the 

networks supposed to do, or the television stations? 

They cover a lot of live events. They're not just 

sports events. They're also like but the Golden -- you 

know, the Emmys, the Oscars, and you deal with a

cross-section of humanity. And my experience is some 

parts of that cross-section swear.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what is it -- what are 

they supposed to do when the event is live, and lo and 

behold, they have a few people in front of them who 

swear, using these words? What is their -- what can 

they do?

 GENERAL GARRE: With respect to live 

entertainment programming, Justice Breyer, you can do 

what the networks now do, which is to have a tape delay 

which permits you to bleep out isolated or offensive --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, what they -- what they 

now -- they now do this? In other words, whenever they 

cover a baseball game, whenever they cover anything 

live, they have to have some kind of tape system or for 

the Emmys, everything is on tape and it's all delayed 

five seconds?

 GENERAL GARRE: No. It varies based on the 

type of programming. For example, the Commission has 

acknowledged -- and this is at pages 94 to 95a of the 

petition appendix -- that their -- that breaking news 

coverage is different and that it will not approach it

breaking news coverage. I guess I'm talking about, you 

know, any one of -- they cover the wrestling matches, 

they cover -- you see what I'm driving at. And I would 

like to know what is the state of the art? You are 

saying the state of the art is right now when I turn on 

my television set, they all use a delay.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't think --

that's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or are you saying they all 

have to use a delay?

 GENERAL GARRE: In a show like the Billboard 

Music Awards, they will use a delay. And since the 

incidents in this case, the 2003 and 2002 instances, the 

networks have gotten more people who are on hand to 

bleep isolated expletives.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They had a 5-second delay 

at the time these things occurred, didn't they?

 GENERAL GARRE: They did, and I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it wasn't -- it wasn't 

that they weren't fast enough or something?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, if you look at the 

Nicole Richie example, they actually bleeped one word 

that was used, I believe --

other two words. But at that time they only had one 

person working the bleeping machine or whatever it is 

they call it.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on whom you are 

dealing with, right?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think that's right. But 

certainly there is an understanding that this is -- that 

these isolated --

JUSTICE BREYER: Did the FCC explain all 

this in its opinion when it said, we understand that now 

we're going to have to -- every incident is going to 

have to be -- have a 5-second delay and they will have 

to have tapes, and we think it's worth the cost? Did 

they explain all that?

 GENERAL GARRE: It explained that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see it.

 GENERAL GARRE: -- in its decision in the 

petition appendix here as to the basis why enforcement 

action would be appropriate. Because here you are 

dealing with individuals who have used inappropriate in 

the past -- Nicole Richie had used inappropriate 

language in the past. You had an inappropriate tape 

delay, you had inappropriate measures in place to ensure 

that expletives were not used, which in the Commission's

judgment meant that this would be an appropriate 

situation.

 If you had a different context, say a 

sporting event where there is an isolated expletive as 

part of a post-game news interview, the Commission as it 

would under its context-based approach, would look to 

all the contextual factors and determine whether or not 

it was indecent in that situation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This Paris Hilton incident 

was scripted. The use of the indecent word was almost 

invited, wasn't it?

 GENERAL GARRE: Certainly our view is that 

it was pandering and invited. It could have been 

expected.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there a different 

word? Wasn't there a euphemism in the script? I 

thought there was a euphemism in the script.

 GENERAL GARRE: The euphemism in the script 

I think was "freaking", and another euphemism for the 

S-Word, but they obviously departed from that. And I 

think the Commission --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it was sort of an 

invitation. I mean, before she was introduced, said, 

"Now we're on live television, you have to watch your 

mouth", or something like that.

GENERAL GARRE: That's what Paris Hilton 

said. I mean, I think the whole thing was set up to be 

pandering --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was a setup.

 GENERAL GARRE: -- to invite this kind of 

abuse, which is one of the contextual factors that the 

Commission looked at, along with the extremely shocking 

and graphic nature of using this language at 9:00 p.m. 

on an eastern night.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you didn't fine them, 

anyway, did you?

 GENERAL GARRE: We did not fine them because 

we exercised restraint in making -- in attempting to 

make clear that the FCC going forward was going to 

consider isolated --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you had gone from 

Pacifica until 2004 with a different policy, where this 

kind of thing would have been okay?

 GENERAL GARRE: We had gone from Pacifica 

until 1987, approximately, in the Action for Children's 

Television case, where the Commission determined that 

that approach limited only to the seven dirty words in 

Pacifica was unduly narrow and inconsistent with its 

enforcement responsibilities.

because there was -- the statement that the networks 

don't do this at all at the time of Action for 

Children's Television, the fight was, was it going to be 

from midnight 'til whatever it was. The networks wanted 

more hours for adult viewing. They said the only hours 

that the Commission gave them were hours when most 

everybody is asleep.

 GENERAL GARRE: But I don't -- my 

understanding was that was not pertaining to use of the 

F-Word. The networks' policies are at 86 to 88a, the 

petition appendix, and described there. The D.C. 

Circuit found with respect to that change in position 

that the Commission had supplied an adequate explanation 

under the APA simply by saying that its prior practice, 

enforcement practice, was unduly narrow and not 

consistent with its enforcement responsibility.

 We think that the even more detailed 

explanation here clearly satisfies the APA standard that 

applied to the Commission's change in position.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe I shouldn't ask 

this, but is there ever appropriate for the Commission 

to take into consideration at all the question whether 

the particular remark was really hilarious, very, very 

funny? Some of these things --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you can't help but 

laugh at. Is that -- is that a proper consideration, do 

you think?

 GENERAL GARRE: Yes, insofar as the 

Commission takes into account whether it's shocking, 

titillating, pandering --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's funny. I mean, 

bawdy jokes are okay if they are really good.

 (Laughter.)

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, my point is that we 

will take it into account, but I think you can recognize 

the potentially greater harmful impact on children where 

you have celebrities using particularly graphic, vulgar, 

explicit, indecent language as part of the comedic 

routine during a show that children are comprising a 

substantial part of the viewing audience.

 And that is one of the factors that is 

appropriate under this Court's decision in Pacifica and 

the Commission's policy to take into account the time of 

day and the viewing audience.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you review me to one 

thing in the record if it's there, or just tell me. I 

did find an explanation for the agency deciding that 

"fleeting" is not going to be an automatic exemption. 

They've talked about that.

What I didn't find is an explanation for a 

second thing, which had to do with their first prong of 

their former test, and that was the distinction that 

used to be made between using these words as swear words 

and using them as descriptive words. Now that, I think, 

showed up in their former policy because they said if 

they were used as a swear word we are not going to go 

after them, at least not immediately. So that had to do 

with prong 1, not prong 2.

 GENERAL GARRE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So is there an explanation 

why they made that change?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, prong 1 hasn't 

changed, Justice Breyer, since the time --

JUSTICE BREYER: It hasn't?

 GENERAL GARRE: -- of Pacifica. It has not. 

It's the same explanation, whether descriptions or 

depictions of sexual or excretorial organs or 

activities, the same definition before the Court in 

Pacifica.

 And as the Pacifica monologue makes clear, 

there were many both literal and non-literal uses of the 

F-Word and S-Word and other words in that monologue. 

So, I think the Commission's position is this kind of 

language has always been indecent, which is -- what has

changed is it's now going to consider enforcement action 

when is it's used in an isolated basis on a context-

based approach.

 If I can reserve --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask one 

question? It's about the bottom line of your brief. 

This whole argument has an air of really futility, 

because the Second Circuit more than tipped its hand 

when it said: And even as they gave a reasoned 

explanation, we have grave doubts whether this would be 

constitutional.

 You suggested in your brief a remand for 

briefing and a hearing in the Second Circuit on the 

constitutional issue. So, is there a way that we can 

say, well, really, this issue that's before us now is 

ignoring the big elephant in the rule, room; we have to 

get to that anyway?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, that approach would be 

consistent with this Court not deciding issues that 

haven't been decided below and the general practice of 

constitutional avoidance. Now, the Second Circuit at 

three different places in its decision, on page 2a and 

page 35a, and at the end of its decision, made clear 

that it was not deciding the constitutional issues. 

Judge Laval who dissented didn't say anything about the

constitutional issues. So we certainly want another 

crack at those issues before the Second Circuit, and 

Respondents after all are not simply asking this Court 

to hold the regulation of isolated expletives is 

unconstitutional, but that any broadcast indecency 

regulation is unconstitutional; and at a minimum before 

this Court entertains that kind of radical 

constitutional shift, it ought to have the benefit of a 

court of appeals decision which actually decides those 

issues.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could that be -- could 

that be done without deciding this APA or are we forced 

to decide that?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, we think the Court is 

forced to decide that because that's the basis that the 

court of appeals has invalidated the Commission's 

action. The Court should reject that decision which is 

incorrect under the APA and send it back for 

consideration of the networks' other arguments.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General 

Garre.

and may it please the Court:

 I think I would like to start with 

Justice Scalia's narrowest question in terms of the 

easiest way to resolve this case, which is did the FCC 

in its remand order in fact recognize that it had made a 

change in policy and therefore dealt forthrightly with 

the fact that it had made a change in policy. While it 

is true that the Second Circuit was prepared to accept 

the idea that the Commission had changed, the reality is 

you will read that opinion without any ability to 

discern that. And the need --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't 

the ability to discern it come from the reasons given 

for not assessing fines? They said: We are not 

assessing fines. This is something new, and this is in 

effect a warning to everybody that things have changed. 

Isn't that a pretty clear indication that they are 

adopting a new policy?

 MR. PHILLIPS: It -- well, that they are in 

fact adopting a new policy, I think that is probably 

right, Justice Souter. I think the problem here is that 

ordinarily when you are in fact forthrightly changing 

your policy it is incumbent upon the agency to say: We 

are changing our policy, we recognize we are changing 

our policy, and here is the explanation for why we are

changing our policy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they -- are they 

supposed to be more virtuous than courts?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, courts all the 

time, you know, distinguish prior cases by saying, 

"well, you know, it was dictum, or we didn't really hold 

that and whatnot. " And I read their opinion as somewhat 

the same -- somewhat the same thing. They acknowledge 

at the end, and that's why they didn't impose a fine, 

that although this, you know, nothing that they had done 

up till now -- although their staff had -- would have 

misled anybody; still and all, it wasn't all that clear, 

and therefore we won't impose a fine. It seems to me --

MR. PHILLIPS: The only thing that's 

strikingly different about that, Justice Scalia, is they 

are very express in dealing with issue in the Golden 

Globes order, which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- General Garre specifically 

identifies. It's interesting, when you say where is it 

in the order under review when they say they are going 

to do that, he says look in paragraph 12 of the Golden 

Globes order. And Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right:

said No, send it back; give us a full opportunity to 

explain exactly what we are doing. Thy take it back and 

they come in and they don't deal with this issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- it was also, they 

said, you know, we sort of made this change without 

getting comments from the affected parties.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That was part of it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Give us a chance to receive 

comments and then -- and then explain.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And then provide a final 

reviewable order from the Commission, presumably that 

defends in all respects that decision. But as I say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What the Commission 

said is that the prior decisions or guidance was 

seriously flawed and we reaffirmed that it was 

appropriate to disavow it.

 It seems to me that is recognizing a change 

and rejecting it. It's at page 82a.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. All -- all I am 

suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that there is equally 

an opposite language in which the Commission -- and the 

Second Circuit acknowledged this, too -- in which the 

Commission seems to back off whether or not it thinks it 

has made a change in this particular order. And it 

seems unreliable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to 

be the same question that I asked your friend: does it 

matter? Don't we look at the Commission's order and 

determine whether it's a reasonable explanation, whether 

they view it as a change or not? It seems to me that 

they kind of said you can view it as a change because 

the staff had these decisions, and there was dicta; or 

it's not a change. But the point -- important point is 

whether or not they provided a reasonable explanation 

for their current position.

 MR. PHILLIPS: This Court said in State Farm 

that when an agency changes its position it is incumbent 

upon the agency to provide more of an explanation in 

that context than -- than if it were adopting the 

position in the first instance. So I think yes, if 

there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it says in 

State Farm -- what it says in State Farm is that an 

agency's view of what is in the public interest may 

change either with or without a change in circumstances.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason there is 

a change is they looked at it and they decided it was 

wrong.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, I -- I think it

-- we wouldn't be having this debate if the Commission 

had simply dealt with this issue in the same forthright 

fashion that it did with respect to the Golden Globes 

order. But even if the Court accepts the idea that 

there is a change, it seems to me quite clear that the 

Commission has not even remotely satisfied its -- its 

obligation to demonstrate that that change is not 

arbitrary and capricious. And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree it's 

enough of a justification for the change that they think 

the other policy was wrong? They don't have to say 

circumstances have changed, the facts are different; 

it's enough to say, "well, whatever the Commission used 

to thing, we think differently"?

 MR. PHILLIPS: And then explain why.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then explain 

why.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And that goes into what I 

think is the next point that I would like to make which 

is the answer to the Justice Breyer's question, which is 

where in the opinion does the Commission explain the 

change in position with respect to the -- to the first 

prong of the indecency standard, which is whether or not 

these words inherently mean either sexual or excretory 

activities; and there, it seems to me, there is a --

whether there is a change or not, the reality is that 

from 1978 until 2004 this kind of language was used 

routinely, without the Commission remotely suggesting 

that every time it was used, it necessarily had a 

particular meaning. And then suddenly in 2004, this 

language has changed its tone completely, and there is 

no explanation for what is different or what is the 

reason for adopting that particular view. The fact is 

that the reading of that is so fundamentally at odds 

with the way the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They said that. They gave 

the reason for their current belief. They said even 

when it is used just as a swear word or as an expletive, 

the reason it has its impact is precisely because it 

refers to these excretory or sexual activities; that's 

what -- that's what gives -- gives it its zing.

 MR. PHILLIPS: This Court expressly said in 

Cohen v California, in talking about exactly the same 

word, that it cannot plausibly be maintained that this 

vulgar allusion would conjure up such -- up such psychic 

stimulation. And if the Court would say that in 1970, 

it applies with even more force in 2008.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not the 

Commission's position. The Commission's position here 

is not when these words were used, people necessarily

thought of a literal meaning; instead, its position is 

that the reason these words shocked is because of its 

association with the literal meaning. That's a 

different question than what was being addressed in 

Cohen.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, all that Cohen says is 

that you cannot immediately jump -- you -- it wouldn't 

even remotely strike you that the reason the language is 

being used is for its particular sexual meaning.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why -- why do 

you think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or 

force?

 MR. PHILLIPS: The same reason the S-Word 

does; it's because in some circles it is inappropriate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because it is 

associated with sexual or excretory activity. That's 

what gives it its -- its force.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, I -- to say that, I 

suppose you can say it, but I don't understand on what 

basis. There is no empirical support for that. There's 

no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there is.

that remotely suggests that.

-- instead of the F-Word.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: People use all kinds of 

euphemisms for it, and nobody blinks about it. The 

point is -- is that for 20-some years the Commission 

didn't draw that inference, didn't reach that conclusion 

and nothing has changed over those 20-some years.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, one thing has 

changed. One thing has changed, I think, from the 

record. And let me ask you whether if the Commission 

had given this explanation it would in your judgment 

satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard?

 What if the Commission said, you know, our 

touchstone under prong 1 is community broadcast 

standards. And we have assumed over the years that 

people really didn't get too exercised by the usage we 

have permitted. But we are now getting all this mail 

from people who are very angry about it, and they find 

it extremely offensive. And therefore, I guess our 

prior community broadcast standards were wrong. We 

weren't taking into consideration the way people 

actually felt. Now we know how they felt, because of 

the mail we are getting and we are changing our policy 

for that reason.

of that, in the matter of arbitrary and capricious 

standards, would it satisfy it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think it probably would, if 

all you are doing is looking at just the sort of raw 

Administrative Procedure Act standard, as it would 

normally apply to non-content.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the raw APA standard 

issue is what we've got here.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I don't think 

that's a fair way to -- to look at this case. Because I 

don't see how you can -- it seems to me a completely 

artificial inquiry to look at this as you're regulating 

the price of oil going through a pipeline. At the end 

of the day you are regulating the content of speech, and 

therefore the First Amendment ought to inform 

everybody's assessment of what can the Commission do as 

it moves --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's --

MR. PHILLIPS: In a more content-restrictive 

way.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's the case, then 

the concept of constitutional avoidance is -- is somehow 

out of this case and similar First Amendment cases, 

because we are always going to -- and I -- when you say 

you really cannot separate that precisely, we were

always going to be getting into the constitutional 

issue, either expressly because we accept your view or 

covertly because we said, boy, we know what's around the 

corner. And so, if --

MR. PHILLIPS: But that would only be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we accept your 

argument, we have to change the constitutional avoidance 

doctrine.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think that's 

exactly right, Justice Souter, because the 

constitutional avoidance doctrine is not going to be 

much of a problem obviously unless there is a grave 

constitutional threat. So, it's not every assertion of 

the existence of a constitutional issue that suddenly 

triggers withdrawal.

 When you are dealing in this area, which is 

content regulation and restriction on the basis of 

content, it seems to me that's inherently a First 

Amendment problem. And when you are in that world, then 

it seems to me the agency, even in the APA context, has 

more of a responsibility, or at least the Court should 

say it has more of a responsibility to explain.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought we've held 

that the Court can't engage in such expansion of and 

additions to the Administrative Procedure Act. I

thought that was --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the Administrative 

Procedure Act expressly says --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- one of our landmark 

decisions that what it says, it says, and we cannot add 

additional procedures. You are suggesting we add an 

additional procedure that when it deals with speech, the 

explanation has to be really good.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just --

MR. PHILLIPS: The Administrative Procedure 

Act also says "not in accordance with law," which also 

refers to other statutes and obviously the Constitution. 

So, it's not as though I am asking you to add more to 

what the -- to the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are asking for a higher 

standard than the APA --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I am asking for a higher 

standard under the APA because we are talking about 

content-based restrictions on free speech.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 

consistent with Vermont Yankee?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because it was not talking 

about restrictions on speech, Mr. Chief Justice.

that we add to the APA when we are dealing with a 

particular area. Which of our cases --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which of our cases 

supports that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: This Court hasn't had to hold 

that in any particular context, but the reality is, as a 

logical matter, if you are thinking about -- you know, 

there is an -- a restriction on "in accordance with 

law." The First Amendment is obviously with law, so you 

have that limitation. And then you have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe sometime 

MR. PHILLIPS: And in order to avoid those 

issues --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to be in a 

position to argue your constitutional issue, but we 

can't assume that you are right on the Constitution in 

applying the APA.

 MR. PHILLIPS: All I'm saying is that it 

seems to me a remarkably artificial inquiry, to look at 

this as if you are regulating the price of oil going 

through, to a pipeline as opposed to what you are

to the lower court about that. You should have said, 

please don't decide this on the APA issue. This is a 

First Amendment case. You should reach the 

constitutional issue.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you went on the APA 

issue, and then you come up here and say: I don't want 

to -- I don't want to discuss the APA; I want to 

discuss, you know, the First Amendment.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Scalia, I am 

perfectly content to talk about the APA, because at the 

end of the day, the APA --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The APA simpliciter; not 

the APA, you know --

MR. PHILLIPS: I like the more complicated 

version, but I am happy to deal with the simpliciter one 

as well.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: But the reality that goes 

back to Justice Breyer's question, at the end of the day 

the important part of this is what explains this 

fundamental shift.

 Now, I think Justice Souter, you know, has 

probably made a respectable argument on APA grounds.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But unfortunately that's not 

the position that the FCC took.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He does good stuff now and 

then.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: I have nothing but the 

highest regard for him.

 But the other -- the other part of this case 

that seems to have gotten lost track of is that this is 

not a statute that -- that the Commission has the 

responsibility to enforce. This is a criminal statute. 

This is section 1464. And through section 503, the 

Commission doesn't have broad-based discretion to define 

for itself these terms. The Commission has to decide 

what is indecent within the meaning of a Federal 

criminal statute, which means we are entitled to the 

rule of lenity, which means we are entitled to an 

interpretation of that first prong which, in dealing 

with indecency, says that it has to describe or depict 

sexual activity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you talk 

about the rule of lenity, I mean, the point is that this 

change -- if there is a change in policy or whether it's 

adequately explained -- simply gets you in the door.

They say then, once you are there, we just look at all 

of the circumstances and the context. So, we don't --

it seems to me in their enforcement decisions, their 

decision not to impose sanctions, their decision not to 

have this count against you in future proceedings, they 

are being very lenient.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, they are being lenient 

in one sense. I think you have to step back, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and recognize what the -- what we've 

got here. We are talking about an extraordinary in 

terrorem regime that the FCC has created. And I would 

commend to you all the amicus briefs from the NAB, from 

the former FCC officials, and from others who describe 

in exquisite detail the chilling effect that this 

particular scheme may have.

 To be sure, you know, Fox isn't being 

immediately penalized by this, but to go back to 

Justice Breyer's question of General Garre, what he said 

-- you know, does everybody have everything on tape and 

delaying? No, of course not. And why not? Because it 

may be one thing for Fox to be able to put a show like 

this on a delayed basis, but if you are dealing with a 

local television station that is just getting by 

hand-to-mouth, and they want to televise a football 

game, and in the middle of that football game some

student decides to express himself in ways that 

nobody anticipated --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this is where 

the context comes in. At least with impressionable 

children, that's dramatically different from saying here 

is an awards show, here is a celebrity, I want to listen 

to what they are going to say because I listen to their 

music, and he comes out with that, as opposed to a 

football. They know that, you know, somebody says a bad 

word in the middle of the interview. The context makes 

all the difference in the world.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure that -- I 

mean, I don't remember the FCC being in a position to 

describe how children are able to perceive one set of 

uses of the word as opposed to another set of uses of 

the word. But what I think this Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They perceive that. 

They know. I mean, it's one thing to use the word in, 

say, Saving Private Ryan, when your arm gets blown off. 

It's another thing to do it when you are standing up at 

an awards ceremony.

 MR. PHILLIPS: You can't seriously believe 

that the average nine-year-old, first of all, who is 

probably more horrified by the arm being blown off to 

begin with, but putting that aside, you -- it cannot

possibly be that the child has more of a reaction to 

that word in that context than if a young high school 

football player is running down the field screaming a 

particular expletive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- the young 

football player is not a celebrity that they follow.

 MR. PHILLIPS: The young high school player 

actually might be more of a celebrity in some 

communities than -- at least than where I live, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The point is whether 

they are or not is the contextual determination that the 

FCC can undertake. All they are saying is that just 

because it's used once doesn't mean you are out of the 

-- out of the woods altogether. Let's look at it, and 

if it turns out there's no -- I mean, this is the point 

they make, that in one context, it's completely 

gratuitous; in the other context, it's not.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But the problem is, 

Mr. Chief Justice, once you open the door, then you end 

up with all of the vagueness and overbreadth problems 

that are inherent in this regime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: These arguments apply not 

just to the isolated, once-upon-a-time use, but even to 

continued use. You could say the same thing about just 

filling a program with these expletives, right?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not, I suppose, what 

you are arguing against here, is it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, because the point we are 

making here is that we haven't asked this Court to 

revisit Pacifica. And the point is that when you move 

away from Pacifica, which is the verbal shock treatment 

formulation, and say, you know, that's perfectly 

consistent with the First Amendment and with everything 

that agency decisionmaking requires, and say that's all 

right -- when you shift from that, which is an enormous 

switchover, and go into fleeting expletives, then it's a 

fundamental -- all we're saying is that's a 

fundamentally different issue and that implicates more 

serious First Amendment issues, because everybody knows 

what is something that is verbal shock treatment or at 

least we know how to stay pretty far away from it; 

whereas, if I say every fleeting expletive potentially 

exposes every broadcaster to $325,000 fines made solely 

at the discretion of five individuals, unelected, that

problem, and one that just follows naturally,


Mr. Chief Justice, from saying, well, all we are going


to do is open the door. Because once you open the door,


it is clearly a Pandora's box we are talking about.


 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why do your 

clients not use these words between 10:00 p.m. and 

6:00 a.m.?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because it affects audience 

share. There are some people --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you think it 

affects audience share?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because some people are 

offended it; not the whole community. There are 

probably a lot of people who would actually prefer to 

have more of it. But some --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you can take that 

into consideration, why can't the FCC make the same 

determination, that there may be some people offended by 

this, and if there are some people, as part of our 

statutory responsibility, we are going to look at it. 

Not that they automatically impose --

MR. PHILLIPS: But that's a heckler's veto.

automatically impose a sanction, but that they're going 

to look at it.

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, that's a 

heckler's veto, and there have been long holdings in 

this Court that suggest simply pandering to one small 

segment of the population is no way to enforce First 

Amendment rights. So that's -- I mean, that's my 

primary answer to that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There goes Pacifica.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think there goes 

Pacifica, because Pacifica was only one person --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a heckler's 

veto?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. What --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if people like, you 

know, going on and on with expletives and offensive 

words? Are those of us who are offended by that 

hecklers and you can't take our positions into account 

because you're giving effect to a heckler? I mean -- I 

don't think so.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But the problem is that the 

Chief Justice's question was: Why do we have a 24-hour 

rule.

 And the answer is: It's one thing for us to 

voluntarily assume that. I think it is a mistake, and I

don't know that -- and I don't think -- I didn't read 

anything in the Commission's opinion that reflects it. 

But they say that fact suddenly defines the community 

standards for purposes of what is indecent and what is 

not indecent. That simply reflects our own best 

judgment about how to serve our audience.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If there is -- if there is 

a change in the community standards, does that justify a 

change in the FCC's policies?

 And the second question and the reason I ask 

that is: Do you think today the community generally is 

more offended by these words or more tolerant of these 

words --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as compared to what 

Pacifica was concerned with?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean I -- I believe that 

society is significantly more tolerant of these words 

today than it was in -- 30 years ago.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think your clients 

have had anything to do with that?

things, probably very, very little to do with that 

compared to the way the language is used. Go to a

baseball game, Justice Scalia. You hear these words 

every -- every time you go to a ballgame.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You do, indeed, but you 

don't have them presented as something that is -- is 

normal in polite company, which is what happens when it 

comes out in -- in television shows. This is a 

coarsening of manners that is -- that is produced by --

by the shows. So I am -- you know, I -- I am not 

persuaded by the argument that people are more 

accustomed to hearing these words than they were in the 

past.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But the -- I mean I think 

what Justice Stevens is getting at is: What has changed 

over the last 30 years? And if anything has changed, it 

would be exactly the opposite, which is they are going 

to be more and more tolerant of this language; not that 

they are less tolerant of this language. And, 

therefore, there is even less reason for the Commission 

to have taken the position that it did in this 

particular context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: More tolerant or more used 

to hearing it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think both.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Candidly, I think there is 

a difference.

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I am not saying there 

is not a difference, but I am suggesting that there are 

-- that the -- that the change over time has -- has made 

this less of a compelling argument than it would have 

been, at least in my judgment, in -- in 1978.

 I would like to make a couple of different, 

additional points. Another thing that has changed since 

1978 is that there is much more opportunity for parents 

to control access for their children because of the V-

clip. That's available.

 Second, in terms of this effort to try to 

lessen the coarsening of America --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that works. 

I haven't looked at the statistics on one-parent 

families, working parents, and so forth. Those factors 

both have to be considered.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, but if you put in a 

V-chip, it doesn't matter whether your parents are 

working or not. The truth is if you had had a V-chip 

for the 2003 version of this, which would have said PGL, 

which is for language, children couldn't have gotten on 

there whether the parents were at home or not. The 

V-chip is a usable and feasible technology and is a less 

restrictive alternative than the one that we have on the 

-- on the table under these particular circumstances.

The -- I wanted to go back to the -- to the 

statute, the fact that this is a criminal statute. 

Again, the Commission is not arguing here for broad --

recognizing, or accepting, or arguing for, that they 

have a broad delegation of authority. They don't have 

the authority to decide what indecency is.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And you were -- you were 

pursuing the practical thing about the tapes, and so 

forth, when you got on to a different subject, which was 

the -- the nature of the program. I just wanted to be 

certain you are finished with what you wanted to say 

there. I -- because I am interested in the practical 

question of: Do all the stations have tapes? And leave 

sports events out of it, and leave news out of it. Are 

there other events that these small stations might want 

to cover that don't have the tape or that now don't use 

the tape; anything else you want to say about that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: I am interested in the 

practical problem as part of this. Where do I look to 

find out some facts?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the NAB amicus brief 

actually has a pretty good description of a variety of 

different instances in which this has -- has occurred. 

And, of course, the NAB represents obviously the large

networks but also all of the individual stations. And 

that, to me at least, makes a compelling argument that 

you -- you cannot simply have one rule that says: Let's 

just impose additional costs on everybody. Because the 

answer to that is that those stations will simply refuse 

to broadcast.

 And to me the best illustration of it, and 

the one that the public interest, I would hope, would 

command or demand the Court take account of, is the 

Vermont public station that refused to broadcast a 

debate or -- or allow a number of Senatorial candidates 

to participate in a debate because that candidate had 

used expletives in a previous public forum, and, 

therefore, didn't think it could allow that broadcast 

and take that risk because it can't afford to have the 

tape-delayed technology that you are talking about.

 And -- and that to me is the quintessential 

example. But there are loads of them, and it's just 

going to get worse once you decide to get past the 

notion that a fleeting expletive, no matter how it 

arises, requires to you justify it.

 Because we went from a system that said: We 

will, in general, never condemn fleeting expletives to 

the system that exists now, which is we routinely 

condemn them unless we think its okay. And that's a

system, it seems to me, this Court ought not to 

countenance. It is embedded in the Second Circuit's 

decision.

 The Court should affirm that decision and 

vacate back to the Commission so that it can go forward 

-- or to remand back to the Commission so it can do the 

best it can to try to come up with a justification that 

satisfies both the APA and the First Amendment that it 

has not done so far.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, this --

this is similar to the question that I asked General 

Garre. The Commission asked for a remand so it could 

provide a reasoned explanation. But you had or your 

clients had -- in their complaint they made an APA claim 

as well as a First Amendment claim, didn't they?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, we did.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean it wasn't a complaint. 

Actually, it was -- it was a petition for review --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Correct.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- going right to the Second 

Circuit.

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You could have just done 

the First Amendment, but you -- you did put the APA into 

it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We --

we do believe that the Commission changed its position, 

and -- and, again, we had to file a separate petition 

for review from the remand order over and above the 

petition for review we filed from the first order.

 So, you know, we took into account this 

assessment in saying we don't think the agency had 

adequately justified its change in position.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, 

Mr. Phillips? I guess in the -- in the last analysis we 

are trying to decide what the word "indecent" means.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And do you think that the 

word "indecent" can have -- that -- that a fleeting 

expletive could be not indecent, but the same words 

could be indecent if they are repeated several times?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think it -- at least to me 

it's hard. I don't think so, but I -- I can understand 

that Pacifica could be read that way, although in 

pacifica, itself, George Carlin does, in fact, use the 

fleeting expletive in an explicitly sexual way at -- at 

times.

But I -- I think the hardest case, candidly, 

is the situation where you have a string of expletives, 

all of which are clearly not designed to reflect 

anything about sexual activity and what you do in that 

situation. That is the hardest case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I -- I am not --

not sure I make my question as clear as I should. If we 

are trying to define the term "indecent" --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- does the -- does the 

number of times the word is used in a particular context 

make a difference in the definition?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I apologize. I didn't -- I 

misunderstood your question. No, I don't think so. I 

think the question -- the first prong of the indecency 

inquiry is whether or not the particular language used 

does, in fact, describe or depict sexual or excretory 

activities or organs. And that's the No. 1 inquiry. 

And I don't think the number of times in which you use 

it affects the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: As a matter of statutory 

definition, if a particular word can describe those 

activities, it is equally indecent if used for a 

different purpose?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I would have thought

that, since you were dealing with a statute that is --

that imposes criminal sanctions, that if you have those 

two alternative interpretions available, you have to 

choose the one that is more favorable to the defendant. 

And, therefore, you would -- you would say that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would not be indecent. 

That is the interpretation --

MR. PHILLIPS: I am sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you should accept. 

Let's say because one interpretation of an ambiguous 

word would not be indecent, you are saying the rule of 

lenity in that sort of approach would require in a 

criminal case to just adopt that -- that definition?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That would be my argument, 

yes, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- I mean you are 

just -- correct me if I am wrong, but your colloquy with 

Justice Stevens sort of is a way of phrasing the issue 

in the case. Because you are saying, I think, prior to 

this -- prior to the change, the Commission interpreted 

"indecency" in terms of indecent practice. And what the 

Commission is now doing is defining "indecency" in terms 

of the meaning of a word. It's -- it's relatively going 

from saying indecency is a practice, i.e., a repetition 

of certain kinds of words, to saying "indecency" is --

is the use of any word which is itself indecent.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I agree with that 

completely, Justice Souter. No. That is exactly how 

you can characterize it. I mean it may not be the 

precise verbal formulation we used, but, candidly, that 

is it and essentially the way Judge Lebal looked at it. 

And he just said at the end of the day, because I have 

to defer to the agency, I am going to let them have that 

interpretation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is not the 

appropriate approach.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask about deferring 

there. You seem to be suggesting that since there is a 

criminal penalty for a violation of this statute, the 

agency has no role in -- in defining what -- what the 

terms of the statute mean.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, the language 

of the statute itself would suggest that, because the 

statute says that the Commission may find violate -- may 

impose certain enforcement actions for people who 

violate section 1464. That, of course, is a criminal 

statute.

 Therefore, it is not a statute that has been 

delegated to the agency's broad discretion to decide 

what falls within that language. It is within the

agency's discretion to choose a penalty that, in fact, 

enforces that criminal dictate.

 And to go back to Justice Stevens's 

position -- I shouldn't give it as your position, it is 

my position -- but the point, I think, we were 

discussing, if you have a choice of two ways to read 

indecency, you have to read it in a way more favorable 

to the defendant, that precludes the approach that the 

government has taken in this particular case.

 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor, I would reserve.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Phillips.

 General Garre you have two minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 First, Justice Scalia, it's on page 82-A of 

the petition appendix where the Commission acknowledges 

the change in the order at issue in this case.

 Justice Breyer, going back to your question 

about whether the Commission's definition of indecency 

has changed, it is not and that is made clear at page 

73-A of the petition appendix where the Commission says,

quote, a long line of precedence indicates that the use 

of the F-Word for emphasis or as an intensifier comes 

within the subject matter scope of our indecency 

definition.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It explained -- I mean, the 

change I saw was that previously the use of these words 

as a swear was treated differently from the use of these 

words as a description. And that after the event, it's 

not treated differently.

 GENERAL GARRE: It explains on page 74 why 

the Commission has determined that these words are 

indecent. The Commission has only treated those literal 

uses of these words as potentially indecent under its 

contextual analysis.

 We think that Justice Ginsburg's decision 

for the D.C. Circuit in the Action for Children's 

Television case provides a road map for resolving this 

case, where the Court separately addressed the APA 

question of whether the agency had provided a reasonable 

explanation and then separated out the constitutional 

issues, which this Court need not address.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask one question 

that just occurred to me? Do you think the use of the 

word dung, D-U-N-G, would be indecent?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think it would probably

qualify under the subject matter definition, but it 

probably wouldn't be patently offensive under community 

standards for broadcasting.

 The one thing that can't be disputed -- in 

this case is that the F-Word is patently offensive under 

community standards for the broadcast medium. This 

Court has reversed the decision below on the APA 

question presented and remand the case for consideration 

under --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have the F-Word in 

there too, and even Judge Leval says he didn't 

understand why that word should be on the list.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, we certainly think 

that under community standards that that word is 

patently offensive as well. And certainly, but we think 

that the F-Word itself is clearly patently offensive. 

We think that the S-Word is patently offensive. This 

Court did so -- we think had that view in the Pacifica 

case as well, because that, of course, is one of the 

seven dirty words at issue in that case.

 If there are no further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
