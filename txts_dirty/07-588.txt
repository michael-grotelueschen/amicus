 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

v. Riverkeeper Incorporated, and the consolidated cases.

 Mr. Joseffer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

 PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL.,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For more than 30 years, EPA has construed 

the Clean Water Act to permit it to consider the 

relationship between costs and benefits in setting 

limits on water intake. The court of appeals' 

unprecedented limitation of that discretion is wrong as 

a matter of basic Chevron interpretive principles for at 

least three reasons.

 First, the controlling statutory standard, 

which looks to the best technology available for 

minimizing adverse environmental impacts, is ambiguous 

and does not preclude EPA's interpretation, especially 

in light of the statute's other "best technology" 

provisions, two of which expressly require consideration

of the relationship between costs and benefits.

 Second, there is no indication that Congress 

determined for itself that the benefits of stricter 

regulations would in fact outweigh their costs. 

Instead, from the context -- I'm sorry, for -- I'm 

sorry. There is no indication in either the context or 

the history of the statute that Congress determined for 

itself that the benefits of stricter regulations would 

in fact justify their costs. Instead the indication is 

that Congress left that to the agency.

 Congress took a very careful look at the 

separate issue of the discharge of pollutants and 

legislated numerous very specific provisions concerning 

the discharge of pollutants. But when it came to water 

intake, the Congress gave scant attention to that at all 

and included only this one very general provision in the 

act on that subject.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, in the 

other provision it specifically required consideration 

of costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this 

provision.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. In our view, that 

strongly supports our view that, first, Congress 

understood that consideration of cost and benefits was 

not incompatible with the application of a best

technology standard. Otherwise it would not have 

required that consideration as part of the best quality 

standard, which seems to show at a minimum that a best 

technology standard does not unambiguously foreclose 

consideration of the relationship between costs and 

benefits.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to follow up 

on that, because your statement about compatibility 

raises what for me is a fundamental difficulty in 

understanding this case. And I think my difficulty goes 

both to Chevron step one and step two. And that is 

this: I think we all start from the premise that, 

whatever else subsection (d) had in mind, it was 

imposing some kind of a technology-driven standard 

criterion. It's there in the words.

 The difficulty that I have is if you are 

going to apply on at least a site-specific basis a cost 

benefit analysis, I'm not sure how it would work. In 

other words, it seems to me that when you're talking 

about the possible harm from pulling in a few fish or a 

few plankton or a few baby clam larvae and so on, as 

against the cost conceivably of millions of dollars for 

extending intake pipes or putting technical expensive 

filtering mechanisms, you are dealing with such 

incommensurables that I don't know how on a site-

specific basis you would sensibly apply a cost-benefit 

analysis. Are a thousand plankton worth a million 

dollars? I don't know.

 And my difficulty then is, I don't know how 

it would work. And because I don't know how it would 

work, it seems to me that if you are going to apply a 

cost-benefit analysis, the odds are what you are going 

to do is basically eliminate the whole technology-driven 

point of the statute. So that's my difficulty. Can you 

help me out on that?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Two points on that. The 

first is that this is how it's always been done. I 

mean, since 1977 at least, first permitting decisions 

have always been done on a facility by facility, case by 

case basis.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we know so far as intake 

pipes are concerned? I mean, maybe I'm being foolish in 

thinking it's a little easy to make sense of it when 

we're talking about toxic discharges, but leaving that 

aside, do we know that, with respect to these kind of 

intake technology decisions, that the cost-benefit 

analysis has been in any way sensible? In other words, 

maybe what Congress had in mind was this just doesn't 

work doing it on a site-specific cost-benefit analysis 

and that's why we're going to pass subsection (b) in the

first place. So you say, well, we've had experience 

with cost-benefit analysis. What's the experience?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Sure. I guess now I have 

three points.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: The first is that -- the 

first is that the history here is, that I was referring 

to, is with respect to cooling water intake structures, 

where for more than 30 years cooling water intake 

structures have been determined on a case by case basis, 

where EPA determined as early as 1977 and ever since 

that it would be unreasonable to impose -- to require 

the use of technology whose costs were wholly 

disproportionate to its benefits.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And have these been 

applications of something more than the outside 

standard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in 

a case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or 

outrageously disproportionate there wouldn't be -- that 

there would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff? 

These have been more subtle decisions than that?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And I mean, just the 

phrasing of the standard, whether costs are wholly 

disproportionate to benefits, itself indicates that 

there is a comparison here. We cite in our brief one

particular -- in our reply brief, one specific example 

where benefits were clearly not de minimus.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Second Circuit 

recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs 

disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and 

they also recognized a cost comparison. If you have a 

cheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that 

and you don't have to use the one that will capture the 

extra fish. So everybody agrees that there is some 

consideration of cost. The question is how much, and 

the concern is, as Justice Souter says, that you are 

comparing things that aren't comparable.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, first off -- I'm sorry. 

I guess one basic point is just that -- first off, 

excuse me, in terms of the court of appeals' recognition 

that costs and benefits could be compared in extreme 

circumstances, that just deprives it of the logic of its 

position, because when we talk about the extent or 

degree or manner to which a permissible consideration 

can be considered that's a classic manner for the 

agency's gap-filling discretion, not something for the 

court of appeals or Respondents to get discretion on.

 And, second, in terms of the concern that 

the cost-benefit analysis can be difficult because we're 

comparing benefits that are not easily monetized to

economic costs, that is just systematically the case 

with all cost-benefit analyses, even ones which people 

do in ordinary life. When I decide whether to buy a TV 

for this amount or a more expensive TV for a different 

amount, I don't know exactly how in my head I quantify 

that, but I do. And with respect to cost-benefit --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it easier to quantity 

that than the value of a plankton?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Not -- well -- but with cost-

benefit analyses, again, this is routinely done by 

agencies. The statisticians and the economists --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It is -- let me -- I will 

grant you that agencies purport to do this kind of 

thing. But my question and I think Justice Ginsburg's 

question is, does it make any sense in these 

circumstances to think that you really can do a cost-

benefit analysis? And if the answer is no, we have been 

purporting to do it but it really doesn't make a lot of 

sense, then it either means that there is just going to 

be an irrational process going on, or it means that the 

technology-driven standard basically is going to be read 

right out of the statute, because you are always going 

to find some disproportion which is going to limit your 

use of technology.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think the most irrational

thing would be to just throw up one's hands and say that 

we are going to impose standards whether or not they do 

harm more harm than good, whether or not they make any 

sense. And -- and here the agency very carefully 

considered the relative costs and the relative benefits 

and also did so in a way that puts its thumb on the side 

of the environmental side of the scales.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to get back 

to your television hypothetical, if you told somebody 

that you were going to buy the best TV available nobody 

would think you meant that you were going to buy a very 

cheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits, 

that was the best one. They would think you are going 

to get the fanciest TV you could.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, these words have 

different meanings in different contexts, which just 

underscores their ambiguity. But taking the phrase here 

as a whole, if I said I was going to acquire the best 

technology available for winterizing my lawnmower so 

that it would work again in the spring, the best 

technology available for winterizing a $400 lawnmower 

would not be $500 fluid, because when one's talking 

about protecting something it's intuitive to think about 

the value of what's being protected.

 And again, Congress by expressly requiring

cost-benefit analysis for some of the pollution 

discharge limits was expressly contemplating exactly 

what seems to concern you, Justice Ginsburg --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it make any 

difference --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- that costs would be traded 

against benefits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have the two labels: 

The BP, "best practical," and then "best available." 

And isn't it so that the best available technology, 

thinking of the Clean Air Act, what they call "BAT," is 

considered the most technology-forcing standard and then 

there are lesser standards? But you seem to think that 

these can be --

MR. JOSEFFER: All of these words can have 

different meanings. I think of the four best technology 

provisions that are expressly cross-referenced in this 

provision, the one that's most informative here is the 

best conventional pollutant control technology, because 

Congress expressly required cost-benefit consideration 

in determining the best conventional pollutant control 

technology and "best" is the only word in that phrase 

that is amenable to a cost-benefit reading.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think maybe what 

Justice Ginsburg was beginning to get at is my question

here. I assume that BTA is the most rigorous of the 

standards set forth in the statute. You can argue with 

that assumption, but grant me the assumption for the 

moment. If BTA is more rigorous than the other 

standards, what is it in the regulations that reflects 

the agency's concurrence with that? What is there in 

the agency regulations that indicates that there is a 

more rigorous examination under BTA than the other 

standards?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, to be clear, the agency 

does not think and therefore did not in its regulation 

presume that the best technology available for 

minimizing adverse environmental impact was more strict 

than the other standards. Just two commonsense points 

on that. The pollutant discharge standards, which are 

the other ones, establish their goal to be the 

elimination of discharges, whereas here this provision 

says that its goal is to minimize. So on its face this 

is a more measured standard than the others.

 And, second, as a practical matter, there is 

no reason Congress would want greater protection for 

fish through intake structures than for people through 

the discharge of pollutants. I mean especially --

Congress enacted all of these provisions in 1972, and it 

provided at that time that in determining pollution

discharge, even including toxic pollution discharge, EPA 

was required to consider the relationship between cost 

and benefits up until 1989.

 And it makes no sense to think that Congress 

would have wanted stricter standards for fish here than 

for people under the toxic discharge provisions. And on 

its face --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you disagreeing with 

the premise of Justice Kennedy's question?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Our argument is that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think --

JR. JOSEFFER: -- this provision here for 

water intact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Congress intended a 

tougher standard?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Pardon?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You do not think Congress 

intended a tougher standard; is that true?

 MR. JOSEFFER: We think Congress did not 

intend this to be a tougher standard than the ones for 

discharge of pollutants --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why didn't it use BPT or 

-- or one -- one of the other standards?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, because these are all 

different standards. One thing that -- two thing are

for certain. One is that this standard is different 

than all of the others --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they are different, 

then one is either less rigorous or more rigorous.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. But there is no 

reason to presume this one is more rigorous, especially 

considering -- first -- I mean, the words here -- it 

uses important words here it did not use elsewhere.

 Here we have "best technology available" --

"best technology available for minimizing adverse 

environmental impact." And, first, "best," as some of 

the examples earlier demonstrated, is not necessarily 

the way that most singlemindedly pursues a goal at all 

costs and without regard to all of the consequences, 

which is why -- for example, if you were talking about 

the best way to get home, it would not necessarily be 

the most direct route if that required payment of a 

toll.

 Similarly, "minimize" is also an -- and, 

again, Congress used "best" to mean that in "best 

conventional pollutant control technology," because that 

is the only word there that is amenable to our reading.

 And, second, "minimize" is also an important 

word, because "minimize" has two perfectly common and 

ordinary meanings. One is to reduce to the greatest

extended possible. The other in ordinary usage is to 

reduce to some lesser, reasonable level.

 So if I said, for example, that I was trying 

to minimize the risk of being hit by a car today, I 

presumably would not mean that I was staying inside at 

home all the time. Instead, it would mean that, 

consistent with other needs, including economic ones, 

like the need to travel to work, I was being prudent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if it "available to 

reduce"? "For minimizing" is no stronger than if it had 

said "available" -- if it meant what you suggest, why 

didn't it read "available to reduce"?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, elsewhere in the Clean 

-- in the Clean Water Act, Congress clearly did use 

"minimize" to mean a reduction. If Congress called for 

a, quote, "drastic minimization of paperwork," Section 

33 U.S. Code 1251(f), then a "drastic minimization" has 

to mean a drastic reduction, which is a perfectly 

ordinary meaning of the word.

 "Available" is also relevant because, 

Justice Ginsburg, as you mentioned earlier --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Reduce" in any event is --

is not -- is not the same as what you are arguing. You 

are arguing reduce to the maximum extent reasonably 

possible. The word "reduce" alone doesn't convey that.

The word "reduce" would just mean, you know, if you --

if you knock it down any amount, you have reduced it.

 But you are saying "minimize" requires more 

than that. It means reducing it to the maximum extent 

reasonably possible. Isn't that what you are saying?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No. We -- we construe -- I 

think the other side might take that view of -- of 

"minimize." Our view is that "minimize" means you have 

to reduce --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just to reduce.

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- a reasonable -- refers to 

a reasonable reduction. And so some minimal reduction 

in this context would probably not be reasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that to 

be your position. You -- you don't think that 

"minimize" even means that you reduce it to the maximum 

extent reasonably possible?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, I guess it depends --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think any reduction 

constitutes minimizing?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, because it does have to 

be a reasonable reduction, which would not be -- in this 

context would not be a trivial one. Reasonableness --

we may -- we may agree, depending on what one means by 

"reasonable." "Reasonableness" tends to connote a

consideration of -- of all relevant factors.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: And so when we're talking 

about a reasonable reduction, we are going to talk about 

a reduction that is reasonable in light of, among other 

things, the relationship between costs and benefits. So 

we may agree if that's what we both mean by 

"reasonableness."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me say it again and you 

tell me whether you agree. I had thought that what you 

meant the meaning of "minimize" was is that you reduce 

the -- the harm to the maximum extent reasonably 

possible, not merely that you reduce it to some extent.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think that's right with --

with "reasonably" entailing a consideration of -- of the 

relationship between costs and benefits.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, "reasonable" 

includes everything.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes.

time for rebuttal.

stage here. For almost 30 years now, the Executive 

Branch has had an executive order through all 

administrations that requires a cost-benefit analysis to 

be done whenever regulations are adopted. And that's 

because the Executive Branch considers that to be just 

an essential component of reasoned decisionmaking.

 So this Court should not be quick to 

conclude that Congress intended to deprive the agency of 

the tools that it needs to come up with reasoned answers 

to these vexing problems in the absence -- -

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this is 

a Chevron case?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it is a Chevron case, 

Your Honor. And we think -- certainly think it could be 

resolved under step one, meaning the following: Can you 

read the statute reasonably to say that Congress 

unambiguously foreclosed cost-benefit analysis under 

316(b)? I think the answer to that is no.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the -- one 

question I have on this is if I look at the two 

standards -- and the first one is "best practical" -- it 

talks about cost-benefit. It says you shall consider

the total cost of application of technology in relation 

to the effluent-reduction benefits.

 Then you look at "best available," and 

they've changed the phrase. It doesn't get rid of cost, 

but it simply says you shall take into account the cost 

of achieving such effluent reduction.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, but that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: So they both use the word 

"cost."

 MS. MAHONEY: They do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you look at what 

Senator Muskie said at the time.

 MS. MAHONEY: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And what Senator Muskie 

said at that time is the object here is when we move to 

better -- to better technology, we -- you know, when you 

get past the practical and you get into the other, it 

says -- stop considering costs? Not quite. He says: 

"While costs should be a factor in the administrator's 

judgment." So he is not against using costs. He says 

that you have to do it under a reasonableness standard 

where you are taking into account all the goals and so 

forth.

 Now, that's ambiguous. But, as I read it, 

it says: Of course you can't avoid taking into account

costs, but don't do it too much.

 And, therefore, you would say: Don't apply 

one of these big formal things when you reach your final 

goal. There are other ways of getting there. Of 

course, see that it isn't absurd. And for 30 years the 

agency has had a way. It has talked about "grossly 

disproportionate."

 Now, that's the whole background to the 

question. My question is, of course: Why not let 

sleeping dogs lie? Let the agency take it into account 

the way it's done it to prevent absurd results, but not 

try to do it so that it's so refined you can't even take 

account of what a fish is worth unless they happen to be 

one of the 1.2 percent that goes to market.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, we are not 

arguing that you have to do monetized cost-benefit 

analysis, nor did the agency say that it was basing its 

rule on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine. Then what are 

you arguing? Are you arguing that you should take costs 

into account? Because I don't think -- or I don't think 

you should reach much disagreement on that point, that 

sometimes you take them into account the way that 

Senator Muskie suggested.

Second Circuit held, and Respondents argue, that the 

benefits have to be essentially the same before you can 

look at the cost of the technology.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well now, what they are 

going to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and 

I would be very interested in hearing it.

 MS. MAHONEY: But that is what they --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then you would be 

satisfied with the following ruling: The Second Circuit 

went too far in saying that you can never take costs 

into account.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can 

sometimes take account of them, and the standard that we 

think is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one 

they have used for 30 years. Is it grossly 

disproportionate? Are you -- is it feasible? Is it 

practical? Are you using costs along with other things? 

How do you feel about some slightly vague thing like 

that?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, something like that, as 

long as it is clear that costs can be --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are happy with that?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, as long as costs can be 

compared to benefits, and the Second Circuit said they

could not be; that the benefits have to be essentially 

the same. That's what "cost-effectiveness analysis" 

means. Of course the statute doesn't say "cost 

effectiveness."

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's simply 

saying the Second Circuit was wrong, the use of the word 

"cost" is meaningless without some idea --

MS. MAHONEY: Of comparison.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of what the costs are 

relevant to, but a -- but a vague, grossly 

disproportionate test is okay with you?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, if --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it or not?

 MS. MAHONEY: A -- a vague, grossly 

disproportionate --

JUSTICE BREYER: The one they used for 30 

years at EPA, is that all right or not all right?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think the point 

is: Yes, if for 30 years they have not been mandating 

closed-cycle cooling under that standing -- standard, so 

from the industry's perspective, that probably is an 

acceptable standard.

 But the real point here is that when we 

start talking about to what degree can you compare the 

costs, is it significantly greater than, is it wholly

disproportionate, that's exactly where Chevron comes in. 

If everyone concludes that you can compare costs to 

benefits, then certainly the agency should have some 

flexibility.

 With respect to the question of whether it 

should be the same standard as the -- what I think 

you're referring to as the B-A-T standard, which governs 

discharges of even toxic pollutants, I think the answer 

to that is that not necessarily by any means, because 

the acronyms are similar but the text isn't. That 

standard actually talks about the goal of eliminating 

discharges. Congress did not say eliminate all 

impingement and entrainment to the country. They could 

have, they didn't.

 They said minimize adverse environmental 

impact, which is necessarily a broad delegation of 

discretion to the agency. In addition, that standard --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, I -- before 

you go any further. I am not clear. I -- I did not 

understand that for 30 years the only test has been a 

grossly disproportionate test. You seem to accept that 

as true.

 MS. MAHONEY: Wholly disproportionate, Your 

Honor, has been the test. That's what has been used.

think what I am happy with is saying that the agency 

should have discretion to formulate what test it's going 

to use. But under the wholly disproportionate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. You think they can 

use a wholly disproportionate?

 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, I do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you'd be happy if they 

continued to do that, but you wouldn't be particularly 

happy if we prescribed that as the only available test? 

Is that the --

MS. MAHONEY: Well, I just think that it's 

hard to get that out of the language. When -- when it 

doesn't come straight out of the language "wholly 

disproportionate," then you ought to leave it to the 

agency. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the -- could the 

agency mandate a closed-cycle system, recirculating 

system --

Could they -- under your view, could the agency, given 

its Chevron latitude, mandate closed circulation?

 MS. MAHONEY: Under a wholly 

disproportionate standard, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just under the statute.

 MS. MAHONEY: Under the statute, I doubt it. 

It would probably be arbitrary and capricious. But --

and -- and let me explain why.

 The statute talks about minimizing adverse 

environmental impact, and it's important to understand 

what the EPA did here. At page 169a of the appendix, 

they say: "We are using impingement and entrainment as 

a quick and convenient metric." In other words, we are 

going to make you reduce impingement and entrainment to 

the -- to a very large extent, get it down, you know, 

close to zero if we can, whatever. But that's not 

because it is itself adverse environmental impact. They 

say they didn't define it at 287a.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it seems to 

me -- of course, there are limits on what the agency can 

do, but if it couldn't mandate the closed circulation 

system -- I think I've got the term right -- if it could 

not do that, then this is not -- you're backing away 

from Chevron.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, here's -- here's how we

would say it, Your Honor. There may be some locations 

where that -- where it would not be wholly 

disproportionate. If -- if for some reason you couldn't 

design an alternative system that would protect, for 

instance, a balanced population of fish in that water 

body, then it might be that -- that -- that 

closed-cycled cooling would be required.

 But on a national basis, at 355a the agency 

said that they understood that reducing impingement and 

entrainment at the ranges they were talking about would 

not be justified in many locations across the country. 

And that's because power plants may be impinging numbers 

of fish that aren't actually harming that water body. 

Fish have the potential to procreate in very substantial 

numbers. Some fish spawn 500,000 eggs in a year. And, 

so, if the -- and throughout the act, even under 316a, 

for instance, Congress has said that, even with respect 

to thermal discharges, you can get variances if you can 

show that you are not harming a balanced population of 

fish in the water body.

 So given that, given the variances 

throughout the act and even these kinds of limits on the 

discharge standards, which are designed to protect human 

health, why would you read the mandate for the maximum 

technology on intake structures which has nothing to do

with human health, nothing. It is just to protect fish 

in the water body.

 So, it doesn't make sense that in a single 

sentence added in conference in a voluminous act about 

discharges of pollutants, that Congress would mandate 

the maximum technology for --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't they use 

the word "cost"?

 MS. MAHONEY: Because, Your Honor, I 

don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, your -- your 

argument is they used cost here, they used cost there, 

they didn't use cost here but they must have meant cost.

 MS. MAHONEY: Here's why, Your Honor: 

Because the most significant comparison between this 

statutory section and the others is they didn't list any 

of the factors. All of the other sections have -- have 

a detailed list of considerations that the agency must 

take into account. This one says nothing. This is not 

an example of where --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And maybe the inference to 

be drawn is the agency is not supposed to be taking any 

of these considerations into account.

 MS. MAHONEY: I -- I don't think that's the 

most reasonable inference because it would lead to very

irrational results, 200-foot cooling towers in -- in --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You've got the -- I mean 

everybody agrees that there is kind of an ultimate 

irrationality standard here. So that's -- that's not --

that -- that kind of a horrible is not really the point.

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

I don't know where in the language you can get allowance 

to take into account things like energy impacts. Why? 

If Congress gave a complete and full standard, why can 

we take into account aesthetic harm, navigational harm, 

energy impact? It doesn't allow for that, and I think 

it doesn't allow for that because Congress intended the 

agency to define the terms in a reasonable way.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. LAZARUS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 In section 316(b), Congress did not 

authorize EPA to decide that the benefits of minimizing 

adverse environmental impact did not justify the cost of 

available technology.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except -- except, you say, 

when it's grossly disproportionate?

 MR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where -- where do 

you find that? Or the Second Circuit said, anyway.

 MR. LAZARUS: Let me explain our position, 

Your Honor. EPA has no authority in any circumstance to 

decide that fish aren't worth a certain amount of cost. 

So EPA never has the authority, in any context, to weigh 

costs against benefits. The reason why we think that 

would not lead to the kind of absurd circumstances 

they're suggesting is not because Congress has that --

sorry -- EPA has that authority. It's because we don't 

think that those kinds of absurd circumstances result 

from the cost-benefit balance mandated by Congress.

 Let me explain why, because there are three 

safeguards in the statutory language, its plain meaning, 

which would guard against any possibility that a 

regulated facility would have to spend millions or 

hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to protect 

just a few fish.

 They would -- that would never happen. I 

mean, it would never happen, but not because EPA can 

decide it's not worth it. This is why it would never 

happen. Three reasons, and these are contributing

reasons.

 The first reason is if you actually had some 

exorbitant huge increase in costs, if that would happen, 

most of those cases would be triggered by the 

availability requirement. And that is, that EPA could 

deem that cost not be reasonably borne by the industry. 

That's the ground they --

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't want to interrupt 

you in your enumeration of three reasons, but I just 

don't see how you get cost into the concept of 

availability. It doesn't fit in there any better than 

it does under "best."

 MR. LAZARUS: No, I think it -- I think it 

fits quite well in the word "available." And EPA has 

said that since 1976. It was not disputed by anyone 

that available --

JUSTICE ALITO: It's not the plain meaning 

of the word. If I look in the real estate page of 

the -- of the "Washington Post" on Sunday and I look for 

the best house that is available, the best house that is 

available might cost $50 million. Now, that would be 

available to me. I couldn't afford it, but it would be 

available.

 I don't see how cost can be fit into that 

concept of availability.

MR. LAZARUS: I think because it's clear 

that in the context of the Clean Water Act what Congress 

meant in available -- and this is throughout the 

statute -- all the technology-based performance 

standards, the availability was both technologically 

available and economically available. And that is not 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are using the word in a 

strange -- economically available? Economically 

feasible maybe. But you wouldn't say economically 

available. You wouldn't say I can't buy the house 

because for me it's not economically available. I might 

say it's not economically feasible, it's not 

economically possible, but it's not economically 

available? That's weird.

 MR. LAZARUS: It may -- it may be weird, 

Your Honor, but it is not anything that has ever been 

disputed in the interpretation of the Water Act. It's 

how EPA has interpreted it for 30 years, and no court, 

no one, has ever disputed the fact that availability 

includes economic availability.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I disagree with that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Availability -- if 

availability includes economic availability, why doesn't 

"best" include economically best?

MR. LAZARUS: Because what the statute says 

is not that EPA should -- should promulgate the best 

technology. It says the best technology available for 

minimizing.

 And what -- what Congress did was told EPA 

what the technology must be best for. And that is not 

reducing it to the amount that EPA believes is sensible. 

It means minimizing it, which means --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- but that -- but 

that doesn't answer, it seems to me, the question. Yes, 

the best available for that purpose, but what is best 

for that purpose could include other factors such as how 

expensive is it and -- and how much it harms the 

industry and all sorts of things.

 MR. LAZARUS: No, it certainly -- it 

certainly includes costs. It certainly includes sort of 

whether it can be reasonably borne by the industry. 

There's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why does it? I don't 

know how you draw the lines you are drawing. You say 

yes, "best" includes whether it would bankrupt the 

industry. Well, if it includes whether it would 

bankrupt the industry, why shouldn't it include whether 

it would bankrupt the individual power company?

no question, Your Honor, that the word "available," and 

perhaps the word "best" -- we think the word "available" 

includes an inquiry into whether or not it could be 

borne by the industry. We also wouldn't doubt, Your 

Honor -- we wouldn't doubt --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I agree with you on 

that, whether it's borne by the industry. But you draw 

the line there.

 MR. LAZARUS: No, that's not what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it where that 

line is drawn up to the agency?

 MR. LAZARUS: We're not, Your Honor -- let 

me explain because I think we are confusing different 

inquiries here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. LAZARUS: We also would agree that EPA 

can take into account site-specific factors in deciding 

whether technology is available. Some technology is 

available for some facilities given their location, but 

not available for other facilities given their location; 

but when -- where EPA decides, right, where EPA decides 

whether technology is available or not, we don't doubt 

they have authority to do that and some discretion to 

decide when technology is no longer available because of 

the cost. But where they don't have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't 

that exactly what they did here in listing what they 

call a suite of technologies or approaches that is 

available? I thought that was exactly what they did. 

They said for different locations, different 

technologies may be the best available.

 MR. LAZARUS: Right. And that is perfectly 

appropriate. But here's what they did which is not 

permitted. They could decide based on site-specific 

factors whether technology is available. What they 

can't do is, once they decide a technology is available, 

they can't then say: But we don't think it's worth 

minimizing adverse environmental impact with that 

technology, because we don't think those benefits are 

worth that cost. That comparison inquiry they can't 

make.

 So if I can do my safeguards: The first one 

is we think availability and cost would eliminate a lot 

of those problems. But let's assume -- let's just 

assume that technology is much more expensive, way more 

expensive, but it's still available in our view. It 

still can be borne by the industry even on a 

site-specific basis, which we don't disagree that could 

be done.

 Then let's say that the national -- EPA says

well, but that will only save -- you know, your cheaper 

technology will only save a million fish. We actually 

think you have to save a million and one fish.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how you can do 

that. I just don't see it. It's -- I mean, suppose 

that the cost of this machine is $100,000. Now, if you 

say I'm talking about using that machine for an entire 

industry, you would say, my God, that is certainly 

available. But here I have just one part of the 

industry here; I have a little plant; and you know, to 

hook that machine up is only going to save one 

paramecium. Neither of us wants that.

 And so the logical thing to say is to say 

well, it isn't available for that. And I would be with 

you there.

 MR. LAZARUS: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: But to be honest about it, 

I would have to say the reason it isn't available is 

quite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the 

harm -- that particular adverse impact which is killing 

a -- a water animal. The reason it isn't is because it 

doesn't kill any water animals. Well, let me be honest;

don't tell me de minimis, because as soon as you say de 

minimis, I'm going to add one, okay?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: But what I'm trying to show 

here is that -- that there -- it isn't meaningful to 

talk about cost being available for an end, without some 

-- about something not being available for an end in 

light of its costs, unless you take into account what 

that end is. I mean, we'd spend trillions to make 

America secure so not 50 thousand people die, but we 

won't spend trillions for a road accident. And -- and 

of course you take those things into account.

 So that's -- that's exactly the point I 

wonder about. Are you really saying pay no attention or 

are you saying, which I could understand better, but you 

have to say what you want, I mean, that what we mean is, 

yes, they can take costs into account. That's what they 

do under the comparable standard, best available 

technology, but just use your head, don't do it too 

much, don't use it -- like take other things into 

account, too, don't do a formal cost-benefit analysis; 

don't try to evaluate the paramecium. Do the difference 

between the -- you know, the two standards: Best 

practical, best available. Do "grossly" or "wholly" or 

something.

MR. LAZARUS: But for best available there 

is no cost-benefit analysis. It's only for best 

practical --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, but best 

available says take costs into account.

 MR. LAZARUS: Right. Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there is a way of 

doing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that 

they have some discretion over, that doesn't involve 

some enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am 

searching for. I don't -- I am not sitting here with an 

answer. I'm trying to find a way of making sense of 

this.

 MR. LAZARUS: But -- well, let me try to 

give you an answer. They can consider costs only in a 

cost feasibility perspective. They cannot compare costs 

to benefits. Congress made --

JUSTICE BREYER: Those two things seem 

contrary to me. I don't see how you could -- do you see 

why?

 MR. LAZARUS: No, I don't, because it is two 

fundamentally different policy decisions. What Congress 

decided in 1972 was that EPA should be allowed to 

consider costs in determining whether technology was 

available, but not -- and they did this for a reason,

Your Honor -- but not to weigh those costs against those 

benefits in deciding whether or not those costs were 

worth it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But how is it -- how is it 

feasible if it has no benefits at all?

 MR. LAZARUS: It -- it -- it's still 

feasible for, in terms of the industry, whether they can 

afford it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then we are going to reach 

our insane results.

 MR. LAZARUS: Yes -- you are never going to 

-- you are never going reach the insane result. It's 

never going to happen, Your Honor. It's never going to 

happen. Put aside the availability limitation, which 

will cut off like it did dry cooling. EPA rejected it 

saying it was too expensive. Not because of the 

cost-benefit: it's too expensive. If you have some --

something where it will only just be saving a few fish 

-- what you have to remember is that 316(b) doesn't 

impose technology design reform. What it imposes is 

that technology-based performance standards. And if EPA 

were to say, you have to save just a few more fish, if 

they really want to promulgate a standard on that kind 

of increment, the regulated facility would always be 

able to save just a small increment, without adopting

some expensive technology, because of the way cooling 

water intake structures work.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your 

argument is focused on proving that your interpretation 

won't lead to insane results, as you put it. But you 

have to do a lot more than that. I mean, you have to 

establish that this is not ambiguous language.

 MR. LAZARUS: Well, I think it's not 

ambiguous language because you look at the statutory 

language, it says -- right? That's in section 316(b) --

EPA is required -- right? Instructed, required, that 

location, design, construction, capacity of cooling 

water intake structures reflect the best technology 

available for minimizing adverse environmental impact. 

And what we argue, and I think this is quite compelling, 

Your Honor, is that with that language Congress itself 

struck the cost-benefit analysis. Congress said for 

costs, EPA has to ensure the technology is available. 

Either on industry wide, and could take site into 

account site-specific factors. For benefits, Congress 

said EPA has to ensure that the environmental benefits 

-- the adverse environmental impact -- be minimized to 

the extent it can be done with available technology.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You have a good -- you have 

a good argument based on the language of the statute, I

think, that that costs cannot be taken into account at 

all.

 MR. LAZARUS: But --

JUSTICE ALITO: At all. But once you 

concede that it can be taken into account at all, then I 

don't see why you were not in Chevron step 2.

 MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, this is a --

JUSTICE ALITO: Once the foot is in the door 

I don't see how you can --

MR. LAZARUS: It's a complete line. Whether 

the word "available" can extend to cost feasibility 

analysis is one question. Whether the word "available" 

can be -- allow EPA to compare costs and benefits, to 

weigh one against the other, that's a completely 

different question. So the fact that we say the first 

half, it doesn't mean the second. Congress really had a 

-- what they were doing in 1972, was Congress --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But our problem is that 

we -- you've got a clear distinction in mind, and I -- I 

don't think we are getting the distinction. Is the 

distinction in crude terms this: they can consider 

costs in the sense that on an industry-wide basis they 

can ask, is there money in the bank or will there be 

money in the bank to pay for this? They don't ask 

cost-benefit in the sense of asking: is the money in

the bank worth what they are going to get for it?

 So is -- is the line you are drawing a money 

in the bank line? Is that the point you are making?

 MR. LAZARUS: No. It's -- it's they can't 

make a judgment that it's not worth it. It's --

JUSTICE ALITO: Right. But --

MR. LAZARUS: And for reasons that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the only question, 

when you say they can consider costs, are you saying 

they are simply asking whether it is economically 

possible for the industry to afford this, regardless of 

whether it's any good or not?

 MR. LAZARUS: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that what --

MR. LAZARUS: Absolutely. What -- 1972, if 

this is what Congress is faced with.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When you say whether the 

industry can afford it, does it take into account at all 

the effect on the that price consumers have to pay? If 

the effect of achieving a small gain in protecting -- uh 

-- fish is to increase electricity costs ten times, is 

that something that cannot be taken into account?

 MR. LAZARUS: If it can be reasonably borne 

by the industry or some site-specific, they can't make 

any other judgment. And if I can, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can't make any other 

judgment. So imagine the consequence of that 

environmentally. They can't make any other judgment. 

Suppose the EPA is right: it's going to add 20 electric 

plants, huge plants, purely to save the fish; and the 

result is the cost of electricity goes up, and the 

result is there are no electric cars, because people 

make the comparison with oil, and now they have to have 

petrol. I mean, it's very hard for me to believe that 

Senator Muskie would have written a statute that would 

have foreseen such an effect.

 MR. LAZARUS: Right. I think because such 

an effect wouldn't happen. What Senator Muskie and 

Congress was worried about in 1972, Your Honor, was they 

were worried about the possible underregulation. They 

worried about overregulation. And their concern was, if 

you gave EPA the authority to weigh costs against 

benefits, you would have systemic underregulation and 

the regulatory process bogged down by --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly where I 

agree with you. So I go back to page 170 of the 

legislative history, which I have read now six times, 

and I agree with you that it is not totally clear. 

Maybe you think it is. But it seems to me what he is 

saying there is just what you've said: Don't go into

this with some elaborate thing, but remember costs are 

still relevant. And what I've been searching for 

throughout is a set of words that would help me 

translate that thought into a legal reality.

 MR. LAZARUS: And going back to Justice 

Souter's statement a moment ago, which I agree with, 

what Senator Muskie's distinction he wanted to draw was 

to allow EPA to engage in cost analysis as to 

feasibility, money in the bank, but not to make that 

value judgment of what's worth what. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you get to 

that money in the bank, does this mean that best 

technology available changes over time? I mean, maybe 

the industry could have borne these costs two years ago, 

but they probably can't today. Nobody has money in the 

bank today.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LAZARUS: It certainly does depend, and 

this is how EPA does it, not just in this area but 

throughout all the technology-based performance 

standards, looking at availability. EPA looks at 

industry revenues, barriers to entry, and decides 

whether or not this technology is available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think they 

could have said, two years ago, this is what you have to

do, but today they would say you don't have to do that 

anymore --

MR. LAZARUS: It's quite possible --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even though the 

technology is still available.

 MR. LAZARUS: Notice -- notice -- not 

economically. Notice in this case, what the Second 

Circuit said in remanding was EPA may be able to justify 

the same decision on availability basis, but they didn't 

make that determination here. What has happened for the 

past 30 years, which is how I -- counsel over here 

posited the case -- what has happened over the last 30 

years is the EPA has ignored the statutory language and 

it engaged in this wholly disproportionate analysis as a 

result, which has led to the very kind of 

underregulation that Senator Muskie was worried about, 

and that is that they had never looked to see whether 

closed-cycle cooling is in fact available, economically 

available. Instead, they tried to compare these things. 

They've just kept from going Phase I through cycle 

cooling. They've never given a serious look at 

closed-cycle cooling. And the kind of increment we're 

talking about, if they actually looked at closed-cycle 

cooling, if they'd make available information, we are 

not talking about increments; it's a 98 percent

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question? It's not economically available if it would 

bankrupt the whole industry?

 MR. LAZARUS: That's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What about if it bankrupts 

three firms?

 MR. LAZARUS: If it bankrupts three firms --

if one looks how EPA has interpreted that historically, 

Your Honor, throughout all the pollution control 

statutes, the Air Act, the Water Act, Resource 

Conservation Act, EPA has said that itself is not enough 

to say it's available for the industry, but it is 

possible -- we don't doubt this -- it is possible --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's not economically 

available to those three firms.

 MR. LAZARUS: No, but here's what happens: 

What the EPA said -- and you can see this in this 

Court's decision in the Crushed Stone case, where the 

Court drew this distinction. A particular facility can 

seek a variance based on cost impact to them, if they

can show that the cost to them is much greater because 

of some particular circumstances to them than it is for 

the industry as a whole. And this Court said they could 

do that. EPA has long said it. We don't question it, 

that they can do a cost-benefit --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but this -- they just 

have -- they are just not quite as strong a company.

 MR. LAZARUS: No. And that's the very 

distinction this Court drew in the Crushed Stone case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But is the variance a 

matter of statutory right or -- or is it available under 

a regulation?

 MR. LAZARUS: It's -- the way this Court 

interpreted sort of the use of categorical standards in 

the Dupont case, early on in the 1970s, the Court said 

in that case that EPA can promulgate these kind of 

technology-based performance standards on a categorical 

basis --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. LAZARUS: -- but if they do so, they 

have to take -- they have to give a variance possibility 

because if a particular --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why isn't that 

simply another name for cost-benefit analysis?

cost-benefit -- it's not a cost-benefit variance.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you are doing it on 

cost-benefit. You are saying --

MR. LAZARUS: No --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we require this and 

the company goes bankrupt, the value of demanding it is 

not satisfied by the result.

 MR. LAZARUS: No, that's not the 

justification for the cost variance. The justification 

for cost variance is not because of a sort of benefits 

being lost. It's because if you can show -- if the only 

basis you can get a cost variance -- and this is an 

important distinction but not an easy one -- the only 

way you can get a variance is if you can show the 

assumptions EPA made about how much this would cost 

don't apply to you because there is something different 

about your facility, so it actually costs you much more. 

You can get a variance for that. You can't get a 

variance if you say, "We are a weak company and our 

revenues aren't strong." You can't get a variance for 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you can't get a 

variance and you also would say the EPA cannot take it 

into account if this particular plant -- although the 

company as a whole is quite prosperous, this is a small

plant, and it's not generating that much electricity. 

It's really just not worth it to put in this big tower. 

We are going to close down.

 MR. LAZARUS: No, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That would not be something 

that EPA could take into account.

 MR. LAZARUS: The EPA can take into account, 

as they do for all technology-based performance 

standards, they can take into account the size of the 

facility to the extent it bears on the availability 

question. They can't do it because they think it's not 

worth it in terms of the benefits over here. They can 

-- they can take into account on availability, but not 

over here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the 

particular case? What they said here is that, if you 

require the closed circuit for everybody, we are going 

to have to build, we are going to have to pay an energy 

penalty of 2.4 to 5.3 percent. You will have to build 

20 additional 400-megawatt plants, which is huge, many, 

many, many billions of dollars, and the -- just to 

replace the capacity you have lost. And the result, 

which seems quite logical, would be to increase by a 

lot, not just a little, the consumption of fossil fuel.

be arguing that they can't take that into account, 

which, for an environmental agency, I would have 

thought, "But they must take it into account."

 MR. LAZARUS: We are not saying they can't 

take that into account. EPA has said they can. The 

Second Circuit said they could, and we agree. But 

here's how they could take it into account. They can 

take it into account in deciding what will be necessary 

to reduce environmental impact. So they can take into 

account those things that --

JUSTICE BREYER: So if they did exactly the 

same thing they've done, which I've just read you, and 

they put a label on it, instead of saying "thinking of 

benefits," we were calling it now "taking into account 

environmental impacts," then they could do it?

 MR. LAZARUS: Well -- but they -- here's 

what they could do, Your Honor, and I don't think there 

is anything anomalous about this: The EPA can say, 

"Here are the factors we're going to take into account 

in deciding whether or not we are minimizing adverse 

environmental impact, and we have some authority to 

decide what is and is not a relevant environmental 

impact. We -- here the industry can take into account 

in deciding whether or not this technology, this cost, 

makes it available or not." They have authority here,

but once they decide whether technology is available, 

once they decide what "environmental impact" means and 

what it means to minimize, once they decided that, they 

can't then say, "Well, we don't think these impacts are 

worth those costs."

 JUSTICE BREYER: I see that thought, and 

this is what's concerning me, but there may be a very 

good answer. A lot remains to be done with EPA. They 

have an enormous job to do. And I wouldn't want to get 

them tied up in unnecessary red tape, where everybody is 

suddenly taking them to court on rather technical 

things. So if this "grossly" or "wholly," or whatever 

you call it, read out of the Muskie page 170 -- read it 

out of the "available technology" definition, you can 

take costs into account; just don't do it in this other 

way. I can see how they could work with that.

 MR. LAZARUS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm worried about what 

you are saying that may make it so difficult for them 

that they won't be able to do the job.

 MR. LAZARUS: Well, we are doing the exact 

opposite now, Your Honor. What we are trying to do is 

say that the information that EPA has to focus on, the 

way Congress constrained them, is limited and it doesn't 

allow them to weigh one against the other.

What happens if -- and this is why Congress 

didn't want to give EPA cost-benefit analysis authority 

here or almost anywhere in the statute. Congress was 

concerned that it would bog down the regulatory process, 

and that is that if you actually had EPA -- had to come 

up to this weighing of one to the other and try to weigh 

these imponderables, you would be subject to such 

extraordinary attack -- it happened in this case with 

this rulemaking -- it would slow down the decisionmaking 

process. It wouldn't speed it up. Congress understood 

that information is not costless. And sometimes one can 

achieve a better cost-benefit balance by having 

regulation be based on less information rather than more 

information.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree.

 MR. LAZARUS: And that's why they said, "We 

want to take out this particular" -- remember, before 

1972, there was cost-benefit analysis based upon 

assessment of water quality impacts. And Congress saw 

what happened with that. It completely paralyzed the 

regulatory decisionmaking process. They ended up with 

very little regulation. So they said: All right, we're 

not -- we think EPA can do cost-feasibility analysis 

well. We don't think they do cost-benefit analysis 

well. We think that kind of information is several

orders of magnitude greater and more imponderable, and 

it's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is the reason they 

don't do cost-benefit analysis well because they are 

forced to do it in a political atmosphere in which it is 

difficult to make rational decisions? Is that basically 

the reason Congress would have come to that conclusion?

 MR. LAZARUS: I think that may be part, but 

I don't think that's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that --

MR. LAZARUS: -- the real reason in 1972. I 

think that does happen. I think the real reason, 1972, 

was that Congress saw what happened before, and they 

said, it turns out to be really hard in the water 

quality context to measure and value environmental 

impact. It's so hard that we think that EPA can get a 

better, more rational result if we instead say, here's 

what you focus on, technology available, minimizing, and 

don't try to compare.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I think -- I see your 

point, but I think if I accept your point, all I am 

doing is saying, they may in a kind of smoke and mirrors 

way take cost-benefit analysis into consideration sub 

rosa, when they decide what availability is going to 

mean; and they make take it into consideration when they

decide what a -- a -- an undesirable environmental 

impact is; and that sort of gets the -- the weighing 

process out of the public focus.

 And if they do it that way, they -- they can 

bring in just the considerations that Justice Breyer is 

talking about, but they don't do it in an obvious way. 

And I think that's what your argument boils down to.

 MR. LAZARUS: Well, I think argument boils 

down to that they can focus on environmental impact, 

decide what is and isn't environmental impact, they can 

focus on availability, decides what costs are relevant 

to that, and when is the technology available --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What costs are relevant to 

that?

 MR. LAZARUS: Well, the relevant --

JUSTICE SOUTER: When they made that 

decision, are they not in effect anticipating the kind 

of decision they would make on a more specific basis in 

a more highly charged political atmosphere, if they 

engaged in the cost-benefit analysis that you say they 

can't do?

 MR. LAZARUS: It may well be one reason why 

Congress didn't want to compare one to the other, about 

that charged atmosphere. But what -- they can't do it. 

I don't think they are doing it sub rosa. Our point is,

results.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the page -- the page of 

the legislative history or the page of the text of the 

statute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it

JUSTICE BREYER: Your son says, "It costs 

$100." You say, "That's too expensive." He says, "But 

I didn't tell you what it was for." What? I mean --

 Now you tell me the page, and I have read a 

lot of it; tell me the page of the legislative history 

or the phrase of the statute where it says what you just 

said -- that you cannot take into account what you were 

buying for that $100.

 MR. LAZARUS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What page? I will read it 

again.

 MR. LAZARUS: I'm -- I'm not going to give 

you a specific page. I'm going to give you the 

statutory language in section 316(b).

systemically in 316(b) and throughout the Clean Water 

Act is that Congress is saying we want to give EPA the 

authority for cost feasibility; we don't believe in this 

-- that it works with cost-benefit analysis because of 

the weighing against one against the other.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it has -- it has 

required, not just permitted but required cost-benefit 

analysis in other areas. What --

MR. LAZARUS: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is your 

response to the fact that it -- it seems ridiculous to 

allow it, and indeed require it in effluent situations 

where human health is at stake, and yet to forbid it in 

this intake situation when you were just talking about 

the snail darter. What -- what's your response to that?

 MR. LAZARUS: Two responses, Your Honor. 

The first is that in 1972, which is when 316(b) was 

enacted, Congress did not allow cost-benefit analysis 

for toxic pollutants. Toxic pollutants were not 

regulated under section 301 and 304 of the statute. 

They were not subject to best practicable technology; 

they were not subject to best available technologies. 

They were subject to a separate provision, and that this 

section 307 at that time. That's a subsequent amendment 

to the law. Where Congress originally --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And did that section 307 

not allow cost-benefit?

 MR. LAZARUS: It did not allow cost-benefit. 

The way Congress originally approached hazardous water 

pollutants and toxic air pollutants, the Clean Water Act 

is the same. They said EPA, this is so harmful that we 

actually want you to do an assessment to figure out at 

what level will it no longer be harmful to humans? And 

what they found out when they tried that, is they found 

out, boy, that information is unbelievably hard to come 

up with. And so, they had -- the regulation depended on 

this incredible information, and the result was that EPA 

did nothing. They did the nothing for water toxics, 

they did nothing for air toxics. So in 1977, when they 

learned how more information could lead to less 

regulation, they said all right: we've got to change 

that. That doesn't work, so we are going to move to a 

technology-based performance approach in the first 

instance, and then couple it with -- still keeping the 

health-based as a backup, to be able to go past that.

 So they put the technology-based as the 

first step and they kept the 307, but in 1972, Your 

Honor, there was only one provision of the Clean Water 

Act in which Congress delegated any authority to EPA to 

compare costs and benefits; and that was under 301(b)(2)

and 304(b)(2). And in that provision they said until 

1977 only, EPA for best practical control technology, 

you can and you must do cost-benefit analysis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

MR. LAZARUS: That's the only provision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have to 

agree, wouldn't you, that the panel's decision in this 

case overruled the prior panel's decision in judge 

Katzman's decision in Riverkeeper 1?

 MR. LAZARUS: No, they certainly didn't 

overrule it for two different reasons. If you look at 

the Riverkeeper 2 opinion, I think it's on 25a, note 11, 

they explain that in Riverkeeper 1, dry cooling was 

rejected because it was too expensive. That's an 

availability consideration, not a cost-benefit 

consideration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in Riverkeeper 

1 what Judge Katzman said is that we think EPA was 

permitted to consider costs and energy efficiency in 

determining the best technology available. He was 

deciding it on the basis of availability, too.

 MR. LAZARUS: He gave -- he gave several 

reasons, Your Honor. Also included was the fact that it 

was too expensive. Which is why the Riverkeeper 2 court 

characterized that as dictum. In all events, with all

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Joseffer, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

 PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSEFFER: Thank you. If I could start 

where I left off, the fact that Riverkeeper 1 in their 

view is wrong, I think does confirm what anyone would 

conclude after reading the two opinions, which is that 

they are not consistent. At a minimum that helps to 

demonstrate ambiguity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's an ambiguity the 

government said it could live with. Now the government 

advised this Court not to grant cert in this case, isn't 

that so?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Our -- our -- what we said 

was we thought the court of appeals was dead wrong, that 

it was a very important issue, but in the interlocutory 

posture of this case, which was a remand, we did not 

think that it was -- was so important as to warrant your 

cert standards. Frankly, we were delighted to find out 

we were wrong about that.

The other point I need to make is that this 

case is, after all, about the one sentence in the Act 

that deals with water intake, not about all the other 

detailed provisions about the discharge of pollutants, 

which is important because about half of the last 

argument dealt with the discharge of pollutants.

 The fact that there is no list of factors 

here, and instead just one general sentence, just 

underscores that on this issue, Congress was delegating 

especially broad authority to the agency to address a 

problem that at the time was relatively novel, and that 

legislative record confirms Congress itself did not give 

any real weight to. If we want to look at floor 

statements, thought I would not look to the floor 

statement of Congressman Muskey concerning a different 

standard, which was the BAT standard, but instead the 

only floor statement that addresses this standard, and 

it says that economic practicability is the test, and 

everyone agrees that practicably considers costs and 

benefits.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that was the House 

side, which the House side was against that. And the --

the question I have from your point of view is the --

the obverse question: if you look at this particular 

cost-benefit analysis, I mean, it goes through all these

things which, they don't know what the numbers are, 

nobody knows what the values of the fishes are, which 

98% are never even eaten, they are fast swimmers or 

whatever.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the -- you see 

the point here. That all of his fears, your -- your 

opponent, brother here, seem to be manifest in this kind 

of a document which, if you do read Senator Muskey, 

seems to be the very things he was against.

 So -- so what is -- I am still left with 

your suggestion of what to do, other than just, "well, 

it's all fine."

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, look -- first off. 

What EPA did here was not among the most robust forms of 

cost-benefit analysis. In other words we don't think 

the Court necessarily needs to expand -- to opine on the 

outer limit here. EPA did two things. First, as you 

mentioned, it first created national performance 

standards; second it did a variance when an facility's 

costs are significantly greater than the benefits.

 So first in determining -- so -- well, the 

second of those is easiest, because there is an obvious 

thumb on the environmental side of the scales there. 

Costs have been to be significantly greater than

benefits, which is not all that aggressive.

 Here, with respect to the nationwide 

performance standards, EPA again did not just try to do 

a strict -- costs are, you know, one penny greater than 

benefits. Instead it weighed up a number of 

considerations. It looked to the incremental benefits 

of closed cycle cooling versus the technology it chose. 

And then it -- it determined that those incremental 

benefits were outweighed by a variety of other things, 

including -- one was the extremely high costs of 

closed-cycle cooling, three and a half billion; second, 

the cost-benefit ratio, which was extremely 

disproportionate; third, the energy impacts which you 

mentioned are really quite significant.

 We are talking about 40% of the Nation's 

power supply. If we are going to reduce that by 4 

percent and require 20 new plants to be built and 

require each of those plants to be taken offline for 10 

months while it's retrofitted, that's really a very 

significant concern of EPA's. And then the fourth is 

air pollution.

 And so when EPA is weighing benefits against 

all the other thing and is not purporting to assign 

artificial monetary values to everything, I argue that 

this just underscores that we are well within the

agency's discretion here.

 If I could also turn then to just the main 

point. One of the main points here is that I really 

don't think Respondents have any logic to their 

position, because when we are talking about the text 

they say costs have to be considered against 

affordability and not against benefits. But when we are 

talking about absurd results, they say, oh sure, you can 

consider costs against benefits, when it would otherwise 

be absurd. But under Chevron it's the agency's 

gap-filling discretion to decide when where to draw that 

line, and nothing draw a de minimis line in the statute 

any more than the line EPA has drawn.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

the case is submitted.
