 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 

now in Margaret Bradshaw v. John David Stumpf.

 Mr. Cole.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court:

 John Stumpf pleaded guilty to the aggravated 

murder of Mary Jane Stout. The evidence shows he is, in 

fact, guilty of that crime. The court below, nonetheless, 

vacated his conviction on habeas review citing two 

grounds. Its reasoning on each directly conflicts with 

this Court's opinions and significantly undermines the 

finality of the hundreds of thousands of State court 

criminal convictions based on pleas. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, I -- I think he was 

given the death sentence. Is that right? 

MR. COLE: That is correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: At the end of the day. 

And there was a separate sentencing hearing?

 MR. COLE: There was a separate mitigation 

hearing under Ohio law, yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was it argued at that

hearing by the State that Stumpf was the triggerman?

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, the State said that they 

-- they thought there was evidence to support that. They 

said, I don't believe it's necessary for this court to 

conclude he was the actual shooter, and that's in the 

joint appendix at 186. So the death penalty is 

appropriate --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it was argued. 

MR. COLE: The court -- or I'm sorry. The 

prosecutor argued that there was sufficient evidence to 

show it. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there evidence at the 

recent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencers 

relied on the fact that the judge thought Stumpf was the 

triggerman and the murderer?

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, after -- at the time of 

the original sentencing hearing there was no other 

evidence, this new evidence of which he complaining --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right. 

MR. COLE: -- didn't exist. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right. 

MR. COLE: When it came into being, he then 

moved to vacate his sentence at the State --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right. 

MR. COLE: -- court. And the judge there from

the original panel --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. 

MR. COLE: -- one of the judges said, it may 

have made a difference. Of course, they had before them a 

motion to vacate the -- the sentence at that time, and 

they denied that motion. So apparently it didn't make a 

difference to that judge.

 Two other Ohio courts have independently 

reweighed all of the evidence and found that the death 

sentence was appropriate. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess my concern 

actually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, in 

light of what's happened, than with the guilty plea. And 

I suppose it's possible that that stands, but conceivably 

he's entitled to a hearing on the sentencing aspect.

 MR. COLE: I -- I guess that would be 

conceivable, Your Honor, although I note that there's only 

one due process claim he's making. He's making one form 

of constitutional error claim predicated on the Due 

Process Clause, and if there was no due process violation 

with respect to his conviction, which is the claim that he 

was pressing before the Sixth Circuit, there's similarly 

no due process violation with respect to his sentence. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think he has waived

any due process claim insofar as it applies to the 

sentencing? Do you think that's waived? Is that clear?

 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that. 

In his Sixth Circuit briefs, he does -- in a section 

that's entitled I hereby challenge my conviction, he does 

also note in that section that he's got some concerns 

about his sentencing hearing. So I don't know that he's 

waived that. But I don't believe that there's a valid due 

process claim that he has with regard to either his 

conviction or his sentence. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you argue that if there 

is no due process violation with respect to the actual 

plea, there is, therefore, no due process violation with 

respect to the sentence?

 MR. COLE: Well, because his theory, Justice 

Souter, is the same with regard to both. He says this --

the use of this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but we -- we may say the 

theory really is -- is not sufficiently relevant with 

respect to the plea but that it is with respect to the 

sentence.

 MR. COLE: That's conceivable, Your Honor. We 

understand that the -- we understood the Sixth Circuit 

opinion to be directed toward his conviction. So the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I -- no question about

that.

 MR. COLE: -- the thrust of our arguments before 

this Court were directed towards the conviction. The 

other side then raised, oh, the State has waived their 

claim about the sentencing, and -- and we were just 

making --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No.

 MR. COLE: -- clear that, A, we haven't, but B, 

in any event, the due process theory sounds the same in 

both. And so if there's not a due process problem, with 

respect to these arguably inconsistent theories, then 

there's not a due process problem with respect to his 

sentence either. He hasn't brought any other set of 

facts --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I understand that.

 May I go back just to one factual issue before 

we go on and forget it? You -- you stated, in response to 

Justice O'Connor, that the State argued in -- in the 

Stumpf case that there was sufficient evidence to find 

that he was the triggerman. Did the State stop there and 

say, in effect, we don't care whether you find him the 

triggerman or not? We're just telling you there's enough 

evidence. I -- I assumed the State went on to say there 

is enough and you ought to find that he is the triggerman.

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, referring to page

187 and 188 of the joint appendix, he says, given those 

circumstances, although we believe the evidence does prove 

he was the shooter of Mary Jane Stout, legally, 

technically, I don't believe it makes any difference when 

you have two people acting in concert for the joint and 

unlawful purpose of committing an aggravated robbery and 

-- and murder results. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did the prosecutor ever 

say he was the triggerman? The evidence supports it and 

-- and that's the conclusion that ought to be drawn: he 

was the triggerman.

 MR. COLE: He said there's ample evidence from 

which the court could conclude --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But did he take the second step 

and say there's ample evidence and he was, in fact, the 

triggerman and you should so find, or in so many words?

 MR. COLE: In so many words, Your Honor, in 

connection with the mitigation phase, in -- in connection 

with the factual basis hearing even, he put on the 

evidence saying, you know, Mr. Stumpf says he wasn't the 

shooter and gives a lot of reasons to discount that 

evidence. So he's arguing that in fact Mr. Stumpf was the 

shooter. I think it's a fair implication if he doesn't 

say the express words, but it's a fair implication. 

Of course, at that time, there was absolutely no

evidence to the contrary. Mr. Wesley had not yet been 

extradited from Texas. He hadn't even made this alleged 

statement to Mr. Eastman. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the evidence was 

Stumpf -- Stumpf himself who said Wesley was the 

triggerman with respect to Mrs. Stout. 

But I wanted to ask you a question about -- that 

-- it relates to the sentencing part and it follows up 

Justice O'Connor's question. The -- the -- you -- as --

if I understood you right, you said, well, there was a 

motion that came before two of the three judges that were 

part of the guilty plea and the sentencing. This was a 

plea, so no jury trial. It was three judges. One of them 

had died. The -- the two who remained -- one of them 

said, but if we had not been satisfied that Stumpf was, in 

fact, the triggerman, and we were satisfied that he was, 

in fact, an aider or abetter, that may very well have had 

an effect on the court's determination whether the death 

penalty should follow. I'm not saying it would, but it's 

possible. And then you said, but then he went ahead and 

voted to deny the motion.

 MR. COLE: To vacate the sentence, yes, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But there's no 

explanation at all. The only expression that we have from

that judge is -- he said, well, it's conceivable, although 

it wouldn't affect guilt, we would have come out with a 

different sentence, and then going from that statement to 

nothing, just a denial without explanation. You -- you 

want us to infer from that silent denial that the judge 

must have resolved his own difficulty and decided it 

wouldn't make any difference on the sentence.

 MR. COLE: Well, A, I think that's an inference 

that's supported by the fact that he voted to deny the 

motion, but B, in any event, there's been an independent 

reweighing of all of the evidence in the Ohio intermediate 

appellate court and that court said that -- very 

specifically said, even if we didn't believe he was the 

principal -- or principal offender, the actual shooter --

we do believe that. But even if we didn't, the death 

sentence here would be appropriate. And this Court noted 

in Clemons that an independent reweighing by an appellate 

court of the evidentiary record can be sufficient to 

secure -- or to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would be appropriate 

because the statute permits it. But the decision-maker 

has three choices. And if the evidence had come in that 

Wesley was the triggerman, maybe the -- this panel of 

judges would have done what the jury did in Wesley's case, 

that is, it's the same crime, but not give the death

penalty for it. 

MR. COLE: Well, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg, 

the -- the evidence wasn't available at the time of the 

original sentence. So the failure to have that part of 

the record at the time of the original sentencing hearing, 

of course, can't violate due process. 

And then the question would be, did something 

that happened later violate due process? But I just don't 

think it can be the case that anytime new evidence comes 

up that might cause a judge to say, boy, if we'd have had 

that evidence before when we -- when we reached the 

sentencing decision, we might have reached a different 

result --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what is the rule 

if there are two successive -- there are successive trials 

with different defendants and there can only be one 

shooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is 

the shooter? What should be the rule, or does the -- does 

the second person get the advantage? Does the State have 

to begin all over again with both? Or -- or does the 

State have no obligation to correct either?

 MR. COLE: Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I think 

it depends, at least in part, on what role that finding 

played. If those two verdicts each had as an essential 

component this fact, this person is the shooter and this

person is the shooter, so that the verdicts are 

necessarily inconsistent so that we know the State has 

actually got someone in jail they're punishing that's 

innocent, we would concede there may be a substantive due 

process right of the -- against the State because the 

State at that point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: By whom? By whom? By which 

one of the two? 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, I -- I think that's a 

great question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we flip a coin?

 MR. COLE: Well, I -- I think the point is 

probably both would have some kind of claim in that I 

don't think the State can pursue and convict two people on 

necessarily inconsistent theories because at that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that? I mean, it 

seems to me due process requires that there be enough 

evidence to -- for a jury to find beyond a reasonable 

doubt that -- that the person was the shooter. And if in 

-- if there is, indeed, in both cases enough such 

evidence, it seems to me there is no denial of due 

process, and that the usual manner of accommodating for 

that apparent injustice is -- is for the Governor to grant 

clemency to one of the two, have him figure out which one 

of the two wasn't the shooter, or to apply for -- for

reopening of the -- of the -- of one of cases. But I 

don't know that there is automatically a due process 

violation which allows one or the other of the cases --

proper convictions. Each one is fully proper. I don't 

know that there's a due process violation that allows one 

of them to be set aside. 

MR. COLE: And I don't know that there is 

either, Your Honor. We'd be willing to concede that for 

purposes of this argument because even if there is, it 

doesn't apply here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Due -- due process doesn't mean 

perfection. It doesn't mean that each jury has to always 

reach the right result.

 MR. COLE: I -- I agree with that, Your Honor, 

and I hate to argue against my position, so I -- I do this 

gently. But at the same time, the court has noted and --

and one of the old saws of American law is -- is it's 

better one guilty person should go free than that one 

innocent person should be punished. And if the State 

knows, as a matter of fact, that it secured two 

convictions for a crime that only one committed, the State 

knows at that point that it's punishing at least one 

innocent person and that might violate --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When -- when did this 

new evidence come to light?

 MR. COLE: The new evidence came to light some 6 

months after his plea was entered and after the sentence 

was announced. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did the other guy 

confess to a -- kind of a jailhouse snitch?

 MR. COLE: To -- to a jailhouse informant, yes, 

Your Honor. And the prosecutor put that evidence on at 

trial, at Wesley's trial, but it's interesting to note 

what he did with that evidence at Wesley's trial. He put 

it on but then in closing very expressly noted that while 

there's been this evidence, even if you don't believe he's 

the principal offender, you can still find him guilty of 

aggravated murder. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it is the case that he 

argued that -- that you should find him guilty because he 

was the triggerman. I mean, that was an alternative 

argument. So the -- I mean, I think what's the -- the 

concern following Justice Kennedy's question, the concern 

that I have is not with the -- the guilt or innocence as 

such here. It's with the sentencing. And as -- it seems 

to me fair to say that as the record stands now, the State 

has made two arguments: one that Stumpf was the 

triggerman, one that Wesley was the triggerman. It has to 

be the case that one of those arguments, if accepted, 

would lead to a false result.

 And the question -- I think the due process 

question is whether the State can pursue those 

inconsistent arguments, even if it starts out innocently 

doing it, but can it pursue two inconsistent arguments 

knowing that in one case the argument must be for a false 

result, without there being any kind of -- of process to 

correct the State's inconsistent positions? What -- I 

mean, what's your response to that?

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, first, I -- I don't 

think they're -- he was without process. Mr. Stumpf had 

abundant process within the State system. He got all the 

evidence --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, he could -- he could get 

into court, but as I understand it, there was no 

recognition here that there is -- that there is in fact 

something wrong with the two inconsistent -- or the two 

arguments of the State, each of which, if accepted, will 

necessarily result in one false conclusion.

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the -- again, the 

intermediate appellate court independently reweighed this 

evidence and concluded that even if we conclude that Mr. 

Stumpf is not the shooter, even if that's our -- our 

conclusion -- it isn't, but even were we to conclude that, 

the death penalty would still be appropriate here. So 

there's been an independent reweighing of the evidence

minus the mitigating evidence or minus the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- maybe that's enough. 

Let me, with respect to that, just ask you one final 

question. And I'm assuming the -- the answer, but I want 

to be sure. 

I assume that at the point of this intermediate 

court's reweighing, the intermediate court was aware of 

the -- the evidence of -- of -- the hearsay evidence of 

Wesley's confession and was aware that the State argued in 

the second case that Wesley was the triggerman. Am I 

correct?

 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. He -- the 

prosecutor, in fact, stipulated to the admissibility of 

the Eastman and the Wesley evidence from Wesley's trial 

back into the Stumpf proceeding in the original trial 

court before the two judges -- the two of the three judges 

that were remaining at that point, and then --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and I take it also --

MR. COLE: That was part of the record on 

appeal. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- stipulated or represented or 

admitted, whatever, that in fact the State had argued in 

the second case that Wesley was the triggerman.

 MR. COLE: I believe so, Your Honor. The 

indictment in Wesley's case included a specification that

he was the principal offender, so at the very least, the 

indictment would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Because of being -- because of 

being the triggerman.

 MR. COLE: The only way to be the principal 

offender under that specification is to be the triggerman. 

So that -- that's clear from the face of the indictment in 

-- in Wesley's case that the State had argued that.

 Now, the jury, importantly in Wesley's case, 

found that he should be acquitted on that aggravating 

circumstance. It's not an element of the crime, but it's 

one of the aggravating circumstances that the State could 

rely on in seeking the death penalty in Wesley's case, and 

the jury specifically rejected that aggravating 

circumstance and -- and found that the State had not 

proved it beyond a reasonable doubt. 

Throughout the -- throughout the appellate 

process, with regard to the sentence, the State's attorney 

argued that, yes, there's evidence in the record from 

which you could conclude that he's the actual shooter, but 

in any event, it doesn't matter. And the -- the State's 

attorney was correct in that, as a matter of Ohio law, 

aiders and abetters can both be found guilty of aggravated 

murder under Ohio law and are subject to the death 

penalty.

 The two -- the two aggravating circumstances --

I'm sorry. The one aggravating circumstance that remained 

after the plea deal turned merely on the reason why Mrs. 

Stout had been put to death. It did not turn at all on 

who was the person who put her to death. So as an 

accomplice, aider, and abetter, with liability for the 

aggravated murder, he was also subject to the death 

penalty under that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, General Cole, isn't there 

a distinction between eligibility for the death penalty 

and actually making the decision to impose the death 

penalty? And it's perfectly clear -- you're dead right, 

of course. He's eligible under either theory. But is it 

not likely that the sentencer would be more likely to 

sentence the defendant to death if the sentencer thought 

he had been the actual shooter?

 MR. COLE: I -- I think it's definitely a fact 

that the court weighs, although here we have evidence that 

at least one Ohio court took that possibility into account 

and said even in light of that fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. COLE: -- we still conclude that the death 

sentence is appropriate. So I don't know that we can say 

that in this case it in any way would change the outcome. 

In fact, the record --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, and the original 

sentencer might -- might not have done the same thing. We 

don't really know that. 

MR. COLE: Well, this did go back in front of 

the two -- two of the three original sentencers and they 

declined to allow him to vacate his sentence. The 

intermediate appellate court then independently reweighed 

and expressly said, whether he's the shooter or not, he's 

eligible for the death sentence. So there have been a 

number of Ohio judges that have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand the facts, even 

if he hadn't shot the wife to death, which was what the 

prosecution was for, he had tried to kill the husband, 

shooting him twice in the head?

 MR. COLE: Twice at the head from essentially 

point-blank range, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: From point-blank range. 

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And then there was some 

discussion that the -- that the lying, seriously wounded 

husband heard between the two perpetrators, and then there 

was shooting of the wife. Whether he pulled the trigger 

or not, could that possibly make a difference? He did 

pull the trigger trying to kill the husband. Is it 

difficult to -- to think that -- that he willingly allowed

his -- his cohort to do the same to the wife? I -- I 

can't imagine it would make any difference. 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, we agree and that 

certainly falls well within the -- the range of 

culpability that this Court set out in Tyson as --

JUSTICE BREYER: There's no doubt that they 

could have -- the trier of fact could have reached the 

same conclusion. But I guess the problem is that when you 

go back to reopen the evidence the second time and the 

judges are sitting there, someone might have thought, 

well, the husband didn't die, and we don't know if he 

actually pulled the trigger on the wife. And we're trying 

to guess what those judges would have done if they thought 

that. I don't know. It could be that people don't want 

to impose capital punishment without thinking I know that 

this person has killed somebody, and if that's so, they 

wouldn't have reached the same conclusion. 

Now, I guess that's the problem because at that 

time on reopening, the State told that panel of judges 

pretty clearly by implication that the State thought that 

the evidence did support Stumpf having pulled the trigger, 

even though at that point the State knew and indeed 

referred to the statement to -- you know, the confession 

and all the things in the second trial. 

Now, what do you think about that problem?

 MR. COLE: Well, first, Your Honor, I don't 

think we have to guess what the judges would do because 

the judges did what they did. They denied the motion to 

vacate and then --

JUSTICE BREYER: They denied it, but as I read 

what the Ohio court said after the denial, I thought it 

did probably rest upon their determination that Stumpf had 

pulled the trigger.

 MR. COLE: And certainly the intermediate --

JUSTICE BREYER: Did you think that?

 MR. COLE: Well, the intermediate appellate 

court expressly said that its determination did not turn 

on who had pulled the trigger, that they would have 

reached the same conclusion independent of who pulled the 

trigger. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the panel -- the panel 

that didn't reopen -- there was no reopening because they 

denied the motion. But they didn't say one way or 

another. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It's the Supreme Court of Ohio 

that then I think I got my impression from, and of course, 

they don't know either. 

MR. COLE: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: The fact is we don't know what 

that original panel thought.

one of the answers to Justice Breyer's questions that you 

-- you never know exactly what a fact finder would do. 

What you have to deal with are reasonable likelihoods and 

reasonable possibilities. 

MR. COLE: That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when -- and when you have 

someone who shoots the first person and is obviously 

attempting to kill him, and then there's an apparent 

discussion -- not -- not 100 percent clear that those were 

the two voices. It's pretty clear because there were only 

two other people there. So we talk about reasonable 

likelihoods, don't we?

 MR. COLE: I would think that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right. Of course, 

that's right. But we can't be sure what they would have 

done, and because we can't be sure what they would have 

done, I guess it might well have made a difference that 

the State told that panel we think Stumpf pulled the trigger. 

MR. COLE: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what gives rise to 

the problem in the case.

 MR. COLE: But, Justice Breyer, I think it --

it's always going to be the case that after a sentence is

announced, there's the possibility that new evidence might 

come up that would cause us to say we can't know for sure 

what this panel would have done with that new evidence. 

And so there needs to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the State say when it comes 

to the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you 

something. We think, indeed, that's what we argued, that 

the State -- in the last case we argued that Stumpf didn't 

pull the trigger, that the balance of evidence is against 

that, but nonetheless, he should be sentenced to death. 

That would make your position absolutely consistent with 

what you argued in that second trial with Mr. --

MR. COLE: Mr. Wesley. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Wesley.

 MR. COLE: But, Your Honor, I'm not sure that 

that would have been the State's position. I don't 

believe after the Wesley trial, that the balance of the 

evidence necessarily showed that Wesley was the shooter 

versus Stumpf. That was one person's testimony. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Now, the -- the jury in 

the Wesley trial rejected that position. 

MR. COLE: They did, Your Honor, and Mr. Wesley 

-- it isn't as though all the new evidence is in Mr. 

Stumpf's favor. Mr. Wesley, the only other eyewitness 

who's testified, came and sat on the witness stand and

said, yes, Mr. Stumpf pulled the trigger. At the end of 

the day, the only two people who know exactly who pulled 

the trigger are Mr. Wesley and Mr. Stumpf, and they have 

every reason to point their finger at the other person. 

So if that's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but wait. Who did the --

who was the last person the State pointed its finger at? 

You -- you told me in -- in response to earlier questions 

that when the case back before the two remaining members 

of the panel, that in fact the State brought the -- called 

to their attention the fact that Wesley had confessed and 

-- and it was -- it was clear one way or another that --

that they had argued in Wesley's trial that he was the 

triggerman. 

When they -- at that point when they are back 

before the two remaining members of the panel in Stumpf's 

case, did the State say we now go back to our original 

position that Stumpf was the triggerman and Wesley wasn't, 

or did they say we think -- we think Wesley is the 

triggerman and Stumpf wasn't? Or did the State simply 

stand there agnostic?

 MR. COLE: The State -- and I would encourage 

the Court to look at the State's response to that motion, 

which is in joint appendix at 126. But what the State 

says on 126 is -- essentially there's a lot of agnosticism

in the response. It says, look, there's this new 

evidence. We don't know. It seems like from this record 

you could conclude that Stumpf was the shooter, but then 

the State says even deleting that finding, even if you 

don't agree with us, or even if you don't agree that's the 

case, because the State isn't really saying this is our 

position anymore, even if you delete that finding, there's 

still sufficient evidence here to support a death penalty 

against Mr. Stumpf. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- could I get one fact? 

Wesley didn't confess or we don't know that he confessed. 

He -- he said he wasn't the shooter at trial, didn't he?

 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But what was introduced was --

was the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions who 

said that Wesley had told him that he was the shooter. So 

who was the shooter was -- was as much an issue in 

Wesley's trial as it was in Stumpf's trial, wasn't it?

 MR. COLE: As the court expressly -- or as -- as 

the State expressly noted in its closing in that case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the State's position 

was that the jailhouse informant had told the truth, 

wasn't it?

 MR. COLE: In closing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: At the trial.

 MR. COLE: In -- in closing at that trial, Your 

Honor, the -- the prosecutor was relatively agnostic, 

frankly. He said, look, you could conclude --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He at least put in the 

evidence. 

MR. COLE: He -- he put in the evidence, and 

then he said, look, from this evidence you could conclude 

that Wesley was the shooter. You could also --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Normally you don't put in 

evidence unless you think it will support a proposition 

that you -- that you're in favor of.

 MR. COLE: Well, and Your Honor, I -- I think if 

he could show Wesley was the shooter, that would, of 

course, support a conviction against Wesley, but he 

recognized that the jury didn't necessarily need to 

believe that, and in fact, he wasn't relying on that in 

order to secure the conviction. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you one final 

question? As a matter of due process, why shouldn't the 

State -- after learning of the supposed admission in 

Wesley, after taking Wesley's position, why shouldn't the 

State, when it gets back to the Stumpf case before the 

remaining two members of the panel, have to fish or cut 

bait on a position and say we think he's the triggerman 

and we want you to affirm on that basis, or we don't think

he was the triggerman because we've taken this other 

position? Why can the State, as a matter of due process, 

stand there agnostic?

 MR. COLE: Because, Your Honor, the State is not 

the fact finder. The judge is the fact finder. The State 

needs to put the evidence in and allow counsel for the 

defendant, counsel for the State to argue positions, and 

let the fact finder make the ultimate determination.

 With the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve 

the rest of my time.

trial. It was a -- it was a plea hearing.

 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, but there was --

but -- but in Ohio there's a requirement to have an actual 

prove-up of the aggravating factor itself. And they 

argued that there was ample evidence, quote/unquote, 

pointed to Stumpf as the killer, and that's in joint 

appendix 186 to 187. Ultimately they -- and they urged 

that he was the shooter. 

Then when the Wesley trial took place, at the 

trial they did the same thing. They used the same terms, 

quote/unquote, ample evidence that Wesley was the shooter. 

They urged a finding that Wesley was -- was the shooter. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I thought the prosecutor 

in closing in the Wesley trial said, it could have been 

Stumpf, but it doesn't make any difference. 

MR. FREEDMAN: They --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they argued both?

 MR. FREEDMAN: That -- they really didn't argue 

both. They -- they -- effect -- that was the throwaway 

argument. They came in there -- what -- what I think is 

critical in both trials and later on in the proceedings is 

what they were urging, what they were recommending the --

to the jury. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's at the bottom 

of page 187. We're on this same point. Given these

circumstances --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page is that? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 187 like the -- of the joint 

appendix. Given these circumstances, although we believe 

the evidence does prove he was the shooter, I don't 

believe it makes any difference when you have two people 

acting in concert for the joint and unlawful purpose of 

committing an aggravating robbery. That's at the top of 

188. 

MR. FREEDMAN: But the -- but they urged. They 

recommended. They didn't come in and say -- and 

throughout this proceeding -- we don't know who the 

shooter is. We don't care who the shooter is. They both 

deserve the death penalty. They -- they were -- the 

prosecutors were aware that the -- the death penalty is 

what stirs the pot here, and so they were urging somebody 

to be the shooter to get the death penalty. If this 

wasn't a death penalty case, I don't think they -- it 

would have mattered who killed who. And so they were 

urging --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think there's quite a 

difference in -- in case A where you say our position is 

that Stumpf was the shooter, pure and simple. That's it. 

In case B, they say we think Stumpf was the shooter. 

We're not 100 percent sure, but he should get the death

penalty. The alternative is before the sentencer and the 

sentencer can make that determination. 

MR. FREEDMAN: But -- but they took the position 

of actually urging, making a recommendation. I -- I don't 

think there would be a due process violation if they said, 

we don't know. They didn't take that. They -- they urged 

a position, and I think that's the key factor when the --

in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what was the due 

process violation here? You're talking about due process 

in the second trial, in --

MR. FREEDMAN: The due process violation, Your 

Honor, would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was in the first trial?

 MR. FREEDMAN: No, of course, it wasn't in 

the first trial. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the trial that 

you're trying to get set aside here.

 MR. FREEDMAN: We submit that the due process 

error is at the motion to vacate. At that time, again, 

after taking the position that Wesley was the shooter, 

they came back and urged that -- that Stumpf was the 

shooter, that the record was ample enough to support 

Stumpf being the shooter --

they're just -- they're just arguing that the evidence we

MR. FREEDMAN: Because they've taken 

inconsistent positions. The -- the violation here is in 

the positions itself, not in necessarily the results. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if they said in the 

second trial it doesn't matter whether he's the shooter.

 MR. FREEDMAN: I think they did more than it 

didn't -- it just didn't matter. I think they urged the 

position. It would -- I mean, a lot of the cases in the 

lower courts have made that distinction when the -- when 

the State comes in and says, we don't know what happens. 

We can't tell you who the shooter is or not, and we don't 

care who the shooter is. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State had said on 

motion for resentencing in Stumpf's trial, Your Honor, we 

took the position that Wesley was the shooter in Wesley's 

trial. The jury disbelieved that. We accept the jury's 

verdict. Our position now is that -- that Stumpf was the 

shooter. We've learned from the jury verdict in the 

Wesley trial. We've had 12 people. They heard the 

evidence. We'll accept that. Any difference in that case 

and what we have here?

what happened. It's different if they've taken -- if 

they've taken the position --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would -- in the case 

I put, would your argument be the same, and if so, why?

 MR. FREEDMAN: I -- I put it that it's not the 

same because they -- first of all, in reality, that's not 

what they did. But let's talk in terms of the 

hypothetical that -- that you've asked me. It is that you 

have to also look at what actually happened in the Wesley 

trial to determine due process for Stumpf because Wesley 

-- what happened in this case through the whole circular 

reasoning, Wesley didn't get the death penalty here 

because they were informed that Stumpf pled guilty, was 

found to be the principal offender, and was sentenced to 

death. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was introduced by 

Wesley, not by the prosecution. 

MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct. The prosecution 

in the Wesley trial originally did not want the -- the 

jury to hear at all what happened in Stumpf's trial. They 

wanted to argue the complete -- that -- that Stumpf's 

verdict was not even -- should be informed. The sentence 

of death shouldn't be informed or the sentence of death. 

And in fact, that's when they started to throw in a little 

bit of the alternative theory after that evidence did

subsequently get in. The record shows that they 

originally did not get it in and they allowed the defense 

counsel -- prevented defense from getting -- in the Wesley 

trial from getting in the evidence of the Stumpf trial. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freedman, you're trying 

to read back now into what apparently you recognize is --

is not a flawed initial sentencing hearing.

 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it might be more 

persuasive if the trier were a jury when the motion to 

vacate is made, but these are judges whose business it is 

to preside over these kinds of cases. They presided over 

that first hearing and now the same prosecutor -- was the 

same prosecutor in both?

 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Comes back to them and says, 

judges, don't vacate the sentence that you yourself 

entered. It's -- given that we're dealing with 

sophisticated judges, the same panel in both episodes, 

it's a little hard to -- to see where the due process 

violation is.

 MR. FREEDMAN: The due process violation is that 

at the minimum, assuming that -- that a weighing is even 

appropriate here, they never weighed it, and clearly any 

indication that there was a waiver -- a -- a weighing of

whether Mr. Stumpf would be put to death as an aider and 

abetter. They never took Eastman's testimony as true and 

-- and the prosecution's position as true, and then 

ultimately said it would make no difference. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they didn't have to take 

it as true. As I understand it, when they went back 

before the -- the two original judges on the motion to 

vacate, they didn't have to take the -- the testimony 

about the jailhouse admission as true, and they didn't 

have to take the State's position at the Wesley trial as 

true. It was evidence. It was before them. They were in 

-- they were required to consider it. 

But as I understand it, the State at that point 

essentially was -- was agnostic. The State said, you 

know, this is what happened, this is what we said, this is 

what the jury did in the second trial, but regardless of 

how you determine -- of -- of any determination about 

triggerman, this man Stumpf still deserves death, so don't 

vacate the sentence. 

And -- and there was nothing I guess -- number 

one, there doesn't seem to be at that point a -- a problem 

with the State taking inconsistent positions, i.e., with 

its position in -- in the -- in the Wesley case, and there 

doesn't seem to be any -- any lack of candor. There may 

be a -- a lack of initiative on the State's part to fish

or cut bait, but there's no lack of candor. So where does 

the due process violation come at that point?

 MR. FREEDMAN: We submit the due process 

violation comes at the time of the motion to vacate. We 

urge -- we're urging that they've not take an agnostic 

position as prosecutors. They're -- they're urging again 

saying the -- the evidence is ample to support that --

that Stumpf was -- was the shooter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- I mean, that -- that 

statement is true, I take it. 

MR. FREEDMAN: But -- but they're also urging a 

position. The State at some point should take a position 

on what the evidence is. At that position -- at that 

point, after urging that Mr. Wesley is the shooter, they 

-- were they untrue? Were they -- I mean, the prosecutors 

at that point maybe then -- if they were believing that --

that Eastman was testifying truthfully, why wouldn't they 

now believe that he was testifying truthfully now in the 

motion to vacate? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, because it seems to me 

they -- they would have two arguments. One is even if he 

wasn't the shooter, you -- you should -- you would have 

imposed the death penalty anyway, but argument number two 

is, wait a minute. You know, yes, we -- we don't know who 

the shooter is but there's a -- there was no violation of

due process here. There was plenty of evidence for you to 

find that he was the shooter. That evidence is still 

there. Do you expect them to throw away that argument? I 

mean, it's -- it's very true and it goes to whether this 

conviction and sentence deserve to be set aside. 

MR. FREEDMAN: We -- we proffer to the Court 

that they shouldn't be taking inconsistent positions as to 

-- in a death penalty case in the sentencing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What should -- what -- was 

Wesley then denied due process? Because at the time of 

Stumpf's initial plea hearing, Eastman hadn't appeared and 

there was only Stumpf's testimony that he was not the 

triggerman and the prosecutor's evidence that he was.

 Then we get to Wesley, and Eastman shows up. 

The prosecutors have already taken the position that 

Stumpf was the triggerman. Is Wesley denied due process 

because they're taking inconsistent positions at his 

trial?

 MR. FREEDMAN: I -- I don't believe that Wesley 

was denied due process. They discovered the evidence 

afterwards and ultimately at that trial they had -- the 

Wesley jury had the opportunity to hear what happened in 

the Stumpf trial, and they were able to weigh that case 

along with the evidence of the Stumpf finding and sentence 

of death and the finding that he was the principal

offender. That's something we submit has not happened in 

this death penalty case. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you concede that the 

evidence presented in the Stumpf proceeding was sufficient 

to support a finding of guilt as an aider and abetter? 

Was there enough evidence that the fact finder could so 

find?

 MR. FREEDMAN: Without the Wesley evidence, I --

I -- at the initial trial, I certainly would concede that.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right, right. 

MR. FREEDMAN: As -- as to -- as to whether the 

evidence that you learn from the Wesley trial -- that's a 

much closer question because the -- the aggravating factor 

in this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: She asked as aider or abetter, 

not as shooter.

 MR. FREEDMAN: Okay, all right. I'm just --

that's correct. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And as to that, it seems to 

me the guilty plea can stand and the only question that, 

it seems to me, I would have would be with the sentencing, 

and I'm not sure that has to be overturned. 

MR. FREEDMAN: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it would help to focus on 

that.

 MR. FREEDMAN: I --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you address, on behalf of 

Stumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?

 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, and that's what 

the Sixth Circuit --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that still before us?

 MR. FREEDMAN: That -- that is correct. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or has that been subsumed 

somehow?

 MR. FREEDMAN: No. That's before you. In fact, 

there's a -- there's a question of whether they even 

challenge that. But clearly, that the sentence by the 

Sixth -- the sentence was challenged by the Sixth Circuit 

and found to be defective and a violation of due -- of due 

process, and that's in the cert --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought a State appellate 

court had effectively reweighed and effectively 

resentenced, saying that this additional evidence would, 

in our view, have made no difference. And we -- we allow 

that to happen all the time. We speculate as to what the 

-- what the sentencer would have done had an invalid 

factor not been there. I mean, when -- when a -- an 

aggravating factor is -- is invalidated, the State supreme 

court can determine, you know, whether the same sentence 

of death would have been imposed even without that

aggravating factor. Why is this any different? 

MR. FREEDMAN: Well -- well, I'd like to ask --

answer that in two ways. First, the -- we would submit 

that a reweighing isn't necessary. This is not like 

vacating an aggravating factor. This is determining a 

constitutional error of due process. 

But let's assume for the moment that reweighing 

is -- is adequate. There was no reweighing, proper 

reweighing, in either the appellate court or the Ohio 

Supreme Court. 

The -- the appellate court, which is the 

intermediate court in Ohio, came out and said both Wesley 

and Stumpf were principal slayers as if they were both 

shooters. And the whole opinion is hinged on the 

assumption that Mr. Stumpf pled guilty to being the 

shooter. If you -- I mean, that's -- we submit that's 

just a fair reading of the opinion. 

And also, if you go to their main opinion, which 

is the final opinion, which this Court reviews, the Ohio 

Supreme Court -- they did the same circular reasoning. 

Ultimately they said he pled guilty. He was the shooter, 

and therefore, Eastman's testimony will have little weight 

as hearsay to -- to vacate the death sentence. They never 

independently weighed the case saying, let's take Eastman 

as true, let's look at this case as an aider and

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What is your best 

case, Mr. Freedman, for the idea that an inconsistency, 

such as you say was present here, is a violation of due 

process?

 MR. FREEDMAN: The best case we cite in our 

brief is Green v. Georgia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which one?

 MR. FREEDMAN: Green v. Georgia where they came 

in with inconsistent positions. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Freedman, you've -- you've 

argued just a second ago that both of the appellate courts 

decided the case or went through so-called reweighing on a 

false premise that he had pleaded guilty to being the 

shooter. Let me go back to the -- to the two remaining 

members of the original trial panel. I take it they did 

not make that -- in your judgment that error.

 MR. FREEDMAN: In all candor, I don't know. 

There's no finding. They simply said denied. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

Let me -- let me ask you what your position 

would be if a hypothetical Justice Kennedy suggested 

earlier in the argument were true. What if the State had 

gone back at the -- at the hearing before the original two 

in response to the motion to vacate and had said, we did

argue in the Wesley case that he was the triggerman? The 

jury rejected that argument. They found that -- that he 

was not. We've -- we've learned from -- from our own 

experience and -- and we now no longer think that -- that 

the evidence from the jailhouse informant should be 

accepted. We're back to the position that we took in the 

-- at the Stumpf sentencing hearing originally, that --

that he was the triggerman. If the State had taken that 

position, would you have a due process claim?

 MR. FREEDMAN: On -- on this -- on this record, 

we would have a due process claim for twofold. We submit 

that the -- that the error is in the attempt not 

necessarily the success, and particularly in the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not getting it. 

What do you mean?

 MR. FREEDMAN: I mean -- I mean, it's -- it's 

that they honestly believed that Wesley -- that in the 

Wesley trial, that Eastman testified truthfully. They 

believed that. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can't they -- can't they 

profit from the jury's verdict?

 MR. FREEDMAN: Perhaps, but not in this 

particular case because what the jury weighed in Wesley 

was not only Eastman's testimony, they weighed the fact 

that Stumpf pled guilty, was found to be the principal

offender, and was sentenced to death. That's a -- I mean, 

that's going to lead to -- I -- I -- maybe I'm off base 

here, but that's going to lead a jury to come out in a 

conclusion to find Wesley the aider and abetter and not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The jury simply decided they 

didn't want to sentence two people to death for the same 

offense.

 MR. FREEDMAN: Right. I mean, they already had 

the principal offender. They already had somebody 

sentenced to death for it. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a procedural 

question here? When I read the -- the Ohio Supreme Court 

opinion, my impression of their due process part of it is 

that they found a violation because of the inconsistency 

between the Wesley trial and the Stumpf sentencing 

proceeding. When you started to talk to Justice Scalia, 

you agreed that couldn't be right. Rather, you said there 

is an inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at 

the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf 

made his motion to vacate. 

Now, if that's so, I'm not sure that the Ohio 

Supreme Court or the lower courts have addressed that 

question to determine whether they really were 

inconsistent, and if so, what or why or what difference it 

made. But I haven't read the record thoroughly, and my

impression might be wrong. So I'd appreciate your telling 

me what are the facts there. 

MR. FREEDMAN: They -- they argued generally in 

-- in the record, and it was -- it was somewhat cryptic. 

They argued that it was unfair --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Who is they?

 MR. FREEDMAN: I'm sorry. I apologize. The --

the defense counsel. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what 

defense counsel did or did not say. I'm interested in 

what the Ohio courts did or did not say.

 MR. FREEDMAN: Thank you. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And my point there is my -- do 

I repeat it or do you have it?

 MR. FREEDMAN: I have it now, yes.

 The -- the Ohio -- the Ohio Supreme Court simply 

-- simply used -- simply used some sort of circular 

reasoning. They -- they hung to the position that Stumpf 

was the shooter, and then after that --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's go to the 

circuit court of appeals. When I read the decision of the 

circuit court of appeals in the due -- what -- what am I 

reading, which is -- this is in the Sixth Circuit Court of 

Appeals.

MR. FREEDMAN: Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You understand what the problem 

is or shall I --

MR. FREEDMAN: Yes, I see it. You want to know 

somewhere in the Sixth Circuit opinion? 

JUSTICE BREYER: The Sixth Circuit seemed to be 

addressing the inconsistency between the sentencing 

proceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial. Well, you say 

the inconsistency we should focus upon is between the 

Wesley trial and the motion to vacate. And I think you're 

right about that because I can't imagine the other being a 

problem. 

MR. FREEDMAN: I -- I -- maybe I should clarify. 

I -- I think that you have to compare the Wesley trial 

with the Stumpf trial.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's relevant in terms of 

evidence, but I think you're asking us to say that there 

is a due process violation because of the inconsistency 

between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and 

what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to

the Sixth Circuit or the Ohio courts has addressed that 

question.

did it in a generic fashion. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So I read this. You can't 

point to anything in which they have addressed that 

question. My quick reading of it -- I couldn't find 

anything in which they addressed that question. And if 

that's so, what should we do?

 MR. FREEDMAN: Well, as an -- as an alternative, 

the Court could remand back to have the Sixth Circuit --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did you raise that 

argument before the Sixth Circuit, the one that you're 

making now?

 MR. FREEDMAN: With absolute certainty, Mr. 

Chief Justice, yes, because they asked the same questions. 

They asked where did the error occur, and that the line of 

the questionings were almost -- on that point was 

identical. They asked questions where did the error come, 

and of course, it wasn't in the first trial. The error 

occurred at the motion to vacate.

in with a -- with a motion to vacate now and -- and he 

points to the inconsistency with the -- with the Stumpf 

trial? Would he also be entitled to get his sentence 

vacated because of the same inconsistency that you're 

pointing out?

 MR. FREEDMAN: Well, he certainly wouldn't have 

the death sentence. That was -- is solely as to the guilt 

part of the case, Justice Scalia? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. FREEDMAN: He might. He might because the 

-- the -- I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So a jury, having found both of 

them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and possibly on a 

basis that -- or not a jury but the judges and possibly on 

a basis that has nothing to do with whether they were the 

shooter, you think both of them are entitled to have the 

death sentence vacated. I think that's extraordinary. 

MR. FREEDMAN: Well, in all due respect, only 

one has the sentence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which one? I mean, doesn't 

Wesley have just as much of a complaint as your client 

does?

 MR. FREEDMAN: Not -- not as to the death -- not 

as to -- not as to the death sentence, no.

receive a death sentence. 

MR. FREEDMAN: No, he did not. That's what --

but you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's -- that's my 

mistake. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. He didn't receive the --

the death penalty. What would his argument be with 

respect to guilt or innocence? It seems to me that the 

issue only goes to penalty. 

MR. FREEDMAN: There's still an issue out there 

because this is killing a witness. As -- he would have a 

tougher role. I don't think Wesley would -- would have 

much of a chance. The -- the version of Mr. Stumpf's 

facts, whether it's a difficult row to hoe is that he --

he drops the gun. That was one of the -- and -- and 

shortly leaves the scene after that. So that he --

there's no intent, notwithstanding Justice Scalia's 

position that you -- attempt to shoot Mr. Stout, that he's 

automatically -- the specific intent is inferred. But 

it's not absolutely clear, leaving the scene, that the 

intent could be inferred to kill another witness.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now your -- your part 

about the guilt, the Sixth Circuit agreed with you because 

it vacated not only the sentence, but the conviction. And 

what is your argument that the conviction is infirm?

 MR. FREEDMAN: And -- and what they -- they 

deduced from that is that the -- the evidence of the 

Wesley trial -- their position is that -- and the position 

that -- that the prosecutor took and the evidence that 

Eastman took, that there would be no specific intent as to

disregard for the death -- for the eligibility for the 

death penalty. It's one of the few States. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I thought the -- the 

specific intent element would be satisfied if -- if they, 

by plan, went to the scene with -- with deadly weapons.

 MR. FREEDMAN: I believe under Ohio law that 

that's not correct. I mean, it's one of the few States. 

And I believe even the cases that are cited by the State 

would infer that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the State argued 

that knowledge -- that there's this plan, and they had a 

common design to rob. Is that right? And then the State 

said that common design plus knowledge that an inherently 

dangerous instrument would be employed to perpetuate the 

felony or that the felony and its manner of accomplishment 

would be reasonably likely to produce death. That's what 

the State argued was the law of Ohio.

 MR. FREEDMAN: But I -- I believe that they 

needed a plan for -- for the killing of a witness. They 

needed that plan at the time for killing the witness. 

It's not enough just to plan the robbery for the specific 

intent. 

And -- and they -- in the Wesley trial, I want 

to refer you to page --

that, any judge on the Sixth Circuit say that that was the 

Ohio law?

 MR. FREEDMAN: I believe so. That's my reading 

of the Sixth Circuit opinion. They said that there was an 

element of -- of intent that was -- I believe that's the 

-- the way I interpret the holding. 

I would like to refer you just to page 295 of 

the joint appendix, even the last sentence or so in the 

first paragraph. They imply that in the Wesley trial, 

talking about the same scenario, that there's not 

necessarily a plan coming in to kill the witnesses. There 

would have to be a plan while they're in the house. And 

-- and the scenario of Mr. Stumpf dropping the gun I 

believe is arguably that there's no specific intent.

 I -- I would just like to sum up and indicate 

that -- that the State argued in both cases urging the 

death of two individuals based on killing the same person, 

and ultimately there was not adequate review in Mr. 

Stumpf's case indicating that he would have gotten the 

death penalty notwithstanding Eastman's testimony, 

notwithstanding their position that he would have gotten 

the death penalty as an aider and abetter, which is a 

rather rare circumstance not only in Ohio but also in this 

country.

Freedman. 

Mr. Cole, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. COLE: Justice Ginsburg, to respond to your 

question, under Ohio law you do not need to -- to plan to 

kill the witness in order to have specific intent for 

aggravated murder. I would refer the Court to the In re 

Washington and State v. Scott cases that we cite in our 

brief that say that participation in an aggravated robbery 

where that's going to be done through force or violence or 

in a manner reasonably likely to result in death is 

sufficient to support a -- an intent -- a -- an inference 

of specific intent. So there's -- there's no need to find 

that they planned to kill the witnesses. 

If -- if I heard Mr. Freedman correctly, he 

admitted that Wesley would not have a due process argument 

here because he said the fact finders were apprised of Mr. 

Stumpf's proceedings. Well, exactly the same is true in 

Mr. Stumpf's case. As soon as that testimony became 

available, as soon as Mr. -- as the prosecutor had 

knowledge of Mr. Eastman's testimony, that testimony was 

then placed back in the record for further proceedings in 

the Stumpf matter. The prosecutor made arguments, but I 

don't think that the Due Process Clause requires --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you mean at the hearing 

on the motion to vacate.

 MR. COLE: Hearing on the motion to vacate and 

further appellate review. 

I don't think the Due Process Clause requires 

the State to admit the ultimate truth of everything that 

Mr. Eastman testified to at that other trial. The 

question was did they have a good faith basis for putting 

him on, and they did. And did they have a good faith 

basis then for arguing that notwithstanding what he said, 

that the conviction and the sentence in Mr. Stumpf's case 

were appropriate? And I believe the record supports that 

they did have a good faith basis for making that argument.

 If we look at the arguments they made, they were 

arguments in the nature of, look, there's this evidence in 

the record. You may believe it, you may not. Either way, 

Mr. Stumpf is correctly eligible for the death sentence 

under Ohio law and that sentence is appropriate. And the 

courts found, based on that argument, that Mr. Stumpf had 

appropriately been sentenced to death.

 This Court has noted that the principal function 

of habeas is to assure that no man has been incarcerated 

under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large 

risk that an innocent person will be convicted. Well, we 

don't have that risk here. Stumpf has knowingly and

voluntarily pled guilty, removing any risk about that. 

And if we look to this sentencing hearing, there's no risk 

that he received an impermissibly large sentence because 

the prosecutor made the evidence available, and Stumpf's 

counsel used that evidence and argued it, and the court 

simply rejected it. 

If the Court has no further questions, I'll 

stop. Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cole.

 The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
