3  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument


4 next in No. 03-407, John F. Kowalski v. John C. Tesmer.


5  Mr. Casey.


6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY


7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


8  MR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


9 the Court:


10  In this facial challenge to the Michigan


11 statute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have


12 third party standing and that their potential clients have


13 a constitutional right to appointed counsel in


14 discretionary appeals are both wrong. 


15  First, with respect to the standing argument, in


16 our brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not


17 meet any of the criteria for standing. This morning I'd


18 like to focus on the element of prudential standing that


19 considers whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a


20 third party to protect his own -- to protect his own


21 interest. 


22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there is an injury in


23 fact. These lawyers claim that if the State were


24 compensating for this service and they're on the list to


25 be appointed, they would have more money in their pockets. 


3


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 You're not -- you're not challenging that there is an


2 injury in fact.


3  MR. CASEY: Yes. In our -- in our brief we have


4 challenged that. The -- the requirement is that there be


5 an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or


6 imminent injury in fact. 


7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you said now you


8 were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked


9 were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and


10 you said no. And -- and why not? Because it seems so


11 obvious that they would get appointments if the system


12 were --


13  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I take it you're


14 reserving it for -- in your -- in your brief.


15  MR. CASEY: I -- I am not waiving the argument. 


16 I -- I would like to rest on the brief. 


17  But I -- in answer to your question, we believe


18 yes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list


19 for appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the


20 list and a case comes up in that county, there is a


21 likelihood that there will be a case. We submit, however,


22 that on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't


23 know how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in


24 Saginaw County. We don't know how many appeals of this


25 nature come up. So it may be many years before the


4


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 situation arises. This is not a concrete and


2 particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and


3 we've argued that in the brief.


4  At -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and


5 if there is -- another factor is the close relationship to


6 the third party. We believe those are weak at best, and


7 we've argued in our brief that they don't exist. I think


8 it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning


9 the hindrance to the third party does not exist here.


10  This is a facial challenge bought by -- brought


11 by lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not


12 that the statute violates their own constitutional rights,


13 but that it violates the rights of potential future


14 clients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.


15  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I clarify something about


16 this case? Are any of the indigent defendants whose


17 rights the respondent attorneys want to advance -- do any


18 of those people themselves have standing to bring their


19 claims in Federal court now?


20  MR. CASEY: Yes. We argue that there are -­


21 there are three ways that an indigent defendant can bring


22 this claim themselves without having to rely on an


23 attorney in this type of case. First, they can bring the


24 challenge directly through the State courts. 


25  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm asking if there are any


5


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 individuals now before this Court in this case -­

2  MR. CASEY: No. None of these -- none of these 

3 defendants --

4  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- who would be available and 

5 who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims. 

6 Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here? 

7  MR. CASEY: In this facial challenge, we're 

8 talking about pure hypotheticals. The -- the three named 

9 indigent defendants --

10  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: There were three named 

11 indigents. 

12  MR. CASEY: Correct. 

13  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: They were? 

14  MR. CASEY: They were denied counsel. 

15  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Denied counsel, and they were 

16 also dismissed at some point down the line? 

17  MR. CASEY: Yes. The -- the Sixth Circuit held 

18 that the Federal court should abstain from deciding their 

19 claims because they could have brought their claims in 

20 their direct State appeals. They raised claims about the 

21 practice of denying counsel before the statute took 

22 effect. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Casey, was it a Younger 

24 abstention -­

25  MR. CASEY: Yes. 

6


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to the -­


2  MR. CASEY: The -- the Sixth Circuit en banc


3 held that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court


4 should abstain from deciding the claims of the three


5 indigent defendants. 


6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means that the


7 defendants could never bring this 1983 suit. Only the


8 lawyers arguably could. 


9  MR. CASEY: No. Younger v. Harris is only -­


10 only defers the time when a proper Federal civil rights


11 action can be brought. There were -- at the time this


12 action was brought, there were pending State appeals in


13 two of the cases. One of the defendants never appealed at


14 all.


15  The Sixth Circuit recently issued an opinion


16 not -­


17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't these lawyers


18 instead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why


19 didn't they just offer their services to -- to these


20 defendants through the State courts?


21  MR. CASEY: Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel


22 could answer that better than I. We say that is the --


23  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what I don't


24 understand about -- about the fact that they won't -­


25 won't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as


7


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 easy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which


2 indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their


3 own lawsuit.


4  MR. CASEY: That is our point on the standing


5 issue precisely, Your Honor. 


6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- didn't the Michigan


7 Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the


8 statute was constitutional, that there was no right to


9 counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel,


10 paid counsel?


11  MR. CASEY: That's correct. In -- in 2000, the


12 -- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan


13 Supreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision


14 that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice


15 of denying appointed counsel was constitutional. The


16 statute was not in effect at that time. The statute took


17 effect, and in a case just decided in June of this year,


18 People v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court relied on


19 Bulger and said this statute is constitutional. It does


20 not violate any rights. 


21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So going through the State


22 system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the


23 defendants could successfully assert a right to paid


24 counsel --


25  MR. CASEY: That is correct. 


8


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




Was there -- was there a cert 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because that's already 

2 been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court. 

3  MR. CASEY: As -- as a matter of jurisprudence 

4 by the State supreme court, yes. Both State and Federal 

5 constitutional --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's an appeal from 

7 -- they could request certiorari from the State supreme 

8 court to this Court, I assume. 

9  MR. CASEY: There are, in fact, two cases 

10 pending, the Harris case that I just mentioned. A 

11 petition for certiorari was filed about 2 weeks ago 

12 raising this precise claim. There is another case Halbert 

13 v. Michigan. It's docket -­

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

15 petition in Bulger itself? 

16  MR. CASEY: There was a petition in Bulger. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was denied. 

18  MR. CASEY: It was denied. 

19  In -- in addition -­

20  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there -- there is a cert 

21 petition filed in what case? In the June case? 

22  MR. CASEY: In the -- the case is pending in 

23 this Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan. It was filed 

24 about 2 weeks ago. I have not been able to find out the 

25 docket number. 

9


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  There was another case, Halbert v. Michigan,


2 which is a pro se defendant who was denied counsel. His


3 applications, pro se applications, were denied in the


4 State appellate courts. A pro se petition was filed. I


5 filed a response to that about a month ago. That's docket


6 number 03-10198. It's on this Court's conference for


7 Friday, October 8th.


8  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So your point is that there


9 are petitions filed here that would enable this Court to


10 decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in


11 holding the statute constitutional. 


12  MR. CASEY: That's correct. There are at least


13 those two petitions pending that I'm aware of in this


14 Court now. 


15  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you acknowledge there is a


16 good Federal question there at least?


17  MR. CASEY: Oh, yes. It's -- it's an important


18 question. 


19  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.


20  MR. CASEY: We -- we -- in the Bulger case, I


21 opposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important


22 question, but it was correctly decided. At that time,


23 there was no conflict. Then when the Sixth Circuit


24 opinion came up, we filed the petition saying it's an


25 important question and now there's a conflict between the


10


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 State supreme court and the Federal court of appeals. 


2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the position you've


3 taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should


4 take the case?


5  MR. CASEY: What I said in the Halbert case is


6 that the Court need not grant this petition now because,


7 although it's an important question, the issue is pending


8 in -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v.


9 Tesmer. If this Court rules in our favor on standing and


10 then does not reach the constitutional question, then it


11 would be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the


12 Halbert case or the Harris case because the -- the


13 determination of the constitutionality of this statute is


14 important to the State of Michigan. 


15  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have lawyers in those


16 cases?


17  MR. CASEY: Now, the Halbert petition is pro se. 


18 The Harris petition has either retained or pro bono


19 counsel. But the -- the constitutionality of the statute


20 is -- excuse me -- is directly challenged in both of those


21 petitions. 


22  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if in exercising


23 prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential


24 standing, because I guess there's article III standing


25 here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one


11


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's


2 now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore


3 that aspect of the case?


4  MR. CASEY: As a matter of judicial economy,


5 there is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been


6 briefed and argued. So perhaps it should be decided. 


7 Just last term in Elk Grove v. Newdow, the Court faced a


8 similar situation. They disposed of the case on


9 standing -­


10  JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in that case there was


11 a conflict between the interests of the third party and


12 the interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here


13 there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.


14  MR. CASEY: That's true. 


15  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, also bearing upon


16 our prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in


17 order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert


18 to be an end run around the Younger abstention. And -­


19  MR. CASEY: That's -- that's correct. In my


20 view, the -- the most logical, most appropriate


21 disposition would be to say that these attorneys do not


22 have standing. Therefore, reverse the Sixth Circuit's


23 judgment. 


24  There are these other vehicles pending now to


25 reach the constitutional issue.


That's true. 

12


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but why isn't the


2 Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem


3 in Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants


4 unavailable but then allowed the third party to have


5 standing. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here


6 just like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?


7  MR. CASEY: Well, in determining prudential


8 standing, there are several criteria that should be


9 examined in deciding whether there's an exception to the


10 general rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of


11 third parties. In Craig v. Boren, the statute directly


12 affected the vendor in that case. It was a statute


13 against sale of certain alcoholic beverages. And in this


14 case we don't have that. 


15  Also, in Craig v. Boren, nobody argued


16 prudential standing considerations until the case reached


17 the Supreme Court apparently.


18  But in our case, we have a situation where we


19 have lawyers who do not have any present clients who are


20 not directly affected by the statute. They're not


21 claiming rights -­


22  JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they have the same


23 interest that the bartenders had because they won't make


24 some -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't


25 sell the booze. I don't see the difference. 


13


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  MR. CASEY: Well, in -- in Craig v. Boren, the


2 -- if the bartenders did not comply with the statute, 


3 they'd be subject to criminal penalties. Here, the


4 attorneys will not be subject to any criminal penalties.


5  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why -­


6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't true -- that


7 wasn't true in the Pierce v. Society of Sisters case and


8 it wasn't true in the Singleton case. Both of those cases


9 recognized third party standing, although the prohibition


10 was not on the plaintiff who was seeking to raise the


11 rights of another person.


12  MR. CASEY: That's -- that's true. The parties


13 have discussed many cases. Almost all of them have some


14


15 argued, all of them have distinguishing factors too. 


16  JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the biggest


17 distinguishing factor the one that you raised in response


18 to Justice Scalia's question? These -- these lawyers can


19 represent somebody on a direct appeal, the same way and


20 raise exactly the same issue that they're trying to raise


21 on third party standing now. Isn't -- isn't that true?


22  MR. CASEY: That -- precisely. Just normal


23 principles of litigation counsel that it is appropriate to


24 have a real party in interest. The criminal defendants


25 whose rights are at stake in the statute litigate that


factors similar to the circumstances here, and as we've 

14


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 case. If you take the step and allow standing for an


2 attorney, based on speculative claims about future clients


3 and economic harm to the attorney, as the dissent in the


4 Sixth Circuit says, that opens up the possibility of


5 vastly expanding the doctrine of standing beyond what this


6 Court has ever said. 


7  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it correct as a


8 factual matter that these particular lawyers do have


9 clients that they could be representing -­


10  MR. CASEY: That is not in --


11  JUSTICE STEVENS: -- on direct appeal?


12  MR. CASEY: -- that is not in the record. In


13 their response brief, they said that they currently do


14 have clients, but in the complaint -- this case was,


15 again, a facial challenge. It was decided on summary


16 disposition or it was a motion to dismiss. It was filed


17 and decided within about a month. And there was no


18 factual development here.


19  If they had actual clients, there would be


20 clearly a closer relationship, but again, those clients


21 would not be hindered from making the claims themselves. 


22 There is no reason -­


23  JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the claim that -­


24 I'm sorry.


25  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it just would seem to me


15


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may


2 not be representing individuals who want to make the same


3 claim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to


4 make these claims who don't have any clients, and the


5 question is whether they have standing. And are they to


6 be defeated standing because there are a lot of other


7 lawyers who might also sue?


8  MR. CASEY: In our view, as a general


9 proposition, lawyers should not be given independent


10 standing to raise claims of their clients. When the


11 clients can present their own issues themselves, as they


12 can in this case or in this situation under the statute,


13 there's no need -­


14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that different from Caplin


15 & Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of


16 the client and --


17  MR. CASEY: Again, there was an actual client in


18 that case and there was significant money at stake. The


19 lawyers had been paid money from drug forfeiture. They


20 had been paid $25,000, and they wanted another 107 -­


21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the actual


22 client, you moved to dismiss. So that's why there's no -­


23 was no back-development. You moved to dismiss. 


24 Therefore, you have to assume whatever facts -­


25  MR. CASEY: That -- that's correct. 


16


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in favor of the opponent


2 of the motion.


3  MR. CASEY: That's correct. But my response on


4 that was to the question of, you know, do they in fact now


5 have clients. There is no allegation in the complaint and


6 no proof that they now have clients. They may -­


7  JUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if you assume -- you


8 assume the correctness of the allegations, which you -­


9 you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they


10 would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to


11 payment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in


12 terms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will


13 have clients and they can bring this -- this issue on


14 behalf of the client. 


15  MR. CASEY: Correct. That goes to the criteria


16 of injury in fact and close relationship with the third


17 party. We still have the criteria that I wanted to


18 discuss this morning about hindrance to the right -- to


19 the ability of the third party to litigate for themselves. 


20 Excuse me. 


21  In our view, there is no need to expand the


22 doctrine of standing to permit lawyers to have independent


23 standing to make these claims because the clients, who are


24 directly affected by the statute, can make them


25 themselves. There are the two pending habeas -- or two


17


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 pending petitions for certiorari that we've mentioned. 


2  There is another case, the Bulger case. Mr.


3 Bulger himself, after he lost in the Michigan courts, he


4 filed a petition for -- for habeas corpus. And the


5 district court granted the writ of habeas corpus. We


6 appealed. That case is now pending in the Sixth Circuit. 


7 So that's another vehicle.


8  It is also possible that an indigent inmate


9 himself could bring a section 1983 case. It's simply not


10 necessary to expand the doctrine of standing to give


11 lawyers -­


12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could an indigent bring a


13 1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred


14 by Younger.


15  MR. CASEY: If they had a pending prosecution,


16 it would be barred by Younger. Once that pending


17 prosecution is over, they could bring a 1983 action. 


18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they? Because I


19 thought this Court had held that -- that you can't bring a


20 1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the


21 conviction.


22  MR. CASEY: Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the


23 outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the


24 conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the


25 1983 case. Here, the allegation is simply that they were


18


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 entitled to counsel. That's not the substantive merits of


2 whether the claim -- whether they are properly convicted


3 or properly sentenced.


4  The Sixth Circuit, in a case decided August


5 31st -­


6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if that -- that -­


7 that's -- you're saying that the defendants themselves


8 could not sue now under 1983?


9  MR. CASEY: A -- a defendant who is currently in


10 the State system on direct appeal is barred by the


11 abstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action. But after


12 they go through the State court and lose, in addition to


13 filing a writ of certiorari with this Court --


14  JUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably up to this


15 Court, if they want to come that far.


16  MR. CASEY: Oh, certainly. After -- after they


17 go through the State court, they could file a writ of cert


18 in this Court, as the two pending petitions have. They


19 could file a complaint for habeas corpus. They could


20 bring a facial challenge under 1983.


21  In a case called Howard v. Whitbeck from the


22 Sixth Circuit, just decided about a month ago, that was


23 the very question that was decided. An inmate -- a prison


24 inmate, challenging another statute, litigated and lost in


25 the State court, then filed a 1983 action. We argued in a


19


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 Federal case under Rooker v. Feldman, he was actually


2 trying to seek review of the State court judgment. The


3 district court agreed. But the Sixth Circuit just said


4 Rooker v. Feldman bars the as-applied challenge, but they


5 remanded for a trial on the merits of the facial


6 challenge, which is not barred by Rooker v. Feldman. So


7 an inmate who has been unsuccessful in the State court,


8 under Sixth Circuit law in my jurisdiction, can bring a


9 1983 action. 


10  So there are at least three vehicles that an


11 inmate can bring -­


12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you -- do you agree


13 that that's right? And you said that that's their theory,


14 that they could bring a 1983 action.


15  MR. CASEY: We are not filing a petition for


16 certiorari from that decision. We are abiding by that


17 decision. We're going back and we're going to try that


18 case on the merits of the facial challenge to the statute. 


19 That -- that case is Howard v. Whitbeck, docket number


20 03-1396. 


21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, what the other side


22 says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but


23 in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they


24 -- what they -­


25  MR. CASEY: That's true. That -- that gets into


20


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 the -- the merits of the constitutional claim. And in our


2 view, talking about the merits, all that is required in


3 the Michigan application for leave to appeal process is


4 that a defendant identify the issues and ask the appellate


5 court to review it. Unlike Douglas, this is not a review


6 on the merits. An order denying an application for leave


7 is not an affirmance. It's not an adjudication of the


8 merits of any legal issue. 


9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do we look to in


10 order to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the


11 Michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time? 


12 And if so, what's the standard that they use?


13  MR. CASEY: The court rules concerning


14 applications for leave do not set out specific standards. 


15 What -- what the court of appeals can do on an application


16 for leave is grant the application, deny it, or issue


17 peremptory relief. 


18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what are the standards


19 they use? Where -- where do I look to find out what


20 standards they use, if I get there?


21  MR. CASEY: To the best of my knowledge, there


22 are no published standards in court rule or statute on


23 that. The court is free to exercise its discretion to -­


24 to deny leave for any reason that it chooses. 


25  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example of


21


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 where they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's


2 not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as


3 incorrect -­


4  MR. CASEY: If -- if --


5  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- such as incorrect


6 sentencing?


7  MR. CASEY: Well, if -- under the statute, if


8 the court of appeals grants leave, counsel is


9 automatically appointed. 


10  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. What are the instances


11 in which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some


12 other statutory -­


13  MR. CASEY: They're -- most often they are


14 sentencing issues. The statistics we put in our brief, in


15 footnote 25 of our brief, indicated that out of the -- in


16 2001, there were 38,000 guilty plea convictions. The


17 court of appeals that year disposed of 7,600 cases. 14


18 percent of them were guilty plea appeals. Most of them


19 were disposed of by order. There were somewhere in the


20 neighborhood of about 50 decisions -- opinions issued in


21 guilty plea cases. I have not canvased all of them. I


22 suspect that the vast majority of them are sentencing


23 issues. 


24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we -- do we know whether


25 any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four


22


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 categories where you a -- a right to?


2  MR. CASEY: In every case where there was an


3 opinion, counsel was appointed. The statute requires it. 


4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the problems, I


5 thought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct


6 -- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's


7 an objection. There's no written record that the indigent


8 could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to -­


9 to determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.


10  MR. CASEY: I believe you're incorrect on that,


11 Your Honor. The -- what an indigent inmate will -- or


12 defendant will have available to him to prepare an


13 application for leave to appeal is a transcript of the


14 proceedings. 
 He's entitled to that for free. He will


15 have whatever written motions and written decisions the


16 trial judge may have issued. He will have -- in the


17 transcript, he will have the oral motions and the


18 decisions of the judge, and then in addition to whatever


19 pro se materials, as in the Ross v. Moffitt case, the


20 inmate can muster. 


21  In -- in these cases, there are other pro se


22 materials available. The district court's opinion in this


23 case noted that there is a -- a form brief, 38-page brief


24 that was circulating among inmates on the precise question


25 of entitlement to counsel, which two of the defendants


23


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 used in their State court appeals.


2  But in determining whether counsel is


3 constitutionally required under Ross v. Moffitt, this


4 Court has said you look to two things. Are the merits


5 decided? What is the nature of the appellate process? 


6 And if the merits are not being decided, as in the


7 Michigan case, we say that falls within the Ross v.


8 Moffitt line of cases, unlike the Douglas case. In -- in


9 addition to the nature of the appellate proceedings, he -­


10  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, now, your -­


11 your opponents quote some language from the -- one of the


12 Michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason


13 that an appeal was denied was it had no merit.


14  MR. CASEY: 


15 of appeals issues when it denies an application for leave


16 to appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds


17 presented. But there is published, controlling Michigan


18 authority, which we cited in our brief, that says that


19 language does not mean that the court of appeals looked at


20 the merits of the underlying legal issue. What -- what


21 the court is looking at is the question of whether to


22 grant leave or deny leave. If they grant leave, counsel


23 will be appointed. In a very real sense --


24  JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what are they getting


25 at when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede


A -- a typical order that the court 

24


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 there was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited


2 on page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the


3 reference to merit supposed to mean?


4  MR. CASEY: I -- I do not know why the court of


5 appeals uses that language. What I do know is that the -­


6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the reasonable thing to


7 assume that they use it as we would normally expect it


8 to --


9  MR. CASEY: Well, the -­


10  JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to mean by the words they


11 use?


12  MR. CASEY: On its face, that would be the first


13 impression that is given from those words. However, the


14 published opinions of the court of appeals we've cited in


15 our brief reject that, and they say that in an application


16 for leave to appeal, the court of appeals is not


17 adjudicating the merits.


18  My opposing counsel in this case was counsel of


19 record in the Bulger case in the Michigan Supreme Court. 


20 He made exactly that same argument. He persuaded the


21 dissent in that opinion, but he did not persuade the


22 majority. They didn't decide the issue precisely, but he


23 has been arguing that ever since. 


24  But the -- all the precedent that Michigan has


25 on that point we've cited in our brief. Those are not


25


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 decisions on the merits.


2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it true that Michigan is


3 the only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on


4 a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?


5  MR. CASEY: I believe that is incorrect. The


6 plaintiffs have cited a 1987 habeas corpus case that


7 purports to make a national survey. In the Michigan v.


8 Bulger Michigan Supreme Court opinion in footnote 3, they


9 cited a 1992 Arizona study which reached almost an


10 opposite conclusion. They said there were only seven


11 States which give unrestricted right of appeal, and there


12 were 21 States that prohibited appeals -­


13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not the right of


14 appeal. The right to counsel, whether it's a mandatory


15 or -­


16  MR. CASEY: It's my understanding that Michigan


17 may be the only State that has a specific statute


18 prohibiting it with exceptions like this, but it's also my


19 understanding that the practice in many other States is


20 that counsel is routinely denied in appeals from guilty


21 pleas.


22  I'd like to reserve my remaining time. 


23  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Casey.


24  Mr. Moran, we'll hear from you. 


25  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN


26


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


2  MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


3 the Court:


4  In fact, in the 41 years since this Court's


5 decision in Douglas, no State, not one, not even a -- a


6 territorial jurisdiction, except for Michigan, has even


7 attempted to deny counsel to any indigents appealing any


8 type of first tier appeal. 


9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Moran, this is a


10 very important question, whether the Michigan law can


11 survive. But I think before we can address that, we have


12 to decide whether there is standing for the lawyers you


13 represent here today, and that's a much tougher question I


14 think. 


15  Is it possible that this Court could grant


16 certiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the


17 underlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's


18 unusual law?


19  MR. MORAN: It is, of course, possible, Justice


20 O'Connor, that this Court could do that. 


21  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if we were to grant you


22 standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our


23 existing holdings on who has standing?


24  MR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice O'Connor. This


25 case fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client


27


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 standing cases, the Triplett case in which this Court


2 unanimously found standing for a -- for a lawyer


3 representing black lung claimants, and the Caplin &


4 Drysdale case in which this Court found standing for a


5 third party assertion by a firm representing a criminal


6 defendant. 


7  And what those three cases have in common and


8 what makes them unique is that this can only arise in a


9 case in which the statute or law being challenged


10 disentitles the client either through loss of funding or


11 through, like Michigan's law, a statute -- disentitles the


12 client to representation. Any other change in the law,


13 tort reform brought up by my -­


14  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 


15 really disentitle the client to representation. It says


16 counsel won't be appointed for him. But presumably these


17 lawyers could have offered their services. 


18  MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be


19 practical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter


20 also raised in the argument. It wouldn't be practical for


21 Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Vogler to offer their services pro


22 bono to some indigent in this position because to do so


23 would probably -- probably be unethical or malpractice. 


24 First of all, they can't be appointed. What the statute


25 prohibits is the appointment of counsel like Mr.


Well, it doesn't 

28


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler. So they -- they cannot form an


2 attorney-client relationship by operation of law. 


3  JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the answer that all


4 they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but


5 I am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the


6 end of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says,


7 I'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the


8 court, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and


9 there's nothing unethical about it. 


10  MR. MORAN: But Justice Souter, that's


11 impractical and unethical in this case because if Mr.


12 Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler were to do that, they would have


13 to represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea


14 and sentencing issues -­


15  JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. 


16  MR. MORAN: -- or those would be lost forever -­


17  JUSTICE SOUTER: Absolutely. 


18  MR. MORAN: -- because the time would fly. And


19 so if they also represented him on the underlying plea and


20 sentencing issues, then this person would not -- then the


21 underlying defendant would not be a person with standing


22 to raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have


23 counsel. 


24  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, which -- which indigent


25 defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on


29


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 behalf of here? Is it past defendants? 


2  MR. MORAN: This was -- this was -- for Mr.


3 Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the


4 prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges. 


5  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You're talking about the two


6 individuals, but they've been dismissed. 


7  MR. MORAN: No. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler,


8 Justice O'Connor, are the attorneys. They were -- they -­


9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm trying to find out


10 what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys


11 attempting to represent here.


12  MR. MORAN: They routinely take appointments. 


13 They are on a list of --


14  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: 


15  MR. MORAN: Presently and future defendants. 


16  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Past defendants? 


17  MR. MORAN: Past defendants. They -- they -­


18  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's past defendants


19 who were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it


20 consistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here,


21 these attorneys? 


22  MR. MORAN: I think I -- I think I misspoke. At


23 the time the statute was passed, it had not gone into


24 effect. This challenge was filed in order to prevent the


25 statute from going into effect, to prevent approximately


Future defendants? 

30


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 2,000 Michigan indigents a year being denied the right to


2 counsel. 


3  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you asserting then


4 that these attorney respondents are here trying to


5 represent future defendants? 


6  MR. MORAN: Present and future defendants. 


7  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if it's present


8 defendants, how is that consistent with Younger? How can


9 they do that?


10  MR. MORAN: Well, they're not representing any


11 named defendants. The -- the problem is that as the


12 statute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive


13 any further funding for -­


14  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's future people,


15 how is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons? I mean, I


16 just don't see how these attorney representatives get


17 here.


18  MR. MORAN: Well, they're in exactly the same


19 position as the bartender in -- or the beer vendor in -­


20 in Craig v. Boren. They're representing prospective


21 clients, prospective patients as in Singleton v. Wulff


22 again. This Court has over and over again -- in fact, in


23 Triplett itself, this Court recognized that -­


24 specifically said that in Triplett that it applied to


25 prospective clients, that the -- and it said that in


31


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 Triplett that -- it quoted the three factors. And it said


2 that -- excuse me. I'm looking at the wrong page. It


3 said in Triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer


4 may charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a


5 due process right to obtain legal representation falls


6 squarely within this principle. And that was the


7 principle of third party standing that this Court cited -­


8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, in Triplett,


9 the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They


10 were raising third party rights in order to defend a


11 proceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me


12 that's distinguishable.


13  MR. MORAN: That's -­


14  JUSTICE SCALIA: And the same thing in the bar


15 case. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of


16 liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking


17 to raise the third party right. But here, there's no


18 restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking


19 to raise the third party right.


20  MR. MORAN: But Justice Scalia, this Court has


21 never held that such a restriction is a condition


22 precedent or required in order for a person to assert


23 third party rights. 


24  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's so, but we've never held


25 what you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law


32


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to


2 raise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held


3 that either. 


4  MR. MORAN: Well, in -- Singleton is a case in


5 which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who


6 provided Medicaid abortions.


7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just as -- as to


8 Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say


9 those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held


10 it.


11  MR. MORAN: I'm sorry. I didn't follow that


12 question, Justice Kennedy. 


13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we've said that Triplett


14 and -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said,


15 well, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then


16 Triplett and Boren aren't controlling.


17  MR. MORAN: Well, I think you have ruled on this


18 Court -- point by many times recognizing that even persons


19 against whom the statute or law would not directly affect


20 -- for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v.


21 Society of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against


22 the school. The legal prohibition was against the


23 students not going to public school. So 80 years ago this


24 Court recognized that. In a situation analogous to this,


25 the school -­


33


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- a prohibition was


2 on the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in


3 that case -­


4  MR. MORAN: That's right. 


5  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- only the schools.


6  MR. MORAN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


7 It was the school that was -- was held to have standing to


8 assert the rights of future and current students, and the


9 same is true of the Singleton case where, again, there was


10 no particular restriction against the doctors. It was


11 simply that they would not get funding.


12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a problem,


13 wasn't there, in Singleton that -- that the part that said


14 that the doctors could raise the patients' right as


15 opposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever,


16 that that was only a plurality?


17  MR. MORAN: That was a plurality portion of the


18 opinion. 


19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't be cited


20 then. You're citing it for something that the Court


21 didn't hold. 


22  MR. MORAN: Well, actually we've cited it in our


23 brief only for the article III proposition which this


24 Court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III


25 standing because there was an economic energy -­


34


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- I thought you were


2 citing it here for the quite different proposition that -­


3 that you can raise third party rights.


4  MR. MORAN: But ultimately this Court in


5 Singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the


6 patients to proceed. I understand that it was a plurality


7 opinion on the -- on the jus tertii standing. 


8  JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I could accept -- I guess


9 I probably would accept your position if I did not think


10 there -- there was another equally workable alternative


11 here. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier


12 question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it


13 would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a


14


15 both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but


16 essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right


17 to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them. 


18 It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the


19 lawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand


20 the reason for your answer.


21  MR. MORAN: I think I might have misunderstood


22 your question, Justice Souter. The question I understood


23 was why don't they represent people and raise only the


24 entitlement to right to counsel. In the Bulger case, for


25 example, the Michigan Supreme Court -­


future client, subject to a claim to be paid and on behalf 

35


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, no. I'm assuming they -­


2 they represent the client for all purposes and one of the


3 client's claims is, pay my lawyer. I don't have any


4 money. Your statute is unconstitutional. Why cannot the


5 lawyer pursue that claim on behalf of the client and -­


6 and raise exactly the issue that is being raised in


7 substance here?


8  MR. MORAN: If that attempt -- if that method


9 were attempted, Mr. Casey would undoubtedly argue that the


10 attorney would not be entitled to any funding because the


11 attorney was never appointed. You can't just go out and


12 find indigents that you would like to represent. You have


13 to be formally appointed. 


14  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except that that's a very


15 formalistic answer. The -- the claim, in effect, would be


16 I have a right to be appointed whatever your statute says


17 because -- or my -- the -- the client would say my lawyer


18 -- I have a right to appointed counsel, whatever your


19 statute says, with the consequence of payment. So to say,


20 well, they're not appointed, that's the question. Should


21 they be appointed? I don't see why they cannot raise that


22 issue.


23  MR. MORAN: The problem is is that the way the


24 Michigan system works, it works on a strict rotation


25 system, and so there's no -- there's no line-jumping here. 


36


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 There's no right for a -- a client to -- to request a


2 certain attorney, for a certain attorney to go the head of


3 the queue and say I would like to represent that fellow


4 and be -­


5  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but these -- these


6 lawyers are in the rotation. Are you suggesting that the


7 rotation is so enormous that it will be 20 years before


8 they get another client?


9  MR. MORAN: No, not at all. They --


10  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.


11  MR. MORAN: They routinely -­


12  JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, your -- your claim is


13 that they are going to get clients in the future and they


14 -- they ought to have a right to be paid when the time


15 comes. So why doesn't, number one, a lawyer representing


16 the next client, whoever he may be, have a right to raise


17 this, and why doesn't each one of these lawyers have a


18 right to raise it presumably within a reasonable time when


19 they next come up in the rotation?


20  MR. MORAN: I think it's clear that the Michigan


21 courts would unquestionably hold that a lawyer who simply


22 inserts himself into a relationship without formal court


23 appointment is not entitled to be paid. 


24  JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure they would, and that's


25 what will get brought to this Court. That's what we're


37


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 here for.


2  MR. MORAN: But the problem is, Justice Souter,


3 we would then have an issue of Michigan law inserted as to


4 whether -­


5  JUSTICE SOUTER: No, because the claim is that


6 they have a right under Federal law to an effective


7 procedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them. 


8 That's a Federal issue, not a State issue.


9  MR. MORAN: That part is a Federal issue, but


10 what Michigan -­


11  JUSTICE SOUTER: That's all you've got to get up


12 here. 


13  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's at least an argument. 


14  JUSTICE SOUTER: It's an argument. 


15  JUSTICE SCALIA: And even if they lose on it,


16 they still will have -- would have raised the issue that


17 you are most concerned about getting raised. They're not


18 -- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars


19 for this particular representation. Even if they lose on


20 what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have


21 raised the question you're trying to raise today.


22  MR. MORAN: And they will have to do so without


23 any prospect of being paid, and that's -- that's the


24 problem. 


25  JUSTICE SCALIA: Who's paying them for this


38


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 lawsuit?


2  MR. MORAN: They're not being paid for this


3 lawsuit. 


4  JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. Exactly the same


5 situation. They can -- they can bring the case directly


6 for the client they're representing just as readily as


7 they can bring this one. And if that is true, why is


8 there an impediment to raising the issue unless we


9 recognize third party standing?


10  MR. MORAN: Because Justice Souter, they would


11 have to represent them on all of their issues. They would


12 have to represent them on their plea and sentencing issues


13 without being paid. And that's not what they're doing in


14 this -­


15  JUSTICE SOUTER: Without being paid if they


16 lose -­


17  MR. MORAN: -- in this litigation. 


18  JUSTICE SOUTER: -- being paid if they win. In


19 this case, if they win, they don't get a dime because


20 they're not representing a client. All they get is a


21 declaration.


22  MR. MORAN: And --


23  JUSTICE SOUTER: And they'd be better off to


24 represent a real client. 


25  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. They have a shot


39


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 at getting paid using this other method.


2  MR. MORAN: In -- in this lawsuit, if we win on


3 the merits, they will then get far more appointments on


4 the rotation system and then they will get paid for those 


5 appointments. 


6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Why will they get more


7 appointments?


8  MR. MORAN: Because --


9  JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said there's a


10 strict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get


11 an appointment. How is that going to change regardless of


12 how this comes out?


13  MR. MORAN: Because the statute, which is now in


14 effect -- and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of


15 prudential standing -­


16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, you're just saying there -­


17 there's going to be a further class of clients to be


18 represented on the rotation.


19  MR. MORAN: Correct. Far more. 


20  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that's -- that's


21 true.


22  MR. MORAN: And -- and while this Court


23 considers these issues of prudential standing, thousands


24 of Michigan defendants will be denied the right to


25 counsel -­


40


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE BREYER: And while this suit is being


2 brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a


3 case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to


4 have on our docket and face it directly because everybody


5 is tied up in these knots on standing. I mean, what -­


6 what is it that -- that you -- led you to bring this case


7 rather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought


8 by a real indigent who wants a lawyer?


9  MR. MORAN: Because there -- there was no person


10 in position at the time. The problem was we had to file


11 this litigation before the statute went into effect


12 because once the statute went into effect, thousands of


13 Michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel


14 every year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to


15 their right to appeal -­


16  JUSTICE BREYER: I see -- I see that. That's a


17 good answer. 


18  And the -- the question I have is if I now,


19 since we have real indigents, believe that there


20 absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this


21 claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus


22 brief. Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it


23 actually. If I believe it, then does your third party


24 standing claim disappear?


25  MR. MORAN: No. 


41


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if it doesn't


2 disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be


3 opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by


4 tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means


5 less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people? 


6 Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in


7 complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's


8 what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I


9 possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?


10  MR. MORAN: Your -­


11  JUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I'd like


12 answered.


13  MR. MORAN: Your Honor, the only kind of case to


14 which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case


15 exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the


16 underlying change in the law or the underlying law


17 disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the


18 criminal defendant or the defendant to representation. 


19  JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 


20  MR. MORAN: Because, first of all, if the


21 indigent or the client still has representation, then


22 there is no hindrance to the third party raising it


23 themselves. 


24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why would a


25 change in substantive law --


42


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I assumed there's --


2  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the same result? 


3 Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -­


4 and the person says this change -- this change has the -­


5 the effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the


6 law. That's the claim that the -- that the client would


7 have. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this


8 change will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust


9 suits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty,


10 antitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why


11 wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection


12 claim of the prospective client? 


13  MR. MORAN: Because the client could raise it


14 directly, represented by the attorney. And so the third


15 prong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in


16 that case. 


17  JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm sorry. I -- I -­


18 Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I


19 assume that there's no problem with the real person, the


20 indigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on


21 that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide


22 in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I


23 wanted to keep firmly closed?


24  MR. MORAN: But this Court's precedents


25 indicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a


43


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves. 


2  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. No. I agree with


3 you. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a


4 real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we


5 have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I


6 would begin to think you were right. So then what I was


7 trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to


8 whether I accept that premise. And of course, that's


9 what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at


10 the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can


11 bring it themselves, and indeed they have.


12  MR. MORAN: But I think -­


13  JUSTICE BREYER: But everything comes down to


14 that. Right?


15  MR. MORAN: I think an answer I need to give to


16 -- to cut through all of this is that third party standing


17 is never predicated on the impossible. Third party


18 standing is never predicated on the idea that third party


19 standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some


20 indigent to make it into court or some third party or the


21 person whose rights are being violated to make it into


22 court. All that must be shown from this Court's


23 precedents is a hindrance. So this Court did not require


24 in Craig v. Boren that it was impossible that some young


25 man could get his claim in front of the court. 


44


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was altogether possible


2 there had been a young man. The problem was he turned 21. 


3 So the case would -- from his point of view was moot.


4  MR. MORAN: Right, but this Court never


5 suggested that it was -- showing that it was impossible


6 for someone to quickly get his claim before the court


7 was --


8  JUSTICE BREYER: I think I agree with you on


9 that. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is


10 because we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And


11 all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want


12 a lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write


13 those words. And at that point, you and the others come


14 in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.


15  MR. MORAN: Well, the problem is is that in the


16 meantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be


17 denied counsel. 


18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a practical


19 question about what is currently before the Court? Mr.


20 Casey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the


21 October 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either


22 of those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court -­


23 Michigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always


24 leave before then. If we should grant in either of those


25 cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case


45


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 till those are decided?


2  MR. MORAN: That may well be a wise course of


3 action -- action, Justice Ginsburg. 


4  I should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed


5 the response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this


6 Court's attention to the fact that this underlying


7 litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called


8 Tesmer v. Granholm. And so he brought to this Court's


9 attention that we had already prevailed in Federal


10 district court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to


11 why this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger


12 case, and so this Court did not grant cert. I don't know,


13 of course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant


14 cert in Bulger. 


15  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he said now he's not


16 taking that position in the Halbert case.


17  MR. MORAN: But I can be confident that if there


18 are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of


19 jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will


20 alert this Court of them. And there may well be. For


21 example, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme


22 Court remanded for further -- remanded for her to then


23 file an application for leave to appeal on her underlying


24 plea and sentencing issues without the assistance of


25 counsel. Was the Michigan Supreme Court's order a final


46


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 order? I don't know. This Court would obviously have to


2 resolve that. But I can be confident that Mr. Casey will


3 certainly bring up any procedural hurdles.


4  And of course, this Court cannot exercise


5 jurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it


6 would be more convenient to do so. This Court does have


7 jurisdiction in this case.


8  The petitioners never challenged prudential


9 standing at any point in this litigation -- they -- they


10 challenged only article III standing, injury in fact -­


11 until this Court. And so part of the reason we don't have


12 a better record is because this came on a motion to


13 dismiss. This Court recognized in Lujan that a motion to


14 dismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a


15 -- a different procedural posture. It requires the


16 assumption of facts being true.


17  JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but no facts -- no


18 additional facts would -- would affect the central point


19 that -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion


20 to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to -­


21 to the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients


22 are asserting raising their own rights. No additional


23 facts bear upon that it seems to me. 


24  MR. MORAN: I agree with you on that, Justice


25 Scalia. 


47


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  JUSTICE STEVENS: Then what case holds that


2 there must be an impediment for the third party? I keep


3 coming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed


4 another class action and say that they filed a class


5 action and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided


6 we won't decide the merits even though it's been argued


7 and both sides have had their day in court? 


8  MR. MORAN: I agree with you, Justice Stevens. 


9  JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the source of the


10 requirement there must be an impediment to the third party


11 suit?


12  MR. MORAN: Well, this Court has said so many


13 times, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the


14 impediment to the -­


15  JUSTICE STEVENS: That -- where they granted


16 standing. 


17  MR. MORAN: That's right. 


18  JUSTICE STEVENS: Have they ever denied 


19 standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the


20 third party suit? I don't think we have.


21  MR. MORAN: I don't believe in all of the cases


22 that both parties cited that there are any cases in which


23 this Court has said that there was no impediment to the


24 third party. It is -- it is certainly not the standard -­


25  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, do you think


48


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 that was just idle observation then?


2  MR. MORAN: Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice. I


3 didn't mean to be light about that. 


4  JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't have to be idle to


5 be dicta, though, does it?


6  MR. MORAN: There -- we -- we fully concede


7 there need to be an impediment, but what it does not


8 require is the showing that it is impossible for someone


9 to get here. What is a showing is that for most -- for


10 the average person in the class, just like the average


11 grand juror in Campbell v. Louisiana, or the average


12 venire person in Powers v. Ohio, there are impediments to


13 getting here. 


14  JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you fully concede there


15 must be an impediment even though the Court has never so


16 held?


17  MR. MORAN: I'm willing to concede that because


18 it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an


19 impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying


20 to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal


21 district court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is


22 very likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally


23 illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his


24 rights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles


25 of the Michigan system to get all the way through the


49


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 Michigan system and then into Federal court, that is a


2 daunting hurdle. And that's Evitts v. Lucey. This Court


3 has recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases,


4 Roe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega. This Court has recognized


5 time and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a


6 typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or


7 her case held -- heard, especially if you have to go


8 through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for


9 the first tier. And that is the problem here.


10  On the merits, I certainly would like to correct


11 Mr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the


12 Michigan system. The -- a properly filed application for


13 leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in


14 the grounds presented. 


15 look at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has


16 cited for the proposition that that is not a determination


17 on the merits because not one of them says that. Not one


18 of them specifically says that a order denying leave for


19 lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision


20 on the merits. 


21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you give me an


22 example, just from your experience in practice, where


23 there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that


24 requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory


25 exceptions?


I certainly urge this Court to 

50


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1  MR. MORAN: Many, many. 


2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Most -- what are -- what are


3 those cases?


4  MR. MORAN: Improper denial of jail credit,


5 making -- improper denial of jail credit. 


6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not sentencing?


7  MR. MORAN: That is a sentencing error. 


8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, but that's covered by


9 the statute.


10  MR. MORAN: No, it's not. The statute -- the


11 only exceptions in the statute are for guidelines


12 departures -­


13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.


14  MR. MORAN: 


15 indigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting -­


16 that's after the indigent has had to file an application


17 identifying his or her own issues without any assistance


18 of counsel. 


19  Double jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues


20 arise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should


21 be consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a


22 breach of the plea bargain. All of these issues arise in


23 Michigan courts every day, and while we are --


24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there instances where


25 Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims


-- and for -- and then if the 

51


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 are raised?


2  MR. MORAN: The problem, Your Honor, is that an


3 indigent can't raise -- a typical indigent would be


4 completely incapable of identifying this -- these sorts of


5 issues. 


6  JUSTICE SCALIA: His counsel will have raised


7 them. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have


8 been raised by counsel.


9  MR. MORAN: Your Honor, Michigan requires that


10 ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on


11 direct appeal. So if counsel has not raised the issue,


12 then the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by


13 himself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective


14 assistance of counsel, on direct appeal. 


15  Further, even if counsel has recognized it, what


16 we typically would have would be an oral objection at a


17 sentencing hearing. For example, Your Honor, I think


18 these sentences should be concurrent, and the judge says,


19 no, I'm going to make them consecutive. That's an oral


20 objection. The indigent will have to be able to get the


21 transcripts, get the register of actions, get all the


22 necessary documents, realize that that's a winning issue,


23 that it does not put him at additional risk. That's


24 another factor. One of the -- one of the points that a


25 counsel can help with is tell an indigent, you don't want


52


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 to take this appeal because success may result in


2 revocation of the plea bargain and an additional risk -­


3 will have to realize that this is in my best interest to


4 go ahead with this appeal. This is my issue. Find the


5 cases, find the controlling authority.


6  And even issues as complex as a Blakely issue,


7 which this Court, of course, will be dealing with this


8 afternoon, that is an open issue of Michigan law right


9 now. Is -- are the Michigan sentencing guidelines


10 unconstitutional or at least the application of them as a


11 result of this Court's decision in Blakely? Right now, as


12 a result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan


13 indigent will have to raise that complex issue of Sixth


14


15 an impossible burden, or the issue will be lost forever. 


16 And that is -- that is a burden that no indigent can meet.


17  And so I would hope that this Court would not


18 get hung up on the standing issue because this issue is so


19 important right now, as a result of the Michigan Supreme


20 Court's order. Right now these issues are happening and


21 right now Michigan indigents are being denied the


22 assistance of counsel. Unique in the Nation. And so this


23 case has been adversely argued. That's the point of


24 prudential standing. The petitioners waived the


25 prudential standing issues below. They challenged only


Amendment law by herself or by himself, and that's simply 

53


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 article III standing. And so there is every reason for


2 this Court not to wait for a perfect case that may never


3 come. 


4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you familiar with the


5 Halbert case? You mentioned that there might be a


6 finality problem in Harris.


7  MR. MORAN: I'm not familiar with that case,


8 Your Honor. I just became aware of it by letter a few


9 days ago and I have not had a chance to find out anything


10 more about it. I have not seen the cert petition in that


11 case. I'm not aware of the underlying -- excuse me -- the


12 underlying order from the Michigan courts in that case.


13  But there may never be a perfect case, but this


14


15 requirements for prudential standing. Article III


16 standing is clearly met in this case, and I hope this


17 Court will affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit. 


18  If this Court has no further questions. 


19  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moran.


20  Mr. Casey, you have 3 minutes left.


21  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY


22  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you waive the objection to


24 prudential standing -­


25  MR. CASEY: We did not waive any of the standing


case is adverse and that meets all the -- all the 

54


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 claims in this case. We've discussed that in our reply


2 brief. I've cited pages of the briefs where these issues


3 were discussed. And the overriding fact is that the


4 district court, the three-judge panel in the court of


5 appeals, and the en banc Sixth Circuit all decided these


6 issues. They have been properly raised and preserved and


7 they're before the Court. 


8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you file a brief in


9 opposition in Halbert?


10  MR. CASEY: Yes, I did. I filed that about a


11 month ago. 


12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that have any


13 procedural impediments?


14  MR. CASEY: Not to my knowledge. That


15 individual was convicted in pleas, asked for counsel


16 citing the Federal litigation in this Kowalski v. Tesmer


17 case. It was denied. He filed a pro se application for


18 leave to appeal challenging the denial of counsel and


19 raising his sentencing issues --


20  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what was the basis for


21 your opposition to cert?


22  MR. CASEY: That the Court need not grant cert


23 in that case because the issue is pending in this case. 


24 If -- if this case goes away, then I suspect we will agree


25 that that would be an appropriate vehicle to decide the


55


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005




1 constitutional issue. As long as this case is pending in


2 which the issue is raised, I suggested that the Court need


3 not grant cert in that case to decide the issue. If the


4 issue is not going to be decided in this case, then that


5 would be an appropriate vehicle to raise and decide the


6 issue.


7  On the standing point, if the plaintiffs here


8 are given standing, it would be a significant expansion of


9 this Court's standing doctrine. This Court has never


10 found third party standing when a litigant is not directly


11 affected by a statute and there is no close existing


12 relationship with the third party and there is no


13 hindrance. We've discussed many cases in which some of


14 these factors are present and others are distinguishing


15 factors. This -- this case is, in some respects, unlike


16 all of them. There would be a significant expansion of


17 the doctrine. 


18  On the merits of the issue, a constitutional


19 right to appointed counsel, under the Michigan system,
