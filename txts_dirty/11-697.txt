Sons.
 

6  Mr. Rosenkranz.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ
 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

9  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you,
 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

11  This case presents a stark choice between 

12 two plausible definitions of the phrase, "lawfully made 

13 under this title." Our definition is the more 

14 consistent with the English language, and is the only 

definition that does not do mischief with the same use 

16 of that phrase each time it's repeated. 

17  Ours is the only one consistent with a 

18 400-year common law history, and 65-year-old right that 

19 was in the statute through 1976, and consistent with the 

principle that Congress doesn't abolish those things 

21 without being clear. 

22  Ours gives the copyright owners much of what 

23 they asked for when they were seeking an importation 

24 provision, just not everything; whereas, Wiley's grants 

them rights far beyond anything that anyone could have

Official 

1 imagined asking for back then. 

2  Ours --

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your reading -- your 

4 reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere, 

the copyright owner loses control of distribution 

6 everywhere. 

7  That is essentially your argument. 

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is correct, 

9 Your Honor. And to put a finer point on it, ours is 

that "lawfully made under this title" means made 

11 wherever, in a way that satisfies U.S. copyright 

12 standards, made in accordance with --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- but -- so this 

14 notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights 

everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal 

16 exhaustion principle. 

17  MR. ROSENKRANZ: International exhaustion. 

18 Yes, Your Honor. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And we are told that no 

country has adopted that international exhaustion 

21 regime, that most countries adhere to the national 

22 exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here. 

23 That is, if it's manufactured in the United States and 

24 sold in the United States, that copy belongs to the 

person who purchased it, end of case. But if the 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 exhaustion doctrine applies only nationally, then your 

2 argument is asking for something that runs against the 

3 regime that is accepted in most places. 

4  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I have a few 

answers to that. The first is it is not true that no 

6 country adopts national exhaustion. Congress adopted 

7 national exhaustion in sections 905 and 906 6 years 

8 after the statute was passed, as to microchips. 

9  But second, Wiley is making the point that 

there is now a norm. They say most States -- most 

11 countries, that is. Back in 1976 Wiley is not even 

12 arguing that there was any international norm, much less 

13 that the drafters of the statute were focused on 

14 international norms; and the truth is that there isn't 

an international consensus around national exhaustion. 

16 We know that for a fact. In 1994 when 125 nations got 

17 together, they -- they agreed to disagree on 

18 international copyright exhaustion principles, and they 

19 codified that disagreement, to each his own, in the 

TRIPS agreement. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take, for 

22 example, the European Union, the position in -- in those 

23 countries. Suppose we -- we just transformed --

24 transferred this case to one of those countries, the 

exact same case; and my understanding is that they would

1 follow the national exhaustion.
 

2  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, not to
 

3 quibble; they don't follow national exhaustion. They
 

4 follow regional exhaustion. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not -- not 

6 exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's 

7 home free all over the world. 

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Agreed, Your Honor, but it 

9 is regional, it's not national. And -- and the point 

here is we've got to of course read what Congress wrote. 

11 What Congress wrote was "lawfully made under this 

12 title," not "lawfully made in the United States," or not 

13 "lawfully made under this title and made in the United 

14 States." When Congress wants to say that, Congress says 

that very explicitly. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you mean by "lawfully 

17 made under this title," simply lawfully made in a manner 

18 that does not violate United States copyright law? 

19  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. Just, I --

I would say "lawfully made under this title" means 

21 lawfully made in a manner that does not violate the 

22 standards articulated. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: The standards, okay. So --

24 so it could be lawfully made in England, let's say; in a 

country that has compulsory licensing, it could be 

6

Official 

1 lawfully made there, but it would not be lawfully made 

2 under our -- under our copyright law, because we don't 

3 have that. 

4  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Let me 

give a -- an example that actually is consistent with 

6 what --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so at least they are 

8 correct in contending that what you are arguing for is 

9 -- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the 

United States copyright law had applied where it was 

11 made; is that what you are saying? 

12  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. And the 

13 reason is --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: No?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- that that statute that 

16 you just described would only do a third of the job of 

17 the first-sale doctrine. Everyone agrees the first-sale 

18 doctrine applies at a minimum to products made in the 

19 United States. And if you use that counterfactual, if 

U.S. law had applied, it would indicate that it, the 

21 first-sale doctrine, does not apply in situations where 

22 it was made in the United States. So the 

23 counterfactual --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't follow 

that.

Official 

1  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So the first-sale doctrine 

2 applies to goods made in the United States --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

4  MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- and to goods made 

outside of the United States, is our argument. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

7  MR. ROSENKRANZ: If it applies in the United 

8 States, if we're talking about goods made in the United 

9 States, the counterfactual "if this title had applied" 

would not work, because this title does apply to the 

11 goods made in the United States, and that's the core of 

12 the first-sale doctrine. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is 

14 what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that 

this language means non-piratical copies as that is 

16 defined by U.S. copyright law? 

17  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, if I may 

18 just change one word, because "piratical" is a 

19 mischievous word. Back in the day when the -- when the 

1976 statute was passed, "piratical" meant unlawful 

21 under the laws of other countries. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: No. 

23  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes. So --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: I said as defined by U.S. 

copyright law.

25

Official 

1  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely. And -- and the 

2 key --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: So that's, that's what the 

4 statute means. It's -- the statute in your view is 

setting up a distinction between piratical, pirated, 

6 whatever the term is -- copies --

7  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Counterfeit. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and other copies, and 

9 saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S. 

copyright law? 

11  MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is right. And Your 

12 Honor, the reason was -- what was driving copyright 

13 owners crazy was this notion that there were lawless 

14 states out there that had no significant copyright 

protection. And we were applying their standards to 

16 products that were infiltrating the U.S. market. And 

17 one of the most important things to underscore here, 

18 which I think got lost in the Costco argument, is that 

19 the space -- that 602 does an enormous amount of work 

even with 109, the first-sale doctrine, carved out of 

21 it. 

22  Copyright owners wanted three things out of 

23 the 1976 Act with respect to importation, and they got 

24 two and a half of them. The first was what we've just 

been talking about, Your Honor. It was driving them 

9

25

Official 

1 crazy that there were lawless states out there; they
 

2 gave the example of Russia, which -- where an agency
 

3 approved the making and distribution within Russia of
 

4 classic English language works. They got imported to
 

the U.S. and they were competing with U.S. works, U.S. 

6 copies within our domestic market. And they got their 

7 wish to shut that down, to use U.S. law as the standard 

8 for those works. 

9  Secondly, they got coverage for copies that 

were lawfully made, but stolen. And this was the one 

11 ask that the film industry had. We see it in the 

12 colloquies. They rented films abroad. The films --

13 that was their business model. The films would get 

14 stolen; and the U.S. market would be awash with stolen 

films. And so they wanted to shut down, with the 

16 importation provision, those stolen goods coming into 

17 the U.S. market. 

18  And the third thing that they wanted is --

19 is what's been dominating this debate. But it's only 

the third thing, and that was help dividing geographic 

21 markets, so that they could go after the rogue 

22 distributors, yes, but also go after the downstream 

23 sales. They got half of that. They got a cause of 

24 action against the rogue distributors. They did not get 

a cause of action that went downstream.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Rosenkranz, can I 

2 ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think 

3 it has a theoretical impact. A manufacturer can choose 

4 to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract 

with someone here to manufacture their goods. They 

6 could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the 

7 world, directly. They can choose to license their 

8 trademark and permit a distributor abroad to manufacture 

9 under their U.S. copyright; or they can permit the 

licensee to register the copyright abroad and 

11 distribute. In your definition of "lawfully made under 

12 this title," does "lawfully made under this title" apply 

13 to all of those situations, i.e. --

14  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I think clearly to 

16 the manufacturer who manufactures abroad --

17  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- clearly to the 

19 manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it. 

But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner 

21 who basically gives the copyright to a foreign 

22 distributor and lets the foreign distributor -- register 

23 it abroad? 

24  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The only 

question under our definition is, was the making lawful, 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 which is to say, was it authorized, whether it's by 

2 transfer of licensing or by transfer of copyright or in 

3 any other way? Is it lawful as measured by U.S. 

4 standards? And -- and the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is -- that is 

6 broader than I thought. Then I'm not quite sure why you 

7 don't mean if this title applied. Because if the --

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: If --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the manufacturer who 

is manufacturing under the English copyright, because 

11 the distributor has an English copyright, is not 

12 manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are 

13 manufacturing under the English copyright. 

14  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Right. And, Your Honor, 

the reason that the language works the way we've 

16 described is because we are not focusing on whether the 

17 making was under this title; we're focusing on whether 

18 it was lawful under this title. Does this -- would this 

19 title, when you apply it to wherever it happens to be, 

whether in the United States or abroad, would this title 

21 say that this is authorized? 

22  Now, let me just circle back again. The 

23 reason if this title had been applicable doesn't work is 

24 because there are enormous numbers of situations, 

probably three-quarters of them, that the First Sale 

12

Official 

1 Doctrine applies to where this title does apply. 

2  And so trying to say where -- you know, if 

3 this title had applied would work for foreign goods 

4 coming in, but not for U.S. goods, which is the core of 

the First Sale Doctrine.
 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have to
 

7 say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured
 

8 directly and received an American copyright and
 

9 satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the
 

case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the 

11 conditions of the American statute, even though, for 

12 technical reasons, it didn't apply. 

13  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. And, in 

14 fact, (a)(2) --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what your argument 

16 is, I take it. 

17  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes. In 2008 --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: So we are off on a kind of 

19 curly cue here.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. But -- so 

21 what Congress did was to find a much simpler, more 

22 efficient way to say all of that. 

23  In 2008, it figured that out and put --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: I take it that the reason 

they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because 

13

25

Official 

1 they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody 

2 under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they 

3 were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer 

4 lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage 

of the First Sale Doctrine. 

6  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: He's in the middle of 

8 printing it. And therefore you have to change the 

9 language. So they changed the language to "lawfully 

made under this title." 

11  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Correct. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right; or, if I am 

13 wrong, why did they change it? 

14  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, that is exactly 

right. And just not to diminish it --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it all right? Wasn't 

17 there also the question of allowing manufacturers to 

18 segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad, 

19 governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States 

governed by U.S. law? Wasn't segmentation of the market 

21 allowing people to do just what these people are doing? 

22  MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Justice Ginsburg, my 

23 answer to Justice Breyer was about why the language in 

24 109 was changed, that is, from "obtained possession" to 

"lawfully made." 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1  And that was -- what Justice Breyer pointed 

2 out was exactly why, because -- and not to minimize 

3 bailees, bailees was the movie industry problem. 

4 Bailees was stealing things from the manufacturers' 

loading docks or from shippers. But, yes, Your Honor, 

6 there was also a segment of the publishing industry that 

7 wanted that third thing. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I couldn't find a word. I 

9 could not find a word of that in the legislative 

history. Irwin Karp, who was the strongest 

11 representative for the publishers, said you couldn't do 

12 that ten years earlier. 

13  So is there --

14  MR. ROSENKRANZ: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but you just said yes 

16 in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. So she'll 

17 find exactly what there is there, so I would like to 

18 know what it is. 

19  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I -- I was 

answering yes to was this a motivation of the 

21 publishers. And if I misunderstood the question, Your 

22 Honor --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: But a motivation for 109, or 

24 a motivation for 602?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: A motivation for 602.

1  When the conversation turned to 109, 

2 Your Honor, not a word was uttered about dividing 

3 distribution or divided markets. It was all about this 

4 problem --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So on 602, you said that one 

6 of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of 

7 markets. They got half of it. They got the rogue 

8 distributors' half. 

9  And I guess Mr. Olson makes the point, and 

it seems a good one, it's like that's a crazy half to 

11 have gotten. That's the kind that they don't need 

12 because they have a contractual remedy about -- against 

13 the distributors. 

14  And then they don't get people like, 

frankly, your client, who are rogue something elses, 

16 with no contractual privity. And what sense does that 

17 make? 

18  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, it makes perfect 

19 sense, Your Honor. Obviously, you know, the industry, 

at least back in 1976, did not get everything that they 

21 wanted. What they got was a much more powerful weapon 

22 than a contract. 

23  I mean, a copyright weapon gives you 

24 injunctive relief, gives you multiples of damages which 

you don't get out of a contract remedy.

1  But to Justice Breyer's point, because I 

2 think it's an important one, when you go to the 

3 history -- and I think you are right, Your Honor, that 

4 there is exactly one spot in the drafting history where 

the relationship between 602 and 109 was discussed. It 

6 was that conversation between Clark and Goldman, who was 

7 the general counsel of the copyright office. 

8  It's on pages 11 to 12 of our reply brief. 

9 It's recited in extensive detail in the amicus brief 

that Costco submitted. And here's what happened. They 

11 got their importation provision. And Karp says, now, 

12 wait a minute, I don't get it. You have got this 

13 importation provision, and you've got this First Sale 

14 Doctrine. They are at war with each other. Which one 

wins? 

16  They seem to be agreeing that first sale 

17 wins, but they realize that there is this problem. And 

18 what they do, the general counsel of the copyright 

19 office says, we obviously haven't thought this through. 

We need to do more work on this, says the librarian of 

21 Congress. And the next thing that happens, you see it 

22 in a red line on page 13 of our reply brief, is that for 

23 the first time in the drafting history, the two are 

24 reconciled by making 602 subordinate to 109, in exactly 

the way that Quality King found it to be.

1  So the copyright owners got half the loaf. 

2 It may not have been the half that was more important to 

3 them, but they got a lot more from the extension of the 

4 -- the importation provision.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rosenkranz, there is
 

6 that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's
 

7 fair to say, unfortunate to your position. Is your
 

8 basic view of that passage that it was simply
 

9 ill-considered dicta that we should ignore?


 MR. ROSENKRANZ: To put it bluntly, yes. 

11 That's my ultimate position. But I do think it can be 

12 reconciled with our position. 

13  Let's start with the question presented in 

14 Quality King is exactly the question that is presented 

here, and the Court answered it yes, that is, do 

16 imports -- is 109 applicable to imports. 

17  The whole driving logic of Quality King is 

18 about 109 trumping 602. And it's only in that part IV, 

19 where the court is rebutting various attacks on its 

position, that it gets to that dictum, and that dictum 

21 is in the third tier explanation to one of five 

22 rebuttals. 

23  I believe it can be reconciled, certainly in 

24 result. What you had there was the foreign distributor 

who had only British rights importing directly into the 

18

Official 

1 United States. There was never a first sale. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, in result, but not in 

3 reasoning. The passage specifically says this was 

4 presumably not to be lawfully made under this title.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And I have an -- I agree 

6 with you, Your Honor. I have an explanation. I offer 

7 it tentatively. I'm not sure whether it's right or not, 

8 either as to what the Court intended or under the 

9 statute.

 My hunch is the Court was thinking about a 

11 scenario where the British publisher only needs 10,000 

12 copies to cover Britain; but, instead, what it does is 

13 to print 100,000 copies. Everyone would know that that 

14 is not authorized, it's not lawfully made under this 

title, because the intent is to send it over to the 

16 United States. So it's not lawfully made at that 

17 moment. 

18  Let me also just mention an important 

19 undergirding to our position, which is that our position 

is the only one that does not make a complete hash out 

21 of every uses of the same phrase -- every use of the 

22 same phrase in the rest of the statute. Wiley's reading 

23 makes almost all of them nonsensical. 

24  So let me just give you an example. Section 

110, the classroom provision. Wiley acknowledges this

1 is the result, but doesn't explain why Congress would 

2 ever have wanted it. The result is that a teacher can 

3 go and buy a Beethoven record and play it to her class 

4 if it was made in the United States. But if she flips 

one past it to the next Beethoven record that happens to 

6 have been made in Asia, she can't play that for her 

7 class. 

8  Or section 109(c), the public display, the 

9 Buffalo Cafe owner is allowed to purchase something in 

the United States and put it up on her walls, you know, 

11 say, a picture of Niagara Falls. That is permissible, 

12 if it was made in the United States. But off the same 

13 retail rack, she flips one past; if it was made in Asia, 

14 it's not permissible.

 Nor does Wiley explain why Congress would 

16 adopt an exception to the First Sale Doctrine that is 

17 not at all about sales, that is only about where copies 

18 were made. 

19  So a U.S. manufacturer who wants to sell 

into the U.S. market has this incentive to go and send 

21 jobs overseas. It's an irresistible incentive if the 

22 law is -- if this Court says the law is what Wiley says. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has that ever happened? 

24 I mean, the Ninth Circuit cases have been around for 

some time. Has any manufacturer ever moved abroad?

1  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm sure it
 

2 has. They haven't announced it. Now, let me just be
 

3 clear. The Ninth Circuit came out with its opinion,
 

4 this Court has intervened twice, so the law has never
 

been settled in Wiley's favor. The courts were split. 

6  The moment that a manufacturer learns that 

7 this Court says you get what we've called the Holy Grail 

8 of manufacturing, endless eternal downstream control 

9 over sales and rentals, you can ruin secondary markets 

that are competing with you, the moment that happens, 

11 that will be yet another reason for manufacturers 

12 silently to decide that they're headed -- that they're 

13 sending their manufacturing overseas. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of -- of those -- of those 

courts that did hold the way your -- your opponent 

16 would -- would have it, am I correct that only one of 

17 them adopted the absolutist rule? 

18  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, there are 

19 only three courts of appeals that have weighed in, but 

yes, the Second Circuit is the only one that has adopted 

21 the absolutist rule, and that's yet another problem with 

22 Wiley's position. Wiley urges its position as a matter 

23 of statutory interpretation, but is refusing to stand by 

24 it. The moment it gets past the language of the 

statute, every argument it makes is an argument that is

4 statutory language.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The government argues in 

6 effect for -- what we might call it -- a common law 

7 adaptation of Bobbs-Merrill. 

8  MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, which --

9 which is even -- creates even more mischief. The 

government's position, as I understand it, is 109 

11 doesn't have to do any work. In service of giving more 

12 berth, you know, greater magnitude to 602, we're going 

13 to make 109 completely superfluous because Bobbs-Merrill 

14 does all of the work.

 Now, 109 Congress said -- it put into the 

16 statute, it said it on every recodification to codify 

17 Bobbs-Merrill, and the government is now making 109 

18 completely irrelevant, but picking and choosing, 

19 deciding that it wants the limitation on us from 109, 

but borrowing from Bobbs-Merrill some reservoir of law 

21 that modifies the first-sale doctrine.

1 as a matter of copyright theory, I had always understood 

2 copyright to -- a copyright holder has a kind of a 

3 bundle of rights. It's not one right that applies 

4 everywhere in the world. It's you have your U.S. rights 

and you have your Chinese rights, you have your rights 

6 under each jurisdiction's law. 

7  And your position is essentially to say that 

8 when I sell my Chinese rights to somebody, I'm also 

9 selling my U.S. rights to that same person, because the 

person who has the Chinese rights can just turn around 

11 and import the goods. I mean, that's the nature of your 

12 position, isn't it, that your U.S. rights are always 

13 attached when you sell more -- your rights under the 

14 jurisdiction of another country?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -- so first, Your 

16 Honor, back in 1976, this notion of geographic division 

17 was very, very new, so it's not at all clear what 

18 Congress was thinking with that -- with respect to that. 

19 But secondly, no, we're not -- we're not saying that 

when the owner sells his Chinese -- its Chinese rights 

21 to the Chinese company, it is selling all rights. 

22 Certainly, the Chinese company cannot sell everywhere, 

23 but after that first sale, all of the manufacturer's 

24 rights are cut off.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

7  MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

8 please the Court: 

9  Petitioner's commercial enterprise is 

precisely what Section 602(a)(1) was enacted to address, 

11 an international gray market in copyrighted works. This 

12 Court unanimously recognized in the Quality King case 

13 that 602(a)(1) encompasses copies of books that were 

14 lawfully made not under the United States' Copyright 

Act, but under the law of some other country. 

16  602(a) is broader than 6 -- 109(a), because 

17 it encompasses copies not subject to the first-sale 

18 doctrine, for example copies made under the law of 

19 another country. These are the words of every member of 

this Court in the Quality King case. 

21  Now, referring to it as dicta misstates what 

22 was going on in the Quality King case. The argument was 

23 that if you interpret 602(a) and 109(a) as allowing a 

24 defense, a first-sale defense, you emasculate Section 

602(a), and so the Court was explaining on page 147 and

1 148, I believe, why there were three reasons why 602(a) 

2 would have viability. And one of those reasons had to 

3 do with direct action against someone that was engaged 

4 in pirating, and some of it had to do with bailees and 

lessees. These are relatively small problems either 

6 otherwise dealt with by contract law or otherwise dealt 

7 with by the provisions of the statute. 

8  But the third reason for the Court's 

9 interpretation and its decision in that case was 

precisely the case that we're talking about here. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it may be important 

12 dictum, but do you really want to argue it wasn't 

13 dictum? 

14  MR. OLSON: I do.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It was the holding of the 

16 case? 

17  MR. OLSON: It was the holding of the case 

18 in the sense that it was necessary, the Court felt. And 

19 we could -- you know, I don't -- I don't feel I want to 

spend a lot of time arguing what the word "dicta" means, 

21 but it was a necessary ingredient to what the Court felt 

22 was an explanation for why it was deciding the case that 

23 it was deciding.

books into the United States, period. 

6  MR. OLSON: That's --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the only -- so there's 

8 plenty of meaning there. The question is what happens 

9 when he sells it to his bookstore and you or I go in and 

buy it and we want to give a copy to our wife when we 

11 get back to the United States. The question is, did --

covered by the various provisions of the copyright 

6 statute. And the question is, is it covered by section 

7 2 -- 602(a)(1)?  Yes, it's an import of an acquired 

8 copy. Do you have a defense under the first-sale 

9 doctrine? And I go to the exact explicit language of 

the statute. There may be exceptions under other 

11 provisions of the copyright law, but the first-sale 

12 doctrine, 109(a) specifically says "lawfully made under 

13 this title." 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: The reason -- what I was 

trying to bring up and I didn't do it artfully --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: -- is, imagine Toyota, all 

18 right? Millions sold in the United States. They have 

19 copyrighted sound systems. They have copyrighted GPS 

systems. When people buy them in America, they think

4 And that's what you were doing in the -- in the Quality

7 was specifically saying what it would apply to, and 

8 it -- what -- what the Court was talking about in that 

9 case was books made not pursuant to title, but pursuant 

to some other country's copyright law. This copyright

13 copyright owner who contracts in England to make 

14 books -- he doesn't have an English copyright, he just 

simply chooses that place to manufacture as opposed to 

16 the U.S. -- why is he making that copy under English law 

17 and not under his rights of U.S. copyright? 

18  MR. OLSON: Well, if he is doing -- if he is 

19 manufacturing the book in England, he's not -- because 

the copyright law does not have extraterritorial 

21 application, he is not making those copies under this

interpretation of the statute is to interpret it as --

6 as the petitioner --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, we know from 

8 the Karp exchange that the response was, this is 

9 something that we have to study with care, in 1976.

 The parade of horribles is now causing the 

11 Solicitor General and at least one, if not two, courts 

12 of appeals to write exceptions into the language to take 

13 care of what they perceive as horribles. 

14  Isn't it incumbent upon us to give the 

statute what is plainly a more rational plain meaning 

16 than to try to give it a meaning and then fix it because 

17 we understand that the meaning doesn't make sense? 

18  MR. OLSON: I -- there -- there is a body of 

19 the government of the United States that is entitled and 

capable of fixing this. These parade of horribles have 

21 been -- people have been arguing about these for years. 

22 For 30 years, the statute has been interpreted the way 

23 that we are suggesting that it should be under this 

24 title, which this Court earlier this year, in another 

case, in the Novo Nordisk case, specifically said, under

6 itself; and then under this section appears twice in 

7 sections 602(a) --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz told us 

9 that under this title means different things in other 

sections, and he gave a number of examples. 

11  MR. OLSON: Yes, and -- and in each case --

12 first of all, if the interpretation that my opponent is 

13 arguing for was the law, that -- those are the words 

14 that are in 602(b) and 602(a)(2). So Congress could 

have used those words that our opponents are arguing 

16 for, and did use those words, one of which was written 

17 on the same time in the same -- passed in the same time, 

18 in 1976, that 602(a)(1) was.

1 of those, if you interpret the statute as under this

4 is used there.

 And -- and there is only one real way to 

6 interpret under this title in the provisions in 109(a) 

7 in -- in conjunction with 602(a)(1), and that is the way 

8 the Court decided it in the Quality King case, 

9 specifically looking at this question.

 Now the facts were slightly different in the 

11 sense that that was a round trip; this isn't a round 

12 trip. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I take you back to the 

14 words here, "lawfully made under this title," which you 

say clearly means what you say it means. 

16  So, I find this language a little bit 

17 perplexing, and I can kind of see it both ways. So what 

18 you say is made under this title, that must mean made in 

19 the United States, and "lawfully," just as this little 

word that's -- that modifies that basic phrase, "made 

21 under this title," which means made in the United 

22 States. 

23  But what Mr. Rosenkranz essentially says --

24 he doesn't say it in these words, but he says, "The 

focus of this provision is on 'lawfully made.'" That is

3  Now, when we just say lawfully made, you 

4 know, we need something to measure, well, how do we know 

whether it's lawfully made? Well, you look to the rules 

6 in the copyright law. 

7  So if you just -- if you focus more on the 

8 lawfully word, lawfully made, and then under this title 

9 doesn't mean made in the United States, it means 

lawfully made under the rules of this title. 

11  MR. OLSON: Lawfully made under this title 

12 is lawfully made under the copyright laws of the United 

13 States. It can't say, 'lawfully made in the United 

14 States,' because then something might --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, lawfully made, under 

16 the rules of the United States, regardless where the 

17 thing was manufactured, is what I'm saying. That's the 

18 way -- it just seems to me as though --

19  MR. OLSON: It --

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- you are saying made must 

21 be manufactured. But lawfully made is a lawfully made 

22 copy. How do we know if it's lawfully made? We look to

6 compatible with the laws of the United States. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: But what about litigation 

8 in this respect? I want to bring you back to the

12 the person bringing books into the United States, there 

13 are other defenses, including fair use. There are other 

14 defenses under the copyright law. But -- and one of the 

things is that, to a certain extent, if you're going to 

16 use the product created by someone else in a way that's 

17 contemplated by the copyright laws, maybe it's required 

18 that you actually comply with the copyright laws by 

19 going to the owner of the copyright and saying, look,

your position is right, that a court would say, it's a

8  MR. OLSON: It may be a fair use. It may be 

9 an implied license, for example, with respect to 

copyrighted items or trademarked items that appear in a 

11 product that was licensed abroad. The government has 

12 offered another alternative interpretation of the word 

13 "made," as putting it in the flow of commerce. That 

14 might deal with some of these situations.

 But the point I guess I am making, 

16 Mr. Chief Justice, is that Congress was clearly 

17 intending to talk about the vast gray market problem. 

18 This provision --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, intending where? I 

mean, I -- you spend a lot of time talking about the 

21 legislative history and the purposes behind 602. But 

22 the language that we're supposed to be interpreting is 

23 the language in section 109. And the language in 

24 section 109, as far as I can see, there's really nothing 

to support your argument that that language was intended

1 to address this gray market problem. 

2  Isn't that correct? 

3  MR. OLSON: Well, no. I think that section 

4 109 and 602(a) were adopted in the same statute. They 

were put in the draft of the statute at the same time, 

6 in 1964. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you know, section 109 is 

8 just a rewording of a prior provision that you would 

9 clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing 

to do with where any product was manufactured. And what 

11 you're suggesting is that we should read this change in 

12 wording -- which actually, there's a real theory behind 

13 what the change in wording meant that has nothing to do 

14 with the place of manufacture, that we should read it as 

incorporating a place of manufacture requirement, 

16 because there was a separate debate going on in section 

17 602 about that question. 

18  MR. OLSON: But the -- but the two pro --

19 what I'm -- I guess what I'm trying to explain is that 

the two were enacted at the same time. They were out 

21 there and available to the public for 12 years before 

22 they were finally adopted. These parade of horribles 

23 could have been addressed by Congress in a different way 

24 at the time, and the interpretation -- this is a -- 109 

is a defense -- is offered as a defense to section -- to

1 section 602(a)(1). 

2  So what does it mean? What provide -- what 

3 is the defense that's provided? And you then have to 

4 interpret, "made under this" -- "lawfully made under 

this title." What does that mean? 

6  And you have done that in the Quality King 

7 case. You explained in the Quality King unanimously 

8 that it makes a difference because you are exhausting --

9 Congress intended to allow segmentation of the market. 

It only makes sense to interpret this way if you allow 

11 segmentation of the market pursuant to these provisions, 

12 because it is exhausting the copyright under the laws of 

13 the United States once you make a sale of a product 

14 produced in the United States subject to the United 

States' copyright laws. 

16  You are not exhausting your U.S. copyright 

17 when you make something, or allow something to be made 

18 abroad. You are not exhausting that copyright. You 

19 have not done that yet. So the first sale is not 

something that happens abroad that uses up the copyright 

21 laws -- of the protection under the copyright laws of 

22 the United States. 

23  So it seems to me that this does make 

24 perfect sense. And it makes -- there is not going to be 

a perfect solution in every case. The Court has dealt

1 with that frequently with respect to copyright laws.

4 precisely like this.


 It's not necessary in this case to decide
 

6 every single permutation of a problem that someone
 

7 crosses a border with a product, but this section 602
 

8 specifically contemplates products that are acquired
 

9 abroad and then brought back into the United States.
 

Here, we have a commercial enterprise doing exactly what 

11 is contemplated by the people who were talking about 

12 602(a) and section 109 when the two were adopted at the 

13 same time. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, do you have an 

answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that 

16 if you read the statute as you are urging, then you are 

17 inviting the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs? 

18  MR. OLSON: There are several answers to 

19 that. One, that's Congress's concern. And -- and there 

is no evidence that that would really actually happen. 

21 And Congress was concerned with creating a segmentation 

22 of the market. But it's entirely speculative as to 

23 whether or not people are going to start manufacturing 

24 books or other items outside the United States.

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,
 

8  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 

9  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  I would like to discuss -- begin by 

13 discussing our Bobbs-Merrill argument, because it's a 

14 part of our brief that's different from both the 

parties' submissions, and I do think it's very important 

16 to understanding the practical implications of the 

17 Court's decision. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, may I ask 

19 you a preliminary question? In Quality King the 

government took the position that the Petitioner is 

21 taking here. What led the government to change its 

22 mind? Was it just what has been called "dictum" in 

23 Quality King, or is there another reason why the 

24 government has switched sides?

 MR. STEWART: I think there are two related

25

Official 

1 reasons, and one of them is the dictum, but I'll get to 

2 that second. 

3  I think in both cases, our overriding 

4 objective was to offer a reading of section 109(a) that 

would not supersede, or would not effectively negate the 

6 importation prohibition in section 602(a)(1), because 

7 from the Copyright Office's perspective, we agree with 

8 Mr. Olson that the primary reason for the enactment of 

9 602(a)(1) was to facilitate market segmentation. And 

the argument we made in Quality King was you can 

11 accomplish that; you can prevent section 109(a) --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you point to 

13 something in the legislative history to support that? 

14  MR. STEWART: I think the best thing I could 

point to is a report of the Registrar of Copyrights that 

16 was issued in 1965, in which the Copyright Office 

17 identified as one of the circumstances that would be 

18 covered by the importation ban, the situation in which, 

19 quote, "the copyright owner had authorized the -- the 

manufacture of copies in a foreign country for 

21 distribution only in that country." 

22  It didn't use the phrase "market 

23 segmentation," but clearly, the point was the same. You 

24 are authorizing copies to be made abroad for 

distribution only in that place, not for redistribution 

43

1 here. 

2  And so --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: So Mr. Stewart, if I 

4 understand your argument, both here and in Quality King 

you want the copyright holder to have some control over 

6 importation, but at the same time you don't want the 

7 copyright holder to have control over all downstream 

8 sales. 

9  MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's what your 

11 Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do. It's designed 

12 to prevent that. 

13  MR. STEWART: That's correct. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Coming back to Justice 

Ginsburg's question, do you think that truly the way to 

16 do those two things, to give the copyright holder 

17 control over importation, but not over downstream sales, 

18 that our problem really is, do you think in your heart 

19 of hearts that we got it wrong in Quality King?

 MR. STEWART: Well, we lost that case 9-0, 

21 and so I am not arguing too vociferously that the Court 

22 should change its opinion. But yes, we think that we 

23 still would adhere to our view that section 109(a) 

24 should not be read as a limitation on section 602(a)(1). 

If the Court had gone that path, it could read "lawfully 

44

1 made under this title" to encompass both foreign-made
 

2 and domestic-made copies, without doing damage to the
 

3 copyright holder's ability to segment markets.
 

4  On the other hand --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you get what you 

6 wanted anyway? That's really the bottom line. We undo 

7 Quality King, except that the price is that people have 

8 to ship their manufacturing abroad. 

9  MR. STEWART: Well, we're not urging the 

Court to take that course, but yes, that would have been 

11 one way to accomplish the same objective. And so --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: So you are essentially 

13 saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to 

14 make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the 

copyright holder control over the importation, to give 

16 Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr. 

17 Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there? 

18  MR. STEWART: I think that's correct, but I 

19 think our Bobbs-Merrill argument does provide a very 

principled way to stop it there without going back on 

21 what the Court said in Quality King. That is, 

22 Bobbs-Merrill was a 1908 case in which the publisher 

23 sold books to retailers on the proviso that they not be 

24 sold at retail for less than a specified amount. One of 

the retailers violated that resale restriction and was 

45

1 sued for copyright infringement. 

2  And this Court in Bobbs-Merrill said --

3 parsed the statutory language, which at that time gave 

4 the copyright owner the exclusive right to vend copies 

of the work.
 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: But you're saying
 

7 Bobbs-Merrill means something beyond section 109, but
 

8 when -- the 1909 Copyright Act said that it was
 

9 codifying the holding in Bobbs-Merrill, and the 1976
 

statute, which is now before us, said it wasn't changing 

11 the meaning of the earlier law. So I don't know how --

12 Bobbs-Merrill wasn't a constitutional decision, it was a 

13 question of statutory interpretation. 

14  So how does some sliver of Bobbs-Merrill 

still survive all of this? 

16  MR. STEWART: Maybe I can put it this way: 

17 If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was 

18 illegally made without the consent of the copyright 

19 owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I 

can't rely on 109(a) because the copy was not lawfully 

21 made under this title. But I still couldn't be held 

22 liable for copyright infringement because there is no 

23 exclusive right to read the book or to own it. I 

24 wouldn't have been infringing any of the copyright 

owner's rights. 

46
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1  And so in order to have a valid claim for 

2 copyright infringement, the copyright owner would have 

3 to show both that 109(a) was inapplicable, and that what 

4 the defendant was doing was a violation, an infringement 

of one of the exclusive rights. 

6  And Mr. Rosenkranz seems to postulate a 

7 situation in which a cagey manufacturer would locate its 

8 facilities overseas, make the copies there, import them 

9 into the United States, sell them in this country, 

subject to conditions on resale. 

11  And if the goods were resold in violation of 

12 those restrictions, the copyright owner would sue for 

13 infringement. And I think the first argument the 

14 defendant would make is that is exactly the conduct that 

the Court in Bobbs-Merrill said did not infringe the 

16 exclusive right to vend. 

17  Now -- namely the resale in violation of 

18 restrictions on resale. How can you now say it's now an 

19 infringement of the exclusive right to distribute? And 

it would be a particularly difficult argument for the 

21 copyright owner to make because what the House Report 

22 said in 1909, it didn't say exactly that it was 

23 codifying the holding of Bobbs-Merrill; it said that it 

24 was amending the statute in other respects, and it 

wanted to make clear that there was no intent to enlarge 

47

Official 

1 the exclusive right to vend.
 

2  And so the Plaintiff, in Mr. Rosenkranz's
 

3 hypothetical, would in effect be arguing that by
 

4 codifying section 109(a), Congress had implicitly
 

expanded the scope of the implicit -- of the exclusive 

6 right to vend or distribute, even though it said it was 

7 doing the various opposite. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an awfully 

9 difficult maze for somebody to -- to get through. You 

have to start with the difficulty of the language here, 

11 and then you have to proceed and put the Quality King 

12 gloss over it; and, when you finally get to that point, 

13 you say, well, now you've got to read Bobbs-Merrill and 

14 figure out how the common law governs all that.

 MR. STEWART: But I think that would be true 

16 under anybody's reading. That is, once a court in a 

17 case determined for whatever reason that section 109(a) 

18 was inapplicable, it didn't provide a safe harbor, the 

19 next step could never be simply to proceed to judgment 

and say that there was infringement. The next step 

21 would always have to be to look at what the defendant 

22 had done --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not that 

24 complicated under the Petitioner's approach. It says 

once you've you had a first sale, that's it. 

48
 
Alderson Reporting Company

10

15

20

25

Official 

1  MR. STEWART: The other point I would make 

2 about the Petitioner's approach is that it -- it really 

3 has no grounding in the statutory text. That is, the 

4 Petitioner is arguing that if the publisher in Thailand, 

if the manufacturer of the books had shipped them 

6 directly into this country, that person could have been 

7 sued for infringement for the importation and --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the word has 

9 grounding. It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it 

says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or 

11 sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition 

12 is no good. And Coke says, and that's how it should be. 

13  And now that's picked up in Bobbs-Merrill; 

14 it's picked up in Dr. Miles. It's been the law.

 Now if, in fact, there are two ways of 

16 interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with 

17 that basic principle of commercial law, and the other 

18 produces some of the complexities that you have just 

19 mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and 

simply reaffirm a principle that's been in the 

21 commercial law almost forever? 

22  MR. STEWART: I -- I give two answers for 

23 that. And the first is that Coke was saying that, in 

24 most circumstances at least, a sale is sufficient in 

order to divest the owner of his prior right to control 

49
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 distribution, but it doesn't say that a sale is 

2 necessary. 

3  And my point is that when Mr. Rosenkranz 

4 says the hypothetical foreign publisher who makes copies 

with authorization but ships it into the -- them into 

6 the United States without could be held liable for 

7 infringement, there is nothing in section 109(a) that 

8 would allow a court to draw that distinction; that is, 

9 although 109(a) is sometimes referred to as a 

codification of the First Sale Doctrine, it doesn't 

11 require an antecedent first sale. 

12  So as long as the foreign publisher was the 

13 owner of the books at the type -- time they were 

14 manufactured, if those books were lawfully made under 

this title, under Petitioner's reading they could be 

16 imported and distributed. 

17  We know also that this was not an oversight, 

18 that Congress didn't intend the provision to be subject 

19 to a sort of implicit first authorized sale requirement, 

because the language was intended to cover copies that 

21 were made pursuant to a compulsory license. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Which of the following is 

23 worse: All of the horribles that the Petitioner 

24 outlines to the extent they are realistic, or the 

frustration of market segmentation, to the extent that

1 would occur, if Petitioner's position were accepted?
 

2  MR. STEWART: Well, if they actually
 

3 happened, then I think the -- the horribles would be
 

4 worse. But, as I say, we -- we feel that we have
 

offered a reading of all the statutory provisions 

6 together that would avoid both. 

7  The other couple of things I would say as to 

8 why a first sale by itself --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: If the -- if that middle 

ground is -- were found to be not viable, which of the 

11 two sets of consequences is worse from the government's 

12 perspective, or can you not say? 

13  MR. STEWART: I would say that the 

14 consequence that all foreign-made goods, even if 

imported into the United States with the authorization 

16 of the U.S. copyright owner, are subject to continuing 

17 licensing requirements, etc., I would say that would be 

18 worse than the frustration of market segmentation that 

19 would occur under Petitioner's view.

1  I just want to step back and take a look at 

2 what the government's doing here. After eloquently 

3 arguing in Quality King in the last two pages of its 

4 brief that our position on the meaning of this language 

is right, it's saying our position is wrong. And then, 

6 it's trying to come up with a middle ground that has 

7 absolutely no basis in the statute. 

8  If Bobbs-Merrill provides the content for 

9 the First Sale Doctrine, then what does section 109 do? 

And so the government is creating a scenario in which, 

11 in order to save 602 from being superfluous in the way 

12 it is described, although we believe it's not 

13 superfluous at all, it is making 109 superfluous. 

14  Justice Kagan asked a question about 

essentially sentence diagramming. Our view is that 

16 'under this title' modifies 'lawfully.' You use the 

17 U.S. metric of U.S. law to figure out whether it's 

18 lawful. The government's and Wiley's position is that 

19 'under this title' modifies both 'made' and 'lawfully.' 

And at least the way I learned grammar, you can't use 

21 the same phrase to modify both terms. 

22  I want to correct something that I said to 

23 Justice Ginsburg because I said it backwards. 905 and 

24 906 are examples of the United States Congress in a 

copyright context applying national exhaustion, and that

1 was six years after this statute was passed. 

2  To Justice Breyer's question, the bear is 

3 there. It is very much there. The only reason no one 

4 has ever pursued these legal arguments is that the legal 

arguments that are the baseline for all of this have yet 

6 to be accepted by this Court. But I have not heard any 

7 argument for why the vast majority of them will not 

8 necessarily obtain, and they are not in any of the 

9 briefs. To use the Toyota example, there simply is no 

other defense. There is none. Fair use doesn't apply 

11 to the vast majority of the scenarios that I've just 

12 described. 

13  Finally, outsourcing: Congress did not want 

14 U.S. jobs to go overseas. Congress in the very same 

statute in section 601 was hoarding manufacturing jobs 

16 to the United States; and as the government said on the 

17 last page of its Quality King, "it is highly unlikely 

18 that the same Congress that hoarded jobs in the United 

19 States was prepared to tolerate a situation in which 

there was eternal downstream control" that the copyright 

21 owners would be encouraged to seize by sending jobs 

22 overseas.
