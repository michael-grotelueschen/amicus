3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next this morning in Case 11-9953, 

Boyer v. Louisiana. 

6  Mr. Bourke? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. BOURKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The Louisiana Court of Appeal in this case 

12 correctly found that the majority of the delay -- the 

13 seven-year delay was caused by the lack of funding, but, 

14 when moving to assess that cause under Barker, 

incorrectly determined that it was a cause beyond the 

16 control of the State and, adopting its earlier ruling 

17 under the State statute, found that it was a cause 

18 beyond the control of the State, in the sense that it 

19 was beyond the control of the local district attorney's 

office. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bourke, was -- was it 

22 within the control of your client? 

23  MR. BOURKE: He was unable to fund himself, 

24 Your Honor. That is why he asked for the appointment of 

counsel.

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was he unable to get his 

2 Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial? 

3  MR. BOURKE: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

MR. BOURKE: That is -- he was unable to 

6 move forward to trial because he was not provided with 

7 counsel adequately funded to advance the --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: He had -- he had one 

9 counsel, right? During the whole time? 

MR. BOURKE: In fact, in a sense, Your 

11 Honor, he had two counsel. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. For part of it, he 

13 had two, and then there was not enough funding for the 

14 second, okay? So he was faced with a choice. 

Louisiana, as I understand it, has adopted a 

16 provision, which the Sixth Amendment does not require. 

17 The Sixth Amendment just requires counsel, but Louisiana 

18 says, in capital cases, we are going to provide two 

19 counsel, and you can't go to trial until you have two 

counsel, okay? 

21  MR. BOURKE: No, Your Honor --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

23  MR. BOURKE: -- that is not correct. That 

24 is not the State of Louisiana law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the State of

25

Official 

1 Louisiana law? 

2  MR. BOURKE: Louisiana absolutely does not 

3 provide a right to two counsel in capital cases. The 

4 Louisiana Supreme Court, in Rule 31, provided that the 

court should appoint two counsel, but, also, it provided 

6 expressly that that created no procedural or substantive 

7 right. 

8  Similarly, there is no right --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't -- I don't 

understand that. That's not Louisiana law that you --

11 that you can't proceed without two counsel? That's not 

12 the law in Louisiana? I thought that's --

13  MR. BOURKE: That is not the law in 

14 Louisiana. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- you don't consider 

16 supreme court rules to be law? 

17  MR. BOURKE: It is a supreme court rule 

18 which directs the trial judge to appoint two counsel. 

19 However, it makes it clear --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the fact that, in 

21 Louisiana, you cannot proceed to trial in a capital 

22 case, unless there are two counsel? 

23  MR. BOURKE: No, Your Honor. That is not 

24 the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then -- then you don't have

1 a case.  You should have proceeded to trial. 

2  MR. BOURKE: No, Your Honor. In -- in this 

3 case, as the court of appeal correctly found, Mr. Boyer 

4 did not have adequate funding for the case to go to 

trial. The court of appeal did not predicate that on 

6 the need for two counsel. The motion to determine 

7 source of funds was not predicated on Rule 31. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The one -- the one 

9 counsel who was qualified, what was his name? 

MR. BOURKE: Mr. Lorenzi was lead certified 

11 counsel. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Lorenzi, yes. He was 

13 only one at the time who was qualified to be lead 

14 counsel? 

MR. BOURKE: Correct. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Louisiana Supreme 

17 Court said, you don't have to do this. You're his --

18 you're his attorney, but you have a right to be paid, 

19 and the State has to pay you. 

So there was no obligation on the counsel's 

21 part to do anything; and he kept asking, please have a 

22 funding order, let me be paid, and I'll do my job. 

23  MR. BOURKE: Yes, Mr. Lorenzi declined to 

24 pay for Mr. Boyer's defense out of his own pocket. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't there, at all times,

1 one counsel who was being paid by the State? 


2  MR. BOURKE: There was --


3  JUSTICE SCALIA: At all times? 


4  MR. BOURKE: There was, at all times, one 


counsel appointed as associate counsel, that is for the 

6 purpose of assisting Mr. Lorenzi as lead counsel. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that counsel qualified 

8 enough under our constitutional Sixth Amendment 

9 jurisprudence? 

MR. BOURKE: Well, I don't understand the --

11 the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to place --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

13  MR. BOURKE: -- a qualification minimum, so 

14 I'm not sure I'm understanding your question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question is would 

16 only lead counsel under -- under the supreme court's 

17 rule qualify as competent counsel, for purposes of 

18 complying with the constitutional requirement? Or would 

19 this certified second chair qualify? 

MR. BOURKE: The -- there is no -- I'm 

21 having trouble answering the question, Justice Scalia, 

22 because the two things don't talk to each other. The 

23 Sixth Amendment doesn't impose a certification 

24 requirement. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. I'm just saying

1 can you establish that the one counsel that your client 

2 had throughout this whole -- whole proceeding would not 

3 satisfy the constitutional requirement? 

4  Can you -- is there any basis for your 

saying that? 

6  MR. BOURKE: Yes, Your Honor. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: What? 

8  MR. BOURKE: The court of appeal twice 

9 found -- knowing that associate counsel had been 

appointed, the court of appeal twice found that the case 

11 could not proceed due to a lack of adequate funding, and 

12 the State --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not because of a Federal 

14 constitutional reason. The court found, you are not 

complying with the supreme court rule. You can't 

16 proceed without complying with the supreme court rule. 

17  It seems to me your client was faced with a 

18 choice: You could either demand what Louisiana, in its 

19 generosity, has given to capital defendants, namely, the 

right to two counsel -- whether it's by statute or by 

21 supreme court rule, it doesn't matter -- you could either 

22 demand that right; or you could demand your right to a 

23 speedy trial. That was your choice. 

24  And it seems to me what counsel chose was to 

insist, all along, I want my right to two -- to two

1 counsel. You didn't have to --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bourke, did anyone --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you didn't have to take 

4 that right. You could have gone to the -- to the 

supreme court and said -- you know, since it's taking so 

6 long, I demand my constitutional right to a speedy 

7 trial. But you didn't do that. 

8  MR. BOURKE: Your Honor, if Mr. Boyer had 

9 been brought into court and had been told, we've got 

associate counsel here; they are qualified in the sense 

11 that they are barred in Louisiana, and they can take 

12 your case to trial and move it forward now. 

13  But, if you wait, we might have funding for 

14 another lawyer here, who will join him, is more senior 

and experienced and will double your firepower. You can 

16 choose, Mr. Boyer, do you want to go ahead now with this 

17 guy? Or do you want to wait? 

18  In that circumstance, there would not be an 

19 invidious choice between the right to counsel and the 

right to speedy trial. It would be, we are giving you 

21 constitutionally adequate counsel, and you can wait for 

22 better, if you wish to. 

23  But that is not what occurred here. And, 

24 Justice Scalia, the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you -- can you tell me 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

25

Official 

1 why that is not what occurred here? 

2  MR. BOURKE: Because the funding problem did 

3 not exist solely around Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and 

4 expenditure. There was no money for investigation. 

There was no money for experts. And the associate 

6 counsel who had been appointed had been appointed solely 

7 and for the limited purpose as an assistant to 

8 Mr. Lorenzi, not to conduct the case in his own right. 

9  If this issue had been raised in the trial 

court, this would have been clearly explained into this 

11 record. It wasn't. But the trial court and the 

12 appellate court of -- the court of appeal -- Third 

13 Circuit in Louisiana knew and understood that there was 

14 no investigative funding. There was no expert funding. 

There had been an assistant. 

16  This isn't the case where there was a lawyer 

17 appointed and they were waiting for the second lawyer. 

18 It's a case where they'd found an assistant and were 

19 waiting for the first lawyer. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much money would 

21 be needed for investigation and experts before you would 

22 acknowledge that that would be competent representation? 

23  MR. BOURKE: That's a very case-specific 

24 determination, Your Honor and, in Louisiana, at that 

time, rested with a judicial determination that the 

10

1 investigative or expert expenses were reasonably 

2 necessary to ensure a fair trial within the meaning of 

3 the Due Process Clause. 

4  So it -- it was a funding level tagged to 

the constitutional minimum of due process. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, a finding by the 

7 district court -- or whichever court found it, that 

8 there was not enough money to pay counsel, to 

9 investigate, and to -- to do whatever else -- buy 

stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that 

11 there was not enough money to investigate and to buy 

12 stamps. 

13  Counsel was a part of that mix. You never 

14 had a finding that there was not enough money to pay 

counsel, right? Or -- I'm sorry -- that there was not 

16 enough money to allow the counsel that has been 

17 appointed to investigate and buy stamps. 

18  Was there ever any such finding? 

19  MR. BOURKE: There was never --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the big tag item 

21 was -- was paying counsel; wasn't it? 

22  MR. BOURKE: No, Your Honor. That was one 

23 of the big tag items. But, in a capital case, the 

24 investigation of both the guilt phase and the full 

mitigation and life investigation, along with the use of 

11

Official 

1 potential expert witnesses, particularly in the case 


2 where there were all the indications of mental health 


3 problems and the like, are often equal to or, in some 


4 cases, greater than the cost of counsel. 


And so, no, the big -- the big tag item 

6 wasn't just Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and expenses. The 

7 big tag item was providing adequate funding. And to 

8 return to your earlier point, Justice Scalia, just to --

9 to make it clear, the Louisiana Supreme Court cases, 

which mandate that a case cannot go forward without 

11 counsel, do not reference Rule 31 at all, or two 

12 counsel. 

13  They are cases which stand for the 

14 proposition that the case cannot go forward without 

constitutionally adequate counsel, counsel who can 

16 provide reasonably effective assistance. 

17  This case began in 2002. At that point, the 

18 controlling Louisiana decision on not moving forward 

19 without effective assistance was Peart -- P-e-a-r-t --

which we cite in our brief, which said that the court 

21 will not allow a case to proceed without reasonably 

22 effective counsel. 

23  During the life of this case -- sorry. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Your -- your point of view 

in this case --

25

Official 

1  MR. BOURKE: Yes, sir. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: In your point of view, 

3 would it satisfy you if we say, the Louisiana court of 

4 appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the 

funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana --

6 that meant giving you adequate money for counsel. 

7  Then they said, the progression of the 

8 prosecution was out of the State's control, as 

9 determined by this court, which I think referred to that 

funding crisis. And we could -- and your view would be 

11 that's what they said. We don't know the underlying 

12 facts, but that's what they said. 

13  And, insofar as they said that the State 

14 wasn't responsible for that part of the delay that they 

are talking about, they're wrong because the State is 

16 responsible for not providing enough money, even if it's 

17 a problem and to say they weren't responsible is wrong, 

18 okay? That's what you want us to say? 

19  MR. BOURKE: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Period. And send it back. 

21  MR. BOURKE: Well, Your Honor --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would like us to say 

23 what Judge Cook said in -- in her opinion, that 

24 responsibility for funding rests with the State, not 

with the defendant.

1  Once an attorney is appointed, it is the 

2 State's obligation to ensure that adequate funds are 

3 available for the defense. And I take "for the defense" 

4 to mean not simply counsel, but the witnesses, the --

the investigation. 

6  It is certainly true that none of the delay 

7 due to the lack of funds was, in any way, attributable 

8 to the defense. That's, essentially, what you would 

9 like us to say? 

MR. BOURKE: That is what Judge Cook said 

11 and --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's enough 

13 that none of the delay was attributable to the defense. 

14 The defense has to complain, has to demand its right to 

a prompt trial. 

16  What did your client do? Frankly, I -- I am 

17 skeptical that a capital defendant who has already 

18 confessed to the crime wants to be tried as soon as 

19 possible. I'm skeptical about that. 

Now, what -- what did your client do to 

21 demand his right to a prompt trial? 

22  MR. BOURKE: Your Honor, what Mr. Boyer did 

23 was act, at all times, in full compliance with the 

24 procedural mechanisms set up in Louisiana for doing 

that.

1  At arraignment -- he -- he had already 

2 identified he was indigent and asked for counsel. At 

3 arraignment, he requested a jury trial. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. BOURKE: His lawyer was appointed, and 

6 his lawyer immediately identified the funding problem 

7 and said, we need money, or we can't go forward. 

8 Louisiana statute bars counsel from filing a motion for 

9 speedy trial without an affidavit saying, you're ready 

to go forward. Louisiana has said, in Article 7 --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- surely, 

12 that's unconstitutional. Did counsel say, I demand a 

13 speedy trial? You can't condition my right to a speedy 

14 trial upon my getting some affidavit or something. 

MR. BOURKE: It's a procedural rule, Your 

16 Honor. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm still waiting for --

18 for anybody telling the court, I demand a speedy trial, 

19 and, if I don't get a speedy trial, you are violating 

the Constitution, and I ought to go scot-free. 

21  MR. BOURKE: Well, Your Honor, the rule I am 

22 referring to is a procedural rule. It does not, in any 

23 way, limit the relief from a speedy trial, but you can't 

24 move for a speedy trial. You can move to quash because 

you have been denied one, but you can't move for one.

1  It's exactly what this Court referred to 


2 in --


3  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that you 


4 waited three years before doing that? 


MR. BOURKE: That was the first point at 

6 which, under Louisiana procedure, he had a remedy 

7 available, exactly as Judge Cook stated in her 

8 abstaining opinion. That was when he could move to 

9 quash. He could not move for a speedy trial in a valid 

motion for speedy trial, without having an affidavit 

11 saying, we are ready to go. 

12  Louisiana has passed that rule to stop pro 

13 forma requests for speedy trial. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we clarify one point? 

Justice Scalia said something about a defendant facing 

16 the death penalty going "scot-free." There was an armed 

17 robbery charge that was added in 2007. 

18  Do you dispute that a new clock started in 

19 2007, the first time that the robbery charge was -- was 

made? 

21  MR. BOURKE: We do, Your Honor. That armed 

22 robbery charge is a lesser included offense of the 

23 first-degree murder count. Mr. Boyer was originally 

24 indicted on first-degree murder, which, in Louisiana, is 

intentional killing during the course of an armed 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 robbery -- there are other varieties, of course -- but 

2 intentional killing during an armed robbery. And those 

3 are the elements of first-degree murder. 

4  The State unpacked those two elements -- or 

two lesser included offenses, to second-degree murder, 

6 which is intentional killing, and armed robbery. And 

7 the State, in fact, conceded that, had the charge 

8 remained a first-degree murder charge, then the armed 

9 robbery charge would have created a double jeopardy 

problem. 

11  And that's at page 3703 to '4 of the record, 

12 where counsel for the State indicated that the armed 

13 robbery charge could be added because the primary 

14 charge, the -- the first-degree murder, had been dropped 

to second-degree murder, and specifically said, 

16 Mr Bourke is correct, that, had we filed for 

17 first-degree murder, there may be double jeopardy 

18 problems. 

19  But, because they had unpacked that charge 

from murder and armed robbery down to murder and, also, 

21 armed robbery, there was no double jeopardy problem. 

22 That is what --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about -- what about 

24 the basic problem in this case, as I understand the 

question presented, is should the State be responsible 

17

1 when the funding problem is at a local level? 

2  So suppose you have a State that says -- you 

3 know, we have had problems in funding; if we give this 

4 to the counties, it's going to be much better, and the 

counties are very, very good at raising money and 

6 knowing who the counsel are. And so it's all handled by 

7 the county. 

8  Then one county has a disaster, a hurricane 

9 in that county, particularly. Is that not a reason for 

delaying? Or does the State have to immediately step in 

11 and -- and supplement the funding? Can't the county 

12 say, oh, we need another two years? 

13  MR. BOURKE: Well, Justice Kennedy --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that's the issue 

that we're trying to decide here. 

16  MR. BOURKE: Well, I think it starts with 

17 the proposition that it is the State, not the 

18 prosecutor, who has the responsibility to ensure a 

19 speedy trial, in accordance with due process. 

And then the State can make all sorts of 

21 different arrangements, and the States around this 

22 country make different arrangements, but it's their 

23 responsibility to make sure that they work. And, if 

24 they don't work, then the State is going to have to make 

reasonable accommodation for that, to meet its 

18

1 responsibility. 

2  And so, by assisting the cause of delay 

3 against the State, but within the Barker weighing 

4 framework, the courts dealing with speedy trial claims 

would be able to deal with short-term unexpected 

6 exigencies. They would be able to weigh the 

7 reasonableness of the response. 

8  A valid reason for delay will justify that 

9 delay, as this Court said in Barker, but here --

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer to the 

11 question -- that's what I was trying to do -- this 

12 case -- the briefing is filled with whether he asked in 

13 time, whether he was delaying, whether he should have 

14 done some other thing, whether he should have -- but the 

question that's asked is, simply, whether the failure to 

16 fund counsel is a factor that should be weighed against 

17 the State. 

18  MR. BOURKE: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: And maybe it only gets very 

little weight because maybe there was a hurricane, and 

21 maybe it doesn't even matter because he didn't make the 

22 right motions. But the lower court said it shouldn't be 

23 weighed against the State, period. And do we have to do 

24 anything other than say, if you're right, yes, it 

should.

1  Now, how much weight it gets, well, that 

2 depends. There was a hurricane and -- but -- but it's 

3 something that they can't just ignore in -- in the 

4 hearing. They have to figure out what happened and 

to -- to the extent the State should have done more, it 

6 weighs against the State. 

7  Do you want any more than that? 

8  MR. BOURKE: Yes, Your Honor. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: And what else? 

MR. BOURKE: The first thing that we want is 

11 exactly that, Your Honor, that the court below 

12 incorrectly -- incorrectly failed to attribute this to 

13 the State. And this Court -- I accept this Court could 

14 stop there and remand to the Third Circuit to deal with 

that in accordance with --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not quite. I mean, 

17 the question presented is not as general as that. It's 

18 much more fact-bound. 

19  It says whether a State's failure to fund 

counsel for an indigent for five years, particularly 

21 where failure was the direct result of the prosecution's 

22 choice to seek the death penalty, should be weighed 

23 against the State for speedy trial purposes. 

24  I think this is inviting us to look into the 

facts of this case and decide whether this five-year

1 delay, particularly since the prosecution chose the 


2 death penalty -- you know, I don't like having to do 


3 that and -- but it seems, to me, that's what the 


4 question presented at least requires. 


MR. BOURKE: Well, Your Honor, it -- I think 

6 it would be open to this Court to answer the question by 

7 saying the court got it wrong at the first step by 

8 failing to attribute it to the State and then remand for 

9 full consideration of weighing, in light of that. 

What we have asked in our briefing for the 

11 Court to do is to also provide some guidance on the 

12 weight that should be given to delay resulting from the 

13 lack of funding because in this case --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: If we provide -- if we 

provide that guidance, what do we do about the 

16 continuances that Mr. Lorenzi requested that relate to 

17 the funding? "January 10, 2003, Lorenzi requests a 

18 continuance of funding hearing, citing scheduling 

19 problems." 

"August 5, 2003, Lorenzi moves to continue 

21 hearing on motion to designate source of funds so that 

22 the Indigent Defender Board can consider funding Boyer's 

23 case at an August 26 meeting." So this is -- okay. 

24  "Lorenzi moves to continue September 12, 

2003. Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to

1 designate funds in trial, so that the IDB may, again, 

2 consider the funding defense at its next meeting. 

3 December 15, Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion 

4 to designate funds," et cetera. 

There are many of these motions. What do we 

6 do with those? 

7  MR. BOURKE: Your Honor, I'd suggest that 

8 this Court does exactly the same thing that the 

9 Louisiana Court of Appeal did with them, which was to 

find that it was the lack of funding, not any action by 

11 Mr. Lorenzi, which caused the delay. 

12  The -- the Louisiana Court of Appeal 

13 declined to adopt the State's argument that it was Mr. 

14 Lorenzi's fault. And the reason it did that was because 

the lack of a funding hearing caused no delay at all in 

16 the conduct of this trial. 

17  The funding hearing, when conducted, 

18 produced no funding, no ruling or order, and had no 

19 influence on the date of the trial. And, of course, the 

right at issue was the right to go to trial, not to --

21 the timing of pretrial hearings. 

22  Furthermore, all of those continuances, 

23 which were joined in by the State, were related to 

24 trying to identify and find funding for this case and 

for this man. None of them were for a dilatory purpose.

1  They were because a new procedure was 

2 announced to submit bills in a different way to the IDB 

3 because the Louisiana Supreme Court had accepted the 

4 Citizen case. And ultimately --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, 


6 Justice Alito's problem seemed, to me, to get back to 


7 Justice Scalia's point, is that he seemed more 


8 interested in the funding than a speedy trial, the 


9 funding that would be provided by the State under its 


procedures. 

11  MR. BOURKE: In the absence of funding, 

12 there was no trial to be had. At the funding hearing --

13 or I'm sorry -- at the motion to quash hearing in 

14 November 2006, there was a colloquy between the trial 

court and the prosecutor in which the trial court said, 

16 what are we going to do with this case? They can't have 

17 a defense without money. 

18  This was not -- absolutely not --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, as 

Justice Alito pointed out on several occasions, what the 

21 defense lawyer said was, let's put it off and see if we 

22 can get funding, let's put it off until there's the 

23 funding hearing, let's put it off and put it off, as 

24 opposed to saying, I want a speedy trial, I'm entitled 

to it now, if you don't have the money, I don't get a

1 speedy trial, I get off scot-free. 

2  MR. BOURKE: Well, under Louisiana's Article 

3 701, there was no filing a motion for speedy trial, 

4 saying, please give me a speedy trial, set a date now. 

And at the same time --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: The Constitution requires 

7 such a motion. I mean, I don't care whether they have 

8 a -- you know, a speedy trial motion.  If -- if denying 

9 him the right to speedy trial violates the Constitution, 

surely, he is entitled to bring that to the attention of 

11 the Louisiana court, whether there's a specific 

12 statutory or rule provision or not. 

13  MR. BOURKE: Your Honor, this Court, in 

14 Barker, when dealing with this very topic under the 

issue of assertion, specifically said it would allow 

16 judges to take account of assertion in accordance with 

17 local procedural requirements. 

18  The local procedural requirement in a State 

19 that already has its own statutory prescriptive period, 

if you don't bring second-degree murder to trial within 

21 two years, you're out. 

22  The -- Louisiana does not need a defendant 

23 to tell them that they have to bring a speedy trial, and 

24 they don't want a defendant doing it, unless they're 

ready to go to trial themselves. They don't want the

1 sort of pro forma assertion that was rejected. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, they -- they don't 

3 even want counsel to say -- you know, Your Honor, we've 

4 been trying to get funding, and we're -- we're just sick 

and tired of waiting for this. We demand a speedy 


6 trial, and, if we don't get funding and, therefore, 


7 don't get a speedy trial, we think there's a 


8 constitutional violation, and we're going to ask that 


9 the indictment be dismissed. 


MR. BOURKE: Well, in July --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody ever made a 

12 statement like that to the Court, did they? 

13  MR. BOURKE: In July of 2005 --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: What did you say? 

MR. BOURKE: In July of 2005, Mr. Lorenzi 

16 moved to quash the indictment and said exactly that, 

17 said, it's too late, no funding, no trial, speedy trial 

18 is up. And it was still another two years before the 

19 funding crisis was solved. 

So there was a very lengthy period, if such 

21 notice were required -- and that is not, in our 

22 submission, the message from Barker and the message from 

23 Article 701, they got that notice in July 2005, when 

24 there was the motion to quash. 

And returning to your question --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't there 

2 something about that motion was withdrawn -- the 2005 

3 motion was withdrawn in 2006? 

4  MR. BOURKE: If -- if I can clarify that, 

Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Lorenzi was at pains to say he was 

6 not withdrawing the motion, but dismissing the motion to 

7 quash because he couldn't advance it in a successful way 

8 in Louisiana without demonstrating prejudice. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Dismissing it, instead of 

withdrawing it, that's the fine line he's drawing? 

11  MR. BOURKE: He specifically --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a line in Louisiana 

13 law? I don't know. Does this -- this come from French 

14 law or something? It seems, to me, withdrawing and 

dismissing sound, to me, the same thing. 

16  MR. BOURKE: Well, the point, Your Honor, 

17 was that he was not withdrawing his claim to a speedy 

18 trial, but, rather, dismissing his motion to quash on 

19 the violation of that at --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Withdrawing his motion to 

21 quash. So it was withdrawn, right? 

22  MR. BOURKE: No, it was dismissed. He chose 

23 dismiss, rather than withdraw is the word, and what he 

24 intended by that was that he wasn't saying, I don't want 

one; he was saying, I can't bring the type of hearing

1 Louisiana courts require to get my Sixth Amendment 

2 motion to quash granted. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I think what you --

4 let's go back to that. It was his view that, under 

Louisiana law to assert his Sixth Amendment right, he 

6 had to follow the procedure laid out in the Louisiana 

7 rule? 

8  MR. BOURKE: To move for a speedy trial, he 

9 had to do exactly that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the 

11 Sixth Amendment, he had to comply with the 

12 requirements -- the procedural requirements of 

13 Louisiana. 

14  MR. BOURKE: The local procedural 

requirements for how one goes about doing that. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So then how 

17 do you -- if he couldn't do it in 2002, '03, '04, or 

18 '05, how did he end up doing it in '05? 

19  MR. BOURKE: The -- it's the difference 

between moving for a speedy trial, please give me a 

21 trial date, I want to go to trial next week, and moving 

22 to quash because the speedy trial right has been 

23 violated. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn't he move to 

quash earlier?

Official 

1  MR. BOURKE: He moved to quash at the first 

2 moment that it became available under the State statute, 

3 which was at the three-year mark. He moved one month 

4 after that three-year mark, as soon as it became 

available. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What -- is 

7 there a law or a regulation in -- in Louisiana that 

8 gives it a three-year mark? 

9  MR. BOURKE: Yes, Your Honor. Article 579 

and following provides that the State must bring a 

11 first-degree murder charge to trial within three years, 

12 or the case is prescribed, the indictment must be 

13 dismissed with prejudice. And so the State always knew 

14 it had that deadline. 

It didn't even set a trial date for a period 

16 of over three years in the middle of this, didn't even 

17 try to set a trial date for three-and-a-half years, 

18 didn't bring Mr. Boyer into court for 

19 three-and-a-half years to address his case at all. 

And so, as soon as the remedy available 

21 became open, as Judge Cook said in her opinion, defense 

22 counsel filed using exactly the remedy provided for. 

23  If there are no further questions, Your 

24 Honor, I will reserve the remainder of my time.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA S. SIGLER 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

4  MS. SIGLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

6  This Court should affirm the holding of the 

7 Third Circuit Court of Appeals for three separate 

8 reasons. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about the 

reasoning -- is delay because of the lack of funding 

11 attributable to the State or not? Or to the district 

12 attorney as agent of the State? 

13  MS. SIGLER: Justice Sotomayor, I don't 

14 believe that the funding -- that we can credibly argue 

that funding is completely outside the role of the 

16 State. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's wrong with 

18 what's been suggested by some, to remand to tell the 

19 court below to whatever extent this was the basis of 

your decision, it was wrong. Now, redo the Barker --

21 the factors. 

22  MS. SIGLER: Well, Your Honor, if you review 

23 the Third Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, which is at 

24 Appendix D, the other Barker factors are analyzed, 

incredibly thoroughly, with a mind to this Court's 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 jurisprudence, and the rationale may be flawed with 


2 regard to that one point in this Court's opinion, but 


3 the result is not. 


4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is one factor 


determinative always in this calculation? I thought it 

6 was a weighing factor. And so, if it's a weighing 

7 factor, why isn't that, in and of itself, a factor that 

8 a court needs to weigh against the others? 

9  MS. SIGLER: I think that this Court has 

always acknowledged, in its Barker v. Wingo 

11 jurisprudence, that there is no one talismanic factor; 

12 all of the factors are interrelated, and all are 

13 reviewed. And that is why, even if the Court disagrees 

14 with that one assessment of the Third Circuit's opinion, 

the result is sound. 

16  With --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but how do we know 

18 that? How do we know that they would have reached the 

19 same determination if they had gotten it right on that 

single factor? 

21  MS. SIGLER: I think, when you look at the 

22 Third Circuit of Appeals opinion, they specifically --

23 and with direct quotations to Barker v. Wingo, go 

24 through every other factor in the analysis. And they 

discuss the fact of the repeated continuances of defense

4 is a --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Whether something is --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Whether something is the 

8 State's fault is a significant factor in the analysis, 

9 and we have made that very clear in our cases. And so, 

if they got that wrong -- and -- and you, I think, quite 

11 rightly, are saying we can't defend that part of it --

12 if they got that wrong, don't we at least have to say, 

13 okay, well, get it right now, and do it again? 

14  MS. SIGLER: Well, Justice Kagan, I don't 

think that what I would say is they got it completely 

16 wrong because, as this Court has acknowledged throughout 

17 its Barker jurisprudence, there are different weights 

18 you attribute to government action, whether it is 

19 negligence or whether it is a deliberate attempt on 

behalf of the State to evade giving a defendant his 

21 Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I would like to get 

23 the structure of your argument. You began to say 

24 there's three reasons. I would just like to hear those 

three reasons, so that I can understand the framework

1 for all these questions. 

2  MS. SIGLER: Yes, sir, Justice Kennedy. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The three reasons that we 

4 should affirm. 

MS. SIGLER: The first reason is that, as in 

6 Vermont v. Brillon, the delay occasioned in this case 

7 was due to Petitioner's counsel's repeated requests to 

8 continue his own funding motion, which delayed a source 

9 of funding when he -- the Petitioner wished to proceed 

with capital-certified counsel. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And the second? 

12  MS. SIGLER: The second reason, Your Honor, 

13 would be, pursuant to Loud Hawk, even if this Court 

14 determines that there was a negligence factor with 

regard to the State of Louisiana in not properly funding 

16 capital-certified counsel, there are valid public policy 

17 interests at play here and the fact that Louisiana is 

18 generous enough to provide specially-certified counsel 

19 to capital indigent defendants, when there is no 

constitutional requirement for it to do so. 

21  And then our third argument, Your Honor, 

22 would be that, based under the Barker v. Wingo 

23 jurisprudence, the delay should not be attributed to the 

24 State in this case because of Petitioner's failure to 

meaningfully assert his right to a speedy trial. And --

2  MS. SIGLER: Yes, sir. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- on that, how could 

4 it possibly be Lorenzi's fault, which is what you said 

is your first point, when he said, pay me, Supreme Court 

6 of Louisiana, you have said that my operation as counsel 

7 for this indigent defendant doesn't become operative 

8 till I get paid, I have a right to get paid. 

9  All that counsel did was to say, again and 

again, pay me, get the funds to pay me. I don't 

11 understand how in the world it could be the fault of an 

12 attorney who has not gotten one cent from the State, has 

13 a right to be paid before he engages in 

14 representation -- how can it be his fault? 

MS. SIGLER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, there 

16 are several reasons why it's Mr. Lorenzi's fault. The 

17 first of which is he filed a motion under 

18 State v. Wigley, and that is Appendix X of your Joint 

19 Appendix. 

In that motion, he identified 

21 State v. Wigley, and, although he referenced wanting 

22 expert resources as well, he primarily based that motion 

23 on his entitlement to attorney's fees. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I was going to ask you 

that question. Opposing counsel said that it -- it 

33

Official 

1 wasn't primarily attorney's fees that's at issue here, 

2 but investigation costs. That makes a difference to me 

3 because, if it's just attorney's fees, he could have 

4 gone ahead with one attorney, as far as I'm concerned. 

MS. SIGLER: I agree with you, 

6 Justice Scalia. And, if you look at Appendix LL, which 

7 is the hearing on the motion to quash, Mr. Lorenzi says, 

8 point blank -- in that appendix, he says, "I was not 

9 going to proceed to file substantive motions until I was 

funded." 

11  And --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't he say, at the 

13 same time, I couldn't do the investigation to make the 

14 motion required by the State? So didn't that implicate 

the funding for investigation? 

16  MS. SIGLER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, if you 

17 look at Appendix LL, where Mr. Lorenzi is speaking, he 

18 says, "I have done substantial investigation on my own." 

19 Mr. Lorenzi had the assistance, at that time, of the 

LCAC, with Ms. Christine Lehmann assisting him as 

21 associate counsel. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were there funds for 

23 investigation? 

24  MS. SIGLER: There were funds available in 

2003 that Mr. Lorenzi did not avail himself of because 

34

1 he continued his funding motion eight times. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which funds? Which 

3 funds? 

4  MS. SIGLER: There were -- there was a 

capital defense account that was held by the Calcasieu 

6 Parish Public Defender's Office. Mr. Lorenzi identified 

7 that account as a source of funding in record volume 1, 

8 pages 193 to 194. 

9  He says, in a letter to Judge David Painter, 

then the presiding trial judge, that he has identified a 

11 source of funds for his representation. In that same 

12 letter, he moves to continue a funding hearing that was, 

13 at that time, scheduled for the next month. 

14  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. I was 

16 told -- maybe I am sort of misreading this record --

17 that he was ultimately told that fund wouldn't be made 

18 available. 

19  MS. SIGLER: That is not correct, Your 

Honor. If you read Appendix LL, Chief Public Defender 

21 Ron Ware testifies that that fund had been used to pay 

22 other capital counsel in Calcasieu Parish. It had been 

23 used extensively. 

24  Now, by the time we get to the funding 

hearing, which was delayed because of Mr. Lorenzi, we

2 expenses that they are paying other capital counsel 


3 because they pay their bills on a first come, first 


4 served basis. 


Had Mr. Lorenzi proceeded to hearing in 


6 2003, there was an identified account that would have 


7 paid him. He did not submit any bills to the public 


8 defender's office to be paid. 


9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --


JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sigler, on appeal, you 

11 said this, the -- the State said, because the defendant 

12 was without properly funded counsel for so long, the 

13 State simply could not ethically or legally bring him to 

14 trial. So what did you mean when you said that, that 

the State could not ethically or legally bring him to 

16 trial? 

17  MS. SIGLER: Justice Kagan, what that 

18 statement meant was that we were aware of the fact that 

19 the Petitioner was, at all times, urging his privilege 

under Rule 31 to capital-certified counsel. 

21  We did not want to be involved in the 

22 business of questioning a Petitioner's right to counsel. 

23 We did not feel that, ethically, we could do so under 

24 the Rules of Professional Conduct. For us to interfere 

with that right would have been inappropriate, in our

4 this single counsel that you have? Was -- was that ever 

a choice put to him? 

6  Or because -- the way I read all of your 

7 assertions below and, indeed, the entire record below, 

8 is that everybody simply assumed that the case could not 

9 go forward in its present circumstances. 

MS. SIGLER: Justice Kagan, I think that 

11 that assumption was made, in part, out of a desire to 

12 recognize Mr. Boyer's decision to try to pursue Rule 31 

13 privileges. It's certainly -- I understand that we 

14 could have --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, a decision implies a 

16 choice. Was a choice ever put to him? 

17  MS. SIGLER: He had a choice that was 

18 implicit, Your Honor, under Louisiana law; and he knew 

19 that, and his counsel certainly knew that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you didn't even know 

21 that. You said the State could not ethically or legally 

22 bring him to trial. How was he supposed to know that? 

23  MS. SIGLER: Justice Kagan, our response 

24 in -- in that particular phrase that you are speaking of

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought the 

6 statement meant could not ethically or legally bring him 

7 to trial while he is insisting on his right to two

22 Petitioner argued that here today because, under Article 

23 71 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, while an affidavit

14 petitioner has a low IQ. In fact, that was refuted by 

our Dr. Charles Robertson at a competency proceeding. 

16  In fact, the results that was given from an 

17 IQ test when he was 15, the person administering it 

18 specifically stated that he was malingering, which would 

19 cause a 10-point drop in the IQ --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the level of his 

21 education? 

22  MS. SIGLER: I believe his level of 

23 education was eighth grade. But I would --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And he was expected to 

know all this about two counsel -- you have a right to

1 two counsel, but, if the State isn't going to pay them, 

2 you can go forward with one counsel? 

3  Did anyone ever tell this man, with an 

4 eighth grade education, what his rights were? 

MS. SIGLER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

6 believe that that specific discussion was ever had --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: His -- his one counsel 

8 might have known. 

9  MS. SIGLER: His one --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He did have one counsel. 

11 He had one counsel because he only graduated from the 

12 eighth grade. That's why we provide counsel. And that 

13 counsel could have known, no? 

14  MS. SIGLER: Absolutely. In fact, 

Mr. Lorenzi was well aware of the fact that he could 

16 have chosen -- the Petitioner could have chosen to 

17 proceed with just one counsel. 

18  But I'd also like to note, Justice Scalia, 

19 that, from 2002 to 2004, he had three counsel. He had 

Mr. Lorenzi, he had Mr. Steven Singer, and he had 

21 Ms. Christine Lehman. 

22  He didn't just have one; he had three. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she was not -- you 

24 know, you said that, at all times, he had at least two. 

It seemed to me -- two paid counsel. Lorenzi wasn't

2  MS. SIGLER: Yes, ma'am. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the woman --

4  Lehman, is it? But, when she started representing him, 

she didn't have the qualifications to be counsel. 

6  MS. SIGLER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as has 

7  been alluded to before, I believe, by Justice Scalia, 

8  she absolutely had the qualifications to serve as 

9  counsel, as required by the Sixth Amendment. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But she wouldn't -- she 

11  couldn't be appointed counsel in a death case under 

12  Louisiana's rules. 

13  MS. SIGLER: She met the qualifications for 

14  associate counsel. In fact, she was later certified in 

a motion filed by Mr. Lorenzi to be associate counsel --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but, in the very 

17  beginning, she wasn't even qualified to do that. 

18  MS. SIGLER: Well, there was a provision --

19  there is a provision in Louisiana law -- law that allows 

someone to move for the admission and the certification 

21  of somebody as capital counsel, which was the procedure 

22  employed in this case. That is perfectly permissible. 

23  But Miss Lehman, at that time, was a very 

24  experienced attorney, and we lay out her qualifications 

in the brief. So, while she may not have been perfectly

6  MS. SIGLER: She's a very impressive 

7  attorney. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And another of his counsel, 

9  Mr. Singer -- of the three that he had -- he was a 

graduate of Harvard law school; wasn't he? 

11  MS. SIGLER: Yes, Your Honor.

constitutional --

17  not provide good counsel.

19  MS. SIGLER: I would refute that, 

Justice Thomas. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is -- do you 

22  want to define constitutionally adequate counsel? Is it 

23  anybody who's graduated from Harvard and Yale?

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would think -- no, no, 

4  no. This is a very serious question which is, I don't 

know that we have ever defined what the minimum 

6  qualification is for qualified counsel. 

7  But it is -- some of it has to be that 

8  counsel themselves feel adequate to represent a capital 

9  defendant. 

MS. SIGLER: Well --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know plenty of lawyers 

12  who would never either volunteer or would resist being 

13  appointed to take on that kind of case because it has 

14  many differences to a normal case. 

MS. SIGLER: I would agree with that, 

16  Justice Sotomayor, but I would invite you to look at the 

17  motion that moved for the certification of Ms. Lehman, 

18  which is in the record. That motion --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She's a very experienced 

trial counsel. There's no -- no doubt of that. But was 

21  she a capital counsel? 

22  MS. SIGLER: She was, Your Honor. That 

23  motion specifically refers to the seven capital cases 

24  she had worked on and states that, while at the LCAC --

the Louisiana Capital Assistance Center -- she had

2  she --

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Let me -- let me give you a 

4  holding -- this is an incredibly factually complicated 

case. We don't usually take cases that are so 

6  fact-bound, but we've taken it. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you a rule that 

9  we might adopt. If the failure to provide funding makes 

it impossible for some period of time for a case to be 

11  tried, then the delay is attributable to the State. 

12  Would you agree with that? 

13  MS. SIGLER: If the failure to provide 

14  funding is a deliberate attempt on the State to 

interfere with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, 

16  then I would agree with that. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: You also agree, right on 

18  this subject, that the only sentence that I can find --

19  I haven't read it totally carefully -- but, in the lower 

court opinion, that has to do with this is the sentence 

21  I read before. 

22  And it says, "The first three years he was 

23  incarcerated, he was charged with first-degree murder, 

24  and the progression of the prosecution was out of the 

State's control, as determined by this Court and the

1  Supreme Court." 

2  Now, when I look at those words, I am not 

3  100 percent certain what they mean. So it would be 

4  helpful -- but I don't want --- you're not going to do 

it -- I'd like to -- are you -- would you concede that 

6  that statement means they're saying that the State, for 

7  speedy trial purposes, is not to be held accountable, 

8  really, at all, for not providing the money, insofar as 

9  that's a cause of the delay? 

Is that a conceded point? Or is that 

11  something I have to spend quite a lot of time going 

12  through? 

13  And, if you don't concede that, what is it 

14  that you concede, which would spare a little time going 

through this record. 

16  MS. SIGLER: Justice Breyer, I regret to 

17  inform you that I do not concede that point. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

2  factors are discussed. And the continuance motions that 

3  were filed by defense counsel are mentioned with regard 

4  to the assertion of the right; they are not necessarily 

mentioned with regard to the State. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you are right. Most 

7  of this opinion -- and almost all of it is about the 

8  other factors. Now, I agree with you, that's what it 

9  looked like. But we do have this sentence. 

So how am I supposed to figure out whether 

11  that sentence really means what they say? Or just is 

12  something they threw in to make the opinion more 

13  difficult for us to understand? 

14  MS. SIGLER: I don't think that was the 

stated -- the -- the intention of the Third Circuit, 

16  Justice Breyer. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: No, I don't either. I 

18  don't either. But what's the argument -- sounds as if 

19  it has something to do with funding. So what's the 

argument it doesn't? 

21  MS. SIGLER: Well, I believe --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it says, you see, 

23  "as determined by this Court and the Supreme Court." 

24  What were they talking about? 

MS. SIGLER: Well, I believe what the Third

Official 

1  Circuit was referring to was this Court's 

2  Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence. This Court has stated, 

3  repeatedly, that even if something --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. Well, then, 

that's it. They're referring to Barker. Okay. 

6  So when they say it's out of this State's 

7  control, as referred to in Barker, which is our case, 

8  then what they mean is that it's not something that the 

9  State had anything to do with, so they shouldn't be 

blamed for it. 

11  MS. SIGLER: I think that they are 

12  attempting, in some fashion, to reconcile some of this 

13  Court's later statements in the Barker jurisprudence, 

14  which this Court made it clear, in Vermont v. Brillon, 

that certain actions are not going to be attributed to 

16  the State for speedy trial purposes --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: When you agreed with --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sigler, could you go 

19  back to Justice Alito's question? 

MS. SIGLER: I'm sorry? 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: That was a good -- that was 

22  a good segue.

2  MS. SIGLER: Okay. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you agreed with the --

4  the principle that I mentioned, except that you want to 

draw a distinction between the failure to provide 

6  funding and the deliberate failure to provide funding? 

7  Is that a real difference? 

8  MS. SIGLER: Absolutely. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Can the State inadvertently 

failed to provide funding? 

11  MS. SIGLER: I think that this Court has 

12  always recognized, in the Barker jurisprudence, that 

13  negligence is a very different factor in how it weighs 

14  against a State than a deliberate attempt to violate a 

constitutional right to a speedy trial. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: When we said in Krillon 

18  delays resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public 

19  defender system could be charged to the State, so that 

suggests systemic breakdown doesn't necessarily mean 

21  deliberate. It just means there has been a breakdown, 

22  and the result is that the person can't get to trial. 

23  And if -- I think -- if Justice Alito could 

24  even read that again and if you think about it, in light 

of this statement in Krillon, that systemic breakdowns 

48

25

Official 

1  are systemic breakdowns, whether or not they are 

2  deliberate. 

3  MS. SIGLER: Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

4  that the best evidence or the fact that there was no 

systemic breakdown is the funding hearing itself, 

6  Appendix JJ. 

7  At that funding hearing, there are extensive 

8  discussions about other capital cases within the State 

9  that are being tried the entire time this case is 

pending, including one case that we referred to, 

11  State v. Reeves, in Calcasieu Parish, a capital case 

12  that went to trial in less than four years, that 

13  included a retrial. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say you have a 

case where the -- the defendant wants counsel, can't 

16  afford counsel, and the State says, we'd love to provide 

17  counsel for you, but we're broke, we just don't have any 

18  money to provide counsel, but, maybe in a year, we'll 

19  have money to provide counsel. 

Now, what do we do with the delay between 

21  that point and -- and the -- the point, a year later, 

22  when the money becomes available? 

23  MS. SIGLER: Well, I think, from that 

24  scenario, we would have to look at the State's 

intention. I certainly think that, if the State flat

Official 

1  out said, I'm sorry, you're not getting counsel for a 

2  year, then we would have to attribute that factor to the 

3  State more heavily, even though it does appear that, in 

4  your scenario, it's more of a negligence problem than a 

deliberate we're not going to fund you problem. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it is negligent. 

7  For -- for a year, this person isn't represented because 

8  the State keeps sending the checks to his cousin of the 

9  same name. I mean -- you know, they didn't do it 

purposely. He just happens to have a cousin, this 

11  lawyer, of the same name, who doesn't tell him he's 

12  getting these checks out of nowhere. 

13  So he can't hire the expert. Absolute 

14  negligence. I mean, that's not to be attributed to the 

State? 

16  MS. SIGLER: No, Justice Breyer. Clearly --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for 

18  that? I mean -- you know, maybe you'd discount it 

19  because it wasn't deliberate, but no attribution 

whatsoever? 

21  MS. SIGLER: Well, you discount it, 

22  Justice Breyer, and you attribute it to more of a 

23  negligence standard than you would a -- an absolute 

24  failure or refusal to provide counsel. And this Court 

has done that repeatedly.

3  the prosecutor because they kept paying the prosecutor, 

4  I want to pay for the prosecutor's investigation, but I 

won't pay you? What -- what is the difference in 

6  applying the negligence versus deliberate standard? 

7  I mean, look, in the end, States are always 

8  strapped, but I don't know a State who doesn't make some 

9  income. They make a choice about where they want that 

income to go. And it may be, in your judgment, a more 

11  legitimate decision, but why is the situation less 

12  negligent -- why is it negligent and not deliberate? 

13  Why is the choice one, not the other? 

14  MS. SIGLER: Because, Justice Sotomayor, I 

believe in this Court's decisions, under 

16  Barker v. Wingo, the choice aspect -- the deliberate 

17  intent aspect has been looked at by the courts in 

18  deciding how much of the blame is to be assessed against 

19  the State. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then answer the 

21  question. Why isn't the choice to say, I -- I'm broke, 

22  so I don't want to pay you, I'm going to pay the 

23  prosecutor -- which happened, the prosecutors were being 

24  paid throughout. They had enough money to investigate, 

but we're choosing not to pay the defendants.

4  funds. What we're here -- we're here today --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Available funds to pay 

6  the lawyer? 

7  MS. SIGLER: There were available funds in 

8  2003. I was referring to that letter in the record 

9  that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the court itself 

11  said, repeatedly, that the cause of the delay was the 

12  funding crisis, the court -- I think we have to accept 

13  that as being the case, that the funding crisis -- the 

14  effort to get this lawyer paid failed, time and again. 

And it was the court determination that it is the 

16  funding crisis that caused the delay. 

17  MS. SIGLER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

18  funding crisis that the court ruled on was present in 

19  2006. It was not present in 2003, when this case 

started. Mr. Lorenzi, himself, identified a source of 

21  funds -- funds to pay him. 

22  And when we hear Chief Public Defender Ron 

23  Ware testify at that motion for funding hearing, at 

24  Appendix JJ, he says, yes, I have a special capital 

defense account, and, yes, I have been paying capital

1  attorneys from this account throughout this time period. 

2  The fact that there weren't funds readily 

3  available in 2006 is directly attributable to Petitioner's 

4  counsels failing to move his funding herein forward in 

2003, when he first identified that source of funds. 

6  This is not a case in which there was never any funding. 

7  This was a case in which defense counsel, 

8  for whatever reason, delayed a resolution of the funding 

9  issue, an issue that he, himself, identified as one --

without any resolution, he was not going to go forward 

11  with substantive motions. 

12  The onus -- the -- the blame -- or more of 

13  the blame in this case, on the funding problem, belongs 

14  with the Petitioner, not the State of Louisiana, whether 

we mean the prosecution --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to argue 

17  the funding issue because I've got to go look at the 

18  record again. 

19  But let's assume that the record doesn't 

support your claim because, as I read the decisions 

21  below and the record that I saw, there wasn't funding 

22  available until -- I think it was 2006 or '7? And so, 

23  somehow, there's a disconnect between what you're saying 

24  and the record.

2  What's your position then? Then it's not 

3  deliberate? It's still negligence. 

4  MS. SIGLER: Justice Sotomayor, I maintain 

that position, and I believe it to be consistent with 

6  this Court's repeated analysis under Barker v. Wingo 

7  jurisprudence. 

8  You do look at the intent of the State as 

9  either a negligence factor, akin to more of a neutral 

factor, a deliberate factor, or a valid reason for the 

11  delay. And I would also suggest to Your Honor --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there could never be 

13  a systematic breakdown, in your judgment, because any 

14  time the State gives resources to something else, it's 

not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown. 

16  MS. SIGLER: Justice Sotomayor, I would 

17  invite you to look at the motion for funding hearing 

18  again. There was money allocated to indigent defense by 

19  Louisiana. It has increased -- and this is public 

record, and it's partially supported by the funding 

21  hearing. 

22  That money has increased from 9.4 million in 

23  2006 to 20 million in 2 -- I'm sorry -- in 2005, to 20 

24  million in 2006, to $33 million today. House Bill 1 of

2  I would, again, suggest that this is not a 

3  case of systemic breakdown. And I think that, as a 

4  policy matter, this Court should be reluctant to rule 

against the State of Louisiana, which, as Justice Scalia 

6  noted, has been so generous in trying to provide capital 

7  indigent defendants with specially qualified counsel, 

8  which is more counsel than they're even entitled to 

9  under the Sixth Amendment. 

And I would also urge this Court to be 

11  cognizant of its own repeated statements in the past, 

12  that this is a very severe remedy with regard to letting 

13  a convicted murderer free. 

14  I'd also like to address, before I sit down 

and turn this back over to Mr. Bourke, Justice Ginsburg, 

16  earlier, you had addressed the question of whether or 

17  not the armed robbery was, in fact, still a valid 

18  charge. 

19  Contrary to Mr. Bourke's assertion before 

Your Honor today, if you look at Appendix 254A, there is 

21  a writ of opposition that was filed by the Petitioner 

22  before the Louisiana Supreme Court. And, at 254A, he 

23  says -- and I quote -- "Even if the murder indictment

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

11  MR. BOURKE: Thank you. And I have a few 

12  points of clarification that I want to make, just in a 

13  very quick fashion. 

14  Justice Sotomayor, there was no funding in 

2001, 2002, 2003. It was never there. If Your Honor 

16  looks at the Louisiana Supreme Court opinion in Citizen, 

17  it will describe the Turner case funding hearing in 

18  2001. Mr. Lorenzi was stuck with that one as well. 

19  There was no money. 

Mr. Lorenzi did, indeed, submit bills in 

21  2003 because a new procedure had been announced, and 

22  that's at page -- Joint Appendix page 401 to '3. You'll 

23  see the correspondence showing he did submit bills, and 

24  there was no money.

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bourke, would you 

7  respond to the last point made by -- by opposing 

8  counsel? 

9  MR. BOURKE: Yes, certainly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You did state -- it's in 

11  Appendix J -- "Even if the murder indictment were 

12  quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution." 

13  MR. BOURKE: Yes, Your Honor. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: You told us, today, that 

that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution 

16  goes down the drain. Which -- which is true? 

17  MR. BOURKE: The passage you're referring to 

18  is from a writ application purely limited to the 

19  application of the State speedy trial statute, which 

does accord a new clock to every new filing. 

21  So, under Louisiana State statutory law, the 

22  armed robbery started the State statutory clock again, 

23  but that is not the case for the Sixth Amendment --

1  included offense, the robbery count. 

2  MR. BOURKE: The armed robbery was a lesser 

3  included of first-degree murder, but it is not a lesser 

4  included of second-degree murder. Our double jeopardy 

argument was the same force was applied in both, the 

6  force for the murder and the force for the armed 

7  robbery, so that's completely irrelevant. 

8  But that was a State statutory argument 

9  about the armed robbery charge, which has no 

application in the case in front of us. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Boyer -- why would --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Why would we get to that 

14  question? I mean, no courts below have dealt with it. 

It has been briefed to us in a grand total of two 

16  paragraphs, I think. There would be no reason for us to 

17  get to that question. 

18  MR. BOURKE: It -- it is well beyond the 

19  question presented, Your Honor, I agree. 

Your Honor, the --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: And so -- so, from that 

22  point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery 

23  conviction that is still out there. 

24  MR. BOURKE: He has a murder and armed 

robbery conviction from the same incident. It's the

1  same charge as the first-degree murder. It's just 

2  unpacked. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or assume that there isn't, 

4  right? 

MR. BOURKE: That -- that is why this Court 

6  would remand to allow the -- the local court to deal 

7  with it and ensure that that's accurate. 

8  Justice Breyer, the reference to our 

9  earlier -- the decision of this Court and the supreme 

court is a reference to the earlier decision on the 

11  interlocutory writ application, the earlier decision 

12  that a lack of adequate funds prevented the prosecution. 

13  And if Your Honor looks at Joint Appendix, 

14  at page 126, which is part of the opinion of the Third 

Circuit, you will see, earlier, in their opinion, they 

16  discuss their own earlier ruling in the supreme court --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

18  The case is submitted. 

19  (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
