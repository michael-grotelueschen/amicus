(11:17 a.m.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 11-798, American Trucking 
Associations v. City of Los Angeles. 

Mr. Lerman? 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL N. LERMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
MR. LERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
This case is about the plain text of the 

FAAAA express preemption clause and the continuing 
vitality of this Court's decision in Castle v. Hayes 
Freight Lines. 

I'd like to start by showing why the Port's 
requirements here fall within the text of the statute 
and cannot be saved by any market participant exception. 

The FAAAA provides that no State or 
political subdivision of a State may enact or enforce 
any law, regulation, or other provision having the force 
and effect of law related to rates, routes, and services 
of a motor carrier. The only statutory language at 
issue here is the force and effect of law requirement. 
And the Port's actions have the force and effect of law 
under any reasonable interpretation of the phrase.

 The Port is imposing binding standards of 

conduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a 
channel of interstate commerce. The Port is enforcing 
those requirements through criminal penalties --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the Port 
said we don't apply criminal penalties which come from 
the tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor 
carriers. They made that representation, so I think we 
have to accept that as being so. 

MR. LERMAN: They -- they did make that 
representation and we could accept that, but it's 
irrelevant because the Port is still imposing the 
criminal penalties on the terminal operators. And when 
a State is imposing criminal penalties, that is classic 
governmental action, the State acting in its sovereign 
capacity, regardless of whom the penalties are imposed 
upon. And in this Court's decision in Roe, it made 
clear that States could regulate trucking activity 
through penalties, in that case civil penalties, imposed 
only on people who do business with truckers. 

Here, the State's requirements are coming at 
the truckers from both ends. On the one end, you have 
the criminal penalties imposed on the terminal operators 
to coerce their conduct and exclude truckers. On the 
other hand, you have the tariff which puts conditions on

access to the Port of Los Angeles, which is a key 
channel of interstate commerce. 

So the Port's requirements here have the 
force and effect of law in spades because using --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I break down your 
arguments into two components, if you might? Whether or 
not the market participant exception exists at all, and 
if it does, how far does it go? 

So let's get to the first question in my 
mind. Seems almost impossible for me to believe that 
the States couldn't require someone to put a little 
placard like you get at the -- at almost any building 
that you go into to park your car. They ask you to put 
a little placard in the front of your window so they 
know who you are and where you're going in the Port, 
okay? 

Why is the placard requirement here any 
different than that requirement generally? Because if 
you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put 
a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to 
come in. 

MR. LERMAN: It's -- it's different in this 
case, Your Honor, because -- in addition to the overlay 
that 14506 specifically targets identification 
requirements, and -- and for purposes of this case,

it's -- but I understand --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But even if that, if we 
didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State 
say, when you come into the terminal, you just got to 
put a little placard in so we know that you're not 
parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded 
or something else? 

MR. LERMAN: I think you need to look to the 
particulars of this case, and the -- and the fact is 
that the placard requirement here is codified into an 
ordinance, it's backed by criminal penalties, and it's 
restricting access to a channel of commerce. Because we 
have all those factors here, it has the force and effect 
of law. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the terminal say, 
we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can 
come and unload here? 

MR. LERMAN: No. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they have to take 

trucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift? 
MR. LERMAN: Heavy is a different scenario, 

Justice Sotomayor, because there's an express exception 
to the FAAAA for weight and size restrictions. So 
Congress carved out a series of exceptions for the FAAAA 
for safety requirements, which gets to part of your

question, for height and weight and size limits, for 
requirements pertaining to the transport of 
nonconsensual goods and the like. It did not create a 
proprietary exception. So a lot of Your Honor's 
concerns may well be covered by one of these other 
exceptions. 

But there is no exception for a proprietary 
action. If it has the force and effect of law and it 
does not fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to 
the statute, then it is preempted under the terms that 
Congress used. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though -- even though 
a related statute did -- did make an exception for 
proprietary action, isn't that right? The FAAAA? 

MR. LERMAN: The ADA. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: The ADA. 
MR. LERMAN: Yes, that's quite right, and 

precisely because that statute contained an exception 
and this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted 
the FAAAA, it copied the ADA, and it copied the express 
preemption clause, but it -- Congress chose not to 
include that proprietary exception. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why, why 
Congress had a different regulation for ports and for 
airfields?

 MR. LERMAN: I don't believe the record --

the legislative history doesn't show why. But Congress 
thought, clearly copied the statute and made the 
decision not to include it. 

So by the terms of the statute, Congress 
wrote a statute that preempts any action with the force 
and effect of law, and it chose not to carve out an 
exception for proprietary action which, as you say, Your 
Honor, was included in the Airline Deregulation Act. 

So that just lends added force to the 
argument that the Act here does not contain an unstated 
exception, an exception that Congress has created not 
only for the ADA, which is the express model of this 
Act, but in a host of other statutes where Congress 
carved out specific exceptions for proprietary actions. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except in Boston Harbor, 
we said that there was a presumption in favor of it 
unless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary. 

MR. LERMAN: Well, Boston Harbor spoke to 
express or implied indication of congressional intent. 
Here there is express indication of congressional 
intent, which is an express preemption provision 
dictating the term -- the scope of preemption. And 
Boston Harbor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Boston Harbor was implied

preemption, right? 

MR. LERMAN: That's correct, Your Honor, it 
was implied preemption. There was no express preemption 
clause to construe, and that language is in the context 
of an implied preemption case. Here, as Justice Scalia 
notes, we have an express preemption clause, and we have 
a clause that has carveouts for a lot of things, but it 
does not have a carveout for proprietary action. And 
that is -- that is the best evidence as Congress has 
intended. 

This Court has stated, when there's an 
express preemption clause, the plain language of the 
clause defines the scope of Congress's intent. And here 
the plain meaning of the clause covers actions as here 
that are backed by criminal penalties and impose 
conditions of access to a key channel of interstate 
commerce. 

That is the very definition of force and 
effect of law. The Port is invoking the full coercive 
power of the State to impose conditions on motor 
carriers, and that is exactly what Congress sought to 
prevent. Congress sought to prevent State actions that 
impede the free flow of trade or that would result in a 
patchwork of requirements from jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction.

 That is what the Port's doing here. It --

it conflicts with Congress's objectives and it falls 
within the text of the statute. And it cannot be saved 
by virtue of a market participant exception that, by 
Respondent's own admission, is untethered from the text 
of the statute itself for the reasons that we've 
discussed. Congress made quite clear what it wanted to 
except from the broad scope of preemption, and this 
Court has reinforced the breadth of preemption, and did 
not include --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we need to get into 
the market exception if we find that this is -- has the 
force or effect of law rather than being a private 
contract? 

MR. LERMAN: No. If this has the force and 
effect --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's one or the other --
or both, but we could choose. 

MR. LERMAN: It either has the force and 
effect of law or it doesn't. If it has the force and 
effect of law, it falls within the scope of the -- of 
the express preemption clause and this Court does not 
need to address any of that.

are okay, though, as you acknowledge, and I guess 
there's a second question in the case. 

MR. LERMAN: There is. Thank you --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You were about to get into 

that anyway. 
MR. LERMAN: I was going to, but thank you, 

Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 
MR. LERMAN: I was going to get to the 

second question in the case, which is this Court's 
decision in Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines. In Castle, 
this Court held that -- that a State cannot enforce 
otherwise valid requirements through a partial 
suspension of a motor carrier's federally granted right 
to operate in interstate commerce. 

That is precisely the authority the 
Port is claiming here. The Port is claiming the 
authority to suspend or revoke motor carrier's access to 
the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in 
the United States and a key channel of interstate 
commerce. That would affect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That matters -- that 
matters in your view whether it's a key component of 
commerce or not. If it's -- if it's a particular 
highway, a particular street, you think Castle doesn't

apply in that case? 

MR. LERMAN: Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, 
Castle spoke to partial suspensions of a motor carrier's 
right to operate interstate commerce and I think it 
cannot be denied that in this case because of the nature 
of the Port, it is -- it would affect a partial 
suspension. I don't think this Court needs to get into 
single roads and I don't think there's any reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you 
have to get into it since I asked you a question about 
it. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. LERMAN: You're quite right, 

Mr. Chief Justice. I don't see any reason to let that 
camel's nose under the tent. If it's a partial --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or you should stop 
referring to a key component of interstate commerce. It 
doesn't matter whether it's key or not, does it? 

MR. LERMAN: That's quite correct. It would 
affect the partial suspension of interstate commerce, it 
would seriously disrupt their interstate commerce 
operations. This falls within Castle's exact terms. 
And Congress has not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they say there's 
this particular road, through a State park or something,

that's scenic, and sometimes the trucks drive on the 
side of the road and it causes damage to what the 
State's trying to preserve. And they have a rule, look, 
if you do that three times and we warn you, the fourth 
time you can't use this road. That is preempted? 

MR. LERMAN: That is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is another 

road not too far away. You've got to use that one. 
MR. LERMAN: That is preempted under Castle. 

The conventional forms of punishment might include the 
three times and we fine an individual truck. But that's 
what the situation was in Castle. So you can't punish a 
violation of an otherwise valid regulation through a 
partial suspension of interstate commerce. And I think 
that would qualify. 

And Castle is --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Castle's didn't say that, 

Mr. Lerman. What if the Court is just saying, we want 
to keep unsafe trucks off the road, but we're not 
prohibiting you for past violations that you've cured. 
All we're doing is keeping unsafe trucks out of our 
port. 

MR. LERMAN: Justice Kagan, the conventional 
forms of punishment include, as we acknowledge, taking 
an unsafe truck out of service or denying access. If --

if the truck is leaking hazardous material, the port can 
deny access to that particular truck. 

The key -- the key problem here is the 
carrier-level suspension of access. And so saying 
because that one truck for the carrier might be leaking 
hazardous material, we are not going to let any trucks, 
even perfectly safe trucks that don't present any 
present -- clear and present safety risk into the port 
until you fix that unsafe truck. 

And that's the authority reserved by the 
State in this case, and that is what Castle said is 
preempted. And so we are not denying the authority to 
invoke what Castle called conventional forms of 
punishment, which we would concede includes the -- the 
type of punishment Your Honor's contemplating, but what 
it doesn't allow is a -- a suspension of access to a 
motor carrier as a business entity. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But why does that -- why 
does it have to be truck by truck rather than operator 
by operator? Why can't the port say, you know, when we 
found a couple of trucks that this company uses that are 
unsafe, we're just going to keep the company off our 
premises until the company can show us that they've 
cured all their trucks, that they are a safe operator 
now.

 MR. LERMAN: Because that's what Castle 

dealt with, Your Honor. And I was going to turn to the 
statutory scheme in Castle, which is Castle's decision 
was predicated on a statutory scheme that gave the 
Federal government exclusive authority to grant 
interstate commerce permits --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the Federal government 
inspect trucks for safety and --

MR. LERMAN: It has regulatory --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- leaking hazardous 

materials and such? 
MR. LERMAN: I don't know that it inspects 

it directly, and it has provisions for States to do 
that. But the Federal government still under 49 U.S.C. 
13905 has exclusive authority to revoke a Federal -- a 
motor carrier's Federally granted operating authority. 
And so there are significant rights that States have to 
impose --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Has it ever done that? 
MR. LERMAN: I don't know if it's ever done 

that, but what it has done is -- is what Castle said, 
which is -- is -- there was no reason to -- to deny that 
the conventional forms of punishment are sufficient to 
protect the State's safety concerns, and then if they 
are not sufficient there was then and there still exists

a remedy, which is to go to the Department of 
Transportation and ask them. 

And that remedy exists to this day under 49 
U.S.C. 13905. The same statutory scheme that was 
present in Castle and animated this Court's decision in 
Castle is present today. So if they have a safety 
concern, there are ways to deal with it. 

They can do what Justice Kagan suggested, 
which is to deny access to a particular truck. They can 
go to the Department of Transportation and ask for --
for some type of exemption. But what they can't do is 
assert the veto power that this Court held was precluded 
in Castle and in the city of Chicago cases, and that is 
precisely the veto power that they are asserting here. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I make a somewhat --
this is how I'm seeing the case and there is some 
mystery in it to me and it would affect how I might 
write this thing or consider it. 

Look, what they want to do is to not have 
trucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they 
want to put a tag on it. All right. So the second --
you seem to have said what they should have done. You 
go to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it. They 
approve it or they don't. 

And their -- their problem is that they

don't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different 
sticker, all right? So then the whole back fills up 
with stickers and that's the problem. That's the 
problem. You go explain, et cetera, okay. 

But the first part, the parking, it seemed 
to me of course they should be able to do that. And 
there seems to me to be a tailor-made exception, the 
authority of the State to impose highway route controls 
or limitations. And if that isn't tailor-made for this, 
I don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's 
doing there. And so why has nobody done that? 

When I read the lower court on that, they 
said, oh, it affects fares and it affects services. 
Every route restriction affects fares and services, you 
know? So here I see an exception which seems 
tailor-made for what they want to do. I see all kinds 
of problems with the proprietary thing. What am I 
supposed to do? What -- what I see as the exception 
tailor-made for this isn't in the case. 

MR. LERMAN: I think that's --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what do you suggest? 

And it's a question for both sides. 
MR. LERMAN: You're right that it's not in 

the case, Your Honor. It's not in the case because the

of law because that's what the court below held. The 
court below held that these could escape preemption 
because the port was acting arguably in part by a 
motivation for community goodwill. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you agree with 
that -- that that provision would apply? I don't see 
that it applies. 

MR. LERMAN: I don't know if it applies. 
That was going to be the second answer. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Route restrictions? 
MR. LERMAN: I don't think this is a route 

restriction. I don't know if it would qualify, and that 
would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you can't say, 
don't drive our truck through the neighborhood? This is 
residential area, no trucks over such-and-such. If you 
can say that, why can't you say do it part of the time? 
Why can't you say -- we're arguing a different question. 

I agree it is not --
MR. LERMAN: Right, not only are we arguing 

a different question, I think that gets to -- and I 
would like to answer this question and then reserve my 
time for rebuttal if I might. 

But that gets to the "related to" question, 
is that in fact related to rates, routes, and services

with respect to the transportation of property? That 
sometimes is a more factual inquiry. But that is not at 
issue here. The only issue here is whether it can 
escape preemption because the Port was arguably 
motivated in part by a proprietary concern such as 
community goodwill. 

None of those words are in the statute, 
which preempts all actions that have the force and 
effect of law, and they are preempted on this basis. 

And I would like to reserve my time. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 
Mr. Bash, welcome. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. BASH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 
may it please the Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think the city 
could pass a regulation like Justice Breyer suggested, 
that says, stay off residential streets? 

MR. BASH: Well, if the city were to pass 
that regulation, they'd have to make out a record that 
it either -- it comes within one -- one of the 
exceptions. Now, it could have been the safety 
exception. The Port argued for that here and the

district court rejected it on the record after hearing 
testimony about the alleged safety and hazardous cargo 
justifications. 

They didn't make an argument under sizes and 
weights. Presumably, they could make that record. 
You'd have to see about the strength of their 
justifications. I'd note that I -- it would probably be 
the case they would have to apply uniformly to trucks of 
a given size or weight.  Here, they were only going 
after drayage trucks, which are a particular category of 
trucks. I don't know if they could make that showing 
with respect to all trucks or if that was their intent 
here. 

I would like to turn, if I could, to Justice 
Ginsburg's question about the criminal penalties in this 
case. We accept the Port's statement in their brief at 
face value that the criminal penalties would only fall 
on the marine terminal operators. But, like Petitioner, 
we don't think that makes a difference. 

If, for example, the State Highway 
Commission said, okay, certain trucks can't use our 
roads unless you sign a certain agreement. But don't 
worry, if you don't agree to bide by that agreement we 
won't do anything to you, but we will throw every person 
who does business with you in jail.

 Whatever else you could say about that 

scheme, I think it would be pretty clear that it would 
be the act of a sovereign and so it would have the force 
and effect of law within the meaning of this statute. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, what would you 
think of this case if the criminal penalties were taken 
out of it? In other words, if the Port did this all 
through contract, basically said to each terminal 
operator, look, if you contract with truckers that don't 
have this concession agreement, we are going to charge 
you a higher price. 

So -- so if the criminal penalties were not 
in the case, is there enough here to still make this the 
force and effect of law? 

MR. BASH: Yes. We think not only is there 
enough here, but there's another sort of a bright-line 
rationale before you get into the Boston Harbor sort of 
understanding of if this is regulatory or market 
participant. And that's the second factor we cite in 
our brief, which is we don't consider the Port the 
equivalent of the cement factory in Reeves, like a 
commercial enterprise that you might see in the private 
marketplace. 

This port authority, like I think virtually 
all other port authorities in charge of these massive

container ports, hold land much like a highway 
commission in trust for the public. 

This is not private property ownership. If 
you look at all the different metrics of success the 
court of appeals pointed to and the district court 
pointed to and I think the Port points to in their 
brief, they are not bottom line business metrics like 
shareholder value and dividends and so forth. 

It's economic vitality of the region. It's 
the number of jobs it brought to the L.A. area. That is 
not the mark of a commercial enterprise. It's the mark 
of a regulatory body. It's something a mayoral 
candidate might point to. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 
true. I mean, a commercial enterprise might want to 
attract customers because of its reputation as a -- as a 
green company because of its reputation of hiring local 
workers. 

I think you have too confined a notion of 
what -- what's good business. 

MR. BASH: I think it's true that Wal-Mart 
might say, hey, we don't do business with labor law 
violators, or we adhere to certain environmental 
practices, as part of a marketing campaign. But I think 
what this Court said in Boston Harbor was that, yeah, a

private business could boycott labor law -- law 
violators too, and, in a sense, the private business 
would be engaged in quote-unquote regulation. 

But when the government does that, when the 
government uses its special place in society and its 
enormous economic power to effectively leverage its 
power to impose regulation, that's -- that's 
fundamentally different, and that is not the government 
acting in a market capacity even though, sure, Wal-Mart 
or Starbucks could do a similar thing. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it part of your 
argument that the city contracts with the port and then 
the port contracts with the truckers, but at that point, 
the ports are -- are confined in what they can do? 
There can be really no bargaining between the ports and 
the truckers based on what the city has already told the 
port? 

MR. BASH: Justice Kennedy, that -- that's 
like our third order argument. I mean, our first order 
argument is criminal penalties and just the nature of a 
port and -- the Port doesn't contract with the city. 
The Port is a department of the city, and its members 
are appointed by the mayor and its revisions to the 
tariff are codified in city ordinances. So it's in 
every way a part of the city, it's not just a

contractual relationship. 

We think just the criminal penalties here 
and the nature of what a port is. A port -- a 
regulatory body that governs a critical part of public 
infrastructure is enough to resolve this case. If you 
think no, the criminal penalties don't matter and this 
Port is more like the cement factory in Reeves, it's 
really just a plain vanilla commercial enterprise, we do 
think the fact that it's leveraging significant economic 
power, that it's the only place in L.A. to do this 
business, is part of this sort of Gould market 
participant analysis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bash, how then do you 
deal with the problem that precipitated all of this? 
Here is a port that's getting lots of complaints from 
the neighborhood people. It wants to expand the port, 
it's being thwarted by environmental suits, so it wants 
to go green and it wants to do something about the 
pollution and the traffic and the hazards from the 
truck. You're saying that it can't do that? 

MR. BASH: We're -- we're not saying it has 
no recourse. And I just note parenthetically that the 
same could be true of any state highway commission 
that's contemplating an expansion of a highway project. 
They could face similar suits based on environmental

complaints. They could face similar community 
opposition, we don't want these huge trucks coming 
through our neighborhood. That doesn't make the decrees 
and acts of a highway commission, particularly if backed 
by criminal penalties, acts that lack enforcement. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how could a port 
respond to the complaints if you're making this -- this 
neighborhood around the Port an environmental hazard? 
And so we're going to make sure that our representatives 
vote against any expansion of the Port. 

MR. BASH: To -- to deal with that sort of 
effectively political opposition, community opposition, 
I think the Port retains a lot of flexibility under the 
statute to address them. 

If you look at page 90 through 93 of the 
Pet. App, it discusses the extensive incentive programs 
that the Port established. 35 percent of the drayage 
trucks currently serving the Port, or at least at the 
time the district court's opinion was written, are new, 
clean trucks that don't have the same emissions problem. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But wait. Why isn't the --
I mean, I thought that the purpose of these 
exceptions -- of course cities can have parking 
regulations. Of course States and cities can have 
regulations involving trucks as to how and where they

use the highways and which ones they can't use and which

exception, isn't it? I mean, I -- I thought that's what 
it was. 

And, of course, you're quite right in saying 
they should have to do it uniformly. It says it based on 
size and weight. Okay. Fine. What's the problem with 
that, that I'm not seeing? 

MR. BASH: I took Justice Ginsburg's 
question to be addressing a slightly different point. 
The exceptions are for things like safety, hazardous 
cargo --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it says, "The 
authority of a state to impose highway route controls or 
limitations based on the size and weight of the motor 
vehicle or the -- or hazard -- or hazardous nature." 
And it's size and weight, hazardous nature. I mean, 
isn't there room in those words to include environmental 
consideration? 

MR. BASH: There -- there may be. It's 
obviously an issue that hasn't been briefed in this 
case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there is. 
You think there is? You can ask the question. 

JUDGE BREYER: I -- I myself don't know.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Seems to me the answer is 

no. 
MR. BASH: But I -- I just wanted to 

emphasize for Justice Ginsburg, though, that there are a 
lot of things that ports and other -- other municipal 
entities can do to address environmental concerns. And 
they've been done in this case. 

It is the replacement of these trucks, which 
was done through a subsidy and incentive program that's 
remarkably similar to the one this Court blessed as 
market participation in Hughes that allowed these 
extensive emission reductions that the Port's seen. 
That sort of direct participation in the market has all 
the hallmarks of what we don't have here. It's not 
enforced through criminal penalties. It's not the --
the Port acting as a regulator of this public 
infrastructure. It's actually entering the drayage 
market and purchasing trucks, effectively becoming a 
part owner of the truck. 

So I do think that the Port has extensive 
authority to address environmental concerns within the 
confines of this preemption statute. 

The Chief Justice asked about the Castle 
question, whether it matters or what if you just didn't 
want a road or what's the size of it?

 I will say that the court in Castle seemed 

to think it made a difference, the sort of size of the 
imposition, but I don't think it needs to make a 
difference anymore because we have a direct preemption 
statute. 

We think that the logic of Castle applies 
not only in the context of the licensing scheme that has 
changed but was effectively in place during Castle, but 
under Section 14501(c) itself. 14501(c) says States 
can't pass regulations that relate to prices, routes, 
and services, but it also gives States safety exceptions 
and so forth. And there needs to be a reconciliation of 
those two provisions. 

I think we'd all agree that if a State -- if 
a truck committed two safety infractions, you couldn't 
say, well, now we're going to regulate your prices, 
routes, and services as punishment for that infraction. 
This -- the framework we've set forth in the Castle 
portion of our brief I think is a reasonable 
reconciliation of the State’s --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- do you think 
that a statute that says if you're a trucking company 
operator and you have three violations of X safety 
regulations, you just can't use our highways because we 
don't trust you, is that okay?

 MR. BASH: No, that's certainly not okay. 

We think that fails under both the holding of Castle and 
just under the current presumption provision, which is 
maybe the easier way to do it. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? Why isn't it a 
standard fact that States and cities use to stop people 
from repetitive violations to tell them, if you keep 
doing this and don't remedy what you've done, we're just 
not going to let you do X, Y, and Z? Why wouldn't the 
safety violate --

MR. BASH: Well, it should be clear at the 
outset that we're not talking about people, we're 
talking about motor carriers as an ongoing enterprise. 
So we're not saying an individual can't have their 
license revoked. 

Are you finished with the question? 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your answer. 
MR. BASH: But more broadly, we think the 

Federal regulatory scheme in combination with this 
preemption provision just bars States from taking 
certain actions that would affect the interstate 
operations of motor carriers. 

Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN S. ROSENTHAL 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
MR. ROSENTHAL: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
At issue today are two provisions contained 

in a contract between commercial actors. They set forth 
conditions under which drayage trucks can enter the 
nonpublic portions of the Port, and they are 
indistinguishable, indistinguishable from contract 
provisions that private parties routinely impose on 
those who seek to enter their property. In our view, 
the FAAAA does not deal with contracts, and it doesn't 
deal with the right of landowners to condition those 
seeking entry into their Port. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What exception do you 
appeal to? There are a number of exceptions there. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: What --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What exception are you 

appealing to from the -- from the preemption provision? 
MR. ROSENTHAL: Your Honor, my first -- my 

first exception is the actual force and effect of law. 
We do not believe --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different 
point, but -- but you're -- you're talking about, you 
know, an exception for private contract operations as

opposed to public matters. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: We're --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There are exceptions to the 

preemption and that is not one of them. And other 
statutes do have exceptions for -- for commercial 
operations or private operations. This one doesn't. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: With -- with due respect, 
the statute says "law, regulation, or provision having 
the force and effect of law." That's a -- that's 
something which applies to the general public. We 
submit that what we are calling the market participant 
exception, what it is generally congruent with, what is 
meant by Congress by the term "force and effect of law." 
The Sixth -- the Fifth Circuit in Cardinal said that the 
market participant analysis should inform what is meant 
by force and effect of law. We're not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do market participants 
impose civil and criminal penalties? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Ah. I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. Yes. 
MR. ROSENTHAL: The answer is no, but I 

think the criminal penalties is a red herring in this 
case, and if you will -- if you'll just indulge me a 
moment. The -- the concession agreement everyone 
concedes does not include any criminal penalties. The

tariff which applies to the marine terminal operators, 
yes, it contains a criminal penalty, but the criminal 
penalty is not included in this tariff against the 
marine terminal operators. It's intended for other 
purposes. 

We have no recollection of a cargo operation 
ever having had a criminal penalty. Yes, it's in there, 
there is a misdemeanor penalty, but it applies to people 
like trespassers, people who perform traditional 
criminal acts. 

There is evidence in the record. I asked 
the director, the deputy director of the Port, how do 
you enforce these requirements, and his answer was, 
primarily through our lease contract. Obviously, we 
don't want to do away with the -- with our lessor, but 
there is no indication, and there is no fact on the 
record that these criminal penalties, which our 
opponents keep dredging up, are ever used against MTO's. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that how we decide these 
things? When there is on the books a criminal penalty 
that can apply to everybody, do we let the State come in 
and say, oh, you know, no harm, no foul because it's on 
the books, but we -- we don't really use it. Well, I 
don't know -- I don't know that we do that. If it's 
there, it's a criminal penalty, and if -- if the

condition of -- of -- of you're being able to impose 
these limitations is that you not have criminal 
penalties, there is a criminal penalty. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Justice Scalia, first of 
all, the direct criminal penalty doesn't apply to the 
truckers at all. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 
MR. ROSENTHAL: So the argument is, this is 

an indirect effect, and what I'm trying to argue is the 
indirect effect is not criminal in nature. Yes, there 
is a criminal provision. But I'm saying as a practical 
matter, criminal penalties aren't used indirectly to 
enforce this prohibition. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but like a lot 
of criminal penalties, that's the whole point. They 
keep people from doing crimes. It doesn't seem to me to 
be very probative to say we've never had to throw 
anybody in jail or we never had to prosecute anybody 
criminally. They have a coercive effect that a private 
operator cannot avail itself of. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: But, Mr. Chief Justice, what 
-- usually criminal penalties apply to the public. The 
reason I'm bringing this up is we have an entirely 
separate and much more robust relationship with our own 
tenants through the lease. The lease is the way this is

enforced. Criminal penalties -- no MTO thinks for a 
second about the criminal penalty. They think about the 
contractual relationship. 

And that's an important point here because 
what we're talking about and what's central here is the 
management of land which we own, which we will not, 
underscore "not," be able to grow and develop unless we 
have some modicum of control. And we are not talking 
about expansive control here, but some modicum of 
control over who enters our land. 

Let me make one additional point which I 
think is terribly important. The owner of land, the 
owner of land has to have some control of the type which 
ATA and the government says we can't have control over. 
I will give you a simple example, where we cut a hole in 
our fence and say the trucks can come in, you can come 
in on Navy Way, but you can't come in on Prospect 
Street. That under a strict definition of the statute 
would be prohibited to us. But you can't prohibit a 
landowner from saying, you've got to identify yourself. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why the route 
regulation thing is the exception. But the State of 
California decides --

MR. ROSENTHAL: But we're not acting –

not. The State of California decides, here's what we 
have, a State public utilities commission which issues a 
tariff, and what the tariff says is anyone who contracts 
with a person in this State, a property owner, to move 
his goods and services, cannot charge less than $30 a 
pound. All right? Plainly preempted. 

And your case differs because? 
MR. ROSENTHAL: My case differs because we 

are not dealing directly with rates, routes, or 
services. We are not regulating. We are --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying it falls 
outside the definition of "routes." Well, that argument 
is not in front of us. I mean, I thought we were 
conceding here it falls within the definition of routes 
or rates or services. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: No. 
JUSTICE BREYER: The parking regulation --
MR. ROSENTHAL: That question was --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it doesn't fall 

within, then I'm not sure what we're talking about 
because I thought the problem was that it does fall 
within the rates, routes and services, and then the 
question is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera.

JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I asked you, and 
how does it differ from the hypothetical I just put? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: I think -- I think -- it 
differs from that because we're not prescribing any --
if we are describing -- if we are prescribing it, it's 
inherent within our ability to access our particular 
land. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You are saying that you 
can do by contract what you cannot do by regulation. 
And I don't understand that argument when there are 
criminal penalties that attach to the breach of the 
contract. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: But, Justice Kennedy, let me 
say again, there are no criminal penalties that attach 
to the breach of the contract. It is purely a contract. 
The remedies are purely civil. Even our other side in 
their argument has conceded there are no criminal 
penalties to the breach of the concession agreement. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that's 
crucial. You think a State can -- can say nobody's 
going to come on our highways until it signs a contract? 
Okay? These highways belong to us, they are State land, 
and anybody who wants to ride on the highways, you have

to enter a contract with the State. And that's going to 
get around this Federal statute? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: No, no, no. Justice Scalia, 
there is a critical distinction here. The roads, the 
bridges, the parks are open generally to the public. 
There is a difference between that and the private part 
of the city hall. For example, we restrict who comes 
into the garage under the city hall. We restrict who 
comes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. It's a highway only 
for trucks. It's a truck highway. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: No, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? It's specially 

reinforced and everything, but you have to enter a 
contract with the State in order to drive your truck on 
this highway. And that -- that's okay. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: But we're not -- we're not 
dealing with that hypothetical. We don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know we're not. That's 
why it's a hypothetical. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: But there's a difference, 
and let me give you the difference, Justice Scalia. And 
that is in this particular case we are dealing with a 
business, a commercial enterprise. And I think the 
appropriate standard which we would contend controls

whether force and effect of law, market participant 
applies, is whether this was an action taken, reasonably 
taken to deal with a genuine commercial interest of the 
Port. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The State makes 
money on this truck highway. It's a money-maker, okay? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: No, no, we're not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that makes it okay? 
MR. ROSENTHAL: No. We are not prepared to 

concede that making money is sufficient, taxes are 
sufficient. No -- we have findings in the district 
court here that this was undertaken to advance a 
commercial objective, that commercial objective being to 
allow the port to grow. 

This -- the city undertakes regulatory 
activities. It runs a police department, it runs -- it 
runs a fire department, public works. It does, in the 
case of the city of Los Angeles, run three enterprises: 
A port, an airport, and a power and water department. 
That is substantively different than running the public 
roads and the bridges. 

And we believe what's critical to this 
analysis and what we have extensive findings from the 
district court is that this was run as a business, like 
the cement plant, like the Boston Harbor. Boston Harbor

I think I would posit is far closer case, it seems to me 
than what we're dealing with here, which are marine 
terminals. 

But nonetheless, in Boston Harbor this Court 
held that the regulation of who could work in Boston 
Harbor, the circumstances fell within the market 
participant doctrine. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was -- it was implied 
preemption in Boston Harbor. Here you have an express 
preemption clause which contains exceptions, and among 
those exceptions is not the running of a commercial 
enterprise, even though that is made an exception in a 
number of other Federal statutes -- Federal preemption 
statutes. That's a very high hill for you to climb, 
relying solely on the fact that you are a commercial 
enterprise. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: It's not the only thing, 
Justice Scalia, I'm relying on. I'm also relying on the 
language which Congress put in, which are words of the 
limitation, which is force and effect of law. 

If Congress had not -- had said any 
requirement by the Port, any requirement by a city 
whatsoever, I believe we'd have a closer case. But 
they're only talking about things which have application 
to the general public.

 We submit that force and effect of law 

almost invites a market participant analysis. 
Let me also respond to your point about the 

ADA, the Airport Deregulation Act. The reason there is 
a limited exception for airport proprietors, as this 
Court has held, is because there was a longstanding 
issue about airports being able to impose restrictions 
about noise pollution on surrounding communities. 

Congress was well aware back in the 1970s, 
when this statute was enacted, of that controversy and 
they wanted to preserve the existing rights of 
airports. There is no comparable controversy with 
respect to truck ports or ports or the government that 
was ongoing in 1994 when this particular statute was 
adopted. 

But let me point out that what did -- did 
occur in 1994 was that Congress was writing against the 
backdrop of this Court's decision in the Boston Harbor 
case, in which Congress was told that in the absence of 
something express, which says that a city or State can't 
manage its own property when it pursues its proprietary 
interests, that there would not be inferred -- not be 
inferred -- a restriction on a State's power to manage 
its own property. 

So unlike the situation when the ADA was

adopted, when the FAAAA was adopted in 1994, there was, 
we submit, a background principle, which this Court had 
enunciated earlier, that there was a presumption that 
our proprietary powers were to be preserved. 

If -- if I can, I'd like to go on to the 
Castle argument as well. Our point -- we make three 
different points in Castle. First of all, our position 
is that the Castle decision was predicated upon a very 
specific statutory regime that existed in -- under the 
Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935. 

Justice Black specifically noted the details 
of that statutory regime, which included certificates of 
convenience and necessity, very precise rules under 
which trucks were to operate within -- within the United 
States. 

That regime has died. Died several decades 
ago. And we would submit that the Castle doctrine, as 
it existed, died with that regime. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rosenthal, could I 
interrupt you for a second and just make sure I 
understand what your policy is? Who do you exclude from 
the Port? What trucks -- what trucks or what trucking 
companies do you exclude? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Well, in fact, we don't 
exclude anybody from the Port. We simply ask that those

trucks that come on to port property sign a nonexclusive 
concession agreement which agrees to certain conditions. 

So drayage trucks that come on, on a regular 
basis, have to sign these conditions. We would point 
out that people who operate at our Port intermittently 
can get day passes. And generally speaking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if they 
violate those conditions? I mean, that's -- that's 
where the -- that's where the shoe pinches. What if 
they violate those contractual conditions? Then do you 
exclude only the truck that violates it, or do you 
exclude the whole trucking company? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Well, we -- we -- there's a 
gradation of remedies. We don't -- we have -- we have 
generally not excluded or revoked. Generally, what 
we've done is tried to get compliance. There are --
there are penalties, there are mechanisms of a 
contractual nature which are used. 

Those are the principal --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the ultimate? 

What's the ultimate? You've tried everything else and 
you whack them with a big penalty. 

What is that? 
MR. ROSENTHAL: In -- in cases involving 

fraud, criminal penalties of a continuing nature, we can

suspend or revoke their right to come on to the 
property. That's the ultimate. But -- but -- and this 
deals with the Castle argument --

JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and not just the 
noncompliant trucks, but the entire operator for 
having some noncompliant trucks, is that correct? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Again, we -- this -- there 
hasn't been this experience of -- of having to revoke 
and -- and suspend in cases like what you're describing. 
There are -- for example, there has been revocations 
when LMC has not had the insurance it's required, but 
that applies to all of their trucks. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you're saying there 
isn't that experience, I mean, could -- are you in a 
position actually to represent that you would not 
exclude anything except noncompliant trucks? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: There -- there hasn't been 
the experience. What we said before is that the 
severest penalties are intended for severe continuing 
offenses. And our position is that, given the fact that 
there are reasonable applications of the revocation --
of the suspension requirement, given the fact that ATA 
has launched a facial attack on our regulation, that it 
will be sufficient time to deal with an as-applied 
Castle.

 If Castle survives and this Court --
JUSTICE BREYER: There are three reasons, 

and the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't 
survive in a policy of deregulation it would seem to 
apply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue 
that with you. 

I want to be sure I have the second and 
third. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Yes. Let me -- let me give 
you -- let me give you my -- the three. 

First, we don't believe Castle continues. 
JUSTICE BREYER: But what is the second and 

third? 
MR. ROSENTHAL: Second -- second argument --

second argument is that even under the Castle regime, 
all Castle talked about is going -- allowing a truck to 
go up to a customer's property line, that -- that a 
certificate of convenience and necessity never gave 
anyone permission to go into Wal-Mart or anything else. 
And that's what we're talking about here. 

And thirdly, our position is that given this 
is -- this being a facial attack, given the fact that we 
believe that there are lawful applications of -- of the 
revocation to ongoing continuing violations, which is, 
frankly, the only -- I can't make a representation --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I've never heard of this 

doctrine. This is a facial attack to a contract? Is 
that it? I mean, you --

MR. ROSENTHAL: Well, but -- it's a -- it's 
a facial attack to -- it is.  It's a facial attack to a 
contract. We don't believe that it applies to our 
contract at all. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We have to attack this 
contract provision by provision -- or application by 
application? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: But -- but they're arguing 
that our contract is tantamount to a law. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I've 
heard of facial attacks to criminal statutes. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Right. And -- but they are 
attacking this remedy to -- they've -- they've --
talking -- they are attacking this on -- on its face and 
saying that no application of this provision is -- is an 
exception. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And what's the one that 
would be? Give me the example that you're thinking of 
where, given Castle --

 MR. ROSENTHAL: Where -- where a truck is in 

continuing violation, a company is in continuing 
violation of a safety restriction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, how 
does -- how -- how would that differ from Castle? 
Because what Castle was concerned about was a State that 
has a perfectly lawful regulation, and it's violated, 
then the State as the remedy excludes the truck from the 
State. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Because --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it's concerned 

about. And it didn't say anything about accepting very 
serious violations, i.e., continuing ones. The reason 
was the need for interstate regulation of an interstate 
enterprise. And that was the reasoning. Leave it to 
the ICC, a fortiori, where it's deregulatory policy, but 
leave that to the side. 

I want to know your best case in that one, 
and I don't see the example yet. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Let me -- let me try to 
respond, Justice Breyer. 

I think if one reads the opinion in Castle, 
Castle dealt with a past violation, not a continuing 
violation. The record in that case didn't deal with 
the -- and I think the words of the -- Justice Black

said that would be a different case, that there would be 
a right to exclude a continuing violation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just go back 
because --

MR. ROSENTHAL: You certainly may. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the theoretical 

questions. The agreement requires the operators to have 
offsite parking. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? It has to do 

that for a reason. It means that if its trucks don't 
use that off -- off-site parking, that the operator is 
in default? Is that the City's position? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: If -- if it does, it submits 
an off-street parking plan for all of the trucks which 
are registered to go onto the property, and it has to 
agree to keep those trucks in the off-site parking. 

If it breaches that agreement, it's treated 
as a breach, and we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just wanted to make 
sure. What you're saying is if trucks park anywhere 
else, then the operator's in violation of the agreement. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: That -- that's correct. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. With respect 

to the placard, as I read the provision it says you have

to have the placard coming in and going out. Is this 
like one of those parking placards that people can affix 
temporarily or does it have to be a permanent? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: No, it does not have to be 
permanently affixed to the truck. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how does that help 
you? Meaning to --

MR. ROSENTHAL: Well, there were -- we -- we 
provide them if they want a sticker they can put on 
their truck, but we don't require it. We just give them 
the words. And most trucks, in fact virtually all 
trucks of this type, have a -- have a frame on the 
outside where they temporarily put plaques, for example, 
at times when they are carrying hazardous materials. 
You probably have seen that color design on the side. 
Those are temporarily affixed. 

So if a trucking company, an LMC, wished to 
just put the plaque on as it's crossing the gate and 
take it off when it's leaving the gate, it's -- it's 
fully lawful to do that under our restrictions. 

Most of them just leave -- leave it on, but 
that's not required. The plaque is only required as it 
enters, while it's on Port property, and when it leaves, 
as it leaves. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is the public

going to use that plaque? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: What? 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is the public going 

to use that? The public hangs around the Port as it's 
loading to call in complaints? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: There are -- there are --
there are members of the public include also the people 
who are on -- at the MTO, also other truckers. The 
purpose of it is essentially to provide a -- a remedy to 
notify from people who are on the Port, and -- and also 
to act essentially as a notice to the drivers in the 
trucking company that if they are violating the rules, 
there -- people know there's a phone number they can 
call. So it acts -- it has a certain enforcement 
effect. 

My point --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you clarify --

would you clarify what the -- what happens when there is 
an infraction? Say three trucks. Is it right that you 
can suspend until the infraction is cured, that you can 
suspend all of that operator's trucks? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: We -- we are -- there has 
been very little practice, Justice Ginsburg, under that, 
but basically our enforcement where there have been 
violations has been to ban the particular truck in

question, not the entire LMC. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could do the 
other. See, I'm -- what -- what are -- is it -- is it 
just a matter of grace that you will say, well, we'll 
require them to fix those two trucks and all the others 
can travel? Or could you say, until you fix those two 
trucks, none of your trucks come through? 

MR. ROSENTHAL: We -- we have built in a 
gradation. I mean, it's not purely a matter of grace. 
We classify things as minor violations and major 
violations. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's say it's a major 
violation. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: If it were a major violation 
involving something we believe was systemic within the 
LMC, the -- the -- not the regulation, but the 
concession agreement would leave the possibility that we 
could revoke or suspend until the problem was corrected. 
But -- but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about after it's 
corrected? The government then says there's some 
uncertainty about that, whether you --

MR. ROSENTHAL: We have -- we have never 
enforced it that way. I mean, the enforcement – we 
haven't used revocation. We haven't used suspension.

And generally speaking, our intent has been, as we 
stated in the lower court and as we stated repeatedly, 
to use this for continuing violations. But we are 
really talking about future actions because revocation 
and suspension have not been common. 

Let me conclude by making two points here. 
Number one, this Port undertook these actions as a 
reasonable and genuine response to the needs to build 
and grow a port. If we are prohibited from taking what 
are substantively limited actions to control trucking, 
then essentially we're going to be in a posture in which 
this Port will be disabled by its surrounding community 
from doing what it needs to do to compete. 

Secondly, we submit you cannot be the 
owner-proprietor of property without having some control 
over the conditions under which owner -- under which 
invitees, business invitees, come onto your property, 
that this statute of Congress was not intended to 
constrain that property interest. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Make -- make this argument 
precisely and substitute for "port authority" the words 
"city of San Diego," okay? And -- and you'd be still 
right. I mean, what's bothering me is, I -- I don't 
know you've got the right one. So -- so if we decide in 
your way, what we've done is distinguish precisely the

same situation, you from the city of Los Angeles, simply 
because of the method they have of governmentally 
regulating the port. 

MR. ROSENTHAL: No. I disagree --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 
MR. ROSENTHAL: -- Justice Breyer. It's not 

because we're -- we have the Port as the proprietorship. 
It's because these actions were commercial in nature. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I see. 
MR. ROSENTHAL: These -- the port is 

operating as an enterprise not because it has the label 
"enterprise," but because this is a business and as a 
business we should be entitled under even-handedness to 
do what a Wal-Mart or any other company could do to 
enable us to prosper, grow, and nurture our business

red herring. 

MR. LERMAN: I know you didn't, Your Honor. 
I was referring to Mr. Rosenthal's argument that -- in 
response to a question of yours. You did not say they 
were any kind of herring and they're not. 

Justice Breyer, in response to your 
question, rates, routes and services are not at issue in 
this case. The only issue is whether they have force 
and effect of law. That's the only issue before this 
Court. The court below said they lack -- they fell 
outside the scope of the statute because of the 
proprietary nature. 

Mr. Rosenthal talked a lot about the 
commercial motivations, but the statute doesn't speak to 
criminal motivations. The statute speaks to actions 
with the force and effect of law. These have the force 
and effect of law and are preempted on that ground. 

Mr. Rosenthal said Castle has died. Castle 
is still alive. The statutory scheme that formed the 
basis of this Court's decision in Castle remains to this 
day in Title 49 of the U.S. Code, and that was the basis 
for the decision then, and it's the basis today. 

Justice Ginsburg, the concession agreements 
gives the Port unfettered discretion to determine 
whether or not to suspend or revoke access. In this

Court's city of Chicago cases, the fact that the city 
claimed at least some power to deny a license or access 
to interstate commerce was sufficient and it's 
sufficient in this case. 

Thank you. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought there --

there was a representation made that they toe the line 
that the government draws. That it, they can say, no 
access as long as you have trucks in your fleet that 
don't comply. But once you've gotten your fleet in 
order and you are in compliance, then we can't punish 
you for having wronged in the past by saying you're --
you're suspended. 

That -- that's the position that the 
government is taking, and I take it you don't agree with 
that. 

MR. LERMAN: I don't agree and I think 
counsel said right here that they reserve the authority 
to suspend access for past or ongoing violations, and 
that runs afoul of Castle under its plain terms. 

If there are no further questions? 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 
The case is submitted. 
(Whereupon, at 12:16 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
