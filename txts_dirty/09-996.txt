 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 09-996, Walker v. Martin.

 Mr. Marshall.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Charles Martin never adequately explained 

why he waited more than 5 years to present additional 

claims to the California Supreme Court. As such, it was 

no surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely. 

California employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that 

merely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure. 

The rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding 

precedents, and the Ninth Circuit's decision to the 

contrary should be reversed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the 

charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general 

5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from 

the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the 

5- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on 

the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do 

it on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred,

and there's no rationale to when they do one or the 

other.

 MR. MARSHALL: Three brief responses, Your 

Honor. The first is that to measure summary denials, 

you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the 

court was thinking about the time of delay.

 The second point is that delay in California 

is only half the equation. In California, there is the 

substantial delay and then there's also the 

justification portion. So persons who operate under 

substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify 

that delay and gain the desired review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the third?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they have to -­

would they have to justify the delay first? I thought 

there was something about, well, if the time question is 

more difficult and the merits are easy, there's no 

merit, so we just decide this.

 MR. MARSHALL: California's policy is to 

take a first look at a habeas petition and determine 

whether it is -- has a prima facie case or whether 

procedural bars are apparent. A court that's denying a 

case on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter 

was timely, and courts should be permitted to reach 

whatever is the most judicially efficient method of

resolving such a question without it being held against 

them.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So basically you're 

taking the position or you're conceding that the 

California courts are not consistent in their 

application of the timeliness rule?

 MR. MARSHALL: No -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief doesn't even 

try to defend that position. Are you conceding that 

there is inconsistent application of the rule?

 MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor.

 The point that we're making is that when you 

look at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or 

whether you impose it or not doesn't mean you're not 

applying the rule. For example, when trial courts 

review matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision 

not to exclude the evidence doesn't mean they didn't 

apply the Fourth Amendment.

 In this case, if the trial court -- or if 

the reviewing court looks at the length of delay, and 

then they may look at the justification to determine 

that the delay was justified.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- I might be 

speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus 

Resource Center brief showed that the court, the

California court, did reach some cases where an 

explanation had not been proffered. And so it can't be 

just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an 

explanation, you won't get heard. So what's the next 

step in that? Why do they reach some and not others?

 MR. MARSHALL: The California Supreme Court, 

if a case is patently meritless and perhaps the 

procedural question of timeliness is more complex -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could it be complex 

when there's no justification offered?

 MR. MARSHALL: The question of how long it 

was -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they pointed to a 

certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in 

delay where no justification was offered, and in some 

they reached the merits and in others they applied a 

procedural bar. So how is that consistent?

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, the State court has 

discretion to determine on the -- on procedural grounds 

or on the merits -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some Federal rule 

that says you have to apply a procedural ground before 

you decide the merits?

 MR. MARSHALL: There is not. There's a -­

which of the two it wants to use.

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in California, if it 

just says "denied," then the presumption is it's denied 

on the merits; is that it?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, a lack of a 

prima facie case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and if -- so if 

it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has 

to be something to indicate that it's for that reason? 

Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct. Typically, 

the citation is to Clark and Robbins, just as it was in 

this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we know that 

the California court just thinks that the Federal 

question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it? 

It may be meritorious. How do we know they're not 

applying the decision to reach the merits on an 

arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to 

avoid hard Federal questions?

 MR. MARSHALL: First is this Court has never 

taken the position, when measuring adequacy, of assuming 

that the rule is inadequate. The starting position that 

this Court has always taken when looking at the adequacy

of a State rule is to look for evidence to see that -­

if it can be shown to be inadequate. And I posit that 

there's no evidence in this case that has been presented 

to show that the State court is using their rules as a 

pretext of any kind.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it arbitrary and 

capricious for a court to take the ground of least 

resistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue 

that's presented? Is that arbitrary and capricious?

 MR. MARSHALL: I posit that it's not. This 

Court endorsed in Lambrix that it's all right for courts 

to address procedural default after Teague if that's a 

more judicially efficient method of handling the matter. 

Strickland cases permit addressing either prong, 

whichever is easier under the circumstances.

 And so the State courts ought to be 

permitted to address habeas corpuses on whatever the 

easiest, most judicially efficient basis is without 

being forced to answer a timeliness question if a case 

is patently meritless. And there should be no finding 

of inconsistency about that.

 And, more importantly, summary denials, as 

we're discussing here, don't afford any notice to 

litigants of what the State's procedures are or what 

they're thin king, because you have to guess. You have

to guess at how long the delay was, you have to guess at 

whether there was any justification offered. So summary 

denials do not assist the inquiry. And this Court has 

never endorsed using summary denials in its adequacy 

measure. This Court has always looked to published 

State cases that explicate the rule.

 This Court is looking to see whether the 

rule has been pronounced by the State for a certain 

amount of time, and then all of a sudden the litigant 

that's receiving the imposition of the rule receives a 

rule that was unexpected, either because the rule was 

changed or because the rule was novel. Nothing like 

that has happened here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The phrase is "substantial 

delay." Are there factors other than temporal factors 

that go into whether or not the delay is substantial; 

that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting 

his counsel and so forth? Is that what the court looks 

at -­

MR. MARSHALL: Those are -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when it looks at 

"substantial"? And is there -- are there California 

cases that tell us what the -- how do we define 

"substantial"?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, to both.

The kind of circumstances you're describing 

are exactly the kind of circumstances which makes 

California's rule fair, because it considers how long it 

takes a litigant to find his claim, get it prepared, and 

get it into court.

 And there are, in fact, concrete examples. 

The Robbins case specifically provided that a 5-month 

window from the discovery of triggering facts to the 

presentation of the -- of the claim was a reasonable 

amount of time. By contrast, the Stankewitz case 

provided that 18 months of delay from the discovery of a 

declaration was substantial and had to be justified.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: When does the State think 

that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely?

 MR. MARSHALL: Certainly he hasn't given any 

reason why he didn't present his additional claims at 

the time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges. 

Mr. Martin went through a full round of superior court, 

court of appeal, and supreme court challenges, and then 

waited some additional years and has never explained why 

he didn't include these additional claims in those 

earlier challenges.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think it -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's supposed to be filed 

within 60 days. I don't -- this is along the same lines

as Justice Kagan's question. Suppose there's the first 

round of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the 

new claim. Would that be substantial?

 Because you're indicating that failure to 

include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed 

against him. And I think that's what the Justice is 

inquiring about.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, it does -- it does weigh 

against. And it's a rule of reasonableness, and it's a 

discretion-based rule. And he would have to offer, 

well, why didn't he include those claims earlier? And 

if he had a good -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and what -- isn't that 

a separate rule? I mean, no matter how soon, if he does 

it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you 

can't come back with another habeas with material that 

you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So time -- time has nothing 

to do with that. It's just a separate -- a separate 

bar.

 MR. MARSHALL: California has articulated 

that successive petitions are a type of delayed 

petition. But you're right, there is a difference in 

California between successive petitions and delayed

petitions, and the ruling here is that he was delayed 

substantially.

 I was just addressing the point about when 

they might have been timely had they been presented 

earlier, and it appears that in the earlier -- he didn't 

get a timeliness ruling in his earlier challenges. So 

it appears that he could have raised them then and did 

not.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if we can take out the 

second and successive aspect of this and just focus on 

the timeliness, when does the State think that this -­

that these claims were -- became untimely?

 MR. MARSHALL: It's a rule of reasonableness 

and diligence that's circumstantially based, and -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have the 

circumstances here, so -- so under those circumstances, 

when did the claims become untimely?

 MR. MARSHALL: In the Robbins case, it 

explains that you have -- a 5-month span from discovery 

of the claims to presentation of the claims would be 

reasonable.

JUSTICE KAGAN: The 5 months would be 

reasonable. So is a year unreasonable? Is 5 months the

reason? I understand that if you have a good reason, 

that can lengthen it. But suppose you don't have a good 

reason. When does the State think, okay, that's too 

late?

 MR. MARSHALL: There isn't -- there isn't a 

defined time line. But our position is that a defined 

time line is not a necessity for adequacy. This Court 

has endorsed reasons of -- rules of reasonableness and 

diligence. For example, in the Federal prisoner context 

in Johnson v. United States, this Court said diligence 

in discovery, while it isn't exact, is good enough.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm -- I'm trying to 

get to even around, not -- not exact. My standard is 

not exact. It's just around. Around what? Around 6 

months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle?

 MR. MARSHALL: The position of the State is 

that Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable, 

18 months is definitely too long, and that there is a 

discretion-based determination in the middle.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's filed within 6 

months and it's -- it's rejected as untimely, and the 

petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this 

represents a grave departure from the way these are 

normally handled by the California Supreme Court? Is 

there any way for the petitioner to do that?

MR. MARSHALL: He would point to the 

published authority and argue that his case was outside 

of the parameters of what the State had done in the 

past. However, our position is that, since California's 

ruling is adequate, that there would be no evidence of 

such available to this particular litigant. A 

hypothetical litigant might be able to proffer that 

prior cases had treated claims differently.

 And the other problem with California is 

that it would require two exact same litigants, and it's 

very rare for two exact same litigants to have the exact 

same claims, the exact same bases for their delay, filed 

in exactly the same amount of delay. So true comparison 

is difficult.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think 5 years is too 

long, though?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- this was taken 

over by California from capital cases, but in the 

capital case context, there -- they have a 90-day 

presumption of timeliness. And when they extended the 

capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out 

the presumption that within 90 days is timely. Was 

there reason for that?

capital case policies took the timeliness rule -- took 

the general timeliness rule for themselves and added the 

presumption.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there reason for and 

then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going 

to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely. Why 

didn't they add that to the original rule?

 MR. MARSHALL: To the other litigant rule?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. MARSHALL: They, I think, felt that the 

rule was adequate the way it was, that a 

circumstantially based rule, a reasonableness-based 

rule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants 

to tell them what they needed to do to present their 

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would it be 

different in the capital context? What was the reason 

for adding the 90 days there?

 MR. MARSHALL: Capital cases are 

significantly more complex, the punishments are -- are 

more significant, and so additional scrutiny might be 

warranted in those contexts.

confused by your response to Justice Scalia. I thought 

from your brief that you were positing that there was no 

claim of inconsistent application of a rule that could 

ever survive.

 Let's assume for the sake of argument the 

following hypothetical, and probably not far off the 

mark. Litigants who don't know the law, who claim 

they're not educated in it, say that they have just 

learned about a new California case that gives them a 

ground to challenge their prior sentence. And the 

litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6 

months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court. 

A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review, 

and half of them are granted review and half are not. 

Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half 

of them don't. There is no difference between them 

that's discernible. They each just claim ignorance.

 Is that a case where someone would be out of 

luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application?

 MR. MARSHALL: I didn't follow the 

hypothetical. Was -- were some of the hypothetical 

individuals getting time-barred?

not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. No. Why do you

because the case is so meritorious or for any other 

reason? The issue is whether those people who filed 5 

years later and knew that it was very late, whether 

they're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether 

the -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years 

earlier to have it heard. How does that do any 

injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you 

know, you're likely to be denied?

evident on the trial record and on the appellate record 

was ever granted a merits review after 5 years. Because

But -- and I think that may be your argument.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, exactly. That no one -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I'm not -- I 

don't understand your answer, then. You have -- let me 

just adapt what Justice Sotomayor said. You have -- a 

case, a Supreme Court case is decided. And you have 

10 -- 10 habeas petitioners in California who file on 

exactly the same day. And five of them, if you were to 

get to the merits of their claim under this new decision 

of this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief, 

five of them would not be entitled to relief on the 

merits. And the California Supreme Court holds that the 

five who would be entitled to relief are procedurally 

barred and the five who were not entitled to relief on 

the merits are not, and they are rejected on the merits. 

Now, would that be an adequate State ground?

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, I'm not sure. It 

doesn't happen in California that way.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I know -­

MR. MARSHALL: All right. I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and I'm not suggesting 

that it would. But if it were to happen, would that be 

adequate?

would be adequate under this Court's prior tests.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So fair notice is not the 

only requirement.

 MR. MARSHALL: This Court has also required 

legitimate State interests, and this Court has used the 

legitimate State interests context, like, for example, 

in Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a 

particular kind of violation was a constitutional 

violation and the Court exercised its discretion not to 

reach the violation, this Court found that the State had 

no legitimate State interest in such a ruling.

 Our point is that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the cases that 

you're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the 

sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in 

which the effect of the State decision was to exclude 

the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision. 

The matter could not come before the Federal courts.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is something quite 

different. This is applying a time limit. I don't see 

why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into 

the -- whether it's not discretionary. I mean, to say 

it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar 

cases may be treated differently.

used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally 

different situation.

 MR. MARSHALL: It was the meritorious nature 

of the claims. And in California, meritorious claims 

don't receive the time bar because there's exceptions 

that take those into consideration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But none of this is -- is a 

device as is used in the cases that -- that you are 

referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude 

the Federal courts from the case. That's -- that's not 

what's going on here, is it?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess if the situation 

were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and 

has to figure out has there been too much delay or not, 

suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he 

said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases 

come out one way and half of them come out the other 

way. Could he then go to the California Supreme Court 

and say, Court, look what you have been doing? And 

would the court then grant a hearing on that and 

possibly correct it?

hypothetical, never-never land so far. But it's 

possible your opponents will convince us it's real land 

and not never-never land.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And for it to be 

real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you 

have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him 

with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the 

defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we're going 

to be barred by this time rule or not. Some courts, 

looks like we will; some don't. So -- what?

 Of course he's going to file the Federal 

habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or 

inadequate, correct?

 MR. MARSHALL: California's rule is 

perfectly suited to such a scenario. All that litigant 

has to do is explain why they didn't bring the claim 

sooner, either from late discovery or some other 

impediment, and the substantial delay can be justified 

with exactly those sorts of circumstances.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: What happens if a -- a 

person in this position is trying to investigate 

multiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to

a little bit more time in order to investigate some of 

my claims further? How does he make that determination?

 MR. MARSHALL: The Gallego case specifically 

speaks to that exact circumstance and provides that if 

you have a good faith basis in investigating further 

triggering facts, you may withhold the claims that 

you've already presented -- or prepared, to prevent 

piecemeal presentation. And that's a perfectly 

acceptable explanation in California.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it, Mr. Marshall, 

that the -- the California courts have not been a little 

bit more transparent about what the presumptive time 

limits are? You know, look, it's around a year unless 

have you a good reason. You know, at least we're taking 

3 years off the table.

 I mean, why don't we have decisions like 

that from the California courts that would -- would help 

folks here?

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, other than the Robbins 

decision, which speaks of 5 months as being reasonable, 

the court has tried to maintain a discretion-based, 

circumstantially driven analysis in which they take 

different litigants into consideration. One litigant

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. BIGELOW

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BIGELOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it 

please the Court:

 The adequacy inquiry is framed by asking 

whether the State rule in question is firmly established 

and regularly followed. At its core is the prevention 

of State courts from declining to enforce Federal rights 

and to maintain Federal authority over the protection of 

constitutional rights in the Supremacy Clause. In its 

brief at page 7, the State would seem to agree that a 

rule is inadequate unless earlier decisions of the State 

court are at least consistent.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what did you 

present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center 

presented? A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed

errors are apparent on the trial record and the 

appellate record, and no justification for the delay is 

proffered. Those are the three seminal facts that go to 

the requirements of Robbins and the other supreme 

court -- other California Supreme Court cases.

 Do you have one case that's similar where 

the court went to the merits?

 MR. BIGELOW: Sanders was a 5-year case 

that's cited in my brief. Jones was -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Was that someone 

who made a claim based on the trial and appellate record 

with no justification?

 MR. BIGELOW: I'll speak to justification in 

just a moment, if I may.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.

 MR. BIGELOW: And Jones was an 8-year case. 

The amicus brief, the Resource Center, cited Cooper, 

Duke, and Hardiman. Cooper was a 5-year case. Those 

were both IAC claims which appear to -- with respect to 

the Sanders and the Jones case, I cannot -- I do not 

know specifically what the claim was as I stand here, 

and I apologize for that. But let us look at 

justification for just a moment. The justification 

offered in those cases was that the habeas petitioner 

was ignorant and had no counsel. Now, I will represent

petitioners who file aren't represented by counsel and 

aren't lawyers themselves, and I will represent further 

that probably 98 percent, 99 percent have no more than a

 JUSTICE SCALIA: These cases that you cite, 

before you go any further -- are they cases in which the 

California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying 

that 6 years was okay? Or are they just cases where, 

without an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to 

the merits?

Sanders case and in the Jones case, there were -- I 

believe that they were decisions in -- they were 

decisions. These cases predated the Clark/Robbins 

situation. In the Cooper case and the Duke case, those 

cases -­

they were decisions, written opinions or just went to 

the merits and decided the merits? Did they say 

anything about the delay question?

but I didn't cite those. And I cannot speak to -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the other side says 

that, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may 

have gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier.

 MR. BIGELOW: No -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't have to worry 

about it.

 MR. BIGELOW: To that extent, it -- it's my 

recollection they went to the merits. They're not 

silent denials, and they don't cite Clark/Robbins 

because they predated Clark/Robbins. With respect to 

the Cooper case and Duke case, those I believe were 

silent denials. Now -- and that's the interesting thing 

about California. We are presuming -- we are presuming 

and this Court has reached that presumption -- that they 

are merit denials when they are silent, but we really 

don't know -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a puzzle to 

me. I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all 

the time -- they -- you used see all the time they don't 

decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because 

it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits. It's 

the same result. And sometimes they don't do that. But 

that happens often in a district court on appeal and

thousands of questions for review. So how do we know 

that that simple practice, which I've never heard of as 

attacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that 

isn't what's going on?

 MR. BIGELOW: Well, in -- in any given year 

recently, in recent history at least, there are about 

800 truly silent denials, no explanation. Now, the 

State says we can't consider them because they mean 

nothing. From our perspective, they have to mean 

something, and they have to count because we don't have 

the information that the litigant in this matter is -­

doesn't have the same kind of resources, for example, 

that the State does.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's -­

they -- what's your point? Eight hundred are silent. 

What does that show?

 MR. BIGELOW: That they have got to count in 

the adequacy -- in the consistency application, they've 

got to count against the Petitioner.

reasons down, and then you would know whether it is

questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a 

supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies 

something, but you haven't looked into the research that

write opinions. Is that -- have I gotten that

an explanation; somebody with 1 year might have not had 

any. And they may view those cases as different cases.

delay, and a curious thing that they did find, which is 

in their brief, is that even though -- cases which -­

look -- did they look for explanations for delay when

 MR. BIGELOW: I think the short answer to 

that is yes, but they also looked at silent denials as 

well. So they found that where there was no explanation 

for delay, more of those cases were decided actually on 

the merits than cases that did offer a delay. So

inconsistency between the need for justification of 

delay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how much range 

are you willing to give the State? Do they have 3 

months' range? I mean, if you come in and say, well, 

here they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed, 

and here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't 

allowed.

 Is that a problem under our consistency 

requirement?

 MR. BIGELOW: It wouldn't be a problem. 

That would be a discretionary rule if there were 

guidelines; if there were guidelines -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says -­

MR. BIGELOW: -- some kind of guidelines -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "as promptly 

as the circumstances allow." And then they go back and 

say there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.

 MR. BIGELOW: Oh, if they went back, with 

decisional law, decided the range?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You do the same sort 

of research you've done here, and you find out that -­

that there's a 3-month range. Sometimes -- I mean,

there are cases and you can show a lot where they are 

allowed at 9 months, and then you find cases that are 

not allowed under 6 months.

 MR. BIGELOW: I would be in a lot more 

tenuous position arguing this case if there was some 

guidance to litigants with respect to what does 

constitute a reasonable time period within which to 

file. What -­

California had a rule that said that you have to file 

within 1 year of the finality of the conviction, absent 

good cause for the delay. If that were the rule that 

California had, your client certainly would be untimely 

and you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, right?

 MR. BIGELOW: If that were the rule, the 

petition would have been filed timely.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -­

MR. BIGELOW: That's my answer. Had that -­

that is my answer to that question. Had that time 

period been known, the petition would have been filed 

timely.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if there is a 

requirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances 

permit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as 

prompt as circumstances permitted?

because in California there are no guidelines. That 

came in the Clark decision, which was 1993, and nothing 

has been decided in the State of California to define, 

to clarify, to narrow what constitutes "promptly." What 

constitutes "promptly."

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bigelow, isn't this 

similar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review 

prior to AEDPA?

 MR. BIGELOW: Well -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: A similar kind of delay 

standard, whatever "delay" means.

 MR. BIGELOW: No, if I recall, the standard 

was prejudicial delay. If I recall correctly. And 

prejudicial delay, if I'm correct, is a quantifiable 

standard. It is a standard that had, over the years, 

come to be understood. There was a -- a shared 

expectation with what prejudice encompassed. And so 

yes, it's similar, but it's not exact. It's not the 

standard in California.

 And if I may, California clearly understands 

that case law can offer guidance to litigants. In In re 

Harris, a case cited by -- by both of us, by both 

parties, the State of California was concerned about the 

Walterus rule, which is another procedural bar. And it 

went on to -- it acknowledged that it wasn't clear at 

that time, and it went on to explain what the Walterus 

rule was all about and why it was needed.

 In another case, more recently, the State of 

California -- a case not cited, the Kelly case; it's a 

2006 case -- the California Supreme Court directed its

detail in their analysis of Wende briefs, which is the 

State's alternative to the Anders brief, in order to 

provide guidance to litigants, to provide guidance to 

justices, and to -- to provide guidance to the Federal 

courts who may be called upon to determine procedural 

bars.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I understand 

that you'd have a much stronger case if you were dealing 

with a judge-made rule about timeliness, if the courts, 

on their own authority, said, look, we're not going to 

look at things that are filed 4 years late because that 

prejudices the State, it prejudices us, et cetera.

 But here you have something different. You 

have a rule, right? An established rule: promptly as 

the circumstances allow.

 MR. BIGELOW: Judge-made.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Judge-made, but it's 

been around for a long time. This isn't a new rule 

that's just coming in.

 MR. BIGELOW: So a rule in a footnote in a 

capital case.

which guide judges, which guide litigants, is just 

simply not there in California, either with respect to 

that rule or with respect to substantial delay.

California timeliness rule was never an adequate rule, 

never can proceed, never can bar consideration of a 

Federal claim?

 MR. BIGELOW: The -- had the -- never. Had 

the rule been applied even-handedly, had the rule been 

applied consistently, it would certainly be more 

adequate. However, and getting back to Justice Scalia's

that, but that hasn't been established as the brackets, 

and it is, after all, California's rule. And it is 

California that -- which needs to make that 

determination. Now, it's -- it's not as if California 

hadn't actually tried to do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a 

decision that said 18 months is too long.

 MR. BIGELOW: Not a decision that said that. 

These were extrapolated -- no, I beg your pardon.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a decision that 

said 18 months is too long.

 MR. BIGELOW: There was a decision that said

pardon -- another decision said that 2 years wasn't a 

particularly long period of time.

 But those are -- those are pre-Clark 

decisions, if you will, and this case is relying upon -­

or the State, rather, is relying on what has come after 

-- after Clark with respect to its "as promptly as the 

circumstances should allow."

 But the other point that I would like to 

make, it's not as if the State of California doesn't 

understand the need for a finite period of time to 

provide guidance to -- to all parties. In -- in 

Saffold, the State requested this Court presume a filing 

period. I think it was -- I want to say 60 days. More 

recently in Chavez, a filing period was requested to be 

presumed, again by the State.

 And both occasions, this -- this Court 

declined because it isn't this Court's prerogative to 

set rules for the State. What this Court did do is it 

certified the question to the State of California, or 

they asked the Ninth Circuit at least to certify the 

question to the State of California. The Ninth Circuit 

did exactly as this Court asked it to do and certified 

the question, and the State of California said: We're 

not going to tell you what a timeliness period is.

 Now, that does not help pro se litigants

 MR. BIGELOW: Approximately 2,500, give or

 JUSTICE ALITO: Approximately what?

 MR. BIGELOW: Approximately 2,500, based on 

a LexisNexis kind of search.

 JUSTICE ALITO: With that many petitions, is 

there any possibility that a multifactor test such as 

the one that California is applying could be applied 

with any degree of regularity, unless there's some sort 

of secret internal guidelines that are being applied by 

the California Supreme Court in deciding this?

 MR. BIGELOW: That's the problem. That's 

the problem. The test that is applied without 

guidelines, without any kind of guidelines. Judicial 

discretion -- judicial discretion is informed 

discretion; it is not discretion -- it's -- it's 

judgment pursuant to known guidelines. It is not a 

judgment issued pursuant to inclination.

when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find 

impossible cases that you should have heard because it

give the people equitable discretion to depart from it,

statute of limitations, we've learned to live with it,
