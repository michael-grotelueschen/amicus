3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 09-350, Los Angeles County v. Humphries.

 Mr. Coates. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. COATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 In Monell v. Department of Social Services, 

11 this Court held there could be no liability against a 

12 local public entity under section 1983 unless the 

13 plaintiff proved causation, namely that the injury that 

14 was inflicted was inflicted as a result of a custom, 

policy, or practice of that local public entity. 

16  The Ninth Circuit, however, in this case has 

17 imposed ex post facto declaratory relief on the County 

18 of Los Angeles as well as a substantial fee award, while 

19 acknowledging that it has not, in fact, determined 

whether the injury suffered by the plaintiffs and 

21 subject to declaratory relief was the result of a 

22 policy, custom, or practice fairly attributable to the 

23 County of Los Angeles. It did so because the Ninth 

24 Circuit has developed a digression from the Court's 

jurisprudence in Monell; namely, in the Ninth Circuit,

1 claims for prospective relief, both injunctive and 

2 declaratory relief, are not subject to the Monell 

3 requirements. 

4  We submit that this is flatly inconsistent 

with Monell and erodes the important principles of 

6 federalism that are the motivating factors for the 

7 Monell causation requirement. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the -- what was 

9 the basis for that -- for that exception, that 

declaratory judgment does not affect the fisc of the -­

11  MR. COATES: Yes, essentially in the Chaloux 

12 case -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: It does -- it does, though, 

14 if you have attorneys' fees. What -- what was the total 

attorneys' fee award in this case? 

16  MR. COATES: As to the County, it's $58,000. 

17 But the overall award is far above that, and that's just 

18 for appellate attorneys' fees. We're not even talking 

19 trial fees at this time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's far above? Like 

21 what? I suspect -­

22  MR. COATES: 600-and-some-odd thousand 

23 dollars. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suspect the case is 

mostly about attorneys' fees.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no 

2 objection on the part of the State. The State was to 

3 pay the lion's share of the fees, I think 90 percent, 

4 right?

 MR. COATES: Correct. The State has not 

6 contested that. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the State is not 

8 contesting. 

9  MR. COATES: The State has not contested 

that, correct. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the State make that 

12 payment under an Ex parte Young theory? 

13  MR. COATES: Yes, yes. It's a suit against 

14 the State under an Ex parte Young theory, since they 

maintain the statute. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you sue the 

17 municipality, if they deny a marriage license, do you 

18 have to sue under 1983, or you can just sue alleging a 

19 Federal cause of action under -- because of a denial of 

a constitutional right? 

21  MR. COATES: Well, it would have to be under 

22 section -­

1 Court has recognized, against local municipalities'

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The only way to sue a 

4 municipality for a constitutional violation is under 

1983? 

6  MR. COATES: In a direct civil cause of 

7 action, I believe that is correct, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could get the 

9 individual officer who's denying the marriage license or 

whatever the offensive act is. You could sue that 

11 person under 1983 and get -- and get injunctive relief, 

12 I suppose. 

13  MR. COATES: That is correct. You could 

14 also sue the individual.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But could you sue outside 

16 of 1983? 

17  MR. COATES: The individual, for a Federal 

18 constitutional remedy? 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to get -- the 

marriage license example -- just to get an order 

21 demanding issuance of the license. 

22  MR. COATES: No, I believe you would still 

23 have to have an operative statute to get it into Federal 

24 court for declaratory relief requires some -- some 

basis.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that has to be a

3  MR. COATES: I believe for a constitutional 

4 claim of this type, it would be section 1983. You might 

find an employment case where you might have Title VII 

6 concerns. It depends on the right that you're talking 

7 -- that's at issue. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens if the 

9 individual says I'm going to ignore the injunction? Can 

you go to the State and force the State to -- in that 

11 circumstance, to get someone to issue the license on 

12 your behalf? 

13  MR. COATES: If it's -- we're talking about 

14 the State, or are you referring to the municipality?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or the municipality. I 

16 misspoke.

18 showed that there was a policy, custom, or practice.

22 ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you're

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many times do you

1 have to show that you're not getting a license you're 

2 entitled to? 

3  MR. COATES: Well, say, for example, that 

4 one brought to the attention of a policymaking official 

that this is what was going on -­

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They wouldn't know 

7 that -­

8  MR. COATES: -- and then you have the 

9 deliberate indifference by a policymaking official. I 

submit that, under Monell, that might provide a basis 

11 under the Court's case law. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what do 

13 you do with CANRA section 11178(a)(2), which tells you 

14 that the municipality is responsible for the accuracy, 

completeness, and retention of the reports sent to the 

16 State? 

17  It's not your policy to ignore your 

18 obligation and not figure out what to do about the 

19 retention of improperly submitted names?

 MR. COATES: Well, the difficulty in this 

21 case with respect to that is there are no State 

22 standards in terms of evaluating the accuracy or when 

23 stuff is removed, when someone wants to be removed from 

24 the database. Even the Ninth Circuit recognized that, 

that it was kind of imposed on local public entities

1 through the back door, that there are no specific 

2 criteria in the statute for removing someone from -­

3 from the list. 

4  And that would require the County to start 

trying to create its own policies or its own procedural 

6 schemes. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's what it's 

8 charged with doing. It's charged with the 

9 responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and 

retention of these reports. 

11  MR. COATES: But -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if you're charged 

13 with the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the 

14 reports, why shouldn't you be responsible for the 

failure to maintain accurate reports? 

16  MR. COATES: Because it's not so much that 

17 they are inaccurate; it's the standards used to remove 

18 someone from the list or not. Because we may have 

19 information showing culpability, information showing not 

culpability, but we don't have a standard to tell us 

21 when to remove them from the database and when to leave 

22 them in, because that's defined by the State. 

23  More importantly, we don't have any 

24 procedures on how to go about that, because the 

statutory scheme doesn't have any for doing that.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Respondents here 

2 argue, don't they, that you should have created a 

3 procedure on your own, right? 

4  MR. COATES: Correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the -- presumably, 

6 that could be brought to the -- that could be brought 

7 before someone who is a County policymaker, couldn't it, 

8 when you are talking about something that's going -­

9 that's ongoing in the future?

 MR. COATES: That's true. That could be 

11 brought to the attention of a policymaker. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: And then that would fall 

13 within Monell. 

14  MR. COATES: Correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So that's why I'm somewhat 

16 puzzled about what this case is about. 

17  When are we going to get into a situation in 

18 which the plaintiffs are asking for prospective relief 

19 and the matter cannot be brought before a municipal or 

County policymaker? 

21  MR. COATES: No, I agree with Your Honor. I 

22 mean, I think that most of these cases do fit neatly 

23 within the Monell framework if a plaintiff pursues them 

24 within that framework.

 The Ninth Circuit doesn't require that,

1 though, and kind of just simply lumps the County 

2 together with the State and says the State statute's 

3 unconstitutional. You're charged with enforcing it. 

4 Declaratory relief against both of you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You concede, I take 

6 it, or acknowledge that one episode can be the basis -­

7 I mean, going forward -- for a determination that the 

8 defendant has a policy, custom, or practice. 

9  MR. COATES: You can. If you have a 

policymaker who understands the situation, makes a 

11 deliberate decision, yes, I think can you come forward 

12 with a Monell claim. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's your 

14 adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have 

been told that there's something wrong -- it seems 

16 pretty natural -- that a report would be kept on the 

17 registry that has been declared just plain wrong. 

18  The court has said there's no foundation 

19 whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report, 

and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove 

21 the name. Why aren't you liable under Monell? 

22  MR. COATES: Well, as a factual matter, the 

23 one thing the Ninth Circuit said it wasn't doing was 

24 figuring out whether this met the policy, custom, or 

practice requirement of Monell, because under its case 

11

Official 

1 law it doesn't have to do so. And, in fact, in the fee 

2 order, it said -- declined to do so and, in fact, it has 

3 remanded on the damage portion of the case, 

4 acknowledging that Monell claims remain open.

 We also contend that for purposes of 

6 potential Monell liability that we may not be free under 

7 State law to add additional procedural protections. 

8 That area may be pre-empted by the State through implied 

9 pre-emption under California law.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if that's the case, why 

11 wouldn't one of the following be possible? 

12  If you -- you say we have no discretion 

13 here. We are required to -- we are totally bound by the 

14 State procedures; we can't add any new procedure. They 

say, well, that's unconstitutional. So -- and you're 

16 choosing to do something that's unconstitutional because 

17 it's required by State law. 

18  Then, haven't -- in that situation, won't 

19 you have adopted a policy?

 MR. COATES: The way the lower courts have, 

21 in the context of liability, viewed this requirement 

22 where State law requires a local entity to do something 

23 is they have virtually said that they're standing in the 

24 shoes of the State. Under those circumstances, it's 

essentially the State making the decision. They are

1 just using the County as a -- the local entity, as an 

2 instrument. And so it's essentially an Ex parte Young 

3 Eleventh Amendment-type case. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: It would be an Ex parte 

Young situation. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they have sued 

7 the State here, right? 

8  MR. COATES: They have sued the State. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or under Ex parte 

Young? 

11  MR. COATES: They have indeed sued the State 

12 here. And we submit that they can get full relief with 

13 respect to the database from the State, should they 

14 choose to pursue that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who would they sue to do 

16 that? As I am reading CANRA, it makes the California 

17 Department of Justice only the repository of reports. 

18  MR. COATES: They may -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So who -- who do they 

sue in the State to -­

21  MR. COATES: They've sued the Attorney 

22 General, because the Department of Justice maintains the 

23 database. The Department of Justice issues the 

24 regulations on how local entities go about -- are 

required to report to the database. And so that's -­

Official 

1 that is the defendant in this case, and that's who they 

2 would sue. And I submit they could get relief by being 

3 removed from the database or require the State to enact 

4 procedures to allow them to have a determination made as 

to whether they should be removed or not. 

6  As it now stands, the statutory scheme 

7 doesn't have that, and the County's view is that it's 

8 not free to just go out and invent procedures, and other 

9 counties throughout the State of California aren't free 

to invent their own procedures. And that's one of the 

11 elements of this case that I think really underscores 

12 the Monell concerns with federalism, because it's an 

13 important question of the manner in which States relate 

14 to their municipalities and the way States divide up 

responsibility for who does what, and in a fairly 

16 important area of the law. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would happen 

18 under California law if you said, we agree with the 

19 Respondents that additional procedures are 

constitutionally required. So, even though California 

21 law doesn't allow this, we are going to create these 

22 procedures because we have to comply with the 

23 Constitution. 

24  What would your situation be under 

California law? Would you be subject to -- what could

2  MR. COATES: Well, there would be a possible 

3 pre-emption argument. They could halt California -­

4 they could halt Los Angeles from enacting the statute, 

from utilizing the procedural protections. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry -­

7  MR. COATES: They could say the area is 

8 pre-empted and move for an injunction from doing it, 

9 because they're interested via maintaining the database.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who is the "they" who 

11 would do this? 

12  MR. COATES: The State of California could 

13 come in and argue that the County was pre-empted from 

14 using these regulations. They could argue that it slows 

down the database or what have you. But they could 

16 theoretically do that under California law. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this is getting 

18 further removed from the situation that we're dealing 

19 with, because the State has already admitted liability 

and not has contested that its fees -- it owes fees. 

21  So, what is the relief that is left? If the 

22 -- if the State has admitted liability, what happens at 

23 that point? Shouldn't the record be expunged? 

24  MR. COATES: I believe the appropriate 

argument for the plaintiffs would be to apply in a

25

Official 

1 district court if they believe they have a valid 

2 injunction and valid declaratory relief vis-à-vis the 

3 State and move forward from there. 

4  They could certainly do that and have 

themselves removed from the database or order the State 

6 to create statutory procedures to allow them a hearing 

7 to determine whether they should be removed from the 

8 database. They're perfectly free to do that, because 

9 it's the State statute and it's the State database, and 

the State is a party here. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the State has already 

12 conceded. It's been adjudicated a constitutional 

13 violator, and the State is now saying, yes, we are not 

14 going to contest that anymore. Doesn't the State have 

to do something? 

16  MR. COATES: They should. They absolutely 

17 should. And if the State drags its feet, the 

18 appropriate remedy is to file a motion for an injunction 

19 as against the State, to have them issue the proper 

procedural protections or to remove them from the 

21 database. 

22  But we submit that it's, at this point, not 

23 appropriate relief as against the County. That issue 

24 still remains open. We could still go back into 

district court and lose that, but at this point you

1 still have to make the inquiry whether it's a county 

2 policy, custom, or practice that's inflicting the injury 

3 that's the subject of declaratory relief here. 

4  And, I mean, I think at bottom, at the end 

of the day, the point is that Plaintiffs really haven't 

6 identified any circumstance in which, in a proper case 

7 applying the Monell standards, you would not be able to 

8 get relief. And the danger of going forward with the 

9 Ninth Circuit's kind of amorphous standard where you 

just impose declaratory relief, independent of whether 

11 or not there's a policy, custom, or practice, is the 

12 kind of sloppy order that we have here, granting 

13 declaratory relief where we have a 90-10 fee split, and 

14 it's unclear how that decision was made, because it's 

not made through the prism of any sort of causation 

16 standard articulated by this Court. 

17  So we would submit that Monell provides 

18 clear guidelines, although sometimes difficult to apply 

19 in certain cases, but they are clear guidelines. And 

the Court in Monell said that those causation 

21 requirements applied to damages, injunctive and 

22 declaratory relief. And we believe that is a solid rule 

23 that supports the interests of federalism and -­

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's true that all cases 

that at least have come to us under Monell have involved

1 damages. 

2  MR. COATES: That is correct. They have 

3 been damages cases. But the -- but Monell itself 

4 doesn't talk in terms of guarding the public fisc, which 

is how Chaloux, the Ninth Circuit case that departs from 

6 Monell with injunctive and declaratory relief -- the way 

7 it characterizes it. It doesn't. 

8  Monell was concerned with interpreting the 

9 language of section 1983, the "shall subject," the 

"shall cause" someone else to subject a person to a 

11 violation. They said that did not really conform to 

12 respondeat superior principles. And looking at the 

13 legislative history, the 42nd Congress in enacting 

14 section 1983 was critical to Justice Brennan in Monell 

that the rejection of the Sherman Amendment, which he 

16 said was concerned mostly with not imposing coercive 

17 liability on the municipality for the actions of others. 

18 They were concerned not to save money necessarily, but 

19 the way in which a Federal court would exercise coercive 

power over a local public entity. 

21  And we submit that it is just as important 

22 to have those guidelines when directly coercing through 

23 injunctive and declaratory relief as it is indirectly 

24 doing it through the threat of damage claims.

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And can you -- can you 

cite me authority for that? And would -- do you think 

6 that the rationale for that is that since Congress has 

7 created an express cause of action, this impliedly 

8 pre-empts Bivens-type actions? 

9  MR. COATES: Yes, that's -- that's my 

recollection. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And have -- have we said 

12 that in a case? 

13  MR. COATES: Off the top of my head -­

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it seems to me it 

would help you in this case, because you would say, 

16 well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured 

17 party can sue for an injunction. Perhaps the State was 

18 against the party first, and he can -- he can raise a 

19 constitutional defense or he can bring an action for an 

injunction, and it doesn't have to be under 1983. And 

21 it would seem to me that that would resolve it. And you 

22 then wouldn't have to pay attorneys' fees because 

23 there's no provision in the statute for it.

6  MR. COATES: My understanding with respect 

7 to a general constitutional claim is that it is section 

8 1983, that that is the Congress's -- that's how Congress 

9 has specified the remedy. There are other portions for 

other types of conduct -- section 1986, section 1985, 

11 for example -- but I think this sort of general 

12 constitutional claim is subject to section 1983. 

13  And if the Court has no further questions, 

14 I'd reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

22 Justice Alito's question about what is at stake here. 

23 Monell held that 1983 has a causation requirement. And 

24 the Court has, in a series of decisions, elucidated what 

a plaintiff must prove in the context of claims for 

20
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 damages to satisfy that causation requirement, and it's 

2 held in particular that the mere fact that a city 

3 employee committed a violation under color of State law 

4 in the past is not itself a sufficient link to the 

municipality itself. And the decisions have been 

6 devoted to elucidating precisely what else is required 

7 in order to show the sufficient link to the 

8 municipality. 

9  The question here arises in what, we submit, 

is the very different factual context of ongoing 

11 constitutional violations. And we think that although 

12 the jurisprudence that's developed under Monell has been 

13 done a -- has been devoted to fleshing out this other 

14 context, the Court should take a look at whether that 

jurisprudence is the appropriate way to determine 

16 whether the causation test is satisfied when there is an 

17 ongoing violation, because there's an easier way to do 

18 it. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same statutory 

language that you're relying on, right, that was held to 

21 require causation in the one case? Why wouldn't it 

22 require a similar causation in the other? 

23  MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, we believe it does 

24 require causation, but the question is what kind of 

facts have to be shown to prove causation. And, in 

21

1 particular, once a plaintiff has shown what is required 

2 otherwise to show the violation, to show standing for 

3 prospective relief and obtain prospective relief, we 

4 think those elements will necessarily encompass the 

showing that's required to prove a link to the 

6 municipality itself. And what our concern here -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you're not really 

8 hurt if -- or the system isn't really hurt by the rule 

9 that the city asks for. If it's so easy to establish a 

policy or custom requirement in cases where prospective 

11 relief is sought, then that's the answer. You can 

12 establish it. End of case. But you don't get it unless 

13 you establish the custom and practice. 

14  MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, we think it should 

be easy. It should be present in every case. Our 

16 concern is that courts might be confused by the idea 

17 that what they are supposed to do is apply the 

18 jurisprudence that's really been developed to target who 

19 was responsible for this act that happened in the past, 

and not realize that there's really a quite more 

21 expeditious way to determine in the future. 

22  Here, it's quite clear. The court of 

23 appeals said there's an ongoing failure by the County to 

24 provide due process.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure

1 I understand your submission. And it could be I'm just 

2 obtuse on this point. 

3  I interpret your remarks as saying that 

4 Monell does apply when there's an injunction. Do I 

misinterpret you? 

6  MR. PINCUS: I guess I would clarify -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say, oh, it's so 

8 easy to do, it doesn't make any difference. Well, then, 

9 why are we here? Why isn't the city right?

 MR. PINCUS: Because I think what the city 

11 has said, Your Honor, is what Monell requires is for the 

12 plaintiff to show something in addition to what the 

13 plaintiff has to -- to what the plaintiff has to show to 

14 (a) prove a constitutional violation, and (b) prove an 

entitlement to prospective relief. 

16  The plaintiff says there is an additional 

17 element that may or not be present, and our submission 

18 is that the Ninth Circuit, although its rationale may 

19 have been slightly off, was correct in saying once a 

plaintiff has shown an ongoing constitutional violation 

21 and that the plaintiff is entitled, under standing 

22 principles and principles governing prospective relief, 

23 to relief, the plaintiff has necessarily shown a link to 

24 the municipality. And there is -­

you agree that a municipal policy, custom, or practice 

6 is required. That's what he thinks. 

7  MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, we agree that 

8 causation is required. I think the only slight fillip 

9 that I would make to your comment is I think in some of 

the jurisprudence that's developed focused on finding 

11 responsibility for past conduct, some of the ways courts

apply to State officials, right? 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. 

7  MR. PINCUS. No. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was trying to do just 

9 an analogy in terms of -- because one of his arguments 

has been that -- that Ex parte Young doesn't have, 

11 inherently, a Monell requirement. 

12  MR. PINCUS: Well, if I may, Your Honor, 

13 just to respond to the Chief Justice's statement -­

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 MR. PINCUS: The Petitioner's position is 

16 that this standard would apply also in Ex parte Young 

17 actions against State officials. The Court's -­

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That, of course, 

19 isn't before us.

 MR. PINCUS: It's not before you. The 

21 Court's jurisprudence is a little -- is a little 

22 uncertain as to whether that might or might not be true. 

23 There certainly hasn't been a holding to that effect. 

24  But one of the reasons we think this is an 

important issue to be very clear about is because, at

1 least on Petitioner's view and possibly on the view of 

2 how -- depending on how the Court analyzes the case, 

3 this would affect not just the universe of cases against 

4 municipalities, but also whether relief is available for 

ongoing constitutional violations in the very broad 

6 group of cases against -­

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would 

8 require -- that would require us to get into the 

9 question of whether Ex parte Young is a fiction or 

substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into. 

11  MR. PINCUS: Well, but it -- it might not, 

12 Your Honor, because it might turn just on whether -- I 

13 mean, Ex parte Young suits against State officials are 

14 under 1983. And so to some -- I think the argument that 

Petitioner would make is if causation is required under 

16 1983, well, Ex parte Young is just a vehicle to get 

17 those people -- to make those people persons. And so 

18 whatever the Court were to decide about causation would 

19 necessarily apply in those Ex parte Young actions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I have a question 

21 similar to Justice Sotomayor's. Suppose we were to hold 

22 that the Monell requirement applies to prospective 

23 relief, injunctive and declaratory relief.

6 make? 

7  MR. PINCUS: I think, Your Honor, we gave 

8 some examples in our -- in our brief. And one I would 

9 give is the example of the marriage license clerk who is 

engaging in unconstitutional -- who is -- who is 

11 violating the Constitution and denying marriage 

12 licenses. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: All right -­

14  MR. PINCUS: He or she is not -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Now we have a situation. 

16 The clerk denies the marriage license. And then I 

17 presume you can take the matter before a municipal 

18 policymaker, and the municipal policymaker will say: 

19 This is our policy, license denied. Or this is not our 

policy. 

21  And then Monell is satisfied, right? 

22  MR. PINCUS: Well, I -­

24 is our policy to deny licenses under this -- under these 

circumstances, that's a policy.

Official 

1  MR. PINCUS: It may be that -- I don't think 

2 the Court has required that there be some exhaustion of 

3 administrative remedies. I guess the way I would look 

4 at the case is, if -- if the party who is being injured 

filed suit against the municipality and against the 

6 official and said, I would like a marriage license, that 

7 -- and the court heard the case and found yes, there's 

8 an unconstitutional denial going on there, the fact that 

9 the lawsuit existed and there was an ongoing violation 

that had been, by virtue of the lawsuit, brought to the 

11 attention of the policymaker, and if in that case the 

12 judge decided that prospective relief is necessary, 

13 which necessarily means that there was some finding of 

14 ongoing violation under Lyons and those cases, that 

there would be a link to the municipality. 

16  And I -- my concern is not that, properly 

17 applied, a causation requirement would weed out cases. 

18 It's that because the focus of the Court's jurisprudence 

19 up till now has not been on the ongoing violation as the 

possible source of a policy, but rather was there a 

21 policymaker involved in the initial denial, unless if 

22 the Court were to say there's an extra step, it were to 

23 make very clear that the focus of attention is not the 

24 initial action, in terms of finding a policy, but on the

4  JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the 

answer to Justice Alito's question? The -- a clerk 

6 doesn't give a license to someone he should. Right? 

7 Now, you bring -- that person brings a lawsuit against 

8 the city. 

9  Now, if Monell applies, in order to win he 

has to show that it was the city's policy to deny it, or 

11 maybe all he has to show is the city's policy was to 

12 leave it up to the clerk. And if he finds it was the 

13 city's policy to grant it, he's going to lose, which he 

14 should, because there was no such policy. The clerk was 

wrong. 

16  MR. PINCUS: Right. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: What's the harm in that? 

18  Now, the next question would be: If we show 

19 the third, is there any ground for an injunction against 

the city? And on that one, I don't know. Maybe there 

21 is. Maybe conditions changed. I don't know.

7  (A) there is a city policy which requires 

8 him to do it; (B) there is a city policy that permits 

9 him to do it; (C) there is a city policy that forbids 

him to do it. All right? 

11  Now, those are the only three I can think

3 marriage licenses and that clerk continues to deny the 

4 marriage license up until the day of the lawsuit, that 

the plaintiff in that case is entitled to relief, to 

6 injunctive relief, because the city, by virtue of 

7 tolerating the conduct, has adopted a de facto policy of 

8 permitting it. And the alternative is -­

9  JUSTICE BREYER: If you're right about

16 would be very helpful is not to simply say Monell is -­

17 Monell applies, adopt our jurisprudence that was focused 

18 on retrospective conduct or prospective conduct; but 

19 rather, yes, Monell's causation requirement applies, but 

we recognize that in this context it's likely to be 

21 satisfied by the other things that the plaintiff is 

22 required to prove. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not what the Ninth 

24 Circuit -- the Ninth Circuit said, we're not deciding 

the Monell question; we're leaving that -- we're leaving

1 that open. But Monell -- we're not deciding because 

2 Monell doesn't apply to forward relief -- declaratory 

3 relief or injunctive relief. And so the Ninth Circuit 

4 has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it 

applies to all forms of relief. 

6  And so that's the question we are confronted 

7 with. Because we have had experience in Monell cases 

8 only with damage actions, was -- was the Monell decision 

9 wrong in saying that that framework applies to 

declaratory and injunctive relief as well? 

11  MR. PINCUS: And, Your Honor, my response to 

12 that is that Monell was not wrong. I don't know that 

13 Monell squarely addressed the question, but clearly the 

14 statute has a causation element and it has to be met.

 But what Monell didn't grapple with, because 

16 it itself was a case involving only a past 

17 non-continuing event, is how does that causation 

18 requirement get met in a case involving an ongoing 

19 violation?

 And we think that although the Ninth Circuit 

21 may not have had its reasoning quite right, what -­

22 the -- the bottom line was right, in the conclusion that 

23 when there is an ongoing violation and the other 

24 requirements for relief are met, Monell/the 1983 

causation requirement doesn't impose an incremental

4 I'm sort of asking for a hypothetical and to take it

7 ongoing violation as the failure to institute 

8 procedures, I'm assuming, to remove a name from the 

9 registry, correct?

 MR. PINCUS: Uh-huh.

12 failure that you're alleging entitled you to injunctive

16 thought that the city could remove the name? 

17  I'm not quite sure what it is that you 

18 think -- what was the continuing violation? 

19  MR. PINCUS: The continuing violation here 

is that every day for the past 9 years, our Respondents 

21 have suffered a violation of their due process rights, 

22 because they have not been given any sufficient process 

23 to show that they are wrongfully included in the index.

4 here, because the court of appeals -­

6 arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you're 

7 going to get a chance to do that on remand because the 

8 Ninth Circuit said we're -- we're making the city pay, 

9 and now we're going to find out if they violated 

anything. 

11  MR. PINCUS: I agree, Your Honor, but -- but 

12 by -- by issuing a declaratory judgment and by finding

 MR. PINCUS: And -­

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

7  MR. PINCUS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I think 

8 this is one of the -- one of the issues, I think, 

9 with -- with simply saying, as my friend does, that 

Monell applies. For the damages question, for example, 

11 whether the damages started accruing on the very first 

12 day the process wasn't -- wasn't provided, there might 

13 be a question about whether on that day there was a 

14 municipal policy in 2002 when this controversy started.

 It might be that on that day there was no 

16 municipal policy one way or another. Maybe no one had 

17 confronted it. Maybe nobody confronted it until 2006. 

18  But I think one thing -- so for damages 

19 there's a somewhat different inquiry which is, for each 

day for which damages are claimed, was that -- is the 

21 policy requirement met? This is a different question 

22 which is on a going-forward basis to provide -- to -- to 

23 be entitled to the prospective relief, what kind of 

24 causation is made. And that's exactly the concern -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you get

1 relief -- how can you get relief going forward under 

2 Monell unless there has been a city violation before? 

3 Otherwise what the injunction you're getting is just an 

4 injunction saying don't violate the law, and the city 

has said we haven't because you haven't shown that we 

6 had policy, practice, or custom. 

7  MR. PINCUS: But it is not necessarily true 

8 in this particular case that the policy -- that the 

9 policy was in effect from day one as opposed to 

something that -- that came into -- that -- the 

11 municipal responsibility might not have come to pass 

12 until later when a policymaker -- the city might say 

13 when -- when these decisions were additionally -­

going to implement a policy that violates the 

21 Constitution.

6 injunctive test is satisfied, yes. From the time that 

7 that is satisfied -­

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: From the time the suit is 

9 filed both -- the injunctive test will also be the 

damages test. 

11  MR. PINCUS: But the difference, I think, 

12 Your Honor, is to recover damages, the plaintiff doesn't 

13 have to show that the other elements of the damages 

14 claim don't encompass the kind of requirement of 

municipal -- of municipal involvement that is 

16 encompassed within the other elements of the prospective 

17 relief claim. So when a case has both, our submission 

18 is that there is no need -- the plaintiff does not have 

19 to show something more to show causation than he has to 

show to show the violation and to show the entitlement

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me follow this. To 

23 bring a damages claim, do you have to show past damages, 

24 or can you just collect damages from the date you file 

suit?

3 you just want to collect damages from the day you filed 

4 the suit.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in -- if that's the 

6 complaint that you file, then -- then in that kind of a 

7 suit the test for damages and the test for injunction 

8 would be precisely the same, and you would be able to 

9 get damages on the basis of the mere fact that the suit 

exists, right? 

11  Because they wouldn't be fighting it if it 

12 wasn't their policy.

1 somebody comes in and says this is what's going on. And 

2 they say, well, we don't -- we don't think that's 

3 unconstitutional. So they're going to defend the suit. 

4  That doesn't mean that they have adopted a 

policy to do what they -- the individual employee has 

6 been alleged to have done. 

7  MR. PINCUS: And is continuing to do. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- or 

9 continuing to do, I mean, the suit doesn't satisfy the 

requirement of showing a policy or practice, because 

11 they may defend on the ground that it's not 

12 unconstitutional. They may say, look, this isn't our 

13 policy, this isn't our practice, but we're going to 

14 defend our employee because we don't think it's 

unconstitutional. 

16  MR. PINCUS: And I think that is -- that is 

17 an example, to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question, 

18 of a case that would be problematic, because at the end 

19 of the day when the -- when the district judge issues 

his -- says, sorry, City, you're wrong, this -- this

3  And our position is, once that showing has

made that would be under Lyons that would say, yes, the 

6 city -- this is attributable to the city, that should be 

7 enough -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The city is in a 

11 catch-22 position. Whenever they are sued, they have to 

12 say if we defend this, we're going to be liable under 

13 Monell, but if we don't defend it, then, you know, our 

14 policy is being changed. Or we might -- we might want 

to have this policy; we might not. We didn't know this 

16 clerk was doing that, but we might think it's a good 

17 idea, we might think it's a bad idea. 

18  The cases are not always going to be as 

19 clear as the hypotheticals in your -- in your brief. It 

seems to me that it's a bit much to tell the city you've 

21 got to choose -- when you have to choose whether to 

22 defend a suit, you are in fact choosing what policy or 

23 practice to have going forward. 

24  MR. PINCUS: But the alternative is to say,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he doesn't get 

6 relief against the city because the city is not 

7 responsible for what happened until they adopt a policy, 

8 practice, or custom. 

9  Now, if they are told this is 

unconstitutional and they decide to stick with it, then 

11 they're -- then that's their policy and custom, and you 

12 can get an injunction against them.

anyone because he can't get prospective relief against

of their employees, then the city is put to a choice. 

6 Once -- I suppose once the legal process has concluded, 

7 they have to decide whether to continue that or not. 

8  MR. PINCUS: But, Your Honor, I think the 

9 consequence of that structure is that the city can leave 

the employee -- there is no remedy against an employee 

11 who is engaging in the unconstitutional conduct. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: -- against State.

4  JUSTICE BREYER: What is wrong with that?

 MR. PINCUS: The Court of Appeals held that 

6 they do have the power to do it. And we think that's 

7 settled for purposes of this case. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Why did the State -- why 

9 did they send it back? I thought they sent it back in 

order to determine whether there was some policy against 

11 doing it. 

12  MR. PINCUS: Look, they sent it -- one of 

13 the reasons they sent it back was to -- for -- so that 

14 the procedures could be provided or an injunction could 

be entered, directing the County to do what the statute 

16 requires, which is exercise its responsibility under the 

17 statute to make sure that the submissions are accurate.

Chief Justice's question, that if the city has a policy 

21 which it believes is constitutional but in fact is

1  MR. PINCUS: No, I'm not -- I don't think 

2 that courts have said that filing a lawsuit is an 

3 impermissible way to do that. And I think that it could 

4 be done by a letter also. But the Court has said, for 

example, that there is a deliberative difference prong 

6 to the Monell retrospective test as well. So that, in 

7 the hypothetical we've been talking about, if 

8 policymakers know of the ongoing conduct and they are 

9 indifferent to it, which they would be presumably if 

they're letting it continue, that that might be 

11 satisfied. 

12  But -- but, to us, that just goes to the 

13 notion that -- it's hard to come up with a situation 

14 where there will be an entitlement to prospective relief 

and the requisite causation won't be satisfied. And, 

16 therefore, saying there is this additional element, it 

17 sort of creates more harm than good because it's going 

18 to serve -- send courts on a search for it.

2 doesn't apply. And if you were just thinking, well, 

3 what's at stake? You say all of our cases involve 

4 damages; that's money. What is involved here? 

Attorneys' fees; that's money. So where do we bracket 

6 this? Do we bracket this with the -- with damages, 

7 because that's money, and that's what's involved here, 

8 attorneys' fees? Then the only thing that's before us 

9 is the award of attorneys' fees, right?

 MR. PINCUS: That's the only thing that the 

11 County petitioned from, Your Honor, but I think more is 

12 at stake here because if this rule applied, then it 

13 would not only preclude attorneys' fees; it would also 

14 preclude the awarding of any relief. And so, although 

this -- it happens to arise here in the attorneys' fees 

16 context, but if this causation requirement is more than 

17 just an extra box to check in terms of something 

18 that's -- for which the requirements will be satisfied, 

19 if it does screen out some cases, then it will not just 

mean no entitlement to attorneys' fees; it will mean no 

21 entitlement to prospective relief, and we think that's

14 relief where it was appropriate, where the injury was 

actually inflicted by the municipality. I think

17 the dog, that having established declaratory relief, 

18 that establishes causation, and that's backwards -­

6 city's acceptance of that policy wasn't what led the

2 done instead by you, the municipality, even though the 

3 agent that you had before was acting on his or her own. 

4  MR. PINCUS: In -- in those circumstances 

where the public entity is not a party, you can only 

6 hold the public entity liable when its policy actually 

7 inflicted that injury. These people re-apply for a 

8 license and they're denied, and a policymaker knows 

9 that, then they absolutely are going to come in under 

Monell, and I think it's going to be a slam dunk for 

11 them. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we're now going to 

13 have a situation where what you are proposing is that 

14 you have to sue the individual actor, get a ruling on 

the constitutionality of whatever is being done, and 

16 then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to 

17 perform or not perform, and if it doesn't, then you 

18 relitigate all these issues? 

19  MR. COATES: In the second lawsuit, the 

municipality is being held liable for its 

21 unconstitutional conduct. That's because the injury in 

22 the second case is absolutely inflicted as a result of a 

23 municipal policy, custom, or practice. That's why.

1 by the employee. You know, I see the significant point 

2 here, again -- and the Ninth Circuit Court recognizes 

3 because, again, it didn't apply Monell in granting 

4 declaratory relief and issuing the attorneys' fees. It 

conspicuously did not. 

6  It expressly reserved the Monell issue in 

7 the main opinion. It did so because, on rehearing -­

8 the initial opinion didn't say anything about Monell. 

9 On rehearing, we pointed out that those issues were 

still open, more specifically the issue of whether we 

11 were even free under California law to create these 

12 additional procedures. That issue remains in this case. 

13 It's a significant issue. Even the Ninth Circuit admits 

14 that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But whether you were free to 

16 do it or not under California law, how can there not -­

17 how can it not be your policy that you have refused to 

18 provide these procedures which they say are 

19 constitutionally required? Your policy is to follow an 

arguably unconstitutional State requirement, rather than 

21 comply with what is arguably required by the 

22 Constitution. Why isn't that a policy? 

23  Now, all that's at stake is -- and, of 

24 course, it's a matter of practical importance, but all 

that's at stake is a monetary dispute between the State

1 of California and the County of Los Angeles, which, as 

2 far as the federal Constitution is concerned, is the 

3 same thing as the State of California. So why should we 

4 be concerned about this at all? I don't understand why 

there's not a policy here. 

6  MR. COATES: For a couple of reasons. The 

7 lower courts in talking about this issue in the context 

8 of Monell claims against local public entities have 

9 said, look, if you are just enforcing State law, if you 

have no discretion, you're not really making a conscious 

11 decision, you have to do this under State law, you're 

12 essentially acting as an arm of the State Eleventh 

13 Amendment Ex parte Young. I think we cite the Bockes 

14 case, which is an employment case where they sued a 

local entity for employment decisions that were dictated 

16 by a State board. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but all that's involved 

18 is money between -- between California and a creature of 

19 California. As far as the Federal Constitution is 

concerned, California could abolish the County of Los 

21 Angeles. California could subsidize you for your 

22 attorneys' fees, or they could levy some sort of -­

23 something upon you and require you to pay them 

24 additional money. None of that -- what's the 

constitutional concern in all of that?

Official 

1  MR. COATES: Well, the constitutional 

2 concern is that it injects a Federal court directly into 

3 the way that municipalities operate under California 

4 law. I mean, injunctive relief -- it's even worse. To 

issue an injunction against the County saying you have 

6 to do these procedural protections, notwithstanding the 

7 fact that the State says you shouldn't be able to do 

8 that, is inviting a lack of uniformity in these 

9 procedures throughout the State, and the State might 

want uniformity. 

11  If you hold a local public entity 

12 automatically liable for declaratory injunctive relief 

13 for -- for enforcing State law, you really have 

14 circumstances where a local entity is going to say: We 

don't need this fight. We're not going to enforce this 

16 law. It may be defensible, but it's not on our dime. 

17  And then you get local entities not 

18 enforcing State law, and that seems to be a significant 

19 State interest. And I submit that these are the kind of 

federalism principles that, you know, Mozell -- Monell 

21 is designed to take into account. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think that the 

23 Federal court has to decide the issue of California law, 

24 namely whether you have freedom under this particular 

statute to add additional procedures to the California

1 statute? 

2  MR. COATES: They'll have to say whether 

3 we -- yes, I believe they will, to determine whether 

4 it's, in fact, a county policy or custom.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that something 

6 that ought to be decided in State court? Why isn't this 

7 a beef between the State and the State's creature, the 

8 County of Los Angeles? 

9  MR. COATES: It's very much like the 

McMillian -- the McMillian case, Your Honor, with the -­

11 the -- the State sheriff in Alabama, who's a county 

12 sheriff, and the question was, for Monell purposes, does 

13 he act on behalf of the State or does he act on behalf 

14 of the county? And the Court said that determination is 

informed by State law. It ends up being a question of 

16 Federal law, but it is informed by State law. 

17  So, the short answer is that the court does 

18 that all the time in Monell damages actions -­

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And California itself or 

the Ninth Circuit had a case in which the county sheriff 

21 was directed by a judge to garnish certain wages or 

22 certain accounts; the sheriff had no choice, apparently, 

23 other than to follow the judge; and the Ninth Circuit 

24 held Monell is not required when you seek declaratory 

relief against future actions, and so attorneys' fees

acting as a State official or a county official -­

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't make any 

7 difference? 

8  MR. COATES: It doesn't make any difference 

9 to the Ninth Circuit. Other circuits have been very 

careful in drawing that distinction as to how county 

11 officers -- how counties function. 

12  As I noted, I think this goes to important 

13 principles of federalism. It goes right into the way 

14 the States interact with their local governments. And 

it can have a profound impact on the way in which local 

16 governments view their obligation to enforce State law. 

17  If the Court has no further questions, I 

18 would submit the matter.
