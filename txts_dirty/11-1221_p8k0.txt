3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-1221, Hillman v. Maretta. 

Mr. Ruttenberg? 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. RUTTENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

9 it please the Court: 

Congress intentionally designed FEGLIA so 

11 that the Federal interest ends once the insurance 

12 proceeds are paid out. FEGLIA was established to enable 

13 Federal employees to carry out their responsibilities to 

14 their families. 

And Congress knew that some of its employees 

16 would get divorced, and it was depending upon State laws 

17 to help make sure that these family duties and 

18 obligations were carried out because Congress doesn't 

19 want to get into the -- the business of regulating the 

divorce. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did it make an 

22 exception then only for divorce decrees? 

23  MR. RUTTENBERG: Justice --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there is an express 

exception in the statute that the beneficiary can be

1 changed by a decree of divorce. 

2  MR. RUTTENBERG: Yes. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why would Congress say 

4 that while at the same time believing that the 

beneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree 

6 of divorce? 

7  MR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Scalia, because 

8 Congress knew that one of the main purposes behind 

9 FEGLIA was to help the insureds or enable the insureds 

to carry out responsibilities to their families. 

11  And that is a mechanism to help do that, but 

12 it wasn't --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's written -- but 

14 it's written in such precise terms, it must be 

incorporated in a divorce decree, and the decree must be 

16 filed with the employee agency pre-death. What you're 

17 saying is this specific exception, rightly cabined, is 

18 generalized so that in all cases, the second wife will 

19 prevail over the first. 

MR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, I believe 

21 that the requirements that it get filed in -- it being a 

22 divorce decree and it get filed before death, are an 

23 example of Congress intending to preempt the field of 

24 interference with the FEGLI plan. 

It -- Congress did this in several 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 occasions. If you wanted to do a beneficiary 

2 designation, you have to do it before -- in order for it 

3 to be honored, it's got to be filed before death. The 

4 same thing with an assignment. An irrevocable 

assignment has to be done before death. 

6  These are all examples of Congress saying we 

7 don't want States interfering with the administration of 

8 FEGLIA plans, but I don't think it is a statement that 

9 Congress is saying we don't want States to regulate 

domestic relations when it comes to FEGLI benefits. 

11  The -- the intent of Congress with regard to 

12 FEGLI benefits needs to be gained from a review of the 

13 entire statute of FEGLIA. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it be 

different than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and 

16 one -- one case that you cite quite often is the 

17 Hisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference 

18 to State domestic relations law, but what was the 

19 outcome in that case? 

MR. RUTTENBERG: The outcome in that case 

21 was the preemption prevailed in that case. I -- I was 

22 citing the -- the case of Hisquierdo because I think it 

23 very well lays out the presumption against preemption of 

24 family law. And -- and while that presumption can be 

overcome, as it was in Ridgway, and as it was in 

5

Official 

1 Hisquierdo, it -- it still is there. 

2  And it's -- it's a statement that Congress 

3 generally is not looking to regulate divorce. Not that 

4 Congress can't do it when it wants to, but that this 

Court normally starts its analysis assuming that 

6 Congress didn't intend to do that, unless they find 

7 direct -- a direct enactment saying this is -- we want 

8 to preempt all other State laws. 

9  That -- that was the -- the purpose behind 

citing Hisquierdo. But to answer your first question --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: But, you know, the -- the 

12 exception suggests another thing besides the fact that 

13 it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails 

14 is by a divorce decree. It also suggests that 

Congress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have 

16 the sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the 

17 insurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to 

18 know whom the -- who the beneficiary will be. 

19  If that were the case, there wouldn't be 

this exception for a divorce decree because the 

21 insurance company is going to have to look to see if 

22 there's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah, 

23 blah, blah. That obviously shows that Congress in this 

24 statute not only had a concern about efficiency of 

payment, but also had a concern about who gets the 

6

25

Official 

1 payment, right? 

2  There's no other way to explain the -- the 

3 exception for divorce decrees. 

4  MR. RUTTENBERG: Well, the exception for 

divorce decrees I would analogize to the Rose case, when 

6 this case was -- when this Court was addressing 

7 veterans' benefits. And in the Rose case, this Court 

8 distinguished Ridgway and Wissner because the purpose 

9 behind the Veterans' Benefits Statute this Court 

determined was in part to take care of the veterans' 

11 families and it looked at -- it looked at the text. 

12  It looked at the Senate report that said 

13 that, but it also looked at the text. And the text had 

14 in Rose a -- a provision which said the Veterans 

Administration can apportion a part of those benefits 

16 for the benefit of the noncustodial children. And it 

17 was argued in that case that that's Congress's statement 

18 that this is the only exception and further exceptions 

19 shouldn't be applied and Congress was trying to regulate 

this area. 

21  But this Court said that's not what Congress 

22 was doing there. That was Congress showing that they 

23 cared about -- that those benefits were there to help 

24 take care of the family members. And FEGLIA is the same 

way.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what was the 


2 issue? What was the issue in Rose? 


3  MR. RUTTENBERG: In Rose, there was 


4 veterans' benefits and those -- he was being sued in 


State court for enforcement of child support and those 


6 were his only assets. 


7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, they were taking 


8 them from him to support his family. 


9  MR. RUTTENBERG: Correct. 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is quite something 

11 different. This is taking it from the designated 

12 beneficiary and giving it to somebody who isn't 

13 designated. 

14  MR. RUTTENBERG: That's correct, Your Honor. 

But I -- I think when you look at the purpose, the 

16 stated purpose of FEGLIA, which is to help insureds 

17 carry out their responsibilities to their families --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that's the --

19 that's the purpose of this exception for divorce 

decrees? 

21  MR. RUTTENBERG: I think that --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: In your experience, a man 

23 usually has more children or children in his second 

24 marriage than he did in his first? 

MR. RUTTENBERG: No, Your Honor.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think so, 


2 either. I -- I think if Congress was concerned about 


3 money for the kids, it would have left the money with 


4 the first wife. 


MR. RUTTENBERG: I think what Congress was 

6 doing is Congress was making a statement -- I don't 

7 think they were trying to say they were looking at this 

8 divorce law in particular. I think what Congress was 

9 saying is that, we're just going to look to the States 

and let the States use their benefit and wisdom to 

11 determine which divorce laws should apply and which 

12 shouldn't apply. 

13  So that in this case in particular, there --

14 there are benefits and detriments possibly to section D, 

but what this Court I think would be appropriate to do 

16 would to -- to pass a bright-line rule that said State 

17 laws that interfere with the administration of a plan 

18 are preempted, but after that, after the money has been 

19 paid out, laws that affect the benefits are not 

preempted, and that -- that allows the States to 

21 be --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, they're 

23 preempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can 

24 be thwarted. 

MR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Kennedy, it's not

1 the purpose of the preemption. Section D was a response 

2 to this Court's opinion in Egelhoff. And at first blush 

3 it looks like, especially with the language, that that's 

4 what the States are trying to do, trying to end run 

preemption. 


6  But that -- when you look at it closely, 


7 that's not what was going on. In -- in Egelhoff, this 


8 Court found that Congress intended to preempt a 


9 Washington statute very similar to section A, but what 


Congress was preempting was a State interfering with the 

11 administration of the plan. It wasn't preempting a 

12 State domestic relations equitable remedy designed to 

13 protect the people to whom the Federal employee owed a 

14 duty of support. 

It wasn't that -- that the States were not 

16 listening to Congress or this Court, and they're not 

17 sticking their fingers in their ears going la, la, la, I 

18 can't hear you. A good example of this would be if a 

19 State had a estimated tax payment law that said when you 

get insurance, you've got to pay 10 percent into the 

21 court or into the State, that wouldn't be preempted. 

22 But if the State thereafter had a law, enacted a law 

23 that said we want a withholding requirement and if that 

24 money is withheld then you don't have to do the 

estimated tax payment, well, that would clearly be

1 preempted because it interferes with the administration 

2 of the plan. But the first law would still be fine. It 

3 shouldn't per se be preempted because it enacted the 

4 second law that is preempted because it's interfering 

with the administration of the plan. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, the divorce 

7 exception blows away that -- that explanation, that all 

8 Congress is concerned about is efficient administration 

9 of the plan so long as the insurer will know. You know, 

just look at the -- look at the -- at the contract, the 

11 named beneficiary, pay the money to the named 

12 beneficiary, and you're home free. That -- that is 

13 blown away by the exception for divorce decrees. The 

14 insurer is going to have to check that there hasn't been 

a divorce since the contract was signed, right? 

16  MR. RUTTENBERG: Well, they're -- they're 

17 not going to have to check unless it's been properly 

18 filed, but --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They have to check 

to see if it has been properly filed, right? 

21  MR. RUTTENBERG: Yes, yes. But the Federal 

22 Government has no -- it -- there is no interest that the 

23 Federal Government would have in saying that a divorce 

24 decree that was properly filed has -- should be --

should be honored, but one that hasn't been properly

1 filed shouldn't be. They want State laws there. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but quite apart 

3 from -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your 

4 proposal the Congress would actually have accepted a 

situation where one spouse sues a former spouse. In 

6 other words, you have a -- that's the whole design of 

7 this statute. 

8  Would the insurance company -- if you were 

9 representing the insurance company, would you tell the 

insurance company that they were completely safe in 

11 paying the benefits to the first spouse even if there's 

12 going to be a suit afterwards? 

13  MR. RUTTENBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or would the insurance 

company itself be under some liability? 

16  MR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Kennedy, that's 

17 the -- the whole point, is that the insurance company 

18 isn't --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the design of the 

statute. 

21  MR. RUTTENBERG: That's the design of the 

22 statute. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm just wondering 

24 whether under State law the insurance company, if it --

if it knows this doesn't have some duty to refrain from

1 making the payment or to put it in escrow or to 

2 interplead. 

3  MR. RUTTENBERG: Not at all. The statute's 

4 specifically written so that the former spouse becomes 

personally liable to the widow or whoever was entitled 

6 to it. It's designed to make the --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if you're representing 

8 the insurance company, you wouldn't say you better 

9 interplead to be on the safe side? 

MR. RUTTENBERG: I think this Court can 

11 establish the -- I think they have established under the 

12 Kennedy case that they have a duty to pay the designated 

13 beneficiary. In Kennedy, with regards to ERISA and 

14 whether or -- it was very clear that the insurance --

the plan administrator has to pay. So I think that 

16 there is no concern at all for the insurance company. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ruttenberg, how do 

18 you get to this notion that administrative convenience 

19 is all that is involved? After all, this is an 

employee's life insurance and the Government is saying 

21 to the employee, the beneficiary is your free choice, 

22 you can pick anyone, your spouse, a charity, it's your 

23 choice, but we want you to know that, although you make 

24 it and you can change it any time you want, if you don't 

change it that will be it.

1  That -- so it's giving, the employee, 

2 control over the proceeds of his or her life insurance. 

3 Why isn't that a purpose along with administrative 

4 convenience? 

MR. RUTTENBERG: I believe that the purpose 

6 of FEGLIA was -- the other main stated purpose is that 

7 Congress was trying to offer life insurance similar to 

8 what was being offered by private companies, and they're 

9 acting as an employer in this regard. And just like 

with private group life insurance, most people think 

11 that the beneficiary designations are going to control 

12 where that money goes and -- and the same with FEGLIA. 

13  But also, most everyone expects when they 

14 get divorced that their assets are going to be subject 

to State divorce law. And I'm not suggesting that 

16 Congress wasn't concerned with employees carrying out 

17 their responsibilities to their families. I'm 

18 suggesting Congress is using the State law. Congress 

19 doesn't want to be the one that makes sure that those 

responsibilities are carried out. They're relying on 

21 State law and they've developed a scheme that allows 

22 State law to help make sure those duties are carried 

23 out. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: If an insured, after making 

a designation of a beneficiary, writes a will and leaves 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 the insurance proceeds to a different person, the 

2 Federal law would still, as interpreted by the State 

3 Supreme Court, require the money to be paid to the 

4 designated beneficiary, wouldn't it? 

MR. RUTTENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: And what does that say about 

7 Congress's supposed desire to ensure that the money goes 

8 to the person that the insured wants it to go to? 

9  MR. RUTTENBERG: Well, Justice Alito, after 

the money has been paid out in a case like that, it is 

11 possible that there are State laws involved that -- that 

12 would allow someone to have a suit -- institute a suit 

13 against who received that. But Congress doesn't want 

14 OPM or MetLife to have anything to do with that. They 

just want OPM and MetLife to be able to do the job of --

16 of paying out the designated. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the point is if 

18 Congress's objective, if one of its objectives in 

19 addition to administrative convenience was to effectuate 

the will of the insured, then I don't see why it would 

21 provide for Federal law to override a subsequent will 

22 which directly expresses the desire of the insured. 

23  MR. RUTTENBERG: I don't think FEGLIA says 

24 that. What it says is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would agree with

1 that? I assume you would agree with what Justice Alito 

2 just said? 

3  MR. RUTTENBERG: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That it has only to do 

with administrative convenience? 

6  MR. RUTTENBERG: Well, I don't want to say 

7 that it has only to do with that. That's one of the --

8 the -- that's the reason, though, that everything ends 

9 once the benefits are paid out. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should this scheme be 

11 treated differently than the National Service Life 

12 Insurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway? 

13 Those operated the same way. They said the person who 

14 designates is who gets it and if you -- the only way 

you can change it is to have a change of beneficiary 

16 form filed with your employer, if you don't do that, 

17 whatever you've said is where the money goes. 

18  MR. RUTTENBERG: There's -- there's a -- you 

19 have to compare the FEGLIA and the SGLIA to get the 

intent of Congress. You want to -- this Court should 

21 look at the text of FEGLIA and it should look at the 

22 legislative history, and there's five main differences I 

23 can point to which suggest that Congress intended 

24 something different. 

The first is that FEGLIA doesn't have an 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 anti-attachment provision. 


2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the two decisions 


3 that dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as 


4 an alternative ground of decision. It was quite 


separate and discrete from saying what's on the 


6 beneficiary, the designation that controls. And they 


7 say, and also there's this anti-attachment. 


8  MR. RUTTENBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor. 


9 But when it did the holding regarding the order of 


precedence, it didn't just look at the order of 

11 precedence. It looked at all of SGLIA and it looked at 

12 the differing provisions, and one of the provisions I 

13 think that indicates Congress's intent in SGLIA is the 

14 anti-attachment provision. 

So if the second holding was not there at 

16 all with regards strictly to the anti-attachment 

17 provision, Ridgway still would have held the way it held 

18 because it was looking at all of SGLIA. 

19  But that's not the only difference. There's 

also the divorce provision which they have in Federal 

21 group life insurance and they -- they didn't put that 

22 into the servicemen's group life. They let FEGLIA 

23 people assign their benefits. There's a limited express 

24 preemption provision in FEGLIA which they didn't feel 

was needed in SGLIA. And when you --

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- in your briefs in 

2 this case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as 

3 an afterthought. I think you did not put it in your 

4 main brief. It came up only in your reply brief, and 

you didn't put it in the appendix to your main brief. 

6  MR. RUTTENBERG: That's correct, Your Honor. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- you seem to 

8 assign lesser importance to it. 

9  MR. RUTTENBERG: I do assign less importance 

to the assignment provision than I would to the -- the 

11 lack of an anti-attachment provision or the -- the 

12 divorce provision or the express preemption provision or 

13 even the legislative history. But I do still think that 

14 it is a factor to be looked at. 

And in this case, again pointing to the Rose 

16 case, in the Rose case, they were dealing with the same 

17 anti-attachment provision in Rose and even there 

18 determined that Congress did not intend that those 

19 dollars should be kept away from the -- the family 

members in that case. 

21  So I would again analogize that to this case 

22 because in the Rose case, they specifically 

23 distinguished those two cases on those grounds. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I keep -- I keep coming 

back to the explicit divorce provision, which says when

Official 

1 there's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it, 


2 without a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new 


3 wife, okay. And you're telling us that even without a 


4 divorce decree, the new wife will effectively get the 


money so long as there is a State law that says all --


6 all proceeds from insurance companies for policies 


7 entered into before the -- before the -- the decedent 


8 was divorced will go to the new wife. 


9  It seems to me that is such a -- such a 


blatant frustration of the -- not just the purpose of --

11 of the very text of the divorce provision in the law, 

12 which says only if there is a decree properly filed will 

13 it go to the new wife. And you're saying, well, it 

14 doesn't really matter so long as there's a State law 

which says it will go to the new wife without a -- you 

16 know. 

17  MR. RUTTENBERG: There -- there are two --

18 two points I'd like to make there. One, I don't think 

19 Congress was trying to get involved in the field of 

divorce. I don't think Congress with that law was 

21 saying all other domestic relations laws don't apply, we 

22 only want to apply these laws. There's so many other 

23 domestic relations laws like community property rights 

24 and waivers. And children even in these divorce 

decrease can't file it, and then children would lose out

3 that's what Congress was trying to do there with that 


4 provision. 


And the second point is that it's not a 

6 superfluous provision. If I had a divorce decree, I 

7 would much rather file it with the court so that I knew 

8 it would get paid directly to me than have to deal with 

9 it after it's been paid out. So I think it is -- it 

absolutely serves a purpose, but it doesn't serve the 

11 purpose of trying to -- to get -- I think Congress was 

12 trying to make a statement, we want these benefits to be 

13 subject to State laws, not that we want these 

14 benefits --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why not just say 

16 that? If that was Congress's intent, why limit it to a 

17 specific form of State borders involving divorce, 

18 annulment, et cetera? Why not just simply say in 80 --

19 80705(e) that any court order could change the order of 

precedence, if that was Congress's intent? 

21  MR. RUTTENBERG: I believe that's basically 

22 what they did because the other type of court orders 

23 such as a waiver wouldn't make sense to put in there. 

24 You -- you would not -- if I was paying attention if 

I -- if I had filed -- if I had a divorce decree that

1 said my ex-wife waived a right to my insurance, it 

2 doesn't make sense that I'd do that additional filing 

3 because that wouldn't add anything to it. 

4  So Congress was saying that court orders can 

-- that direct where money goes does that. And the 

6 other types of laws, like community property laws or 

7 waivers or this type of law, they would have to have a 

8 separate section for each of them to draft it in such a 

9 way that it wouldn't interfere -- it would make it easy 

on OPM to know where to pay the money. 

11  And I think what they were doing is they 

12 weren't saying any types of State laws can come in 

13 because they didn't -- they wanted to deal with the ones 

14 that were clear, that were easy for them to deal with, 

so that they -- so that OPM and MetLife knows where to 

16 pay the money. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ruttenberg, what 

18 about the interest, which was an interest in Wissner and 

19 in Ridgway, of uniformity under this Federal insurance 

scheme? That is, one of the hypotheticals in the briefs 

21 was the deceased dies domiciled in Virginia. Wife 

22 number 1 comes from X State, not Virginia, wife number 2 

23 two from Y State, and they all have different --

24 different rules. The employee, in the course of her 

career, may move around from here to there.

1  But if you follow the Federal law, then it's 

2 going to be the same for every employee. These are the 

3 rules for every employee no matter where he or she 

4 lives, no matter the location of the spouse. And then 

we don't have these messy problems with choice of law. 

6  MR. RUTTENBERG: Congress was definitely 

7 concerned with -- and -- and as, again, I keep referring 

8 to the Rose case because I think it worded it well, it 

9 was confirmed with the uniformity of the administration 

of the policy. And they wanted OPM and MetLife to 

11 uniformly, no matter where anyone lived, be able to pay 

12 those out. 

13  But just like a private employee, people 

14 expect their assets to be subject to divorce laws after 

they're paid out. And OPM is not involved in anything 

16 messy, MetLife is not involved in anything messy after 

17 it's paid out. They're treating them just like any 

18 other employee in a private company. 

19  And -- and Congress stated that the purpose, 

the other -- there are two main purposes. The other 

21 main purpose of FEGLIA was to create an insurance plan 

22 that was on par with, not the special kind of insurance 

23 that we're offering to servicemen. Congress with 

24 Servicemen's Group Life took out a magic wand and said, 

we're going to make these insurance proceeds special,

1 and gave special characteristic -- characteristics to 

2 the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance proceeds. 

3  But they did not do that -- well, the reason they 

4 did that with Servicemen's Group Life Insurance is 

because they wanted servicemen, no matter how much they 

6 messed up their finances, to know that they could leave 

7 some asset to whoever they wanted to, regardless of --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did't they just say, 

9 look, if the -- if the State law says so, the -- the new 

wife gets it? Why didn't they just say that instead 

11 of -- you're telling me they set up this -- this sick 

12 system in which the -- the former wife or the new wife 

13 has to sue the former wife to get the money that was 

14 paid to the former wife. I mean, my goodness. What --

our courts are crowded with -- with suits between, you 

16 know -- why -- why don't they just say, if the State law 

17 says it, it goes to the new wife. 

18  MR. RUTTENBERG: The -- the first reason is 

19 because I don't think they wanted to try and come up 

with every permutation of divorce law. The second 

21 reason, you -- you characterize this as a -- a "sick 

22 law," but 48 States incorporate laws which have this 

23 concept. They say, in your will, references to your 

24 former spouse are deemed divorced, they just haven't

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. STEFFEN N. JOHNSON 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

9  MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  On two separate occasions, this Court has 

12 held that order of precedence provisions like those 

13 found in FEGLIA grant the insured an absolute personal 

14 right to, quote, "direct that the proceeds belong to the 

named beneficiary and no other." 

16  In fact, Congress enacted FEGLIA just four 

17 years after this Court's decision in Wissner, where this 

18 Court held that the MISLA order of precedence was the 

19 controlling section of the Act, was forceful and clear 

in defining the scope of this Federal right, preempted 

21 post-distribution efforts to nullify the insured's 

22 choice, quote, "whether directed at the very money it 

23 received from the Government or an equivalent amount." 

24 And Ridgway, of course, extended Wissner to SGLIA, which 

contains the very same text at issue here.

Official 

1  Now, for a number of reasons we think that 

2 this case is even easier than Wissner and Ridgway. 

3 First of all, we are not dealing with the generally 

4 applicable body of law, we are dealing with something 

that is quite openly an attempt to do an end run on 

6 preemption. The only thing that triggers section D is 

7 being a former spouse and receiving the proceeds. The 

8 statute doesn't make any inquiry into intent, into 

9 whether there has been a tort or an independent 

contract. It simply reallocates the proceeds. It 

11 substitutes a new beneficiary. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, if the 

13 ex-wife were in bankruptcy proceedings this money would 

14 not necessarily go to her, right? It would go to the 

bankruptcy estate? 

16  MR. JOHNSON: It -- it might, Your Honor. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so why is the 

18 State law any different --

19  MR. JOHNSON: Well, Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- with respect to 

21 divorces? 

22  MR. JOHNSON: Well, one reason, Your Honor, 

23 is 8705(e). Congress has spoken specifically to the 

24 question of divorce in this context, and I think, as 

Justice Scalia's and Justice Sotomayor's questions

1 indicate, it didn't simply say that the existence of a 

2 decree or the fact of divorce would result in a change 

3 in who receives the proceeds. It said a very specific 

4 type of divorce decree would change the result. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, my problem with this 

6 case is, other than administrative convenience, I don't 

7 see what purpose Congress could have thought that this 

8 provision serves. 

9  MR. JOHNSON: Your Honor, there is certainly 

elements of administrative convenience in the statute. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: What else -- what other --

12 what other objective do you think Congress was trying to 

13 achieve? 

14  MR. JOHNSON: It was trying to provide a 

benefit to Federal employees, and that benefit was to be 

16 able to provide benefits, life insurance proceeds, to 

17 the person of their choice. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it override the 

19 expressed will of an insured in -- the express desire of 

an insured in, for example, a will that's executed after 

21 the time of the assignment --

22  MR. JOHNSON: In the case of --

23  JUSTICE ALITO: -- and the designation of 

24 the beneficiary.

1 Honor, 8705(a) makes specific provision for the filing 


2 of a will with the employing officer, OPM. And so 


3 Congress has taken account of wills and it's rejected 


4 the idea of just a free-floating inquiry into intent. 


There were pre -- I should add that the will language of 

6 8705(a) was added to the statute in 1966. There had 

7 been some lower court cases that had sort of taken this 

8 approach to wills contrary to the regulations that 

9 existed that said -- that designated beneficiary 

provision should govern. Congress rejected a 

11 free-floating inquiry into intent. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: But why? You've got a --

13 you've got a designation of a beneficiary in 1975, 

14 let's say, and then you have a will that's executed in 

2005. Why would Congress want the -- the designation of 

16 the beneficiary so far in the past to override the 

17 expression of the desire of the insured in the 

18 subsequent will? 

19  MR. JOHNSON: Congress wanted a simple rule, 

and it determined that the best evidence of intent is 

21 the actual naming of the beneficiary. Section D doesn't 

22 make --

23  JUSTICE ALITO: How can that be the best 

24 designation of intent? You have a designation long in 

the past, then you have a will that says that, the

2 How is the earlier designation of a beneficiary a better 

3 expression of intent? 

4  MR. JOHNSON: Well, I think you can debate 

what the better policy default is, but when you have a 


6 long-standing policy that says to Federal employees, 


7 this is what we take account of and we give top -- top 


8 billing, top priority to the naming of the 


9 beneficiary --


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Johnson, that -- that 

11 is in the OPM manual, but I think Mr. Ruttenberg pointed 

12 out that it's 106-some-odd pages. How are employees 

13 covered by this insurance, how are they informed about 

14 what the beneficiary designation means? 

MR. JOHNSON: The simplest answer, Justice 

16 Ginsburg, is the form itself. It's Form SF-2823. This 

17 form says, "Keep your designation current. Submit a new 

18 one if your intentions change, for example, due to a 

19 change in family status such as marriage, divorce, et 

cetera." 

21  So it's not simply the OPM handbook. It's 

22 the form itself. And this form is publicly available, 

23 of course, on -- on OPM's website, but also was 

24 substantially the same and contained this language at 

the time of Warren Hillman's designation in this case.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do you resist --

2 I'm just curious. I -- I would have thought that to 

3 answer Justice Alito you were going to say the answer is 

4 it isn't more accurate. If you write a will and say I 

want these proceeds now to go to my second wife, that is 

6 a better expression of the person's intent. But if you 

7 open that door, you'll get other wills that aren't quite 

8 so clear. And that's the problem that Congress faced. 

9  MR. JOHNSON: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor. And of course there is an --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? 

12  MR. JOHNSON: Well -- well, it is true that 

13 if you open the door you'll have this problem. 

14 Congress wanted a clear, simple, and certain rule, 

and -- and it spoke both to the issues of wills in 

16 8705(a) and to the issue of divorce decrees in 8705(e). 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that provides a 

18 simple -- that provides a -- a simple rule for the 

19 people who are affected by this dispute, and those are 

the people who are -- who stand to benefit either under 

21 the designation of the beneficiary or under the will. 

22 But what -- why does Congress care about that? There 

23 are a lot of messy domestic relations issues out there 

24 in the States. That's what Congress was doing? 

They said, you know, these -- that State

Official 

1 domestic relations law leads to a lot of nasty and 


2 difficult disputes -- you know, Bleak House. Let's 


3 intervene and let's simplify this with a simple rule. 


4 Do you think that's what was involved here? 


MR. JOHNSON: I think that's part of what 

6 was involved here. I think -- I think they wanted to 

7 ensure uniformity for Federal employees who might work 

8 in different jurisdictions or move around. I think, you 

9 know, you have a situation where wills are addressed in 

the statute, divorce decrees are addressed in the 

11 statute, and I would note that section D doesn't make 

12 any inquiry into intent. It's simply -- it's just an 

13 automatic blunt rule that the divorce itself has the 

14 effect of rerouting the proceeds. 

This Court has taken a very practical and 

16 realistic approach to issues of preemption in a -- in a 

17 wide variety of context, just this term in the Wos case, 

18 we said, the Court said, that -- that it's not simply a 

19 matter of semantics. In Free v. Bland, one of this 

Court's precedents involving U.S. savings bonds, there 

21 was a dispute between the husband of the decedent, who 

22 had an absolute right of survivorship under Federal laws 

23 governing the U.S. savings bond, and a son who would 

24 have taken under a will, and the -- the Texas Supreme 

Court, as the case came to it, said, we can simply honor

Official 

1 title by saying, yes, the husband does have an absolute 

2 right of survivorship, but we'll order the husband to 

3 reimburse the -- the estate. 

4  And this is what this Court said in 

reversing, "Viewed realistically, the State has rendered 

6 the award of title meaningless. If the State can 

7 frustrate the party's attempt to use the bond's 

8 survivorship provision through the simple expedient of 

9 requiring the survivor to reimburse the estate, the 

State has interfered directly with the legitimate 

11 exercise of the power of the Federal Government." 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: If he is right, if the only 

13 consideration that led Congress to make this absolute 

14 rule and so forth the underlying the previous holdings, 

if the only consideration were ease of administration by 

16 the Federal administrator, this statute wouldn't 

17 undermine it. So -- so isn't that true? 

18  I mean, the Federal administrator writes the 

19 check to the person that's on the list. This is a 

matter after the check gets mailed, so this doesn't 

21 undermine it at all, there is no problem. 

22  MR. JOHNSON: If the question is whether 

23 it's possible to comply with the mandate to pay the 

24 named beneficiary --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And if that were the

1 only consideration, administration, this doesn't 

2 interfere with Federal administration. So in order to 

3 find something to -- to have to interfere with, we have to 

4 figure that they are trying to protect an interest like 

the following, the person is married twice. He secretly 


6 wants to leave the insurance in the name of his first 


7 wife while pretending to the second wife it was just an 


8 oversight. 


9  (Laughter.) 


JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's what we have 

11 to make up in order to --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He'd have to be dead 

13 by the time the issue comes up. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else? 

MR. JOHNSON: In -- in many cases, Your 

16 Honor, the former spouse will have the care of children. 

17 There are lots of reasons why one might want to leave 

18 benefits to a former spouse. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe we should say, 

look, this is a statute that is absolute. There is no 

21 interest. All this does is run around, without being 

22 too pejorative, it runs around the earlier cases, which 

23 is your basic point. It's absolute. 

24  MR. JOHNSON: And that would be -- and that 

would be a short route to affirmance, Your Honor.

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 

2  MR. JOHNSON: This Court has spoken to 

3 the -- the nature of language like this. SGLIA is 

4 essentially identical. Wissner in fact predates the 

adoption of FEGLIA, and so Congress had the benefit of 

6 that ruling when it was deciding to enact an -- an order 

7 of precedence in this statute. The only real difference 

8 between the order of precedence here and the order of 

9 precedence in Wissner is that the range of choice is 

even broader. Wissner --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I guess the question, 

12 Mr. Johnson, is whether we just got it wrong there. 

13 Because if you look at this statute, it seems -- you 

14 know, if you were just doing it as a matter of first 

impression, that what Congress wanted was a clear and 

16 uniform rule to allow it to pay benefits quickly and 

17 easily without any discussion or investigation of a 

18 person's true intent. 

19  But that after that, why does Congress have 

an interest any further? And if a State has a law that 

21 says, really, we think the better measure of intent is 

22 something else, then we should let the State go ahead 

23 with their law. 

24  MR. JOHNSON: It's conceivable, Your Honor, 

but at a minimum, I think this -- this Court has said

Official 

1 repeatedly that when this Court's ruled on the meaning 

2 of language and -- and a similar language is adopted in 

3 a new statute, it's given the judicial interpretation 

4 unless Congress says otherwise. But here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I guess -- I guess you 

6 might -- you might respond also that, you know, it's 

7 characterized by -- by your -- your friend as a -- a 

8 State law having to do with -- with marriage and -- and 

9 so forth. Maybe. 

But maybe it's just a State law having to do 

11 with discernment of intent. And here you have a Federal 

12 statute and I guess the Federal Congress's assertion of 

13 what's the best discernment of intent, in the natural 

14 order of things, ought to prevail over the State's 

assessment of what's -- what's the clearest expression 

16 of intent, right? 

17  I don't know why it's a family law provision 

18 as much as it is a provision of what the presumed intent 

19 of -- of a decedent is. And here the -- the Federal 

Government has spoken to it with respect to a Federal 

21 statute, and I don't know why it isn't intruding upon 

22 State family law for -- for the Federal Government to --

23 to assert, in its own right, intent under this statute 

24 is -- is determined this way. 

MR. JOHNSON: Either way, it's preemptive, 

34
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 Your Honor. If that is the purpose behind it, Congress 

2 has a very different means of determining intent. And 

3 as the Court's repeatedly said, where you have 

4 conflicting means, you have preemption. But Section D 

doesn't call for any inquiry into intent. It makes an 

6 assumption about intent, and then based on that 

7 assumption, the rule is automatic. 

8  So whether it's a statute about intent, it's 

9 preempted because Congress says the best evidence of 

intent is what you do on the beneficiary form, or 

11 whether it's about -- about divorce, it's preempted 

12 because Congress has spoken to when divorce will affect 

13 the enjoyment of proceeds by the beneficiary. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Johnson, there are at 

least one case where the State law would override the 

16 beneficiary designation and that's obviously if the 

17 beneficiary murdered the -- the insured. So how does 

18 this scheme to displace the beneficiary designated in 

19 the policy in the Slayer case requires State law? Is 

that --

21  MR. JOHNSON: Your Honor, I believe -- I do 

22 agree with the premise of your question was that the --

23 which is that the Slayer would not be paid. The path to 

24 that is, I think, as follows. I think if the Slayer 

Statute looks like a typical Slayer Statute, then it's 

35

Official 

1 going to speak to -- it's going to relate to life 


2 insurance and the express preemption provision would 


3 probably kick in and it would call for a different 


4 result, it would be preempted. 


But there's a longstanding Federal common 

6 law rule, and the lower courts addressing this situation 

7 have also held that -- that that informs the Federal 

8 statute here. The leading case from this Court is an 

9 1886 decision, National Mutual Life Insurance v. 

Armstrong, and it is such a well-established rule that I 

11 think Congress can be viewed as having incorporated that 

12 rule under the statute by not having specifically 

13 overridden it. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would get there by 

a Federal common law rule, but then who would get the 

16 proceeds? If the designated beneficiary is out because 

17 of the Federal common law that excludes a Slayer, where 

18 would you go next? You'd go to State law, right? 

19  MR. JOHNSON: No, it would go to the order 

of precedence. So --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The next one is -- it 

22 would be --

23  MR. JOHNSON: It would be the widow or 

24 the -- then the children and so forth -- in that 

scenario.

Official 

1  If I may speak to Petitioner's argument 

2 about the Rose v. Rose case, I think that that case is 

3 really doubly inapposite. First of all, as this Court 

4 acknowledged in Rose, the statute there was designed to 

benefit dependents as well as the veteran. And it 


6 distinguished Wissner and Ridgway as cases involving a 


7 situation where Congress wanted to give an absolute 


8 right to the -- the insured to ensure that they would 


9 enjoy the benefits. 


Second of all, at the -- at the State law 

11 level, again, there's no guarantee that -- that the 

12 operation of Section D will result in the proceeds going 

13 to one's family. It could end up going to a perfect 

14 stranger under the next of kin provision. And in many 

cases, of course, the former spouse would be the one 

16 caring for children. So it's really, I think, doubly 

17 inapposite. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the -- in the Wissner 

19 case, there was a community property State. Do you 

know, under the statute we're dealing with here, is 

21 community property in those States also preempted so 

22 that the -- the insured is the sole owner of the policy? 

23  MR. JOHNSON: I think that would be right, 

24 Your Honor. I mean, that is the holding of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it was a specific

Official 

1 provision on that point in Wissner, and I -- or the 


2 Court so read it. And I take it the same provision 


3 applies -- exists in this statute? 


4  MR. JOHNSON: Yes. The Wissner court said 


that the order of precedence there was the controlling 

6 provision of the Act, and it said the same thing again 

7 in Wissner concerning SGLIA's order of precedence and it 

8 said it displaces inconsistent State law. Wissner, of 

9 course, in that case it was community property law. In 

Ridgway, it was State constructive trust law. 

11  I would like to speak to the anti-attachment 

12 provision. As Justice Ginsburg noted, that was an 

13 alternative holding of the Court in these earlier cases, 

14 and the Court referred to the order of precedence 

provision as controlling. Rose v. Rose itself 

16 acknowledged that the anti-attachment provision was an 

17 alternative holding of the Court. And we think that 

18 that is sufficient to -- the order of precedence 

19 provision is sufficient to resolve this issue. 

Certainly, Congress, looking at the Court's opinion in 

21 1954 when it enacted FEGLIA, would have been likely to 

22 conclude that. 

23  In -- in summary, Your Honors, this case is 

24 not a difficult case for a finding of preemption under 

this Court's precedence. It's really a much easier

1 case. It's not dealing with generally applicable law. 

2 It's governed squarely by precedent, and the statute at 

3 issue here, Section D, is effectively an attempt to do 

4 an end run on the will of Congress. 

If there are no further questions, I'll 

6 defer to Ms. Goldenberg. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

9  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

11  SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 

12  MS. GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

13 it please the Court: 

14  Section D seeks to substitute a new 

beneficiary in place of the one that Federal law 

16 mandates, and it does that through an attempted end run 

17 around Federal preemption. I'd like to start off by 

18 talking about the purpose of the Federal law, which 

19 several of the Court's prior questions spoke to. 

The purpose here is to get benefits to the 

21 designated beneficiary for that person's beneficial 

22 enjoyment. That's the purpose that the Court found in 

23 very similar language in Ridgway and Wissner. And 

24 that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how far -- how 

39

25

1 far does that go? Obviously, the benefit becomes the 

2 property of the named beneficiary, but it's not like to 

3 her enjoyment. She may want to spend it on something, 

4 but it's going to be -- have to go through bankruptcy, 

it's going to have to go through other claims like any 

6 other property under State law. 

7  MS. GOLDENBERG: That's true, Your Honor, 

8 but the designated beneficiary is benefiting in a sense 

9 when that money is used to pay that person's 

obligations. So we don't deny that because there's no 

11 anti-attachment provision here, the designated 

12 beneficiary could be subject to a contracts judgment, a 

13 tort judgment, it could have to pay other outstanding 

14 obligations that that person has. 

But that is extremely different than a law 

16 like the one we have here that says, in effect, to the 

17 designated beneficiary, you know what, we don't really 

18 think you're entitled to this money. We don't really 

19 think you deserve it. We don't think you have, in 

effect, equitable title to it. We think that belongs to 

21 somebody else and so we're just going to transfer the 

22 proceeds to that other person. That's an extremely 

23 different situation. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would Congress 

want to make sure that the money goes to the designated 

40

15

20

25

Official 

1 beneficiary where there is a very clear expression of 


2 intent on the part of the insured that the money go 


3 someplace else? 


4  MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think there are a 


number of purposes served by that, and that speaks to 


6 the will question that Your Honor asked earlier. 


7  For one thing, it creates certainty in the 


8 process, not only for the insured, but also for the 


9 beneficiary, who's not going to have to face some kind 


of long legal contest over the money that may eat up the 

11 proceeds in attorney's fees and costs. 

12  And that was a purpose that Congress 

13 specifically articulated when it made the 1966 amendment 

14 to the statute. 

It also --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: These arguments seem to be 

17 circular. You're saying that the -- the reason for 

18 making sure that the designated beneficiary gets the 

19 money instead of the person whom the insured has 

subsequently and very clearly said he or she wants to 

21 get the money is to make sure that the designated 

22 beneficiary gets the money, and gets it without any 

23 hassle. 

24  MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, it creates a clear 

and uniform set of rules that everyone can abide by.

1 And also, I think in the case of a will, it protects the 

2 insured from fraud. That was another purpose that 

3 Congress gave in 1966. They don't want a situation 

4 where someone is going to find a will after the fact and 

say: Look, this shows what this person really thought. 

6  The designated beneficiary form is the 

7 expression of -- of the person's intent, and that's 

8 particularly true here, where you have a very clear 

9 network of rules set up by the Federal Government that 

tells insureds what they must do if they want to change 

11 their beneficiary designation, and tells them that their 

12 beneficiary designation is going to --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your concern 

14 is there might be fraudulent wills? 

MS. GOLDENBERG: It's possible that if you 

16 are looking outside the designated -- the beneficiary 

17 designation form, that you may have people trying to 

18 come up with some other expressions of intent. It could 

19 be a will, it could be a letter, it could be other 

things. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me 

22 that's grasping at straws. 

23  MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, Your Honor, that's, 

24 as I say, one of the purposes that Congress gave when it 

passed that amendment in 1966 that said you don't

2 intent. You don't ask, what would the insured have said 

3 if someone had asked them in the last moment of their 

4 life what they had -- what would they want. 

You look at the designated beneficiary, you 

6 look at the beneficiary designation form. And as I was 

7 saying, in -- in part, that's because it's so easy to 

8 change. It's a one-page form. It's very simple. And 

9 insureds are told over and over again, you have to keep 

your beneficiary designation up to date. Divorce 

11 doesn't --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: When are they told -- when 

13 are they told over and over again? 

14  MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, they --

JUSTICE ALITO: They -- they get the form 

16 when they -- when they sign up for the life insurance, 

17 so they periodically get notices from OPM saying, now, 

18 remember, you've designated so-and-so as your 

19 beneficiary, you know, annually, like in the open 

season? Do you really want to keep this person as your 

21 beneficiary? 

22  MS. GOLDENBERG: OPM actually does instruct 

23 agencies to periodically remind employees that they must 

24 keep their beneficiary designations up to date. 

Obviously, there is no way to know exactly what

1 Mr. Hillman was told here --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Nobody has told me that for 

3 many years. 

4  (Laughter.) 

MS. GOLDENBERG: I hope it's clear at this 

6 point. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean, we 

8 do get these cases over and over again. I mean, it is 

9 the sort of thing that -- it may be very easy to do, but 

it is the sort of thing that people often overlook. 

11  MS. GOLDENBERG: That may be, but, 

12 nevertheless, Federal law sets up the rules and expects 

13 people to abide by them. And what you can't have is the 

14 opposite rule because that just creates tremendous 

confusion. And I think the conflict here is very 

16 starkly illustrated when you think about what somebody 

17 who designated their spouse and got divorced and then 

18 wanted to keep that person as their beneficiary would 

19 hear from the Federal Government if they went and said, 

what should I do? I really want my ex-spouse to keep 

21 being the beneficiary. What ought I to do? 

22  And if they were to consult the FEGLIA 

23 handbook, if they were to ask OPM, they would be told, 

24 do nothing. That beneficiary designation is valid, it's 

going to remain valid until you change it yourself. 

44

1 Now, that person's intent would be overridden by section 

2 D, which would essentially pluck the benefits right out 

3 of the hand of the ex-spouse that that person meant them 

4 to go to and transfer them over to somebody else. 

And that makes essentially the focus of the 

6 Federal law on the designated beneficiary meaningless. 

7 It makes the award of the proceeds to that person a 

8 meaningless gesture. That's the language that this 

9 Court used in Free v. Bland, which was a case about 

ownership of Federal bonds. And that can't be what 

11 Congress intended. And you can't have these two 

12 different default rules operating together and -- and 

13 have a system that works. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that situation 

comes up a lot, where an -- an insured wants to make 

16 sure that a former spouse gets more money than the 

17 spouse is entitled to under the divorce decree? 

18  MS. GOLDENBERG: I certainly think it's 

19 possible, Your Honor. I think every person is 

different, every divorce is different. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, everything is 

22 possible. Do you think that's a common situation? 

23 That's what Congress was --

24  MS. GOLDENBERG: I don't know --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- was concerned about?

25

Official 

1  MS. GOLDENBERG: -- I don't know if I can 

2 speak to how common it is, but, as we said in our brief, 

3 there may be many reasons why somebody would want to 

4 give their ex-spouse the insurance proceeds. And I 

think what Congress was concerned with was effectuating 

6 the intent of the insured as expressed in their 

7 designated -- in their designation form -- so that there 

8 would be a clear system, a uniform system. 

9  And again, so that the beneficiary would be 

protected against actions much like this one, that 

11 create all this confusion over who is actually entitled 

12 to the proceeds, and may -- may eat them up in -- in 

13 legal fees. 

14  In addition, I'd point out that if 

Petitioner is correct, then you could have other State 

16 laws that are like this one that try to rewrite the 

17 order of precedence. And essentially, the Federal order 

18 of precedence could be completely undone by State law. 

19  You'd also have a situation in which Federal 

employees attempting to figure out where their benefits 

21 are really going to go would have to make themselves 

22 familiar with State law. As Justice Ginsburg pointed 

23 out earlier, there may be serious choice of law problems 

24 there. The vast majority of these employees are not 

attorneys and this is a tremendous burden to place on

9  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

11  MR. RUTTENBERG: Thank you, Your Honor. 

12  First, a quick point about the -- the FEGLI 

13 handbook. The FEGLI handbook came out in July 2008. 

14 Warren Hillman died in July 2008. So what the FEGLI 

handbook said -- I don't know that it applies in this 

16 case. 

17  But even if it did, what it says is a 

18 recitation of the Egelhoff holding. All it says is, "a 

19 divorce does not invalidate a designation that means 

your former spouse is a beneficiary." It says nothing 

21 about domestic relations laws not applying after that, 

22 and that's exactly what -- this Court found in Egelhoff. 

23  Another -- another point that my friend made 

24 was with regard to Servicemen's Group Life Insurance and 

the holding in Ridgway was based on the fact that these 

47
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 insurance proceeds belong to the designated beneficiary 

2 to the exclusion of all others. That was one of the 

3 main purposes this Court depended upon in ruling that 

4 the -- the State law was preempted. 

And you can't say that in this case because 

6 those proceeds can belong to -- there's express 

7 enactments which allow you to assign it, and allow a 

8 Federal -- a divorce decree to direct where those go. 

9 So it can't be said in -- with FEGLIA that those 

proceeds belong to the designated beneficiary to the 

11 exclusion of all others. 

12  And the example that Mr. Chief Justice gave 

13 with regard to bankruptcy, the -- in the case of a 

14 bankruptcy, that's not benefiting the designated 

beneficiary because all their debts are being discharged 

16 anyways. So in that situation, it's solely benefiting 

17 the creditors. 

18  I also wanted to address one of Justice 

19 Scalia's comments. Justice Scalia was suggesting that 

this is not a divorce law and is not subject to the 

21 preemption. But the preemption analysis with regards --

22 there were I think two reasons he suggested that. One 

23 was it's a Federal act, and they applied in Ridgway, 

24 which was dealing with the Federal Act, the Servicemen's 

Group Life Insurance, they did apply the preemption 

48

1 analysis there. It was overcome, but they applied it. 

2  And this Court's case in Egelhoff also 

3 recognized that the statute, very similar section A, the 

4 Washington version of section A, was a divorce/probate 

type of law, both of which are historical police powers. 

6  The -- the only other comment I would like 

7 to make is with regard to the Slayer statutes. Many 

8 State Slayer statutes are drafted with the identical 

9 language of section D, which says if preempted, then 

there can be a State law cause of action. They're --

11 they're based on the same uniform code, and they use the 

12 same language. 

13  And if there are no other questions, I just 

14 would like to say what an honor it's been today and cede 

the rest of my time. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

17  The case is submitted.

19 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
