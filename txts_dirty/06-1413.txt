 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 06-1413, MeadWestvaco v. The 

Illinois Department of Revenue.

 Ms. Brinkmann.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The ruling of the Illinois Appellate Court 

in this case radically expanded the Court's 

operational-function tax. The State tax at issue 

violates the principles of constitutional limitations on 

state taxing authority for at least two reasons. 

First, the factors relied on by the appellate court here 

for functional -- for operational function would mean 

that ownership and investment would meet that standard. 

But that's what this Court rejected in Allied-Signal.

 A State does not have the authority to reach 

out to tax all investments owned by a company that does 

business in the State. The operational function demands 

more. It applies --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are saying to me, Ms. 

Brinkmann -- we talk about an asset, an investment.

This was one company. This -- it's strange to talk 

about unitary basis or investment. This is a division 

of one company. And we are talking about a sale of 

assets. Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary.

 So what more is there than this is one 

company, it sells some of its assets?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, the fact 

that it's a division does not mean that it meets either 

the operational-function test or the unitary-business 

test. A long line of cases from this Court tell us 

that. It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any cases --

do we have any decisions that go against the state 

taxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to 

subsidiaries?

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, but the Exxon case 

involved divisions, and it went in favor of the state 

taxing authority. But the Court applied a 

straightforward, unitary business analysis to that. 

And, Your Honor, this dates back to the Adams Express 

case of 1897.

 The Court in that case said it's not 

ownership. It's about the use, the unitariness of use, 

not of ownership. Mobile followed on that. Mobile 

talked about the fact that it's not the corporate form

that mattered. It pointed out that that could have 

little to do with the underlying determination of 

apportionment, which depends upon whether it's a 

discrete business enterprise.

 And then following on the heels of that 

analysis in Mobil, the Court applied it to the Exxon 

case that involved divisions. That was a vertically 

integrated corporation. It's very different from the 

facts of this case, and it reached a different result.

 Moreover, the Woolworth case involved 

subsidiaries. Three out of the four of them were 100 

percent wholly owned.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I go back to sort of a 

fundamental question I'm not quite sure I know the 

answer to. Supposing we don't have corporations here, 

but an individual resident of New York owned this whole 

business and a big bunch of it was activities in 

Illinois, and he sold the business. Would Illinois have 

the authority to impose any tax on that transaction?

 MS. BRINKMANN: If it was a capital gain, 

Your Honor, on the sale of investment, the Court's 

longstanding cases teach that it is the domicile that 

taxes that commercial gain.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm assuming it's not the 

domicile. The owner lives in New York. The business is

all over the country, but does millions of dollars of 

business in Illinois. And they sell the whole business. 

Would the owner be subject to any tax of any kind in 

Illinois on that transaction? Could he constitutionally 

be subjected to any tax?

 BRINKMANN: If there was -- the domiciliary 

State generally is the State which has the authority to 

tax an income on a capital gain --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Assume it's not the 

domiciliary State.

 MS. BRINKMANN: But what the Court explained 

in Mobil, for example, if it is under the unitary 

business principle, then the State in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could we get an answer 

without reference to cases? Do you think Illinois would 

have the authority to impose a tax on that transaction?

 MS. BRINKMANN: If the -- there was 

sufficient nexus to the company doing business --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Millions of dollars of 

business in Illinois, that's my assumption.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, they would be able to 

tax the ongoing business activity in that State.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could they tax the sale of 

the business?

MS. BRINKMANN: The sale of the business 

would be to the domicile of the seller. They would be 

able to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying only the 

domicile could impose a tax?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, unless, as the Court 

recognized in Mobil, there is this unitary business 

exception, because the State's ability to tax begins at 

the starting point at the territorial limitations of the 

State. And the Court has --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they owned a truck 

instead of a business, they could tax that transaction, 

I suppose?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't have a unitary 

business -- a person who is a unitary business. I mean, 

a person can't be unitary with Exxon. I mean, when you 

speak of a unitary business you're talking about a 

corporation which, you know, is unitary with another 

corporation.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's the area --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you put it into a 

personal taxation scheme, it seems to me the whole 

unitary business notion has no application at all.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, I agree with you, Your

Honor. But it does come back to the taxing, the right 

of the domicile State to tax on a sale --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is -- what does the 

domicile State -- we have Ohio. But you say as a matter 

of constitutional law, not State tax policy, as a matter 

of constitutional law, the only State that has authority 

to tax the capital gain is Ohio?

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's right, Your Honor, 

unless --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does Ohio -- would Ohio 

give credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is 

due? What is, in fact, Ohio's tax law in this respect? 

Does Ohio give credit to taxes paid by other States --

to other States?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Ohio would allocate the 

entire gain as a capital gain on an intangible that was 

sold in the State of Ohio. That would be allocated in 

its entirety to Illinois.

 Now, what the Court has recognized is that 

default principle sometimes gives way when that gain has 

had enough connection to business activity in another 

jurisdiction. That's where these issues arise, because 

there are States taxing multi- state activities. And 

that's --

very simple question? If Illinois claimed the tax, 

would Ohio give credit for the tax paid in Illinois?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Not if Ohio had the 

constitutional right to allocate that tax to Ohio, as it 

does.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know what -- what 

Ohio does in these situations?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. It allocates it to the 

State of Ohio. The only exception for that would be in 

a situation, not the facts here, but if that capital 

gain either served an operational function to the 

business activities that were conducted in another 

State, then that State would have a right to apportion 

it and tax its portion of that or if the operational 

function applied. And that is because the activity now 

has transformed from just a capital gain that's 

connected to the domiciliary State of the seller to a 

business income because it is part of this unitary 

business. That's why the other State has a right to 

apportion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What has Ohio done --

MS. BRINKMANN: That's not the situation 

here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What has Ohio done up to 

this point with respect to this transaction?

MS. BRINKMANN: Under Ohio's laws this would 

be allocated to that State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To Ohio?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, because it's a capital 

gain on a sale of an investment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, you 

begin your brief by saying this, a paper company, that 

happens to own a data processing company. Why couldn't 

you equally say this is a data processing company that 

happens to own a paper company?

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. This has 

been a paper company since 1846.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and 

Lexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since 

whenever.

 MS. BRINKMANN: But under the Court's 

unitary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the 

oldest -- whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to 

be regarded as the dominant partner, is it?

 MS. BRINKMANN: No. But when you do the 

analysis, you're looking at the taxpayer, which is Mead 

Corporation. And it clearly has a --

company.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I would have to know many 

more facts in order to answer that questions, Your 

Honor. But I -- and I don't mean to be evasive --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't the answer 

both? Why isn't the answer both, just as here it is 

both a paper or office supply company and a Lexis/Nexis, 

electronic data company?

 MS. BRINKMANN: It's an analytical construct 

that we're doing here. We're looking at the taxpayer 

who is being taxed, the Mead Corporation. So you look 

at its business that's being conducted in Illinois. 

They have a unitary paper company that's vertically 

integrated that's doing business activities in Illinois.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

they sell paper in Illinois?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Lexis sells 

data services in Illinois, too.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. But when you're 

looking -- and for both purposes, Your Honor, for State 

tax on the operating income of both of those businesses, 

Illinois does have a right to apportion those taxes. 

And those taxes were paid without objection by both of 

those businesses.

We're talking about a tax on a different 

event, on a capital gain on a sale of the business in 

Ohio.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't --

I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has 

the right to tax Lexis under business activities in 

Illinois. Illinois would argue the reason it has a 

capital gain is partly because they were doing business 

in Illinois and so we should be entitled to part of that 

capital gain. Almost -- I mean, it seems to me it would 

be pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's 

business, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of 

the capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that is a 

belated argument that the State of Illinois has raised 

in this Court. It did not present an argument to the 

Illinois appellate court based on Lexis/Nexis's 

connection to Illinois. It raises a host of 

jurisdictional, procedural and substantive bars.

 Under the rules of Illinois, as we point out 

in our reply brief, that argument is waived. This comes 

to the Court from a State court, not a Federal court of 

appeals. Because of that waiver, it's an independent 

and adequate state ground.

 Moreover, that argument wasn't raised in the

brief in opposition, either.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're raising it in --

in support of the judgment. So if it's novel, but it 

supports the judgment, then at least shouldn't the 

Illinois courts have a chance to look at it and say, oh, 

that's what we really meant, we just got -- explained it 

the wrong way?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, that would certainly 

be a matter for the Illinois court rather than for this 

Court, Your Honor. But in addition, I think any 

disposition on the merits of that issue would be a 

ruling by this Court that would be trumping that 

independent and adequate State ground waiver.

 Moreover, this argument wasn't raised in the 

brief in opposition, either. And the Court's precedent, 

of course, and practice would not be to address that. 

Particularly in this case, it denied notice to the amici 

who would be affected by this argument.

 But turning to the substance of it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think this is part of 

the substance. I thought that as part of one of your 

answers you said that Ohio is free to allocate part of 

this capital gains tax to Illinois? Did I hear you say 

that, because I don't understand that?

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

I apologize if I misspoke.  Ohio would allocate, I mean, 

take the entire gain for itself as the domicile State of 

the seller --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see.

 MS. BRINKMANN: -- of the investment. In 

other factual scenarios, if it turns out that that asset 

actually was not an investment and in fact had enough 

connection to the business activities in Illinois 

because it was really the supplier of the raw materials, 

or the two examples that this Court has given as 

operational functions is the interest on the bank 

account, which is the working capital, or the -- the 

futures hedging against the raw material of corn.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't it kind 

of like futures hedging? I mean, you've got a paper 

company and then you've got something that is sort of 

the paperless aspect, and they can look at it and say, 

well, we're kind of hedging our paper business by 

investing heavily in something that's supposedly going 

to take away the need for paper.

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. Under the 

operational function test, it has to be a much closer 

nexus to the operating, the operations of the paper 

company; and short of that operational function -- or if 

it were part of the unitary business, the domiciliary

State would allocate. And if I could turn --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying this is a 

passive investment?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How can you call it a 

passive investment, not only when there was -- I think 

undisputedly -- as -- as much interest and activity in 

Nexis's business planning by the Mead people? But to my 

mind even more importantly, when in fact Mead, I think a 

couple of times, merged with -- with Nexis -- with Lexis 

-- when that provided a tax advantage, by -- by giving 

them loss carryforwards that reduced their taxes. Why 

isn't it fair to -- to say under the operational 

function test that if -- if the company is -- if Nexis 

is -- is mergeable with Mead when it produces a tax 

advantage and is certainly in a very operational sense 

functional then, because it's saving them a lot of 

money -- and that's, that has nothing to do with passive 

investment. If it's usable in a merger scenario there, 

it ought when the -- when the tide turns be -- be 

regarded as close enough in operational function to be 

taxable when the gain comes in.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that's contrary 

to the Court's long-standing recognition that something 

that enriches the taxpayer is not necessarily part of

the unitary business's operational function.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's right. 

But weren't the enrichment cases in which income was 

being generated by an investment? The investor, of 

course, was the -- was the taxpayer company, and it 

simply reaped the benefits of a profitable investment. 

That's something very different from merging 

corporations, then unmerging them, and then merging them 

again to provide not merely enrichment, but great tax 

savings; and if they are operationally close enough to 

produce great tax savings, why shouldn't they be treated 

as operationally close enough when in fact they -- they 

produce a capital gain?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Because that isn't the 

operational connection that justifies a State --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The gain alone certainly is 

not. If they had absolutely done nothing but make their 

investment and wait to see whether the ship came in, I 

would understand your argument. But between the 

investment and the return of the ship, they were merging 

these corporations back and forth for -- for their --

for Mead's tax advantage. And that seems to me to take 

it out -- take the facts of this case out of the sort of 

the paradigm of the -- the operational or the 

nonoperational function cases.

MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I think not, if 

we look at Allied-Signal, we look at Woolworth, and we 

look at ASARCO. Allied-Signal was a sales and 

investment -- and getting back to the point about the 

argument really was waived about the connection with 

Lexis/Nexis in Illinois, those were the same facts in 

Allied-Signal. The investment there was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a sale of stock in 

that case, wasn't it?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was the sale of a 

subsidiary. And here we have a sale of assets of one 

company, and that's why it's so hard for me to see this, 

as, why are we talking about unitary or not? There is 

only one company; it's Mead.

 MS. BRINKMANN: In Allied-Signal, the 

investment there was also doing business within the 

State. In the Exxon case, there were divisions to which 

this Court applied the entire unitary business 

principle, because what the Court has said repeatedly in 

Mobil, in Exxon, in all these cases, it's not the 

corporate form; it is whether there is a discrete 

business enterprise; and ASARCO speaks to this.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You told me that there 

was no case that the tax -- taxing authority lost that

involved divisions of a single company and sale of 

assets, rather than the sale of stock.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's correct. We have 

four or five cases here. One of them does involve 

divisions, Exxon, but in that case it was a vertically 

integrated corporation, and the State prevailed in that 

case, but it did not change the analysis that applied.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're talking about 

what Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking 

us to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has 

never been declared in any case.

 MS. BRINKMANN: It has, Your Honor. It goes 

back to principles that ownership do -- does not 

determine; simply because there is a business operating 

in the State, the State does not have the right to tax 

every investment that's owned by that. That dates back 

to 1897.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not just that it's 

an investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the 

shares in another company. It's both of these are 

ongoing businesses, Lexis/Nexis and Mead, and they are 

both generating income, and all along Illinois has been 

taxing the income of both of them, right?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, the operating income 

within the State's apportioned. But if you look to the

business activity of the taxpayer Mead, operating in 

Illinois, it is that nexus on which Illinois is claiming 

that they have a right to tax here. And if we look at 

the Woolworth case, for example, I think that is also 

instructive. Those were four subsidiaries. Three of 

them were 100 percent wholly owned, and the Court 

expressly said we recognize they are wholly owned 

subsidiaries. These could be integrated divisions, and 

they said, that is not significant, if they are 

independent, different business enterprises.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Weren't those foreign 

corporations?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So running them as -- as 

a single company would have been a little harder.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, no, in fact there were 

also some foreign subsidiaries, I believe, involved in 

the ASARCO case, for example, Your Honor, and the same 

analysis applied -- you know, whether it was vertically 

integrated and whether or not it met -- the unitary 

business test goes back to three core principles, and 

this Court has said at least four if not five times that 

the unitary business principle is the linchpin of 

apportionment. That is whether or not there is 

functional integration.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't we start -- I don't 

mean to cut off your argument, but don't we start with 

the assumption that this is not a unitary business? 

Wasn't that the finding of the trial court which was not 

disturbed on appeal?

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's right, Your Honor. 

That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You can say it if you want, 

but I wanted to make sure --

MS. BRINKMANN: There is no virtual 

integration; there is no sharing of centralized 

management; there's no economies of scale. We think 

this is unassailable in the stipular record --

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I thinking about that 

part correctly? I -- I found this difficult. I go back 

to the railroad; that seems the easiest case. You have 

a railroad in 50 States, and Illinois finds it very hard 

to evaluate its -- evaluate its value, its railroad 

property in Illinois, because the value of that depends 

on service everywhere. So the court says that's the 

unitary principle; and really what you're supposed to 

look at is whether when you look at the supposedly 

separate part of the business, does that separate part 

of the business contribute to the whole thing? So that 

if you were in fact trying to say what is Illinois doing

without considering that separate part, it would be 

tough to do.

 I mean, that's the underlying theme.

 MS. BRINKMANN: We would --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if that's so, there is 

no second test. I mean, I grant you there is language, 

but really what people have done is they've said, we are 

here in a special situation because we have an interest 

in another company, and that's a special part of our 

business, and has nothing to do with the rest of the 

business. And then the argument is no, it does have 

something to do with the rest of the business. And if 

it does, like it provides you with working capital, it's 

just like the railroad track in California vis-a-vis 

Illinois.

 MS. BRINKMANN: It's contributing to the 

business.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And if it doesn't, it 

doesn't. So now, if that's right, then it's the form of 

analysis rather than the result that's wrong in the 

court below. Because they start talking about two 

separate tests and then people argue whether the second 

should swallow up the first, and at that point I get 

totally lost. It's fairly long, but I'd appreciate your 

evaluating what I've just said.

MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, there --

on this record, there's no question that the Lexis/Nexis 

cannot meet the unitary business test.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, there is, Ms. 

Brinkmann. The Illinois appellate court never got to 

that question. Illinois argued all along this is a 

unitary business. The only one who said it wasn't was 

this trial court, and the Illinois intermediate 

appellate court says, well, we don't have to deal with 

that because if you use the other label, operational 

function, that comes out all right, too.

 But this argument was certainly the number 

one argument that Illinois was making. It lost only in 

the trial court on -- on it. And the appellate court 

said we don't have to get to it. So I think your answer 

to Justice Souter really wasn't accurate because it 

isn't --

MS. BRINKMANN: Well, our position is on the 

record here, Your Honor, the stipulated record, that 

it's unassailable. But we do --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: All we know is that a 

trial judge said that was so.

 MS. BRINKMANN: And then that's our 

position, obviously, on the record, Your Honor; but we 

agreed this was properly raised in the appellate court,

as opposed to the other argument which was not. And 

this also was mentioned in the brief in opposition, as 

opposed to their other argument, which was not.

 So we do think the Court could reach this 

argument, and we maintain that on this record the 

linchpin of apportionment giving the right of a State --

and this is a right to extend beyond its territory.

 The Court has already let it go beyond its 

territory to get to something outside the State if it's 

part of the unitary business -- the railroad case, the 

express case.

 And in that situation there are three 

factors, none of which can be met on this record. There 

was no shared, centralized management, none. There was 

no integrated functions, none. And there were no 

economies of scale. Lexis/Nexis did not even get a 

discount on any paper they bought from Mead. They were, 

you know, minor customers of each other.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe when we're talking 

about Due Process and Commerce Clause limitations on 

what States can tax, we ought to ask ourselves if those 

three -- is that it? If we're trying to measure, is 

there a sufficient relationship between Lexis/Nexis, 

Mead, and the State of Illinois to make it fair for them 

to tax?

And you say, oh, yes. Each year when 

they're making income, when they are a going concern, 

Illinois can get a piece of it. But when the assets are 

sold, assets that would have generated income for 

Illinois year after year, but when those assets are 

sold, Illinois can get nothing to represent -- to 

substitute for that stream of income that it would have 

gotten.

 MS. BRINKMANN: No. It will continue to get 

income tax on an apportioned basis before and after.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Lexis/Nexis is gone.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Lexis/Nexis continues 

to operate. It's now owned by Reed Elsevier. So it 

would continue to pay an apportioned income tax.

 It's a different event here, Your Honor. It 

is the sale of an investment that occurred in Ohio. And 

as the domicile State, Ohio has provided benefits to the 

corporate headquarters, to management --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it had been 

Delaware, and there was nothing there in Delaware except 

it was a Delaware corporation.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's not the commercial 

domicile, Your Honor. There is a distinction in all of 

these cases between the State of incorporation and the 

commercial domicile. The commercial domicile --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, one 

thing that concerns me is how this will complicate the 

process. I think, with respect to ordinary income, the 

States work this out, and they figure we get 5 percent 

because we have 5 percent of the presence or business, 

whatever.

 Now, they're going to have that, and they're 

going to have an overlay on that. They're going to say, 

well, it's 5 percent; but, you know, we sold this asset 

that doesn't have any connection to Illinois; and that's 

part of the income we've got. So you don't get quite 5 

percent of all.

 And another -- Illinois is going to come 

back and say, well, yes, but you sold this other one; 

and, as to that one, you've got sufficient connection 

with Illinois. It seems to me it's going to be 

impossible to sort this out.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, this has been 

going on since at least 1992 in the Allied-Signal case. 

The lower courts, the State courts, except for the court 

in this case, have been able to apply that easily.

 In order to take the expansive view of 

Illinois here, you would be undermining Allied-Signal, 

which had the same facts as in this case, not to mention 

ASARCO, Woolworth.

And I would just say, before I could reserve 

the remainder of my time, Allied-Signal was the case in 

which this Court was faced with new arguments raised by 

the States, at argument. You went back and had 

resupplemental briefing and reargument, and questioned 

in your questions to those parties whether or not ASARCO 

and Woolworth should be revisited and overruled.

 So the Allied-Signal case took into account 

all of these concerns and came back with a ringing 

affirmation of the linchpin of an apportionability for 

state taxation being the unitary-business test with the 

operational-function aspect.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't like to intrude on 

the white light, but if I could just ask one question.

 If the unitary-tax argument has been 

preserved and is met and if there's a finding that they 

are unitary, does Illinois have the right to tax the 

sale, or to -- to a portion of it?

 MS. BRINKMANN: We think that the finding is 

that it is not unitary.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. Assume -- assume 

it is unitary. Can Illinois then, in your view, have a 

part of -- tax part of the gain on the sale?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, if it were unitary, but 

we think there's no way this record could meet the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN F. BAROV

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BAROV: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Illinois is not attempting to tax income 

earned outside its borders. To the contrary, the income 

it seeks to tax here is income earned by Mead on its 

electronic publishing business, Lexis, which conducted 

substantial business in Illinois.

 Mead paid taxes on the income that the 

electronic publishing business earned. Yet, it now 

contends that the Constitution bars it from taxing any 

of the gains it realized on the sale of Lexis, even 

though Illinois undeniably contributed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you did not 

proceed on the unitary business there, let's take that 

off the table. It seems to me that Lexis's presence in 

Illinois is quite irrelevant.

 MR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. It's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, under

your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were 

not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.

 MR. BAROV: If this - if they were unitary, 

yes, then Lexis's presence in Illinois would be 

irrelevant to this case, if they met the 

unitary-business doctrine.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's not the question. I 

thought that the -- I agree with the same question 

Justice Kennedy had. Suppose that I'm a Massachusetts 

company that sells tables, and I sell some tables in 

Illinois. And one day I take some of the money, and I 

buy an iron mine in New Mexico. And then I sell the 

iron mine. And Illinois, not Massachusetts, wants to 

impose a tax. And suppose there is no connection 

whatsoever between the iron mine and anything else but 

for four, which are the four listed on page 13a:

 One, that I have contributed capital support 

to the iron mine.

 Two, I approve the major capital 

expenditures of the iron mine, sitting in my office in 

Massachusetts.

 Three, sometimes -- and this is a tougher 

one -- I call the iron mine a division of my table 

company.

 And, four, I sometimes retain tax benefits

and control over the extra cash of the iron mine, but 

I'm not using it in my day-to-day work.

 Now, are those four things alone sufficient 

for Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine? That, it 

seems to me, is the way they presented it. Maybe it is 

a unitary business really, but I guess we have to send 

it back for that.

 MR. BAROV: Under -- under those bare facts, 

probably there would be not a sufficient connection.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then why isn't 

that the end of this case? That's what they said it 

was. That's what they said, perhaps wrongly, that this 

isn't a unitary business. And, therefore, we are left 

with those four facts, and why not send it back and say 

you haven't reached the unitary-business question; go 

reach it?

 MR. BAROV: Because, Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if I can just add on 

to that same question: If you're going to have the 

unitary-tax theory, that's -- that's very helpful. But 

if we take the unitary-tax theory off the table, it 

seems to me that you are confusing the law by having 

some midway test. I don't know what your theory is, 

that -- in relation to this part of Justice Breyer's 

question.

MR. BAROV: There's a two-part answer to 

that question -- those questions, Your Honor.

 First, there's a second avenue of State 

taxation that's been well recognized by this Court for 

at least 80 years, which is that if a business conducts 

business in a State, a State has a tax -- has the right 

to tax a share of that business. And that's all 

Illinois did here. When it apportioned the income in 

this case, it apportioned the income only based on 

Lexis's in-State Illinois presence. So under that 

avenue alone, the tax is constitutional.

 The second --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Mead didn't receive --

pardon me -- Lexis didn't receive the money for the 

sale, Mead did.

 MR. BAROV: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Unless, again, if Mead's 

presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what 

happened here, absent a unitary theory.

 MR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. Mead received 

the tax -- the gain for the sale because Lexis was a 

division of Mead, and the only tax-paying -- the only --

there is no -- there was no legal entity known as 

"Lexis" at the time that Lexis was sold. It was assets 

-- it was assets owned by the Mead Corporation.

Now, Mead received the benefit -- the gain 

on the sale because Mead was the only tax-paying entity 

in this case. So Mead was conducting a business in 

Illinois called "Lexis," and, therefore, Illinois could 

tax at least --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that if there 

had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a 

subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was -- it was 

sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois 

then could have had a tax?

 MR. BAROV: Yes. Illinois could have taxed 

based on the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So, then, the 

asset stock doesn't make any difference?

 MR. BAROV: But the -- but the point, Your 

Honor, is that Lexis had a presence in Illinois. It was 

conducting business in Illinois. That, alone, gave 

Illinois the power to tax a share of the income --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to Justice 

Stevens's initial hypothetical. If you live in New York 

and you have an investment in a company that does a lot 

of business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident 

individual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois 

could tax it.

 MR. BAROV: No. Illinois can't tax that

State because there is no relationship -- there has to 

be some relationship, you know, between Illinois and the 

tax-paying activity and the taxpayer.

 In Justice Breyer's hypothetical there was 

none. But there is a -- but let me, if I can, address 

that prong of the analysis, also.

 Here there was a much closer connection 

between Lexis and Mead than simply that of a passive 

investment. It wasn't just that Mead helped Lexis buy, 

make, handle acquisitions. They were involved in the 

actual acquisitions themselves, in purchasing and 

contracting to make those acquisitions.

 Mead was involved in many of the -- in 

controlling lots of their capital investment, its -- and 

its -- it was also involved in manipulating excess -- in 

their excess cash. And there is a whole -- there was a 

host of facts that supported a closer relationship 

between Mead and Lexis than simply that, that passive 

investment.

 So whether -- even if you are looking at it 

from the operational-function point of view, there was 

-- there was a -- a sufficient connection between Lexis 

and Mead beyond that of Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

your tax laws?

 MR. BAROV: Under our tax laws --

JUSTICE ALITO: Say that Mead was domiciled 

in Illinois but Lexis/Nexis operated in Ohio, would you 

have just taken -- would you have allocated or would you 

have claimed that -- the right to tax the entire capital 

gain?

 MR. BAROV: This would have probably, I 

think, Your Honor -- I believe this would have been 

apportioned as business income under Illinois law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know what -- or 

did you know what Ohio did in the --

MR. BAROV: I don't know what Ohio did. 

They -- Mead has never cited anything in the record to 

support the contention that it has been -- that it was 

allocated all to Ohio. My understanding of Ohio law at 

the time was they -- they have the same business-income 

test, basically, that Illinois does.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would you say 

-- I mean, we talk about apportioning income and 

allocating income, allocating to the commercial 

headquarters.

 What in an enterprise like this would you 

say is allocated to the commercial headquarters as 

opposed to being apportioned among all the States?

MR. BAROV: Different States have different 

rules, Your Honor, and these are State-law rules, not 

constitutional rules, about allocation and 

apportionment. Some States will allocate an intangible 

capital gain like this to their own domicile State.

 Other States will apportion it based on the 

share of income that is done in the State.

 Again, I don't know what Ohio did. But the 

point is that's a rule -- that's a State-law rule of 

choice, not a rule of -- a constitutional rule. I think 

this Court has been pretty clear in the Mobil Oil case 

that these -- those -- that doesn't have a 

constitutional significance.

 That when a State, a domicile State, and a 

State where a source -- which is the source of income, 

when those conflict, in fact, this Court has signaled 

that apportionment is the default rule. And that the 

source State actually would have -- the source State 

would win that confrontation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Barov, I just want to 

go back to an earlier answer to see how far you would go 

with the position that you took.

 Assume that, exclusive of Nexis, Mead is the 

same kind of unitary corporation as under -- under 

everybody's understanding now. Assume, also, as you

suggested in a hypo, that Lexis was doing business in 

Illinois. So that at least a -- a portion of its own 

activity could be taxed in Illinois. And assume, third, 

that the relationship between Mead and Lexis is simply 

one of passive investment. Mead simply bought a lot of 

stock, maybe 100 percent of the stock at the right time; 

and, otherwise, it kept hands off. And at this point 

Mead now -- now sells.

 On -- on your theory, would -- would the 

State of Illinois be able to tax a portion of the 

capital gain?

 MR. BAROV: Yes, they would, Your Honor. 

But they would be limited in how much of that capital 

gain they could apportion. They would apportion it 

limited to the amount of income that arose in Illinois. 

And that's what the auditor did in this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but that would be, in 

effect, the portion of the Nexis business, total 

business that took place in Illinois, total sales, total 

payroll, however you do it.

 MR. BAROV: Right, and then that would be 

put -- that would be put into --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But the only point I 

wanted to be clear on to understand your position is 

that purely passive investment would be enough to

 First, under the -- they have cited 

basically two basis grounds for waiver, one under 

Illinois law and under this Court's rules. But they 

misstate Illinois law in the -- on the waiver regard.

 The cases and rules they cite to stand for a 

simple proposition that a point not raised in a brief 

before a particular court can't be raised on oral 

argument. But what the Illinois Supreme Court has been 

clear on "otherwise" is that an argument, even if it's 

not raised in the appellate court, as long as it's 

raised in the trial court in support of a judgment, may 

be raised in a reviewing court on further review.

 I can provide a couple of cites, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and I'm not 

following your argument, because I thought that the 

argument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in 

the Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court

recognizes that it was made, and said we are not going 

to reach it because we have this operational-function 

test?

 MR. BAROV: Yes, Your Honor. That's --

that's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's --

they are very different from your current argument, 

which you emphasize that whether they are unitary or 

not, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois.

 MR. BAROV: That's correct, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Now, as to 

that argument, at least I am very reluctant to overturn 

a State court on an argument that they didn't have an 

opportunity to consider. And whether it's technically 

waived because you raised it in the trial court or not, 

it certainly was not an argument you made to the 

Illinois appellate courts.

 MR. BAROV: That's correct, Your Honor. And 

-- but I think, as this Court set forth in Caterpillar 

v. Lewis, it is a predicate to the intelligent 

resolution of this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wasn't in 

Allied-Signal. In Allied-Signal the asset that was sold 

was in New Jersey, and that was totally irrelevant to 

how we treated the issue in that case.

MR. BAROV: Certainly, Your Honor. But New 

Jersey was taking a very different position in that 

case. They were making a much broader argument than we 

are making here. They were trying to overturn the 

entire unitary doctrine.

 And so they may have -- they may have chosen 

not to make that argument. It may very well have been 

in that case that ASARCO's apportionment factors in that 

case were so minimal that it wasn't worth their making 

that argument.

 But, for whatever reason, they weren't 

interested in taxing based on the source alone.

 But here, as the facts show, Illinois did 

tax. We taxed Lexis, or the gain on Lexis, pursuant to 

Lexis' in-state apportionment factors.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

just -- it shows my ignorance, but if the 

unitary-business approach to taxation was not applied in 

this case, how did you compute the amount of the tax?

 MR. BAROV: It was computed -- what the 

department did in this case is it -- it took the entire 

gain that put -- that went into Mead's apportionable tax 

base. But, then, in order to find the Illinois-Lexis 

share of the gain, he looked at the -- he looked at 

Lexis's Illinois sales and Illinois's -- Lexis's

Illinois payroll and pulled that amount out, which was 

about four percent of the gain, and put that into Mead's 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you use a different 

formula from the normal three-factor formula to compute 

the tax?

 MR. BAROV: Right. You use a different 

formula. You use a two-factor formula, but it was just 

related to Mead's sales, not to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that 

those factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale. 

It's just whimsical. It has nothing to do with the 

sale.

 The reason we use apportionment in other 

cases is, just as in Justice Breyer's railroad example, 

there is no other way to tell, and so forth.

 But here the presence of Lexis in Illinois 

is wholly accidental with reference to what went on in 

the sale.

 MR. BAROV: No, Your Honor, it wasn't. I 

mean Lexis did considerable business in Illinois, and 

the auditor was isolating Illinois's business in 

attempting to accurately value the amount of gain that 

should be attributable to Mead based on Lexis's Illinois 

presence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why 

it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the 

argument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois. 

That's the basis on which your auditor is claiming these 

taxes; and, yet, you don't even raise it before the 

Illinois appellate court as a ground for being able to 

reach the Lexis/Nexis income.

 MR. BAROV: -- the trial court -- actually 

the appellate court ruled on whether the State law tests 

had been met at the time. And when it went up on appeal 

we -- we prevailed in the appellate court based on 

operational -- I'm sorry, in the trial court, based on 

the court's finding the operational function had been 

met. That's how the appellant framed the issue, and the 

case sort of turned on really Illinois State law's 

interpretation of Allied-Signal. But, you know, at this 

point the -- the facts and the law are clear and a 

decision --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In the Illinois courts, 

they did argue that as a matter of Federal 

constitutional law the tax is impermissible, didn't 

they?

 MR. BAROV: Correct, yes. Yes, they did. 

At this point, Your Honor, I mean, to render a decision 

that doesn't take into account the facts of the case,

the economic reality, accordingly would be artificial.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We couldn't do 

anything more if we said you haven't waived it, we 

couldn't do anything more than send it back. You're 

telling us Lexis has this presence in Illinois, but we 

have nothing in the record about that.

 MR. BAROV: Yes, it is in the record. The 

auditor's -- I mean, the stipulation itself shows that 

Lexis was in Illinois. And the Illinois appellate court 

made a finding that the presence of Lexis -- Mead to tax 

Nexis with Illinois was undisputed. So the Illinois 

appellate court recognized that Lexis had a taxing --

adequate taxing connection with Illinois.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that?

 MR. BAROV: That is -- I don't have the page 

cite handy, Your Honor, but the appellate court did make 

a finding that it was undisputed that the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just -- usually 

appellate courts don't make findings. That's why I'm 

curious --

MR. BAROV: I'm sorry. Made a statement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any sort of 

stipulation between the parties to say what each, what 

Lexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing 

in Illinois?

stipulation, yes, Your Honor, and plus there was 

exhibits attached to the stipulation, which are 

reflected in our briefs, that discuss in detail what 

Mead and Lexis were both doing, at least their 

relationship to each other.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask you about the 

theory that both the trial court and the intermediate 

appellate court went on, this operational function test, 

which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I 

don't know any that was decided. Did we ever have any 

case that turned on the operational function test to 

hold for the State taxing authority?

 MR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. But in 

Allied-Signal there was -- examples were given of 

certain --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But one of the 

problems with applying it as you urge here is that that 

would just override -- why would anyone go to the 

trouble of making a case under the so-called unitary 

business test, because the operational function test 

would be much easier to meet? So --

MR. BAROV: I guess on that point I would 

disagree with you a bit, Your Honor. I think there are

relationships. So one doesn't -- while the same facts 

can support them in instances, you can have situations 

where a business is unitary but not operational or --

I'm sorry, an asset is operational, but isn't 

necessarily --

JUSTICE BREYER: What? What? What could it 

be? That is -- as I read this, I thought, well, there 

is no separate test. It's just there's a certain 

situation that comes up fairly commonly where someone 

claims that an asset of a company was really quite 

separate, and therefore when they get income from it or 

they sell it it has nothing to do with my business. And 

the answer is: It did have something to do with your 

business, you used the working capital and so forth, in 

which case it's part of the business. So how -- how is 

it -- how is it different from that?

 MR. BAROV: I agree, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you agree with 

that, do you really agree, because if you agree with 

that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong 

to consider it separately, the lower court, and they 

should have reached the question they didn't reach, 

which was is this whole thing one single business, which 

is normally called the unitary business test?

disagree.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Good. All right.

 MR. BAROV: I think there is -- I mean, 

they're both ways of reaching the overall unitary 

principle, whether you can show the intangible flow of 

assets -- of value between a company -- I can give you 

an example, say, of a company that would be unitary but 

where the operational function analysis wouldn't apply 

is the Container Corp. Type fact pattern, where you have 

a domestic -- a domestic parent providing value out to 

the foreign subsidiaries, but there is nothing sort of 

flowing back to the domestic parent. They're not really 

using those subsidiaries in the domestic business. But 

nevertheless, there is enough value being thrown out 

that it passed the unitary threshold.

 The unitary -- the unitary -- I'm sorry. 

The operational function analysis or test or principle, 

whatever you want to call it, arises in the examples 

given in Allied-Signal. As you said, you've got 

something which isn't really part of the rest of your 

business, but you're using it in that business to 

support it way beyond just a passive investment.

 And this -- in this case, that's how Mead 

was using Lexis. They were using it to support their, 

the value of their multiple, their multi-state business,

by manipulating -- by making capital contributions, 

manipulating corporate structures, and bringing back 

that tax and net loss carryforwards, which increased the 

value, which increased their business activities.

 So this case actually is that -- is that --

falls within that paradigm also. It's not unlike any --

like either of those hypotheticals in Allied-Signal, not 

unlike the use of working -- investment of working 

capital.

 So, yes, both -- the test, while there are 

facts that overlap them, they can show that there are 

different relationships.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So say you -- but you 

would be asking us, if you were going to go on that 

operational function, to take two examples that were 

given in Allied-Signal that are quite different from 

what's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when 

you recognize that we have never used that theory to 

hold for a State taxing authority in the context of a 

multi-state enterprise?

 MR. BAROV: Your Honor, I don't think you 

have to create a separate doctrine again. I think these 

are both considered different ways of showing the 

intangible flow of value, the significant links between 

a business that give rise to constitutional

apportionment. And whether they're considered separate 

analyses -- they have been described by some academics 

as corollaries of each other. It's certainly, given 

this Court's signals in Allied-Signal, I think it's 

certainly appropriate where the facts arise to make the 

constitutional finding based on the operational function 

that an asset serves in a business.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question. 

Does the record tell us whether other States have sought 

to tax the capital gain on this transaction?

 MR. BAROV: No, it does not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: As far as we know, 

Illinois is out on its own here?

 MR. BAROV: I don't know, Your -- I don't 

know the answer to that, Your Honor. I hope not.

 In any event, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd not wager, however, 

right?

 MR. BAROV: In any case, Your Honor, as you 

said, as I've said, there are two possible ways that --

two different constitutional paths or theories that we 

can go down in this case to meet the -- that allows 

Illinois to apportion.

 Independent of the operational links, Mead 

can tax the gain on Lexis simply because Lexis conducted

business in Illinois. A state may tax a nonresident's 

investment income based on its investment in a separate 

business, and that's exactly what Illinois -- that's 

another way to uphold the Illinois appellate court's 

decision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If Illinois -- if Ohio 

is, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on 

the theory that this entire income should be allocated 

to Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation, 

right?

 MR. BAROV: That's possible, Your Honor, but 

it's -- first, there is no -- there's no evidence that 

Ohio in fact did that. But I think the Mobil Oil case 

should have disposed of that, that contention, because 

this Court rejected a similar argument that the mere 

possibility of taxation by a domiciliary State 

foreclosed taxation by a State where the business was 

present.

 And under Mobil Oil, when a resident State's 

claim and a source State's claim conflict, this Court 

indicated that the resident State's claim must yield to 

that of the source State. So there should be no issue 

of multiple taxation in this case.

 Just -- Chief Justice Roberts, just to go 

back to your question, it's page 11A of the pet. app.

$46 million of sales attributable to Lexis/Nexis.

 MR. BAROV: Well, it's relevant if, only if, 

this Court finds that there was no operational 

relationship between Lexis and Mead. Then Lexis's 

presence in Illinois becomes relevant because in that 

case, whether you look at this as a separate business 

conducted by Mead or whether it was even a passive 

investment of Mead's, Illinois can still tax it in the 

manner that it did by -- by isolating the values of 

Lexis's -- that Lexis earned in Illinois.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is different --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I might say that I don't 

follow that. It seems to me what you can establish from 

the fact that it did a lot of business in Illinois is 

that can you tax it and -- but I don't see how.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no "it" to tax, 

right?

 MR. BAROV: That 's correct. There was no 

"it" to tax and under this court's well-established case 

law, International Harvester, J.C. Penney, a State can 

tax a nonresident on an investment in that State as well 

as the tax is properly prorated to the amount of income 

that rose within that State.

of Lexis/Nexis assets, there was only one taxpayer; it 

was Mead.

 MR. BAROV: That's correct, Your Honor. 

There was one taxpayer and it was Mead. That was the 

only party that could have been taxed. That's correct.

 So here, in this case, Mead is taking an 

all-or-nothing approach to taxation but this could --

this disregards the connections between Mead's 

electronic publishing business in Illinois. And the 

Court should decline to rule in their favor. In fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any case like 

that where your ability to tax a surviving corporation 

has to do with, not whether the surviving corporation 

itself has sufficient contacts with the State, but 

whether some other corporation that has disappeared now 

but that merged into it had sufficient -- it seems to me 

you have to establish connection with the taxpayer. Not 

-- not with somebody from whom the taxpayer made some 

money.

 MR. BAROV: You have to establish a 

connection with the taxpayer's activities in the taxing 

State. That's the constitutional touchstone. So if 

Mead -- whether Mead was running a business in Illinois 

or investing in Illinois or had a unitary business that 

operated in Illinois, those -- that's the -- that

provides a sufficient link.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.

 MR. BAROV: So that provides the taxing --

the ability --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that isn't established 

by the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there. 

Ultimately you have to come down to connecting it to 

Mead, either by your unitary business doctrine or by 

this functional doctrine that you're relying on.

 MR. BAROV: No, Your Honor. Under 

International Harvester, I think that the Court made it 

very clear that even a passive investment can be taxed 

by a State. If Mead -- Mead can be taxed -- even if 

LEXIS was a passive investor and Mead was only investing 

in Illinois, Illinois could still tax Mead on the value 

of its investment that arose in Illinois. And so Mead 

realized the gain. Mead is the taxpayer. Mead can be 

taxed as long as the tax is properly prorated to the 

Illinois presence, which it was in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the proration, it 

seems to me -- that should have nothing to do with the 

extent of Lexis in Illinois --

MR. BAROV: Exactly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- nor does it have to do 

with the extent of Mead in Illinois.

MR. BAROV: Well, no, Your Honor. It's --

under this -- then under this Court's precedent, that 

you're looking for the source State, the activity of the 

business was conducted in the source State. Now, in 

this case it happened that the amounts are fairly close 

to each other. So if there is any question about it, 

there's no -- you know, there is no constitutional 

problem that arises out of that. But clearly this -- I 

mean it's settled precedent that a State can tax based 

on income -- the income that arose in that State and 

that's what happened here.

 Indeed, to accept Mead's contention which 

also would create a constitutional loophole that for 

income in ae State's marketplace helped create but which 

a State cannot recover, the Illinois court's decision 

permitting Illinois to tax a fraction of the gain should 

be affirmed.

 And if the Court has no other questions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you tax me on stock --

on stock that I own on companies that do business in 

Illinois?

 MR. BAROV: In the abstract, yes, you could,

investors, on the shareholder's investment in a State in

ground there. I think it's their cert page, they were 

agreeing with us on what the Illinois law meant.

 On the substance of it, I think Justice 

Scalia and Justice Kennedy brought out the weaknesses. 

Their position would lead to taxes on all stock sales. 

Any State where an investment was doing business could 

then reach out and apportion the gain on that. And as 

far as International Harvester and J.C. Penney, those 

were tax on the investment, not the investor. And the 

dissent -- that was the dispute -- the majority. It was 

the incident of the tax fell on the invest -- the 

investment that was doing business in the State.

 The State concedes, Your Honor, on Justice 

Ginsburg's, the distinction between -- the sale of 

assets and the sale of stocks that you were concerned 

about. On page 43, they concede and I think it's very 

well recognized through Mobil and Exxon and Woolworth 

that "apportionment has nothing to do with the form a 

business organization takes."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, your 

final point.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Finally I would point out, 

on the question you asked -- I think it was Justice 

Ginsburg -- what Illinois would do in this. 

Interestingly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ohio.

 MS. BRINKMANN: -- the record in this case 

at -- it's not in the joint appendix, but it's at C-851. 

It's Exhibit 1, to the stipulation of facts. It 

indicates that interest and dividends allocable are 

allocable to Illinois if the commercial domicile is in 

Illinois.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Illinois or Ohio, were you 

talking about?

 MS. BRINKMANN: This is the Illinois return, 

and the question was what Illinois would do? And they 

say commercial domicile, we get your interest and 

dividends.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Brinkmann, on 

the waiver point -- I'm looking at page 18a -- it not 

only says that Lexis/Nexis contributed $46 million from 

its presence in Illinois; it begins the sentence by 

saying "as the Department notes, $46 million of Mead's 

income came from Lexis/Nexis activities in Illinois." 

So that doesn't sound like a waiver of that point to me.

 MS. BRINKMANN: At one point, after they got 

through the unitary business and operational functional 

analysis, there was an argument about whether it was 

grossly disproportionate, and that's where some of that 

information came. It was never in the context of this

legal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Initially, it's 

about the context in which -- what I regard as an 

important fact -- was raised, whether it was raised in 

the context of an argument on unitary business or 

whether or not they went too far, but the stubborn fact 

is still there.

 MS. BRINKMANN: There are facts, Your Honor, 

but the Illinois law is very clear; it's rule 341(h)(7) 

and (i) which applies to applee. If you don't raise a 

point in the appellate court, it is waived. That's an 

independent and adequate State ground. And it's a very 

breathtaking argument, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 

that also wasn't brought forth in the brief in 

opposition. Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. The case 

is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
