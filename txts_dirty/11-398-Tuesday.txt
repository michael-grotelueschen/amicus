CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will continue 

argument this morning in Case 11-398, The Department of 

Health and Human Services v. Florida. 

General Verrilli. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The Affordable Care Act addresses a 

fundamental and enduring problem in our health care 

system and our economy. Insurance has become the 

predominant means of paying for health care in this 

country. Insurance has become the predominant means of 

paying for health care in this country. For most 

Americans, for more than 80 percent of Americans, the 

insurance system does provide effective access. Excuse 

me. 

But for more than 40 million Americans who 

do not have access to health insurance either through 

their employer or through government programs such as 

Medicare or Medicaid, the system does not work. Those 

individuals must resort to the individual market, and 

that market does not provide affordable health

insurance. It does not do so because it -- because the 

multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for 

the -- the employer market are not available in the 

individual market. It does not do so because ERISA and 

HIPAA regulations that preclude -- that preclude 

discrimination against people based on their medical 

history do not apply in the individual market. That is 

an economic problem. And it begets another economic 

problem. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why aren't those problems 

that the Federal Government can address directly? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: They can address it 

directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it 

directly through this -- through this Act by regulating 

the means by which health care -- by which health care 

is purchased. That is the way this Act works. 

Under the Commerce Clause, what Congress has 

done is to enact reforms of the insurance market, 

directed at the individual insurance market, that 

preclude -- that preclude discrimination based on 

pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue 

and community rating. And it uses -- and the minimum 

coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution 

those insurance reforms --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you create Congress --

commerce order to regulate it? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's not what's going 

on here, Justice Kennedy, and we're not seeking to 

defend the law on that basis. 

In this case, the -- what is being regulated 

is the method of financing health -- the purchase of 

health care. That itself is economic activity with 

substantial effects on interstate commerce. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, any self-purchasing? 

Anything I -- you know, if I'm in any market at all, my 

failure to purchase something in that market subjects me 

to regulation. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No. That's not our 

position at all, Justice Scalia. In the health care 

market -- the health care market is characterized by the 

fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose 

to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those 

who for religious reasons don't participate, those who 

are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody 

else is either in that market or will be in that market, 

and a distinguishing feature of that is that they 

cannot -- people cannot generally control when they 

enter that market or what they need when they enter that 

market.

seems to me, would be true, say, for the market in 

emergency services: police, fire, ambulance, roadside 

assistance, whatever. 

You don't know when you're going to need it; 

you're not sure that you will. But the same is true for 

health care. You don't know if you're going to need a 

heart transplant or if you ever will. So, there's a 

market there. In some extent, we all participate in it. 

So, can the government require you to buy a 

cell phone because that would facilitate responding when 

you need emergency services? You can just dial 911 no 

matter where you are? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Mr. Chief Justice. 

think that's different. It's -- we -- I don't think we 

think of that as a market. This is a market. This is 

market regulation. And, in addition, you have a 

situation in this market not only where people enter 

involuntarily as to when they enter and won't be able to 

control what they need when they enter, but when they --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me 

that's the same as in my hypothetical. You don't know 

when you're going to need police assistance. You can't 

predict the extent to emergency response that you'll 

need, but when you do -- and the government provides it. 

I thought that was an important part of your argument,

sure you get it. 

Well, when you need police assistance or 

fire assistance or ambulance assistance, the government 

is going to make sure to the best extent it can that you 

get it. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the fundamental 

difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's not an 

issue of market regulation. This is an issue of market 

regulation, and that's how Congress -- that's how 

Congress looked at this problem. There is a market. 

Insurance is provided through a market system --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there is a 

market for burial services? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: For burial services? 

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Alito, I 

think there is. 

JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Suppose that you 

and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour 

and we found a couple of healthy young people and we 

stopped them and we said: You know what you're doing? 

You are financing your burial services right now because 

eventually you're going to die, and somebody is going to 

have to pay for it, and if you don't have burial

insurance, or you haven't saved money for it, you're 

going to shift the cost to somebody else. 

Isn't that a very artificial way of talking 

about what somebody is doing? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No --

JUSTICE ALITO: And if that's true, why 

isn't it equally artificial to say that somebody who is 

doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing 

health care services? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: It's -- I think it's 

completely different. The -- and the reason is that the 

burial example is not -- the difference is here you are 

regulating the method by which you are paying for 

something else -- health care -- and the insurance 

requirement I think -- the key thing here is my 

friends on the other side acknowledge that it is within 

the authority of Congress under Article I under the 

commerce power to impose guaranteed-issue and 

community-rating reforms, to end -- to impose a minimum 

coverage provision. Their argument is just that it has 

to occur at the point of sale, and --

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't see the difference. 

You can get burial insurance. You can get health 

insurance. Most people are going to need health care, 

almost everybody. Everybody is going to be buried or

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, one big 

difference --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: One big difference, 

Justice Alito, is the -- you don't have the cost 

shifting to other market participants. Here --

JUSTICE ALITO: Sure you do, because if you 

don't have money, then the State is going to pay for it 

or some --

GENERAL VERRILLI: But that's different. 

JUSTICE ALITO: A family member is going to 

pay for it. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's a difference, and 

it's a significant difference, that this -- in this 

situation, one of the economic effects Congress is 

addressing is that the -- there -- the many billions of 

dollars of uncompensated costs are transferred directly 

to other market participants. It's transferred directly 

to other market participants because health care 

providers charge higher rates in order to cover the cost 

of uncompensated care, and insurance companies reflect 

those higher rates in higher premiums, which Congress 

found translates to a thousand dollars per family in 

additional health insurance costs.

JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't that really a 

small part of what the mandate is doing? You can 

correct me if these figures are wrong, but it appears to 

me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium 

for a single insurance policy in the non-group market 

will be roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016. 

Respondents -- the economists who have 

supported the Respondents estimate that a young, healthy 

individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes 

about $854 in health services each year. So, the 

mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge 

subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes 

that the Act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those 

figures are right, isn't it the case that what this 

mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who 

are subject to it to pay for the services that they are 

going to consume? It is requiring them to subsidize 

services that will be received by somebody else. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think that -- and I 

do think that's what the Respondents argue. It's just 

not right. I think it -- it really gets to a 

fundamental problem with their argument. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're going to have 

insurance, that's how insurance works.

works, but (b) the problem that they -- that they're 

identifying is not that problem. The guaranteed-issue 

and community-rating reforms do not have the effect of 

forcing insurance companies to take on lots of 

additional people who they then can't afford to cover 

because they're -- they tend to be the sick, and that 

is -- in fact, the exact opposite is what happens here. 

The -- when you enact guaranteed-issue and 

community-rating reforms, and you do so in the absence 

of a minimum coverage provision, it's not that insurance 

companies take on more and more people and then need a 

subsidy to cover it; it's that fewer and fewer people 

end up with insurance because the rates are not 

regulated. Insurance companies, when they -- when they 

have to offer guaranteed issue and community rating, 

they're entitled to make a profit. They charge rates 

sufficient to cover only the sick population because 

healthy people --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you help -- would 

help me with this? Assume for the moment -- you may 

disagree. Assume for the moment that this is 

unprecedented. This is a step beyond what our cases 

have allowed, the affirmative duty to act to go into 

commerce. If that is so, do you not have a heavy burden 

of justification?

I understand that we must presume laws are 

constitutional, but, even so, when you are changing the 

relation of the individual to the government in this, 

what we can stipulate is, I think, a unique way, do you 

not have a heavy burden of justification to show 

authorization under the Constitution? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: So, two things about 

that, Justice Kennedy. First, we think this is 

regulation of people's participation in the health care 

market, and all it -- all this minimum coverage 

provision does is say that, instead of requiring 

insurance at the point of sale, that Congress has the 

authority under the commerce power and the necessary and 

proper power to ensure that people have insurance in 

advance of the point of sale because of the unique 

nature of this market, because this is a market in 

which -- in which you -- although most of the population 

is in the market most of the time -- 83 percent visit a 

physician every year; 96 percent over a 5-year period --

so, virtually everybody in society is in this market. 

And you've got to pay for the health care 

you get, the predominant way in which it's -- in which 

it's paid for is insurance, and -- and the Respondents 

agree that Congress could require that you have 

insurance in order to get health care or forbid health

care from being provided --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you -- why do you 

define the market that broadly? Health care. It may 

well be that everybody needs health care sooner or 

later, but not everybody needs a heart transplant. Not 

everybody needs a liver transplant. Why -- I mean --

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct, Justice 

Scalia, but you never know whether you're going to be 

that person. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you define the 

market -- everybody has to buy food sooner or later. 

So, you define the market as food; therefore, 

everybody's in the market; therefore, you can make 

people buy broccoli. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No, that is quite 

different. It is quite different. The food market, 

while it shares that trait that everybody's in it, it is 

not a market in which your participation is often 

unpredictable and often involuntary. It is not a market 

in which you often don't know before you go in what you 

need, and it is not a market in which, if you go in 

and -- and seek to obtain a product or service, you will 

get it even if you can't pay for it. It doesn't have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it a principled basis? 

I mean, it's -- it's a basis that explains why the 

government is doing this, but is it -- is it a basis 

which shows that this is not going beyond what -- what 

the system of enumerated powers allows the government to 

do. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, for two reasons. 

First, this -- the test, as this Court has articulated 

it, is: Is Congress regulating economic activity with a 

substantial effect on interstate commerce? 

The way in which this statute satisfies the 

test is on the basis of the factors that I have 

identified. It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, I thought 

that your main point is that, unlike food or any other 

market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, 

even though you have every intent in the world to 

self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you 

may not have the money. And the tangible result of it 

is -- we were told -- there was one brief that Maryland 

hospital care bills 7 percent more because of these

uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand 

dollars more than they would if there were no 

uncompensated costs. 

I thought what was unique about this is it's 

not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me 

healthy, but the cost that I am foisting on other people 

if I don't buy the product sooner rather than later. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That is -- and that is 

definitely a difference that distinguished this market 

and justifies this as a regulation --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if that is 

your difference --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- of common activity. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If that is your difference, 

I'm somewhat uncertain about your answers to -- for 

example, Justice Kennedy asked, can you, under the 

Commerce Clause, Congress, create commerce where 

previously none existed? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I thought the answer 

to that was, since McCulloch v. Maryland, when the 

Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United 

States which did not previously exist, which job was to 

create commerce that did not previously exist, since 

that time the answer has been "yes." I would have

that if we propose comparable situations, if we have, 

for example, a uniform United States system of paying 

for every burial such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid 

Burial, CHIP Burial, ERISA Burial, and emergency burial 

beside the side of the road, and Congress wanted to 

rationalize that system, wouldn't the answer be, yes, of 

course, they could? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: So --

JUSTICE BREYER: And the same with the 

computers or the same with the -- the cell phones, if 

you're driving by the side of the highway and there is a 

Federal emergency service. Just as you say you have to 

buy certain mufflers for your car that don't hurt the 

environment, you could -- I mean, you see, doesn't it 

depend on the situation?

Clause. Can you identify for us some limits on the 

Commerce Clause?

rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that we're 

advocating here would not justify forced purchases of 

commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand.

for the purposes -- in situations in which insurance 

doesn't serve as the method of payment for a service --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That, it seems to 

me, is -- and it's a passage in your reply brief that I 

didn't quite grasp. It's the same point. You say, 

"Health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like 

a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing 

health-care consumption and covering universal risks." 

Well, a car or broccoli aren't purchased for 

their own sake, either. They're purchased for the sake 

of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for 

food. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No --

Justice, is that health insurance is the means of 

payment for health care, and broccoli is --

satisfying a basic human need --

GENERAL VERRILLI: But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- just as your 

insurance is the means of satisfying --

GENERAL VERRILLI: But I do think that's the 

difference between existing commerce, activity in the 

market already occurring -- the people in the health 

care market purchasing, obtaining health care 

services -- and the creation of commerce. And the 

principle that we're advocating here under the Commerce 

Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation 

of commerce. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, can 

we go --

GENERAL VERRILLI: This is a regulation of 

existing commerce. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to --

Justice Breyer asked a question, and it kind of 

interrupted your answer to my question. And tell me if 

I'm wrong about this, but I thought a major, major point 

of your argument was that the people who don't 

participate in this market are making it much more 

expensive for the people who do; that is, they will 

get -- a goodly number of them will get services that 

they can't afford at the point when they need them, and

the result is that everybody else's premiums get raised. 

So, you're not -- it's not your free choice 

just to do something for yourself. What you do is going 

to affect others, affect them in a major way. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that absolutely 

is a justification for Congress's action here. That is 

existing economic activity that Congress is regulating 

by means of this rule. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, you could say 

that about buying a car. If people don't buy cars, the 

price that those who do buy cars pay will have to be 

higher. So, you can say in order to bring the price 

down, you're hurting these other people by not buying a 

car. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That is not what we're 

saying, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not -- that's not 

what you're saying. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's not -- not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was. I 

thought you're saying other people are going to have to 

pay more for insurance because you're not buying it. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No. It's because you're 

going -- in the health care market, you're going into 

the market without the ability to pay for what you get,

the social norms that allow -- that -- to which we've 

obligated ourselves so that people get health care. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't obligate 

yourself to that. Why -- you know? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I can't imagine 

that that -- that the Commerce Clause would -- would 

forbid Congress from taking into account this deeply 

embedded social norm. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, you could do it. But 

does that expand your ability to issue mandates to – 

to the people? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- this is not a 

purchase mandate. This is a -- this is a law that 

regulates the method of paying for a service that the 

class of people to whom it applies are either 

consuming --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- or inevitably will 

consume. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I see or have 

seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one 

of them is echoed today. The first strand that I've 

seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to 

effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it

1 made a decision that to effect -- to effect mandatory 

2 issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the 

3 mandatory purchase of it. 

4  The second strand I see is self-insurance 

affects the market; and so, the government can regulate 

6 those who self-insure. 

7  And the third argument -- and I see all of 

8 them as different -- is that what the government is 

9 doing -- and I think it's the argument you're making 

today -- that what the -- what the government is saying 

11 is if you pay for health -- if you use health services, 

12 you have to pay with insurance, because only insurance will 

13 guarantee that whatever need for health care that you 

14 have will be covered, because virtually no one, perhaps 

with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can 

16 afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens. 

17  This third argument seems to be saying what 

18 we're regulating is health care, and when you go for 

19 health services, you have to pay for insurance, and 

since insurance won't issue at the moment that you 

21 consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell 

22 you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at 

23 the moment that you need it. 

24  Is that -- which of these three is your 

argument? Are all of them your argument? I'm just not

sure what the --

GENERAL VERRILLI: So, let me try to state 

it this way: The Congress enacted reforms of the 

insurance market, the guaranteed-issue and 

community-rating reforms. It did so to deal with a very 

serious problem that results in 40 million people not 

being able to get insurance and therefore not access to 

the health care market. Everybody agrees in this case 

that those are within Congress's Article I powers. 

The minimum coverage provision is necessary 

to carry those provisions into execution, because 

without them, without those provisions, without minimum 

coverage, guaranteed issue and community rating will, as 

the experience in the States showed, make matters worse, 

not better. There will be fewer people covered; it will 

cost more. Now, the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, on that ground --

GENERAL VERRILLI: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you're answering 

affirmatively to my colleagues that have asked you the 

question, can the government force you into commerce? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: So -- no. No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there's no limit to 

that power.

that's the first part of our argument. 

The second part of our argument is that the 

means here that Congress has chosen, the minimum 

coverage provision, is a means that regulates the --

that regulates economic activity, namely your 

transaction in the health care market, with substantial 

effects on interstate commerce; and it is the 

conjunction of those two that we think provides the 

particularly secure foundation for this statute under 

the commerce power. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: General, you've talked on --

a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress 

might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents 

suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the 

alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which 

somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and 

asks for care. 

Did Congress consider those alternatives? 

Why did it reject them? How should we think about the 

question of alternative ways of dealing with these 

problems? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I do think, Justice 

Kagan, that the point of difference between my friends 

on the other side and the United States is about one of 

timing. They've agreed that Congress has Article I

authority to impose an insurance requirement or other --

or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have 

agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to 

achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage 

provision in the Affordable Care Act is designed to 

achieve. 

This is a situation in which we are talking 

about means. Congress gets substantial deference in 

the choice of means, and if one thinks about the 

difference between the means they say Congress should 

have chosen and the means Congress did choose, I think 

you can see why it was eminently more sensible for 

Congress to choose the means that it chose. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure which way it 

cuts, if the Congress has alternate means. Let's assume 

that it could use the tax power to raise revenue and to 

just have a national health service, single payer. How 

does that factor into our analysis? In one sense, it 

can be argued if this is what the government is doing, 

it ought to be honest about the power that it's using 

and use the correct power. 

On the other hand, it means that since the 

Court can do it any way -- Congress can do it any way, 

we give it a certain amount of latitude. I'm not sure 

which way the argument goes.

GENERAL VERRILLI: Let me try to answer that 

question, Justice Kennedy, and get back to the question 

you asked me earlier. The -- the -- I do think one 

striking feature of the argument here that this is a 

novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to 

do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a 

method that has more choice than would the traditional 

Medicare or Medicaid type model. And so, it seems a 

little ironic to suggest that that counts against it. 

But beyond that, in the sense that it's 

novel, this provision is novel in the same way, or 

unprecedented in the same way, that the Sherman Act was 

unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern 

Securities case, or the Packers and Stockyards Act was 

unprecedented when the Court upheld it, or the National 

Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court 

upheld it in Jones & Laughlin, or the dairy price 

supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, it's not. They all 

involved commerce. There was no doubt that what was 

being regulated was commerce. And here you're 

regulating somebody who isn’t commerce. 

By the way, I don't agree with you that the 

relevant market here is health care. You're not 

regulating health care. You're regulating insurance.

It's the insurance market that you're addressing, and 

you're saying that some people who are not in it must be 

in it, and that's -- that's different from regulating in 

any manner commerce that already exists out there. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, to the extent that 

we're looking at the comprehensive scheme, Justice 

Scalia, it is regulating commerce that already exists 

out there. And the means in which that regulation is 

made effective here, the minimum coverage provision, is 

a regulation of the way in which people participate, the 

method of their payment in the health care market. That 

is what it is. 

And I do think, Justice Kennedy, getting 

back to the question you asked before, what -- what 

matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool 

that's reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress 

is confronting. And that may mean that the tool is 

different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in 

the past. That's not something that counts against the 

provision in a Commerce Clause analysis. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. That's -- it's both 

"Necessary and Proper." What you just said addresses 

what's necessary. Yes, has to be reasonably adapted. 

Necessary does not mean essential, just reasonably 

adapted. But in addition to being necessary, it has to

be proper. And we've held in two cases that something 

that was reasonably adapted was not proper, because it 

violated the sovereignty of the States, which was 

implicit in the constitutional structure. 

The argument here is that this also is -- may be 

necessary, but it's not proper, because it violates an 

equally evident principle in the Constitution, which is 

that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a 

government that has all powers, that it's supposed to be 

a government of limited powers. And that's what all 

this questioning has been about. What -- what is left? 

If the government can do this, what -- what else can it 

not do? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: This does not violate the 

norm of proper, as this Court articulated it in Printz 

or in New York, because it does not interfere with the 

States as sovereigns. This is a regulation that -- this 

is a regulation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- no, that wasn't 

my point. That is not the only constitutional principle 

that exists. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: An equally evident 

constitutional principle is the principle that the 

Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers

and that the vast majority of powers remain in the 

States and do not belong to the Federal Government. Do 

you acknowledge that that's a principle? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course, we do, Your 

Honor, but this is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And that's what 

we're talking about here. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: And the way in which this 

Court in its cases has policed the boundary that -- of 

what's in the national sphere and what's in the local 

sphere is to ask whether Congress is regulating economic 

activity with a substantial effect on interstate 

commerce. 

And here I think it's really impossible, in 

view of our history, to say that Congress is invading 

the State sphere. This is a -- this is a market in 

which 50 percent of the people in this country get their 

health care through their employer. There is a massive 

Federal tax subsidy of $250 billion a year that makes 

that much more affordable. ERISA and HIPAA regulate 

that to ensure that the kinds of bans on pre-existing 

condition discrimination and pricing practices that 

occur in the individual market don't occur.

reserved, not just to the States, but to the States and 

the people.

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the argument here is 

that the people were left to decide whether they want to 

buy insurance or not. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But this -- but, Your 

Honor, this is -- what the Court has said, and I think 

it would be a very substantial departure from what the 

Court has said, is that when Congress is regulating 

economic activity with a substantial effect on 

interstate commerce, that will be upheld. And that is 

what is going on here. And to embark on -- I would 

submit with all due respect, to embark on the kind of 

analysis that my friends on the other side suggest the

substantive due process --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The key in Lochner 

is that we were talking about regulation of the States, 

right, and the States are not limited to enumerated 

powers. The Federal Government is. And it seems to me 

it's an entirely different question when you ask 

yourself whether or not there are going to be limits on 

the Federal power, as opposed to limits on the States, 

which was the issue in Lochner. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I agree, except, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that what the Court has said, as I 

read the Court's cases, is that the way in which you 

ensure that the Federal Government stays in its sphere 

and the sphere reserved for the States is protected is 

by policing the boundary. Is the national government 

regulating economic activity with a substantial effect 

on interstate commerce? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the reason this 

is concerning is because it requires the individual to 

do an affirmative act. In the law of torts, our 

tradition, our law has been that you don't have the duty 

to rescue someone if that person is in danger. The 

blind man is walking in front of a car, and you do not 

have a duty to stop him, absent some relation between

you. And there's some severe moral criticisms of that 

rule, but that's generally the rule. 

And here the government is saying that the 

Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual 

citizen that it must act. And that is different from 

what we have in previous cases. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that changes the 

relationship of the Federal Government to the individual 

in a very fundamental way. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think so, Justice 

Kennedy, because it is predicated on the participation 

of these individuals in the market for health care 

services. Now, it happens to be that this is a market 

in which, aside from the groups that the statute 

excludes, virtually everybody participates. But it is a 

regulation of their participation in that market. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 

critical how you define the market. If I understand the 

law, the policies that you're requiring people to 

purchase involve -- must contain provision for maternity 

and newborn care, pediatric services, and substance use 

treatment. It seems to me that you cannot say that 

everybody is going to need substance use treatment --

substance use treatment or pediatric services; and yet,

that is part of what you require them to purchase. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it's part of what 

the statute requires the insurers to offer. And I think 

the reason is because it's trying to define minimum 

essential coverage because the problem --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but your theory 

is that there is a market in which everyone participates 

because everybody might need a certain range of health 

care services. And yet, the -- you're requiring people 

who are not -- never going to need pediatric or 

maternity services to participate in that market. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: The -- with respect to 

what insurance has to cover, Your Honor, I think 

Congress is entitled the latitude of making the 

judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is. 

And the problem here in this market is that for -- you 

may think you're perfectly healthy and you may think 

that you're not -- that you're being forced to subsidize 

somebody else, but this is not a market in which you can 

say that there is a immutable class of healthy people 

who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy. This 

is a market in which you may be healthy one day, and you 

may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the 

next day. And that is a fundamental difference, and

essential coverage. That doesn't -- that doesn't seem

engaging in economic regulation and solving an economic 

problem here --

you took the group of people who are subject to the 

mandate and you calculated the amount of health care 

services this whole group would consume and figured out 

the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services 

that group would consume, the cost of that policy would 

be much, much less than the kind of policy that these 

people are now going to be required to purchase under

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, while they're young 

and healthy, that would be true, but they're not going 

to be young and healthy forever. They're going to be on 

the other side of that actuarial equation at some point. 

And, of course, you don't know which among that group is 

the person who's going to be hit by the bus or get the 

definitive diagnosis. And that --

JUSTICE ALITO: That’s not -- the point is --

no, you take into account that some people in that group 

are going to be hit by a bus, some people in that group 

are going to unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with 

a disease that -- that is very expensive to treat. But 

if you take their costs and you calculate that, that's a 

lot less than the amount that they're going to be 

required to pay. 

So that you can't just justify this on the 

basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other 

people, can you? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, no, the people in 

that class get benefits, too, Justice Alito. They get 

the guaranteed-issue benefit that they would not 

otherwise have, which is an enormously valuable benefit.

in this context, the subsidizers eventually become the 

subsidized? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that was the point 

I was trying to make, Justice Kagan, that you're young 

and healthy one day, but you don't stay that way, and 

the system works over time. And so, I just don't think 

it's a fair characterization of it. And it does get 

back to, I think, a problem I think is important to 

understand --

JUSTICE SCALIA: These people not stupid. 

They're going to buy insurance later. They're young and 

need the money now. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When they think they have a 

substantial risk of incurring high medical bills, 

they'll buy insurance, like the rest of us. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But that's -- that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you think 

they're never going to buy it. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's the problem, 

Justice Scalia. That's -- and that's exactly the 

experience that the States had that made the imposition 

of guaranteed issue and community rating not only be 

ineffectual but be highly counterproductive. Rates, for 

example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from

180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000 

people covered in this market. In Kentucky, virtually 

every insurer left the market. 

And the reason for that is because when 

people have that guarantee of -- that they can get 

insurance, they're going to make that calculation that 

they won't get it until they're sick and they need it. 

And so, the pool of people in the insurance market gets 

smaller and smaller. The rates you have to charge to 

cover them get higher and higher. It helps fewer and 

fewer -- insurance covers fewer and fewer people until 

the system ends. 

This is not a situation in which you're 

conscripting -- you're forcing insurance companies to 

cover very large numbers of unhealthy people --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could solve that 

problem by simply not requiring the insurance company to 

sell it to somebody who has a condition that is going to 

require medical treatment, or at least not -- not 

require them to sell it to him at a rate that he sells 

it to healthy people. 

But you don't want to do that. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But that seems to me to 

say, Justice Scalia, that Congress -- that's the problem 

here. And that seems to me -­

regulation, and that -- and I do not think that can be

to enter -- to enter the insurance market. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: This is not a -- it's not 

a problem of Congress's creation. The problem is that 

you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable 

insurance through the means that the rest of us get 

affordable insurance. Congress, after long study and 

careful deliberation, and viewing the experiences of the 

States and the way they tried to handle this problem, 

adopted a package of reforms. Guaranteed issue and 

community rating and subsidies and the minimum coverage 

provision are a package of reforms that solve that

problem. 

I don't -- I think it's highly artificial to 

view this as a problem of Congress's own creation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your argument 

limited to insurance or means of paying for health care? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. It's limited to 

insurance. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, why is 

that? Congress could -- once you -- once you establish 

that you have a market for health care, I would suppose 

Congress's power under the Commerce Clause meant they 

had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that 

market. And it would be -- it would be going back to 

Lochner if we were put in a position of saying, no, 

you can use your commerce power to regulate insurance, 

but you can't use your commerce power to regulate this 

market in other ways. I think that would be a very 

significant intrusion by the Court into Congress's 

power. 

So, I don't see how we can accept your --

it's good for you in this case to say, oh, it's just 

insurance. But once we say that there is a market and 

Congress can require people to participate in it, as 

some would say, or as you would say, that people are 

already participating in it, it seems to me that we

can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do 

under its commerce power. Just like in any other 

area -- given significant deference that we accord to 

Congress in this area, all bets are off, and you could 

regulate that market in any rational way. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But this is insurance as 

a method of payment for health care services. And 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. You're 

worried --

GENERAL VERRILLI: And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the area that 

Congress has chosen to regulate. There's this health 

care market. Everybody's in it. So, we can regulate 

it, and we're going to look at a particular serious 

problem, which is how people pay for it. But next year, 

they can decide everybody's in this market; we're going 

to look at a different problem now, and this is how 

we're going to regulate it. And we can compel people to 

do things -- purchase insurance, in this case; something 

else in the next case -- because you've -- we've 

accepted the argument that this is a market in which 

everybody participates. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, let me

tax power argument. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I tell you what the 

something else is so -- while you're answering it? 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The something else is 

everybody has to exercise, because there's no doubt that 

lack of exercise cause -- causes illness, and that 

causes health care costs to go up. So, the Federal 

Government says everybody has to join a -- an exercise 

club. That's the something else. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No. The position we're 

taking here would not justify that rule, Justice Scalia, 

because health club membership is not a means of payment 

for -- for consumption of anything in a market. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Right. 

That's exactly right, but it doesn't seem responsive to 

my concern that there's no reason -- once we say this is 

within Congress's commerce power, there's no reason 

other than our own arbitrary judgment to say all they 

can regulate is the method of payment. They can 

regulate other things that affect this now-conceded 

interstate market in health care in which everybody 

participates.

interstate market in which everybody participates.

GENERAL VERRILLI: And they agree that 

Congress could impose the insurance requirement at the 

point of sale. And this is just a question of timing 

and whether Congress's -- whether the necessary and 

proper authority gives Congress, because of the 

particular features of this market, the ability to 

impose the -- the insurance, the need for insurance, the 

maintenance of insurance before you show up to get 

health care, rather than at the moment you get up to --

you're just --

care. And that --

something, I think you're just repeating the idea that 

this is the regulation of the method of payment. And I 

understand that argument. And it may be --

GENERAL VERRILLI: And it is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may be a good 

one. But what I'm concerned about is, once we accept 

the principle that everybody is in this market, I don't 

see why Congress's power is limited to regulating the 

method of payment and doesn't include as it does in any

other area. 

What other area have we said Congress can 

regulate this market but only with respect to prices, 

but only with respect to means of travel? No. Once 

you're -- once you're in the interstate commerce and can 

regulate it, pretty much all bets are off. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But we agree Congress can 

regulate this market. ERISA regulates this market. 

HIPAA regulates this market. The market is regulated at 

the Federal level in very significant ways already. So, 

I don't think that's the question, Mr. Chief Justice. 

The question is, is there a limit to the authority that 

we're advocating here under the commerce power? And the 

answer is yes, because we are not advocating for a power 

that would allow Congress to compel purchases. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could you just say--

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Before you move on, could 

you express your limiting principle as succinctly as you 

possibly can? Congress can force people to purchase a 

product where the failure to purchase the product has a 

substantial effect on interstate commerce, if what? If 

this is part of a larger regulatory scheme? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: We've got --

GENERAL VERRILLI: We've got --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything more? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: We got two and they're --

they're different. Let me state them. First, with 

respect to the comprehensive scheme. When Congress is 

regulating -- is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it 

has the authority to enact, that the Necessary and 

Proper Clause gives it the authority to include 

regulation, including a regulation of this kind, if it 

is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the 

scheme itself that people engage in economic activity 

that would undercut the scheme. It's like -- it's very 

much like Wickard in that respect. Very much like Raich 

in that respect. 

With respect to the -- with respect to 

the -- considering the Commerce Clause alone and not 

embedded in the comprehensive scheme, our position is 

that Congress can regulate the method of payment by 

imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time 

in which the -- the service is consumed when the class 

to which that requirement applies either is, or virtually 

most certain to be, in that market, when the timing of 

one's entry into that market and what you will need when 

you enter that market is uncertain, and when -- when you 

will get the care in that market, whether you can afford

to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market 

participants. 

So, those -- those are our views as to --

those are the principles we're advocating for, and it's, 

in fact, the conjunction of the two of them here that 

makes this, we think, a strong case under the Commerce 

Clause. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, could you turn 

to the tax clause? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Thank you,so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have looked for a case 

that involves the issue of whether something denominated 

by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless treated as a 

tax, except in those situations where the code itself or 

the statute itself said treat the penalty as a tax. 

Do you know of any case where we've done 

that? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think I would 

point the Court to the license tax case, where it was --

was denominated a fee, a nontax, and the Court upheld it 

as an exercise of the taxing power, in a situation in 

which the structure of the law was very much like the 

structure of this law, in that there was a separate 

stand-alone provision that set the predicate and then a 

separate provision imposing the fee.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, fees -- you know, 

license fees, fees for a hunting license -- everybody 

knows those are taxes. I mean, I don't think there's as 

much of a difference between a fee and a tax as there is 

between a penalty and a tax. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: And that -- and I think 

in terms of the tax power, I think it's useful to 

separate this into two questions. One is a question of 

characterization. Can this be characterized as a tax? 

And, second, is it a constitutional exercise of the 

power? 

With respect to the question of 

characterization, the -- this is in the Internal Revenue 

Code. It is administered by the IRS. It is paid on 

your Form 1040 on April 15th. I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But yesterday you told 

me -- you listed a number of penalties that are enforced 

through the tax code that are not taxes, and they're not 

penalties related to taxes. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: They may still be 

exercise of the tax -- exercises of the taxing power, 

Justice Ginsburg, as this is, and I think there isn't a 

case in which the Court has, to my mind, suggested 

anything that bears this many indicia of a tax can't be 

considered as an exercise of the taxing power.

In fact, it seems to me the license tax 

cases point you in the opposite direction. And beyond 

that, your -- the -- it seems to me the right way to 

think about this question is whether it is capable of 

being understood as an exercise of the tax power. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The President said it 

wasn't a tax, didn't he? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, Justice Scalia, 

what the -- two things about that. First is, it seems 

to me, what matters is what power Congress was 

exercising. And they were -- and I think it's clear 

that the -- they were exercising the tax power as well 

as the commerce power. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're making two 

arguments. Number one, it's a tax. And, number two, 

even if it isn't a tax, it's within the taxing power. 

I'm just addressing the first. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: What the President 

said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it a tax or not a tax? 

The President didn't think it was. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: The President said it 

wasn't a tax increase because it ought to be understood 

as an incentive to get people to have insurance. I 

don't think it's fair to infer from that anything about

whether that is an exercise of the tax power or not. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't -- a tax is 

to raise revenue. A tax is a revenue-raising device, 

and the purpose of this exaction is to get people into 

the health care risk pool before they need medical care. 

And so, it will be successful if it doesn't raise any 

revenue, if it gets people to buy the insurance. 

That's -- that's what this penalty is -- this penalty is 

designed to affect conduct. 

The conduct is buy health protection, buy 

health insurance before you have a need for medical 

care. That's what the penalty is designed to do, not to 

raise revenue. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that is true, 

Justice Ginsburg. That is also true of the marijuana 

tax that was upheld in Sanchez. That's commonly true of 

penalties under the code. They do -- if they raise 

revenue, they are exercises of the taxing power. But 

their purpose is not to raise revenue; their purpose is 

to discourage behavior. 

The mortgage deduction works that 

way. When the mortgage deduction is -- it's clearly an 

exercise of the taxing power. When it's successful, it 

raises less revenue for the Federal Government. It's 

still an exercise of the taxing power. So, I don't -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: I suppose, though, General, 

one question is whether the determined efforts of 

Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a 

difference. I mean, you're suggesting we should just 

look to the practical operation. We shouldn't look at 

labels. And that seems right, except that here we have 

a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a 

tax. And the question is why should that be irrelevant? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think that that's 

a fair characterization of the actions of Congress here, 

Justice Kagan. On the -- December 23rd, a point of 

constitutional order was called, too, in fact, with 

respect to this law. The floor sponsor, Senator Baucus, 

defended it as an exercise of the taxing power. In his 

response to the point of order, the Senate voted 60 to 

39 on that proposition. 

The legislative history is replete with 

members of Congress explaining that this law is 

constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power. It 

was attacked as a tax by its opponents. So, I don't 

think this is a situation where you can say that 

Congress was avoiding any mention of the tax power. 

It would be one thing if Congress explicitly 

disavowed an exercise of the tax power. But given that 

it hasn't done so, it seems to me that it's -- not only

is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power, 

but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as 

an exercise of the tax power, if it can be upheld on 

that basis. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why didn't 

Congress call it a tax, then? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're telling me 

they thought of it as a tax, they defended it on the tax 

power. Why didn't they say it was a tax? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: They might have thought, 

Your Honor, that calling it a penalty as they did would 

make it more effective in accomplishing its objectives. 

But it is in the Internal Revenue Code. It is collected 

by the IRS on April 15th. I don't think this is a 

situation in which you can say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the 

reason. They thought it might be more effective if they 

called it a penalty. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I -- you know, I 

don't -- there's nothing that I know of that illuminates 

that. Certainly --

GENERAL VERRILLI: No. There are certain 

limiting principles under the taxing power, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, there has to be a 

limiting principle as to when --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and they -- and I 

think, of course, the Constitution imposes some: Got to 

be uniform; can't be a tax on exports; if it's a direct 

tax, it's got to be apportioned. Beyond that, the 

limiting principle, as the Court has identified from 

Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch, is that it can't be 

punishment, punitive in the guise of a tax. 

And there are three factors the Court has 

identified to look at that. The first is the sanction 

and how disproportionate it is to the conduct; the 

second is whether there is scienter; and the third is 

whether there is an administrative apparatus out there 

to enforce the tax. 

Now, in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, for 

example, the tax was 10 percent of the company's 

profits, even if they had only one child laborer for one 

day. There was a scienter requirement. And it was 

enforced by the Department of Labor. It wasn't just 

collected by the Internal Revenue Service. 

Here you don't have any of those things. 

This -- the penalty is calculated to be no more than, at

requirement. There's no enforcement apparatus out 

there. So, it's certainly --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can the --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- consistent with those

a tax if it does impose a requirement on people who are 

not subject to the penalty or the tax? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it could, for the 

reasons I -- I discussed yesterday. I don't think it 

can or should be read that way. But if there's any 

doubt about that, Your Honor, if there is -- if it is 

the view of the Court that it can't be, then I think 

the right way to handle this case is by analogy to New 

York v. United States, in which the -- the Court read 

the "shall" provision, shall handle low-level 

radioactive waste, as setting the predicate, and then 

the other provisions were merely incentives to get the 

predicate met, and so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying that all 

the discussion we had earlier about how this is one big 

uniform scheme and the Commerce Clause, blah, blah,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FLORIDA, ET AL. 

MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The mandate represents an unprecedented 

effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter 

commerce in order to better regulate commerce. The 

Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate 

existing commerce. It does not give Congress the far 

greater power to compel people to enter commerce, to 

create commerce essentially in the first place. 

Now, Congress when it passed the statute did 

make findings about why it thought it could regulate the 

commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a 

regulation of the economic decision to forgo the 

purchase of health insurance. That is a theory without 

any limiting principle. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you accept here the 

General's position that you have conceded that Congress 

could say, if you're going to consume health services, 

you have to pay by way of insurance? 

MR. CLEMENT: That's right, 

Justice Sotomayor. We say, consistent with 220 years of 

this Court's jurisprudence, that if you regulate the

point of sale, you regulate commerce, that's within 

Congress's commerce power. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, what do 

you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the 

point of consumption? Virtually, you force insurance 

companies to sell it to you? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice, I think there's 

two points to make on that. One is a lot of the 

discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the 

assumption that the only thing that's at issue here is 

emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being 

imposed is catastrophic care coverage. But, as the 

Chief Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance 

that's being covered is for ordinary preventive care, 

ordinary office visits, and those are the kind of things 

that one can predict. 

So, there's a big part of the market that's 

regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that 

you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room 

visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at 

that point. You could simply say, through some sort of 

mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide 

people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool, 

and maybe you'll have to share it amongst yourself or 

something, but people simply have to sign up at that

point, and that would be regulating at the point of 

sale. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Clement, now it 

seems as though you're just talking about a matter of 

timing, that Congress can regulate the transaction. And 

the question is when does it make best sense to regulate 

that transaction? 

And Congress surely has it within its 

authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale, 

given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to 

regulate it earlier. It's just a matter of timing. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, we don't 

think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has 

very significant substantive effects, because if 

Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one 

group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who 

don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no 

plans of using health care services in the near term. 

And Congress very much wanted to capture those people. 

I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese 

that pay for the entire lowering of the premium --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the government's 

argument this -- and maybe I won't state it accurately. 

It is true that the noninsured young adult is, in fact, 

an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health

services, insofar as the way health insurance companies 

figure risk. That person who is sitting at home in his 

or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality 

that can and must be measured for health service 

purposes; is that their argument? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know, 

Justice Kennedy, but, if it is, I think there's at least 

two problems with it. 

One is, as Justice Alito's question 

suggested earlier -- I mean, somebody who is not in the 

insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial 

risk. I mean, we could look at the people not in the 

insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're 

relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would 

have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would 

actually lead to lower premiums. 

The people that would be captured by 

guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed 

issue and community rating would presumably have a 

higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums. 

And one of the things, one of the things, 

Congress sought to accomplish here was to force 

individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those 

that are already in it to lower the rates. And that's 

just not my speculation, that's Finding (I) at 43a of

the Government's brief that -- it has the statute. And 

that's one of the clear findings. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, doesn't that 

work -- that work the way Social Security does? 

Let me put it this way: Congress, in the 

'30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old 

age and survivor's insurance. And, yes, they did it 

through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in 

it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's 

not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become 

old or disabled or widowed. So, they required everyone 

to contribute. 

There was a big fuss about that in the 

beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some 

people still do today -- I could do much better if the 

government left me alone. I'd go into the private 

market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment, 

and they're forcing me to pay for this Social 

Security that I don't want. 

But that's constitutional. So, if Congress 

could see this as a problem where we need to have a 

group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get 

the benefits, it seems to me you're saying the only way 

that could be done is if the government does it itself; 

it can't involve the private market, it can't involve

the private insurers. If it wants to do this, Social 

Security is its model. The government has to do --

has to be government takeover. We can't have the 

insurance industry in it. Is that your position? 

MR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think it is, 

Justice Ginsburg. I think there are other options that 

are available. 

The most straightforward one would be to 

figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance 

industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and 

community rating. And once we calculate the amount of 

that subsidy, we could have a tax that's spread 

generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay 

for that subsidy. That's the way we pay for most 

subsidies. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we have an 

exemption? Could the government say everybody pays a 

shared health care responsibility payment to offset all 

the money that we're forced to spend on health care, we 

the government; but anybody who has an insurance policy 

is exempt from that tax? Could the government do that? 

MR. CLEMENT: The government might be able 

to do that. I think it might raise some issues about 

whether or not that would be a valid exercise of the 

taxing power.

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I do think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We get tax credits for 

having solar-powered homes. We get tax credits for 

using fuel-efficient cars. Why couldn't we get a tax 

credit for having health insurance and saving the 

government from caring for us? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it would depend 

a little bit on how it was formulated, but my concern 

would be -- the constitutional concern would be that it 

would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax. And 

I do think -- you know, I mean, I don't want to suggest 

we get to the taxing power too soon, but I do think it's 

worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the 

ability to impose direct taxes. 

And the one thing I think the Framers would 

have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not 

having something. I mean, the framing generation was 

divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax 

or not. Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax; 

Madison thought it was a direct tax. I have little 

doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on 

not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct 

tax. I also think they would have thought it clearly

wasn't a valid regulation of the market in carriages. 

And, you know, I mean, if you look at 

Hylton v. The United States, that's this Court's first 

direct tax case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask -- can I go back 

for a step? Because I don't want to get into a 

discussion of whether this is a good bill or not. Some 

people think it's going to save a lot of money. Some 

people think it won't. 

So, I'm focusing just on the Commerce 

Clause; not on the Due Process Clause, the Commerce 

Clause. And I look back into history, and I think if we 

look back into history, we see sometimes Congress can 

create commerce out of nothing. That's the national 

bank, which was created out of nothing to create other 

commerce out of nothing. 

I look back into history, and I see it seems 

pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on 

interstate commerce, Congress can act. And I look at 

the person who's growing marijuana in her house, or I 

look at the farmer who is growing wheat for home 

consumption. This seems to have more substantial 

effects. 

Is this commerce? Well, it seems to me more 

commerce than marijuana. I mean, is it, in fact, a

regulation? Well, why not? If creating the bank is, why 

isn't this? 

And then you say, ah, but one thing here out 

of all those things is different, and that is you're 

making somebody do something. 

I say, hey, can't Congress make people drive 

faster than 45 -- 40 miles an hour on a road? Didn't 

they make that man growing his own wheat go out into the 

market and buy other wheat for his -- for his cows? 

Didn't they make Mrs. -- if she married somebody who had 

marijuana in her basement, wouldn't she have to go and 

get rid of it? Affirmative action? 

I mean, where does this distinction come 

from? It sounds like sometimes you can, and sometimes 

you can't. 

So, what is argued here is there is a large 

group of -- what about a person that we discover that 

there are -- a disease is sweeping the United States, 

and 40 million people are susceptible, of whom 10 

million will die; can't the Federal Government say all 

40 million get inoculation? 

So, here, we have a group of 40 million, and 

57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other 

care, which we're paying for. And 22 percent of those 

pay more than $100,000 for that. And Congress says

1 they're in the midst of this big thing. We just want to 

2 rationalize the system they're already in. 

3  So, there, you got the whole argument, and I 

4 would like you to tell me, looking back --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Answer those questions in 

6 inverse order. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, it's one 

9 question. It's looking back at that -- looking back at 

that history. The thing I concede, that you say to some 

11 people go buy -- why does that make a difference in 

12 terms of the Commerce Clause? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let me 

14 start at the beginning of your question with McCulloch. 

McCulloch was not a commerce power case. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: It was both? 

17  MR. CLEMENT: It was not -- no, the bank was not 

18 justified and the corporation was not justified as an 

19 exercise of commerce power. So that is not a case that 

says that it's okay to conjure up the bank as an 

21 exercise of the commerce power. 

22  And what, of course, the Court didn't say, 

23 and I think the Court would have had a very different 

24 reaction to, is, you know, we're not just going to have 

the bank, because that would be necessary and proper;

we're going to force the citizenry to put all of their 

money in the bank, because, if we do that, then we know 

the Bank of the United States will be secure. 

I think the Framers would have identified 

the difference between those two scenarios, and I don't 

think that the great Chief Justice would have said that 

forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the 

United States was necessary and proper. 

Now, if you look through all the cases you 

mentioned, I do not think you will find a case like 

this. And I think it's telling that you won't. I mean, 

the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard v. 

Filburn, all this effort to address the supply side and 

what producers could do, what Congress was trying to do 

was support the price of wheat. It would have been much 

more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10 

loaves of bread. That would have had a much more direct 

effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing market. 

But we didn't do that. We didn't say, when 

we had problems in the automobile industry, that we're 

not just going to give you incentives, not just cash for 

clunkers; we're going to actually have everybody over 

100,000 dollars has to buy a new car --

that everybody is in this market. It's all right to 

regulate Wickard -- in Wickard v. Filburn, because 

that's a particular market in which the farmer had been 

participating. 

Everybody is in this market. So, that makes 

it very different than the market for cars or the other 

hypotheticals that you came up with, and all they're 

regulating is how you pay for it. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I suppose the first thing you have to say is 

what market are we talking about? Because the 

government -- this statute undeniably operates in the 

health care insurance market. And the government can't 

say that everybody is in that market. The whole problem 

is that everybody is not in that market, and they want 

to make everybody get into that market. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, doesn't that seem a 

little bit, Mr. Clement, cutting the baloney thin? I 

mean, health insurance exists only for the purpose of 

financing health care. The two are inextricably 

interlinked. We don't get insurance so that we can 

stare at our insurance certificate. We get it so that 

we can go and access health care. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not 

sure that's right. I think what health insurance does

and what all insurance does is it allows you to 

diversify risk. And so, it's not just a matter of I'm 

paying now instead of paying later. That's credit. 

Insurance is different than credit. Insurance 

guarantees you an up-front, locked-in payment, and you 

won't have to pay any more than that even if you incur 

much greater expenses. 

And in every other market that I know of for 

insurance, we let people basically make the decision 

whether they're relatively risk averse, whether they're 

relatively non-risk averse, and they can make the 

judgment based on --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we don't in car 

insurance, meaning we tell people buy car -- not we, the 

States do, although you're going to -- I'll ask you the 

question: Do you think that if some States decided not 

to impose an insurance requirement, that the Federal 

Government would be without power to legislate and 

require every individual to buy car insurance? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, let 

me say this, which is to say -- you're right in the 

first point to say that it's the States that do it, 

which makes it different right there. But it's also --

Lochner-era argument that only the States can do this, 

even though it affects commerce? Cars indisputably 

affect commerce. So, are you arguing that because the 

States have done it all along, the Federal Government is 

no longer permitted to legislate in this area? 

MR. CLEMENT: No. I think you might make a 

different argument about cars than you would make about 

health insurance, unless you tried to say -- but, you 

know, we're --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But health insurance --

I mean, I've never gotten into an accident, thankfully, 

and I hope never. The vast majority of people have 

never gotten into an accident where they've injured 

others; yet, we pay for it dutifully every year on the 

possibility that at some point, we might get into that 

accident. 

MR. CLEMENT: But, Justice Sotomayor, what I 

think is different is there's lots of people in 

Manhattan, for example, that don't have car insurance 

because they don't have cars. And so, they have the 

option of withdrawing from that market. It's not a 

direct imposition from the government. 

So, even the car market is different from 

this market, where there's no way to get outside of the 

regulatory web. And that's, I think, one of the real

given --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're -- but the 

given is that virtually everyone, absent some 

intervention from above, meaning that someone's life 

will be cut short in a fatal way, virtually everyone 

will use health care. 

MR. CLEMENT: At some point, that's right, 

but all sorts of people will not, say, use health care 

in the next year, which is the relevant period for the 

insurance. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But do you think you can, 

better than the actuaries or better than the members of 

Congress who worked on it, look at the 40 million people 

who are not insured and say which ones next year will or 

will not use, say, emergency care? 

Can you do that any better than if we knew 

that 40 million people were suffering, about to suffer a 

contagious disease, and only 10 million would get sick? 

MR. CLEMENT: Of course not --

JUSTICE BREYER: We don't know which?

to regulate extant commerce, it is going to get all

The question that's a proper question for 

this Court, though, is whether or not, for the first 

time ever in our history, Congress also has the power to 

compel people into commerce, because, it turns out, that 

would be a very efficient thing for purposes of 

Congress's optimal regulation of that market. And I --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement, this goes 

back to the Chief Justice's question. But, of course, 

the theory behind, not just the Government's case, but 

the theory behind this law is that people are in this 

market right now, and they're in this market because 

people do get sick, and because when people get sick, we 

provide them with care without making them pay. 

And it would be different, you know, if you 

were up here saying, I represent a class of Christian 

Scientists, then you might be able to say, look, you 

know, why are they bothering me? But absent that, 

you're in this market. You're an economic actor.

again, it depends on which market we're talking about.

the health insurance market, which is designed to access

MR. CLEMENT: And with respect to the health 

insurance market that's designed to have payment in the 

health care market, everybody's not in the market. And 

that's the premise of the statute, and that's the 

problem Congress is trying to solve. 

And if it tried to solve it through 

incentives, we wouldn't be here; but it's trying to 

solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an 

economic problem before, which is saying, you know, it 

would be so much more efficient if you were just in this 

-- the market. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they're in the market 

in the sense that they're creating a risk that the 

market must account for. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't 

think that's right, certainly in any way that 

distinguishes this from any other context. When I'm 

sitting in my house deciding I'm not going to buy a car, 

I am causing the labor market in Detroit to go south. 

am causing maybe somebody to lose their job, and for 

everybody to have to pay for it under welfare. So, the 

cost shifting that the government tries to uniquely 

associate with this market -- it's everywhere.

And even more to the point, the rationale 

that they think ultimately supports this legislation, 

that, look, it's an economic decision; once you make the 

economic decision, we aggregate the decision; there's 

your substantial effect on commerce -- that argument 

works here. It works in every single industry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, we do know that 

there are a few people, more in New York City than there 

are in Wyoming, who never will buy a car. But we also 

know here, and we don't like to admit it, that because 

we are human beings, we all suffer from the risk of 

getting sick, and we also all know that we'll get 

seriously sick. And we also know that we can't predict 

when. And we also know that when we do, there will be 

our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who 

will pay for this. If we do not buy insurance, we will 

pay nothing. And that happens with a large number of 

people in this group of 40 million, none of whom can be 

picked out in advance. 

Now, that's quite different from the car 

situation, and it's different in only this respect: It 

shows there is a national problem, and it shows there is 

a national problem that involves money, cost, insurance. 

So, if Congress could do this, should there be a disease 

that strikes the United States and they want every one

inoculated even though 10 million will be hurt, it's 

hard for me to decide why that isn't interstate 

commerce, even more so where we know it affects 

everybody. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, there 

are other markets that affect every one --

transportation, food, burial services -- though we don't 

like to talk about that either. There also are 

situations where there are many economic effects from 

somebody's failure to purchase a product. 

And if I could -- if I could talk about the 

difference between the health insurance market and the 

health care market, I mean, ultimately I don't want you 

to leave here with the impression that anything turns on 

that. Because if the government decided tomorrow that 

they've come up with a great -- somebody -- some private 

company has come up with a great new wonder drug that 

would be great for everybody to take, it would have huge 

health benefits for everybody; and by the way, also, if 

everybody had to buy it, it would facilitate economies 

of scale, and the production would be great, and the 

price would be cheaper -- and force everybody in the 

health care market, the actual health care market, to 

buy the wonder drug, I'd be up here making the same 

argument.

I'd be saying that's not a power that's 

within the commerce power of the Federal Government. It 

is something much greater. And it would have been much 

more controversial. That's one of the important things. 

In Federalist 45, Madison says the commerce power --

that's a new power, but it's not one anyone has any 

apprehension about. 

The reason they didn't have any apprehension 

about it is because it's a power that only operated once 

people were already in commerce. You see that from the 

text of the clause. The first kind of commerce Congress 

gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations. Did 

anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to 

compel some other nation into commerce with us? Of 

course not. 

And in the same way, I think if the Framers 

had understood the commerce power to include the power 

to compel people to engage in commerce --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, once again, though, 

who's in commerce and when are they in commerce? 

If the effect of all these uninsured people 

is to raise everybody's premiums, not just when they get 

sick, if they get sick, but right now in the aggregate, 

and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the 

aggregate, and the aggregate of all these uninsured

people are increasing the normal family premium, 

Congress says, by a thousand dollars a year -- those 

people are in commerce. They're making decisions that 

are affecting the price that everybody pays for this 

service. 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, again, with all 

due respect, I don't think that's a limiting principle. 

My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up 

the price of an electric car. If only more people 

demanded an electric car, there would be economies of 

scale, and the price would go down. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, this is very different, 

Mr. Clement, and it's different because of the nature of 

the health care service, that you are entitled to health 

care when you go to an emergency room, when you go to a 

doctor, even if you can't pay for it. So, the 

difference between your hypotheticals and the real case 

is the problem of uncompensated care, which --

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, first of all, I 

do think there -- this is not the only place where 

there's uncompensated care. If some -- if I don't buy a 

car and somebody goes on welfare, I'm going to end up 

paying for that as well. 

But let me also say that there's a real 

disconnect then between that focus on what makes this

different and the statute that Congress passed. If all 

we were concerned about is the cost sharing that took 

place because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms, 

presumably we'd have before us a statute that only 

addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance 

coverage. But it covers everything, soup to nuts, and 

all sorts of other things. 

And that gets at the idea that there's two 

kinds of cost shifting that are going on here. One is 

the concern about emergency care and that somehow 

somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to 

other policy areas -- holders. But there's a much 

bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost 

shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into 

an insurance market precisely because they're healthy, 

precisely because they're not likely to go to the 

emergency room, precisely because they're not likely to 

use the insurance they're forced to buy in the health 

care insurance. That creates a huge windfall. It 

lowers the price of premiums. 

And, again, this isn't just some lawyer up 

here telling you that's what it does and trying to 

second-guess the congressional economic decisions. This 

is Congress's findings, Findings (I) on page 43a of the 

appendix to the Government's brief.

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But all that 

sounds like you're debating the merits of the bill. You 

asked really for limiting principles so we don't get 

into a matter that I think has nothing to do with this 

case: broccoli. Okay? 

And the limiting principles -- you've heard 

three. First, the Solicitor General came up with a 

couple joined, very narrow ones. You've seen in Lopez 

this Court say that we cannot -- Congress cannot get 

into purely local affairs, particularly where they're 

noncommercial. And, of course, the greatest limiting 

principle of all, which not too many accept -- so, I'm 

not going to emphasize that -- is the limiting principle 

derived from the fact that members of Congress are 

elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of 

the United States is State law. That is a principle, 

though enforced by the legislature. The other two are 

principles, one written into Lopez and one you just 

heard. 

It seems to me all of those eliminate the 

broccoli possibility, and none of them eliminates the 

possibility that we're trying to take the 40 million 

people who do have the medical cost, who do affect 

interstate commerce, and provide a system that you may 

like or not like.

would encourage this Court not to Garcia-ize the 

Commerce Clause and just simply say it's up to Congress 

to police the Commerce Clause. So, I don't think that 

is a limiting principle. 

Second of all --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's exactly what 

Justice Marshall said in Gibbons. He said that it is 

the power to regulate; the power like all others vested 

in Congress is complete in itself, may be exercised to 

its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other 

than those prescribed in the Constitution. 

But there is no conscription in the -- set 

forth in the Constitution --

MR. CLEMENT: I agree --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with respect to 

regulating commerce. 

MR. CLEMENT: I agree 100 percent, and I 

think that was the Chief Justice's point, which was once 

you open the door to compelling people into commerce 

based on the narrow rationales that exist in this

industry, you are not going to be able to stop that 

process. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, see, that's the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would like hear you 

address Justice Breyer's other two principles. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, the other two principles 

are Lopez -- and this case really is not -- I mean, you 

know, Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of 

people who are already in commerce. The question is, is 

there any other limit to people who aren't in commerce? 

And so, I think this is the case that really asks that 

question. 

And then the first point, which was -- I 

take it to be the Solicitor General's point, is, with 

all due respect, simply a description of the insurance 

market. It's not a limiting principle, because the 

justification for why this is a valid regulation of 

commerce is in no way limited to this market. It simply 

says these are economic decisions; they have effect on 

other people; my failure to purchase in this market has 

a direct effect on others who are already in the market. 

That's true of virtually every other market under the 

sun. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And now maybe return 

to Justice Sotomayor's question.

MR. CLEMENT: I'd be delighted to, which is 

-- I mean, I -- you're absolutely right. Once you're in 

the commerce power, there -- this Court is not going to 

police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit. And 

that's exactly why I think it's very important for this 

Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented 

step of saying that the commerce power not only includes 

the power to regulate, prescribe the rule by which 

commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v. Ogden; but 

to go further and say it's not just prescribing the rule 

for commerce that exists, but it is the power to compel 

people to enter into commerce in the first place. 

I'd like to say two very brief things about 

the taxing power, if I could. There are lots of reasons 

why this isn't a tax. It wasn't denominated a tax. 

It's not structured as a tax. If it's any tax at all, 

though, it is a direct tax. Article I, section 9, 

clause 4 -- the Framers would have had no doubt that a 

tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a 

forbidden direct tax. That's one more reason why this 

is not proper legislation, because it -- it violates 

that. 

The second thing is I would urge you to read 

the license tax case, which the Solicitor General says 

is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax

is denominated into something other. Because that's a 

case where the argument was that because the Federal 

Government had passed a license, not a tax, that somehow 

that allowed people to take actions that would have been 

unlawful under State law, that this was some special 

Federal license to do something that was forbidden by 

State law. This Court looked beyond the label in order 

to preserve federalism there. 

What the Solicitor General and the 

government ask you to do here is exactly the opposite, 

which is to look past labels in order to up-end our 

basic federalist system. And this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me, do 

you think the States could pass this mandate? 

MR. CLEMENT: I represent 26 States. I do 

think the States could pass this mandate, but I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any other area 

of commerce, business, where we have held that there 

isn't concurrent power between the State and the Federal 

Government to protect the welfare of commerce? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 

have to resist your premise, because I didn't answer, 

yes, the States can do it because it would be a valid 

regulation of intrastate commerce. I said, yes, the 

States can do it because they have a police power, and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS NFIB, ET AL. 

MR. CARVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

May it please the Court: 

I'd like to begin with the Solicitor 

General's main premise, which is that they can compel 

the purchase of health insurance in order to promote 

commerce in the health market because it will reduce 

uncompensated care. If you accept that argument, you 

have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution 

and give Congress plenary power. 

It simply doesn't matter whether or not this 

regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing 

uncompensated care. All that matters is whether the 

activity actually being regulated by the Act negatively 

affects commerce or negatively affects commerce 

regulation, so that it's within the commerce power. If 

you agree with us that this is -- exceeds commerce 

power, the law doesn't somehow become redeemed because

it has beneficial policy effects in the health care 

market. 

In other words, Congress does not have the 

power to promote commerce. Commerce has -- Congress has 

the power to regulate commerce. And if the power 

exceeds their permissible regulatory authority, then the 

law is invalid. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, surely --

MR. CARVIN: I'm sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, surely, 

regulation includes the power to promote. Since the New 

Deal, we've said there's regulation in -- there's a 

market in agricultural products, and Congress has the 

power to subsidize, to limit production, all sorts of 

things. 

MR. CARVIN: Absolutely, Chief Justice, and 

that's the distinction I'm trying to draw. When they're 

acting within their enumerated power, then obviously 

they're promoting commerce. 

But the Solicitor General wants to turn it 

into a different power. He wants to say we have the 

power to promote commerce, to regulate anything to 

promote commerce. And if they have the power to promote 

commerce, then they have the power to regulate

everything, right? Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- I don't 

think you're addressing their main point, which is that 

they're not creating commerce in -- in health care. 

It's already there, and we're all going to need some 

kind of health care; most of us will at some point. 

MR. CARVIN: I'd -- I'd like to address that 

in two ways, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice. In the 

first place, they keep playing mix and match with the 

statistics. They say 95 percent of us are in the health 

care market, okay? But that's not the relevant 

statistic, even as the Government frames the issue. No 

one in Congress or the Solicitor General is arguing that 

going to the doctor and fully paying him creates a 

problem. The problem is uncompensated care, and they 

say the uncompensated care arises if you have some kind 

of catastrophe -- hit by a bus, have some prolonged 

illness. Well, what is the percentage of the uninsured 

that have those sorts of catastrophes? We know it has 

got to be a relatively small fraction. So, in other 

words, the relevant --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yet, we don't know 

who they are. 

MR. CARVIN: We don't, no, and we don't know 

in advance, and -- but that doesn't change the basic

principle, that you are nonetheless forcing people for 

paternalistic reasons to go into the insurance market to 

insure against risks that they have made the voluntary 

decision that they are not -- have decided not to. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the problem is --

MR. CARVIN: But even if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is that they 

are making the rest of us pay for it, because as much as 

they say, well, we're not in the market, we don't know 

when they -- the timing when they will be. 

MR. CARVIN: With --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- the figures of 

how much more families are paying for insurance because 

people get sick, they may have intended to self-insure, 

they haven't been able to meet the bills for -- for 

cancer, and the rest of us end up paying because the --

people are getting cost-free health care. And the only 

way to prevent that is to have them pay sooner rather 

than later, pay up front. 

MR. CARVIN: Yes, but my point is this: 

That, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, conflates the 

people who do result in uncompensated care, the free 

riders. Those are people who default on their health 

care payments. That is an entirely different group of 

people, an entirely different activity than being

uninsured. 

So, the question is whether or not you can 

regulate activity because it has a statistical 

connection to an activity that harms commerce. And my 

basic point to you is this: The Constitution only gives 

Congress the power to regulate things that negatively 

affect commerce or commerce regulation. It doesn't give 

them the power to regulate things that are statistically 

connected to things that negatively affect the 

commerce --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Carvin --

MR. CARVIN: -- because -- I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Please. 

MR. CARVIN: I was just going to say, 

because if they have that power, then they obviously 

have the power to regulate everything, because 

everything in the aggregate is statistically connected 

to something that negatively affects commerce, and every 

compelled purchase promotes commerce.

care market, this Court said the activity being 

regulated, i.e., violence against women, is outside the 

Commerce Clause power. So, regardless of whether it has 

beneficial downstream effects, we must say no, Congress

the harm to other people from the communicable disease 

is the result of the disease. It is not the result of 

something that the government has done, whereas here the 

reason why there's cost-shifting is because the 

government has mandated that. It has required hospitals 

to provide emergency treatment; and, instead of paying 

for that through a tax which would be borne by 

everybody, it has required -- it has set up a system in 

which the cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who 

have health insurance and who pay their bills when they 

go to the hospital. 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Alito, that is exactly 

the Government's argument. It's an extraordinarily 

illogical argument. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then if that's so, 

is it -- let me just change my example under pressure --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and say that in fact it 

turns out that 90 percent of all automobiles driving 

interstate without certain equipment put out pollution, 

which travels interstate -- not 100 percent, maybe only 

60 percent. Does the EPA have the power then to say 

you've got to have an antipollution device? It's

MR. CARVIN: What they can't do -- yes, if 

you have a car, they can require you to have an 

anti-pollution --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're -- then you're 

not going on statistics; you're going on something else, 

which is what I'd like to know what it is. 

MR. CARVIN: It's this: They can't require 

you to buy a car with an anti-pollution device. Once 

you've entered the market and made a decision, they can 

regulate the terms and conditions of the car that you 

do, and they can do it for all sorts of reasons. What 

they can't do it compel you to enter the market. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now we -- now you've 

changed the ground of argument, which I accept as 

totally legitimate. And then the question is when you 

are born and you don't have insurance and you will in 

fact get sick and you will in fact impose costs, have 

you perhaps involuntarily -- perhaps simply because you 

are a human being -- entered this particular market, 

which is a market for health care? 

MR. CARVIN: If being born is entering the 

market, then I can't think of a more plenary power 

Congress can have, because that literally means they can 

regulate every human activity from cradle to grave.

for the private insurers. There's something very odd 

about that, that the government can take over the whole 

thing and we all say, oh, yes, that's fine. But if the 

government wants to get -- to preserve private insurers, 

it can't do that. 

MR. CARVIN: Well, I don't think the test of 

a law's constitutionality is whether it more adheres to 

the libertarian principles of the Cato Institute or the 

statist principles of someone else. I think the test of 

the law is -- constitutionally is not those policy 

questions; it's whether or not the law is regulating 

things that negatively affect commerce or don't. 

And since obviously the failure to purchase 

an item doesn't create the kind of effects on supply and 

demand that the market participants in Wickard and Raich 

did and doesn't in any way interfere with regulation of 

the insurance companies, I don't think it can pass the 

basic --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought 

that Wickard was you must buy; we're not going to let 

you use the home-grown wheat. You've got to go out in 

the market and buy that wheat that you don't want.

 MR. CARVIN: Oh, but let's be careful about 

what they were regulating in Wickard, Justice Ginsburg. 

What they were regulating was the supply of wheat. It

1 didn't in any way imply that they could require every 

2 American to go out and buy wheat. And the -- yes, one 

3 of the consequences of regulating local market 

4 participants is it'll affect the supply and the demand 

for the product. That's why you can regulate them, 

6 because those local market participants have the same 

7 effect on the interstate market that a black market has 

8 on a legal market. 

9  But none of that is true -- in other words, 

you can regulate local bootleggers, but that doesn't 

11 suggest you can regulate teetotalers, people who stay 

12 out of the liquor market, because they don't have any 

13 negative effect on the existing market participants or 

14 on regulation of those market participants. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well that's why I suggested, Mr. 

16 Carvin, that it might be different if you were raising 

17 an as-applied challenge and presenting a class of people 

18 whom you could say clearly would not be in the health 

19 care market. But you're raising a facial challenge, and 

we can't really know which of the -- which of the many, 

21 many people that this law addresses in fact will not 

22 participate in the health care market and in fact will 

23 not impose costs on all the rest of us. 

24  So, the question is, can Congress respond to 

those facts, that we have no crystal ball, that we can't

tell who is and isn't going to be in the health 

insurance market, and say most of these people will be 

and most of these people will thereby impose costs on 

the rest of us and that's a problem that we can deal 

with on a class-wide basis? 

MR. CARVIN: No again. The people who 

impose the costs on the rest of us are people who engage 

in a different activity at a different time, which is 

defaulting on their health care payments. It's not the 

uninsured. Under your theory, you could regulate 

anybody if they've got a statistical connection to a 

problem. You could say, since we could regulate people 

who enter into the mortgage market and impose mortgage 

insurance on them, we can simply impose the requirement 

to buy private mortgage insurance on everybody before 

they have entered the market, because we're doing it in 

this prophylactic way before it develops. And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, that's not 

-- I don't think that's fair, because not everybody is 

going to enter the mortgage market. The Government's 

position is that almost everybody is going to enter the 

health care market.

Mr. Clement's already made, which is the health 

insurance market is different than the health care

market. But let me take it on full-stride. I think 

everybody is in the milk market. I think everybody is 

in the wheat product market. But that doesn't suggest 

that the government compel you to buy five gallons of 

meat or five bushels of wheat, because they are not 

regulating commerce. 

Whether you're a market participant or not, 

they are still requiring you to make a purchase that you 

don't want to do. 

And to get back to your facial example --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But then that's true of 

almost every product. 

MR. CARVIN: I'm sorry? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's true of almost 

every product, directly or indirectly by government 

regulation. The government says -- borrowing my 

colleague's example -- you can't buy a car without 

emission control. I don't want a car with emission 

control. It's less efficient in terms of the 

horsepower. But I'm forced to do something I don't want 

to do by government regulation. 

MR. CARVIN: You are not forced to buy a 

product you don't want. And I agree with you that since 

the government regulates all markets, there is no 

limiting principle on their compelled purchase. When

MR. CARVIN: No. I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: --unpasteurized goods, 

goods that don't have certain pesticides but have 

others. There is government compulsion in almost every 

economic decision because the government regulates so 

much. It's a condition of life that some may rail 

against, but --

MR. CARVIN: Let's think about it this way: 

Yes, when you've entered the marketplace, they can 

impose all sorts of restrictions on you, and they can 

impose, for example, all kinds of restrictions on States 

after they've enacted laws. They can wipe out the laws. 

They can condition them. 

But what can't they do? They can't compel 

States to enact laws. They can't compel States to carry 

out Federal law. And I am arguing for precisely the 

same distinction, because everyone intuitively 

understands that regulating participants after A and B 

have entered into a contract is fundamentally less 

intrusive --

because they might statistically. We let -- there's all

of agricultural farms, of all sorts of -- of activity 

that will be purely intrastate because it might affect

Sotomayor. And I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how is that 

different from saying you are self-insuring today, 

you're forgoing insurance? Why isn't that a predecessor 

to the need that you're eventually going to have? 

MR. CARVIN: The cases you referred to I 

think effectively eliminated the distinction between 

participants in the intrastate market vis-à-vis 

participants in the interstate market. None of those 

cases suggest that you can regulate people who are 

outside of the market on both an intrastate and 

interstate level by compelling them to enter into the

market. And that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what about -- you know, 

the simplest counter-example for me to suggest is you've 

undoubtedly read Judge Sutton's concurring opinion. He 

has about two pages, it seemed to me, of examples where 

everyone accepts the fact that under these kinds of 

regulations the government can compel people to buy 

things they don't otherwise want to buy. 

For example, he gives -- even in that farm 

case, the farmer was being forced to go out and buy 

grain to feed to his animals because he couldn't raise 

it at home. You know, and he goes through one example 

after another. So, what is your response to that, which 

you've read? 

MR. CARVIN: Judge Sutton is wrong in each 

and every example. There was no -- there was no 

compulsion in Raich for him to buy wheat. He could have 

gotten wheat substitutes, or he could have not sold 

wheat, which is actually what he was doing. There is a 

huge difference between conditioning regulation, i.e., 

conditioning access to the health care market and saying 

you must buy a product, and forcing you to buy a 

product.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was common ground that 

the requirement that the insurers -- what was it -- the 

community-based one, and you -- they have to insure you 

despite your health status; they can't refuse because of 

pre-existing conditions. The Government tells us and 

Congress determined that those two won't work unless 

you have a pool that will include the people who are now 

healthy. But -- so -- well, first, do you agree with 

your colleague that the community-based -- and what's 

the name that they give to the other? 

MR. CARVIN: The guaranteed issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. That that is 

legitimate Commerce Clause legislation? 

MR. CARVIN: Oh, sure. And that's why --

but we didn't –- don’t in any way impede that sort of 

regulation. These nondiscrimination regulations will 

apply to every insurance company just as Congress 

intended whether or not we buy insurance. We're not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well then, what about the 

determination that they can't possibly work if people 

don't have to buy insurance until they are -- their 

health status is such that the insurance company just 

dealt with them on its -- as it will? They'd say, I 

won't insure you because you're -- you're already sick.

8 is the Government's very illogical argument. They seem 

9 to be saying, look, we couldn't just force people to buy 

insurance to lower health insurance premiums. That 

11 would be no good. But we can do it because we've 

12 created the problem. We, Congress, have driven up the 

13 health insurance premiums, and since we've created that 

14 problem, this somehow gives us authority that we 

wouldn't otherwise have. That can't possibly be right.

MR. CARVIN: One of the more pernicious, 

misleading impressions that the government has made is 

that we are somehow advocating that people could get 

thrown out of emergency rooms or that this alternative 

that they've hypothesized is going to be enforced by 

throwing people out of emergency rooms. This 

alternative, i.e., you condition access to health care 

on buying health insurance, is enforced in precisely the 

same way that the Act does. You either buy health 

insurance or you pay a penalty of $695. You don't have 

doctors throwing people out on the street. And -- so, 

the only --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Did you say

MR. CARVIN: No. No, no. I was -- they 

create this straw man that says, look, the only 

alternative to doing it the way we've done it, if we 

condition access to health care on buying health 

insurance, the only way you can enforce that is making 

sick people not get care. I'm saying no, no. There's a

structure that's in the Act. 

There is no moral dilemma between having 

people have insurance and denying them emergency 

service. Congress has made a perfectly legitimate value 

judgment that they want to make sure that people get 

emergency care. Since the founding, whenever Congress 

has imposed that public responsibility on private 

actors, it has subsidized it from the Federal Treasury. 

It has not conscripted a subset of the citizenry and 

made them subsidize the actors who are being hurt, which 

is what they're doing here. 

They're making young, healthy people 

subsidize insurance premiums --

MR. CARVIN: -- for the cost that the 

nondiscrimination provisions have put on insurance 

premiums --

say we're going to set up a public health system, but 

you can get a tax credit if you have private health 

insurance because you won't access the public system. 

Are you taking the same position as your colleague? 

MR. CARVIN: There may have been some 

confusion in your prior colloquy. I fully agree with my 

brother Clement that a direct tax would be 

unconstitutional. I don't think he means to suggest, 

nor do I, that a tax credit that incentivizes you to buy 

insurance creates a problem. Congress incentivizes all 

kinds of activities. If they gave us a tax credit for 

buying insurance, then it would be our choice whether or 

not that makes economic sense, even though --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how is that 

different than this Act, which says if a taxpayer fails 

to meet the requirement of having minimum coverage, then 

they are responsible for paying the shared 

responsibility payment?

government set up these emergency room laws. The 

government set up Medicaid. The government set up 

Medicare. The government set up CHIP, and there are 40 

million people who don't have the private insurance. 

In that world, the government has set up 

commerce. It's all over the United States. And in that 

world, of course, the decision by the 40 million not to 

buy the insurance affects that commerce and 

substantially so. 

So, I thought the issue here is not whether 

it's a violation of some basic right or something to 

make people buy things they don't want, but simply 

whether those decisions of that group of 40 million 

people substantially affect the interstate commerce that 

has been set up in part through these other programs. 

MR. CARVIN: That's the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, that's the part of your 

argument I'm not hearing. 

MR. CARVIN: Oh, let me, please. It is 

clear that the failure to buy health insurance doesn't 

affect anyone. Defaulting on your payments to your 

health care provider does. Congress chose, for whatever 

reason, not to regulate the harmful activity of 

defaulting on your health care provider. They used the 

20 percent or whoever among the uninsured as a leverage

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree -- I agree that 

that's what's happening here. 

MR. CARVIN: Okay. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Government tells 

us that's because the insurance market is unique. And 

in the next case, it'll say the next market is unique. 

But I think it is true that if most questions in life 

are matters of degree, in the insurance and health care 

world, both markets -- stipulate two markets -- the 

young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately 

very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the 

costs of providing medical care in a way that is not 

true in other industries. 

That's my concern in the case. 

MR. CARVIN: And your -- I may be 

misunderstanding you, Justice Kennedy, and I hope I'm 

not. 

Sure, it would be perfectly fine if they 

allowed -- you do actuarial risk for young people on the 

basis of their risk for disease, just like you judge 

flood insurance on the homeowner's risk of flood. One 

of the issues here is not only that they're compelling 

us to enter into the marketplace, they're not -- they're

prohibiting us from buying the only economically 

sensible product that we would want, catastrophic 

insurance. 

Everyone agrees the only potential problem 

of the 30-year-old is he goes from the healthy 70 

percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent. 

And yet, Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying 

any kind of catastrophic health insurance. And the 

reason they do that is because they need this massive 

subsidy. 

Justice Alito, it's not our numbers. CBO 

said that injecting my clients into the risk pool lowers 

premiums by 15 to 20 percent. 

So, Justice Kennedy, even if we were going 

to create exceptions for people that are outside of 

commerce and inside of commerce, surely we'd make 

Congress do a closer nexus and say, look, we're really 

addressing this problem; we want these 30-year-olds to 

get catastrophic health insurance. And not only did 

they -- they deprived them of that option. 

And I think that illustrates the dangers of 

giving Congress these plenary powers, because they can 

always leverage them. They can always come up with some 

public policy rationale that converts the power to 

regulate commerce into the power to promote commerce,

which, as I was saying before, is the one that I think 

is plenary. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Carvin, a large part of 

this argument has concerned the question of whether 

certain kinds of people are active participants in a 

market or not active participants in a market. And your 

test, which is a test that focuses on this 

activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to 

confront that problem all the time. 

Now, if you look over the history of the 

Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of 

unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this, 

direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing. 

I think most people would say that those things didn't 

really work. And the question is why should this test, 

inactive versus active, work any better? 

MR. CARVIN: The problem you identify is 

exactly the problem you would create if you bought the 

government's bogus limiting principles. You'd have to 

draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the 

car industry and all of that, returning to the Commerce 

Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the 

1930s, where they were drawing all these kinds of 

distinctions among industries; whereas our test is 

really very simple. Are you buying the product, or is

Congress compelling you to buy the product? I can't 

think of a brighter line. 

And, again, if Congress has the power to 

compel you to buy this product, then obviously they've 

got the power to provide you -- to compel you to buy any 

product, because any purchase is going to benefit 

commerce. And this Court is never going to second-guess 

Congress's policy judgments on how important it is, this 

product versus that product. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that drawing a 

line between commerce and everything else that is not 

commerce is drawing an artificial line, like drawing a 

line between commerce and manufacturing? 

MR. CARVIN: The words "inactivity" and 

"activity" are not in the Constitution. The words 

"commerce" and "non-commerce" are. And, again, it's a 

distinction that comes, Justice Kagan, directly from the 

text of the Constitution. 

The Framers consciously gave Congress the 

ability to regulate commerce, because that's not a 

particularly threatening activity that deprives you of 

individual freedom.

 If you were required -- if you were 

authorized to require A to transfer property to B, you 

have, as the early cases put it, a monster in

legislation which is against all reason and justice, 

because everyone intuitively understands that regulating 

people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting 

terms and conditions does not create the possibility of 

Congress compelling wealth transfers among the 

citizenry. And that is precisely why the Framers denied 

them the power to compel commerce and precisely why they 

didn't give them plenary power.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

Congress confronted a grave problem when it 

enacted the Affordable Care Act: the 40 million 

Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered 

often very terrible consequences. Now, we agree, I 

think, everyone arguing this case agrees, that Congress 

could remedy that problem by imposing an insurance 

requirement at the point of sale. 

That won't work. The reason it won't work 

is because people will still show up at the hospital or

at their physician's office seeking care without 

insurance, causing the cost-shifting problem. And 

Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for 

a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic. 

Think about how much it would cost to get 

the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the 

doctor. It would be -- it would be unfathomably high. 

That will never work. Congress understood that. It 

chose the means that will work, the means that it saw 

worked in the States and -- in the State of 

Massachusetts, and that -- and that it had every reason 

to think would work on a national basis. 

That is the kind of choice of means that 

McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the 

democratically accountable branches of government. 

There is no temporal limitation in the 

Commerce Clause. Everyone subject to this regulation is 

in or will be in the health care market. They are just 

being regulated in advance. That's exactly the kind of 

thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress 

and the democratically accountable branches of 

government.

 And I think this is actually a paradigm 

example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice 

Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the

provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted 

in a manner that would allow them to be effective in 

addressing the great crises of human affairs that the 

Framers could not even envision. 

But if there's any doubt about that under 

the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold 

the -- the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of 

the taxing power. 

Under New York v. United States, this is 

precisely a parallel situation. If the Court thinks 

there's any doubt about the ability of Congress to 

impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as 

simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of 

5000A(b) seeks accomplishment. 

And the Court, as the Court said in New 

York, has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments 

of the democratically accountable branches of 

government, and because this statute can be construed in 

a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way, I 

respectfully submit that it is this Court's duty to do 

so. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 

Counsel, we'll see you tomorrow.
