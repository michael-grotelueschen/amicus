3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 12-398, Association for 

Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics. 

6  Mr. Hansen? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. HANSEN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. HANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  One way to address the question presented by 

12 this case is what exactly did Myriad invent? And the 

13 answer is nothing. 

14  Myriad unlocked the secrets of two human 

genes. These are genes that correlate with an increased 

16 risk of breast or ovarian cancer. But the genes 

17 themselves, their -- where they start and stop, what 

18 they do, what they are made of, and what happens when 

19 they go wrong are all decisions that were made by 

nature, not by Myriad. 

21  Now, Myriad deserves credit for having 

22 unlocked these secrets. Myriad does not deserve a 

23 patent for it. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hansen, Respondents 

say that isolating or extracting natural products, that

1 has long been considered patentable, and give --


2 examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine. How 


3 is this different from -- those start with natural --


4 natural products. 


MR. HANSEN: Well, in -- in essence, Your 


6 Honor, everything starts with a natural product. And 


7 this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a 


8 natural product is insufficient. For example, this 


9 Court has used the example of gold. You can't patent 


gold because it's a natural product. 

11  The examples that you cite all involve 

12 further manipulation of a product of nature, so that the 

13 product of nature is no longer what it was in nature; 

14 it's become something different. And in many instances 

has taken on a new function. 

16  But --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you dispute that 

18 you can patent, however, a process for extracting 

19 naturally-occurring things? 

MR. HANSEN: Of course. I think that is 

21 totally acceptable. And what's interesting in this case 

22 is, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is 

23 not at issue in this case. It's a process that's used 

24 by geneticists every day all over this country. It is 

routine, conventional science.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So isn't that -- why 

2 isn't that a way to, in effect, have patent protection 

3 for the product? Does somebody who wants to use the 

4 product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case, have to 

find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to 

6 have it available? 

7  MR. HANSEN: Well, the -- the process by 

8 which it's extracted is now very routine. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no -- yes, I 

know. I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this 

11 process and it leads to a -- a particular product. Does 

12 anybody who wants to use the product either have to get 

13 a license for the process or find a different way of 

14 extracting it? 

MR. HANSEN: I think they have to find a 

16 different way of extracting it, in the same way that 

17 finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to 

18 a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also 

19 entitle you to a patent on the use of gold. For 

example, if you find a new way of using gold to make 

21 earrings, or if you find a new way of using DNA to do 

22 something, you may be entitled to a patent on that 

23 because --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me why 

their test wasn't given a patent? I know the method of

1 extraction wasn't, and why. Why would the tests --

2 would the tests be subject to a patent? 

3  MR. HANSEN: The tests are also routine and 

4 conventional science, but in this particular case, there 

were some method claims that we challenged. The method 

6 claims in this case involved taking the genes that you 

7 extracted from the woman and the gene that you -- the 

8 way you think it should be, and simply looking back and 

9 forth to see if they're the same or different. And the 

Federal Circuit that -- found that that was an abstract 

11 idea and not patentable. 

12  And, in fact, that's --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm curious as to why 

14 the methodology of extracting the gene has not been 

patented. You say everybody -- everybody uses it. Why 

16 wasn't that patented? 

17  MR. HANSEN: The original -- the original 

18 methodology was patented, and is -- is patentable. In 

19 fact, if they came up with a new process, it would be 

patentable. But it has -- but that -- it has been very 

21 freely licensed. In fact, the patent may now have 

22 expired. And so it's used all over the country every 

23 day. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to -- to 

Justice Ginsburg's question because I'm -- I don't --

1 I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that. 

2  Suppose there is a substance, a -- a 

3 chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of 

4 a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered 

that this has tremendous medicinal purposes. Let's say 

6 it -- it treats breast cancer. 

7  A new discovery, a new way -- a way is 

8 found, previously unknown, to extract that. You make a 

9 drug out of that. Your answer is that cannot be 

patent -- patented, it's not eligible for patenting 

11 because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug 

12 is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of 

13 the plant. 

14  MR. HANSEN: If there is no alteration, if 

we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it 

16 and it has some additional value, then I think it is not 

17 patentable. You might be able to get a method patent on 

18 it, you might be able to get a use patent on it, but you 

19 can't get a composition patent. 

But as --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: But you're making -- you 

22 keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're 

23 intended to be. It's not just the case of taking the 

24 leaf off the tree and chewing it. Let's say if you do 

that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the

1 value of this. But it's extracted and -- and reduced to 

2 a concentrated form. That's not patent -- that's not 

3 eligible? 

4  MR. HANSEN: No, that may well be eligible 

because you have now taken what was in nature and you've 

6 transformed it in two ways. First of all, you've made 

7 it substantially more concentrated than it was in 

8 nature; and second, you've given it a function. If it 

9 doesn't work in the diluted form but does work in a 

concentrated form, you've given it a new function. And 

11 the -- by both changing its nature and by giving it a 

12 new function, you may well have patent --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, when you concede that, 

14 then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA 

here because it has a different function. Will you 

16 dispute that? Isolated DNA has a very different 

17 function from the DNA as it exists in nature. And 

18 although the chemical composition may not be different, 

19 it -- it certainly is in a different form. So what is 

the distinction? 

21  MR. HANSEN: Well, I don't think it has a 

22 new function, Your Honor, with respect. I believe that 

23 what -- Myriad has proffered essentially three functions 

24 for the DNA outside the body as opposed to inside the 

body. The first is we can look at it. And that's true, 

8

Official 

1 but that's not really a new function. That's simply the 

2 nature of when you extract something you can look at it 

3 better. 

4  The second two rationales that Myriad has 

proffered are that it can be used as probes and primers. 

6 Three of the -- three of lower court judges found that 

7 full-length DNA, which all of these patent claims 

8 include, cannot be used as probes and primers. But more 

9 important, finding a new use for a product of nature, if 

you don't change the product of nature, is not 

11 patentable. If I find a new way of taking gold and 

12 making earrings out of it, that doesn't entitle me to a 

13 patent on gold. If I find a new way of using lead, it 

14 doesn't entitle me to a new -- to a patent on lead. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: From what you know and 

16 from what the record shows, would the process of tagging 

17 the isolated DNA be patentable? The process of tagging, 

18 we just don't know about that or is there a patent on 

19 that? 

MR. HANSEN: The very patents in this case 

21 include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it 

22 can be used as a probe. We have not challenged that. 

23 We are not asking the Court to strike down that. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under our -- our law, is a 

patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but 

9

1 invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the 

2 part? 

3  MR. HANSEN: No, it is not permissible under 

4 patent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing 

construction of the -- of the claim. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you haven't 

7 challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect 

8 to the tagging? I don't quite understand. Because 

9 the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would 

fail under your argument. 

11  MR. HANSEN: Oh, I'm sorry, no. I 

12 misunderstood. The claims that we are challenging do 

13 not -- are not limited to tagging, are not limited to 

14 use as probes. There are other claims that we are not 

challenging that are limited to probes. Those would 

16 remain, but the -- but the claims that we're challenging 

17 would in fact be struck down because they're not so 

18 limited. In fact --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then -- then explain 

when you said you can't narrow. You said earlier you 

21 can't narrow. 

22  MR. HANSEN: Yes. If a claim reaches 

23 something that is both impermissible and permissible, 

24 it -- the claim is invalid, period. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right, that

Official 

1 individual claim is invalid. 

2  MR. HANSEN: That individual claim. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the patent with 

4 respect to claims that are not invalid would still 

stand. 

6  MR. HANSEN: That is correct, Your Honor. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The primers and probes 

8 stand. 

9  MR. HANSEN: Would -- would still remain. 

Even if you were to rule for Petitioners, you would not 

11 have to rule concerning the use of DNA as a probe or a 

12 primer. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hansen, could you tell 

14 me what you think the incentives are for a company to do 

what Myriad did? If you assume that it takes a lot of 

16 work and takes a lot of investment to identify this 

17 gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and 

18 what you just said is that discovering uses for that 

19 gene would not be patentable, even if those new -- even 

if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this 

21 deal? Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies 

22 like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going 

23 to do this work anymore? 

24  MR. HANSEN: Well, we know that would not 

have happened in this particular case, Your Honor. We 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 know that there were other labs looking for the BRCA 

2 genes and they had announced that they would not patent 

3 them if they were the first to find it. We also know 

4 that prior to the patent actually being issued, there 

were other labs doing BRCA testing and Myriad shut all 

6 that testing down. So we know in this particular case 

7 that problem would not have arisen. 

8  But the point of the whole -- the whole 

9 point of the product of nature doctrine is that when you 

lock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from 

11 innovating and -- and making new discoveries. It --

12 that's the reason we have the product of nature 

13 doctrine, is because there may be a million things you 

14 can do with the BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is 

allowed to look at it and that is impeding science 

16 rather than advancing science. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you still haven't 

18 answered her question. Why? Why would a company incur 

19 massive investment if it -- if it cannot patent? 

MR. HANSEN: Well, taxpayers paid for much 

21 of the investment in Myriad's work, but --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're still not answering 

23 the question. 

24  MR. HANSEN: But -- yeah. But I think 

scientists look for things for a whole variety of 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 reasons, sometimes because they're curious about the 

2 world as a whole, sometimes because --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Curiosity is your answer. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you were going 

to --

6  MR. HANSEN: Sometimes because they want a 

7 Nobel Prize. Sometimes --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you were going to 

9 say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped 

you were going to say something else, which is that, 

11 notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this 

12 gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various 

13 things that you could get a patent on that would make 

14 this kind of investment worthwhile, in the usual case. 

But if that's the case, I want to know what those things 

16 are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're 

17 supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel 

18 Prizes. 

19  And I agree that there are those scientists, 

but there are also, you know, companies that do 

21 investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't 

22 just shut them down. 

23  MR. HANSEN: Let me give a specific example 

24 that may be helpful in doing a better job of answering 

the question. One of the -- one of the amici has 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 worried a lot about whether a decision for the 


2 Petitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant 


3 DNA. Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major 


4 innovations in industry are doing these days. It's 


DNA where the scientist decides the sequence rather than 

6 nature deciding the sequence. 

7  There is nothing in our position that would 

8 prevent recombinant DNA from being patented, but there 

9 is -- it is the cases that if the patents are upheld, 

recombinant DNA is frustrated. 

11  People can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to 

12 recombine them and find new treatments and find new 

13 diagnoses and find new things that will advance medicine 

14 and science as a result of these patents. It's a 

perfect example of what the point of the product of 

16 nature doctrine is. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But, of course, to 

18 profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to 

19 not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do 

something with it afterwards. So you really haven't 

21 given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the 

22 gene. 

23  MR. HANSEN: Well --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, sure, yes, I can do 

stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else.

1 What advantage do I get from being the person that or 

2 the company that isolated that -- that gene. You say 

3 none at all. 

4  MR. HANSEN: No, I think you get enormous 

recognition, but I don't think --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's lovely. 

7  MR. HANSEN: But I think that we know that 

8 that's sufficient. We know it's sufficient with respect 

9 to these two genes. We also know it's sufficient with 

respect to the human genome project. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure the 

12 Court can decide the case on -- on that basis. I'm sure 

13 that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief 

14 that this investment is necessary and that -- and that 

makes sense. To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do 

16 it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer. 

17  As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions 

18 indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are 

19 process patents that they can have, that this is 

sufficient. 

21  MR. HANSEN: And that's certainly true. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I just don't 

23 think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't 

24 worry about investment, it'll come. I -- I just don't 

think we can do that. It may be that the law allows you

1 to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature 

2 and there's nothing new here, but that's quite 

3 different. 

4  MR. HANSEN: And it is certainly true, as 

Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is 

6 a process patent or a development patent. If you -- if 

7 you've isolated the gene and you find a new use for it, 

8 you could get a patent on the new use for the patent. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the whole point, 

isn't it? The isolation itself is not valuable, it's 

11 the use you put the isolation to. That's the answer, 

12 isn't it? 

13  MR. HANSEN: That's exactly correct. Thank 

14 you. Yes, that is the answer. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so that is the 

16 answer, which is in isolation it has no value. It's 

17 just nature sitting there. 

18  MR. HANSEN: Interestingly, it has one 

19 value. And that is you can look at it to see if there's 

a mutation in it. And when you find a mutation in the 

21 isolated gene, you write back to the woman who provided 

22 the sample and you say to her because the isolated gene 

23 is the same as the gene in your body, I can tell you 

24 that there's a mutation in your body. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a failure of the

25

Official 

1 patent law. It doesn't patent ideas. 

2  MR. HANSEN: And it shouldn't patent ideas, 

3 and -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene 

4 and the gene in the body are the same. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go to -- can we 

6 go to cDNA a moment? 

7  MR. HANSEN: Sure. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is artificially 

9 created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature. 

It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in 

11 nature. And yet you claim that can't be patented. The 

12 introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and 

13 they're sequenced together. Give me your argument on 

14 that. I read your brief, but it is not a product of 

nature, it's a product of human invention. 

16  MR. HANSEN: There are two big differences 

17 between cDNA and DNA. The first is exactly the one Your 

18 Honor just discussed, which is that the introns, the 

19 noncoding regions, have been removed. That is done in 

the body, by the body. That's done in the process of 

21 DNA going to mRNA. 

22  What the scientist does who's creating the 

23 cDNA is they take the mRNA out of the body and then they 

24 simply have the natural nature-driven nucleotide binding 

processes complement the mRNA. So that if the mRNA has

1 a C, the scientist just puts a -- the corresponding 

2 nucleotide in there and nature causes them to bind up. 

3 The scientist does not decide --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I don't see the 

answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it 

6 correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA 

7 does not have the same base pairs. There's a U or 

8 something instead of an A or whatever it is. 

9  MR. HANSEN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So when you actually look, 

11 if you could get a super-microscope and look at what 

12 they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would 

13 discover something with an A, not a U. Is it AU? Is 

14 that the one? 

MR. HANSEN: Yes. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. So -- so you 

17 would discover something with an A there, you see, and 

18 you wouldn't discover something with a U there. And 

19 there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG, 

whatever, okay? It's not there. That's not truly 

21 isolated DNA. But you can go look up the Amazon, 

22 wherever you want. Hence the question. Now, on that 

23 one, how? How is that found in nature? The answer is 

24 it isn't. 

MR. HANSEN: Well, but I would suggest, Your

Official 

1 Honor, that the question is not whether it is identical 

2 to something in nature. The question is whether there 

3 was a human invention involved, whether it is markedly 

4 different from what is found in nature. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that goes to 

6 obviousness. That does not in my mind go to the issue 

7 of whether it's patent eligible. You may have a very 

8 strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not --

9 it's creating something that's not found in nature at 

all. 

11  MR. HANSEN: The sequence of the nucleotides 

12 is dictated by nature. The order that they go in is 

13 dictated by nature. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a separate 

question --

16  MR. HANSEN: It is true --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- about whether this 

18 claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15 

19 nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly. But

21 not the small snippet that they want to capture the

1 order are found in nature, and the question is whether 

2 when the body removes the introns, has the body made 

3 something markedly different than what is in nature, and 

4 it is our view --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: When I first looked at 

6 this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind 

7 of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't. But my 

8 understanding is that it may have a functionality that 

9 the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et 

cetera. That may be incorrect for the record, but that 

11 was my present understanding. 

12  MR. HANSEN: It is somewhat easier to work 

13 with cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant 

14 DNA that is the place where all of the innovation and 

all the efforts are taking place. And if we lock up --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is all the tagging done on 

17 recombinant DNA? 

18  MR. HANSEN: All of the change -- all of the 

19 useful things that we are inventing is done -- is done 

through the process of recombinant DNA. And if we lock 

21 up the cDNA, it makes it harder to do the recombinant 

22 DNA. So that if someone owns all the cDNA, I can't do 

23 recombinant DNA using what the company owns.

4 involving manipulation? 

MR. HANSEN: It certainly -- there's --

6 there is some manipulation, although it's -- it's 

7 letting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the 

8 scientist manipulating. But it -- what the other factor 

9 that distinguishes aspirin and the other examples you 

use from cDNA is that they have -- the alteration of the 

11 substance has also altered the function, and cDNA has 

12 exactly the same function as DNA with the exception of 

13 Justice Kennedy's, that it's easier to use with. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- you've really 

lost me when you say that it's nature that does the 

16 alteration rather than the scientist. I mean, whenever 

17 a scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by 

18 some force of nature. 

19  MR. HANSEN: No --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, he doesn't do it 

21 unnaturally, does he? I mean, there's some --

22  MR. HANSEN: Well, let me try an analogy, 

23 Your Honor, that might be helpful. In our view, it's 

24 like Funk Brothers in the sense that the five bacteria 

in Funk Brothers didn't sit together in nature.

12 Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason 

13 is because of the nature of the claim. Okay, I look at 

14 their claim. Their claim says they want, "the isolated 

DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide 

16 sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1." 

17  Then we turn to that and the first thing it 

18 says right there is it says, "The molecule involved 

19 is" -- "Molecule type: cDNA." And then it has a long 

list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay. 

21  So molecule type, cDNA. So they say what do 

22 you mean they aren't claiming cDNA? That's what they 

23 say they're claiming.

4 makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as 

well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under 

6 claim 2?

16 to know is there anything else I should read? 

17  MR. HANSEN: Yes. The other support for it 

18 is the definition of the DNA in the patent itself, which 

19 we cite, which says that whenever we use the term "DNA" 

we mean both.

1  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

2  FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

3  SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

6  Enforcing the distinction between human 

7 invention and a product of nature preserves a necessary 

8 balance in the patent system between encouraging 

9 individual inventors and keeping the basic building 

blocks of innovation free for all to use. Isolated DNA 

11 falls on the ineligible side of that divide because it 

12 is simply native DNA extracted from the body. The claim 

13 that it is a --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are we fighting over 

nothing? Are you fighting over nothing? If -- if they 

16 can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it 

17 matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on 

18 the cDNA to be effective? 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: I actually think that --

I think we're -- we're fighting about something of 

21 importance. That question gets right to it. I want to 

22 answer the question directly, Your Honor. I'd like to 

23 make a prefatory point before doing so. 

24  The claim that isolated DNA is a human 

invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no

1 longer connected at the molecular level to what 


2 surrounded it in the body. But allowing a patent on 


3 that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from 


4 using the gene itself for any medical or scientific 


purpose. That is not true about a patent on cDNA. A 


6 patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for 


7 other scientists and other -- and others in the medical 


8 profession to try to generate new uses. 


9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen 


just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to 

11 use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated 

12 DNA. Do you disagree with that? 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's not my 

14 understanding, Justice Kagan. My understanding is that 

you -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant 

16 DNA without the step of cDNA. We do think cDNA is 

17 important and the position of the United States is that 

18 cDNA is patent eligible. We disagree --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose his 

understanding is correct. Suppose your 

21 misunderstanding -- suppose your understanding is not 

22 correct. 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: Our position, though, is 

24 that cDNA is patent eligible because we don't -- we think,

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mister -- General 

4 Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief 

that your view was that, although the cDNA may be 

6 patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's true now, Justice 

8 Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that 

9 the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not 

have been true at the time the patents were initially 

11 issued. And --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I -- I thought 

14 the basic general approach here was we have a very 

expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we 

16 narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness 

17 and so on. Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to 

18 address the questions at issue here in the obviousness 

19 realm? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's a little --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you got something 

22 that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could 

23 take a smaller part of it. That the idea -- a smaller 

24 part of something that's bigger is obvious. Now, yes, 

you can have a patent on the process of extracting that

1 small part, but I don't understand how a small part of 

2 something bigger isn't obvious. And if it is, I don't 

3 understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at 

4 that stage. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think my answer 

6 to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first 

7 to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the 

8 threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility 

9 does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty 

test and a specification test do not do, and the work 

11 that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to 

12 ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature 

13 itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly 

14 because if it can be deemed to be a human invention 

solely as a result of the change that occurs when you 

16 extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a 

17 practical matter that you have granted a patent on the 

18 gene itself because no one else can extract it because 

19 extracting it is isolating it, isolating it violates the 

patent. 

21  And so as a result of that, no one else can 

22 try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one 

23 else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not sure 

that's responsive to my concern. Your answer said well,

1 here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent 

2 protection. My question goes to whether we ought to 

3 focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at 

4 the obviousness stage. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the Court 


6 identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo 


7 that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that 


8 question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the 


9 eligibility stage because the -- because getting the 


balance right is of critical importance. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the issue here is a 

12 very difficult one. It's one on which the government 

13 has changed its position, isn't that correct? 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE ALITO: It seems that there is 

16 disagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This 

17 case has been structured in an effort to get us to 

18 decide this on the broadest possible ground, that 

19 there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not 

about any other provision of the Patent Act. 

21  Why -- why should we -- why should we do 

22 that? We have claims that if patent eligibility is 

23 denied here it will prevent investments that are 

24 necessary for the development of new drugs or it will 

lead those who develop the new drugs to -- new

1 diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not 

2 disclose them to the public. Why -- why should we jump 

3 in and -- and decide the broadest possible question? 

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I would -- again, I 

would point the Court to what the Court said last term 

6 in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent 

7 eligibility really is a double-edged sword. 

8  And it may be that in a -- in a particular 

9 case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a 

view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the 

11 other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and 

12 the proposition of whether you can patent the gene 

13 itself is a question we think of fundamental importance, 

14 and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that 

led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo. And Mayo 

16 was a situation very much -- I'm sorry. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, there's 

18 an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United 

19 States would be in a singular position. That is, they 

suggest that in every other industrialized nation this 

21 could be subject -- could be patentable. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, and that --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so? 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I think the picture 

is much more complicated than that. In many other

Official 

1 nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is 

2 different from nation to nation. 

3  I'll give one example I think helps 

4 illustrate the point. In Germany and France, for 

example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA, 

6 but only for a particular use. So you would get what is 

7 the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that 

8 we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too. 

9  If you -- just as with the question that 

Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a 

11 useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you 

12 isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects, 

13 you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you 

14 can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that 

no one else can explore it for different uses and for --

16 and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to 

17 recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more 

18 therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance. And 

19 that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand why you are 

21 saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter. I am 

22 looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it 

23 says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides 

24 long or longer. The reality is that 15 nucleotides 

doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between

1 exons. It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more 

2 sequences long. So are you arguing that this claim as 

3 written is sustainable? 

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, as a -- I am 

going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this 

6 situation. I think that's a fight between the parties. 

7 The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual 

8 matter cDNA is patent eligible. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are not taking 

the position that this claim as written is patentable? 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's right, Your Honor. 

12 We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think 

13 cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial 

14 creation, it's as a general matter patent eligible. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because as I understand 

16 it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature. 

17 They get reproduced in that sequence of 15. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that may well be 

19 right, Your Honor. As I said, we're not taking a 

position on the particulars. 

21  But if I -- just to return to the point that 

22 Justice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a 

23 similar situation in Mayo. On the one side you had 

24 the -- the industry coming in and saying, look, we have 

got a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than 

31

1 150,000 patents here. You are going to really disrupt 

2 those reliance issues. On the other side you had the 

3 American Medical Association, as you have here, coming 

4 in and saying, actually, these patents inhibit much more 

innovation than they incent. 

6  And what the Court said is that -- as 

7 Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not 

8 in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively. It 

9 doesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it. 

But what the Court is in a position to do is to apply 

11 the general principles of law as they were articulated 

12 in Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular 

13 different set of rules for the biotech industry, 

14 Congress can provide that different set of rules. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli, could 

16 I understand what you said because I think it might be a 

17 little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want to 

18 understand your position. You said that a company can't 

19 get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on the 

uses. So if I find this plant, let's say, in the Amazon 

21 and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but can I 

22 get a patent when I discover that if you eat this plant 

23 it has therapeutic effects?

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I have a sort of 

analytical problem. I find it very, very difficult to 

6 conceive how you can patent a sequential numbering

8 in thinking that someone could get a patent on the 

9 computer binary code merely because they throw a certain 

number of things on a piece of paper in a certain order.

7 number 1 is the, as Justice Breyer understood, the cDNA 

8 molecule. 

9  When you look at those particular sequences, 

there was invention in the decision of where to begin 

11 the gene and where to end the gene. That was not given

briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the 

6 chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and 

7 it's attached to two ends. 

8  But also in the body, perhaps because cells 

9 die, there is isolated DNA. And that means that the DNA

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice? 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to 

7 your baseball bat example? 

8  MR. CASTANIAS: Sure. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding --

my understanding is that here, what's involved, 

11 obviously through scientific processes, but we're not 

12 talking about process. Here, what's involved is 

13 snipping. You've got the thing there and you snip --

14 snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there 

you've got it. 

16  The baseball bat is quite different. You 

17 don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch 

18 here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a 

19 baseball bat. You have to invent it, if you will. You 

don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of 

21 the strand, you just have to cut it off. 

22  MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I guess I'll even 

23 take issue with that because the -- the story of how the 

24 SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about is 

exactly the opposite of that. If you look, for example,

1 at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the 

2 declaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shattuck, at 

3 paragraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the 

4 Myriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree 

at least on that score with the Solicitor General, is 

6 indeed eligible for patenting. But then -- and by the 

7 way, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different 

8 patient samples to create what was called a consensus 

9 sequence. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. You've got 

11 the cDNA. 

12  MR. CASTANIAS: And then what the -- what 

13 the Myriad inventors then did to create what is called 

14 SEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the 

'282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that 

16 further to add in the introns. It was in -- actually, 

17 the inventive process was additive. 

18  Now, ultimately, again, going back to the 

19 last sentence of section 103, the patentability should 

not be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an 

21 invention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter. But it 

22 is a --

particular -- where you snip. We're talking about 

6 though the patentability of what's left --

7  MR. CASTANIAS: Right. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- after you've 

9 snipped it. 

MR. CASTANIAS: And -- and that is indeed a 

11 product of human ingenuity and that has substantial new 

12 uses. Now, my friends on the other side have said --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Castanias, go back to 

14 Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right because it 

takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually 

16 find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a 

17 lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on 

18 the genetic material. 

19  But are you -- are you saying that you could 

patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a 

21 lot of ingenuity to find it? 

22  MR. CASTANIAS: The plant itself, I think

13 the plant and uproot it, all right?

haven't done is isolated a new thing. All I have done 

21 is isolate the plant from the forest. And that's the

1 body here is fundamentally different in kind from what 

2 was in -- what is in the body. The most important 

3 reason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used 

4 in the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian 

cancers. 


6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the plant in the 


7 forest can't be used for any purpose either. It only 


8 has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's 


9 uprooted and taken out of the forest. But it's still 


the same thing. And I guess what you haven't gotten me 

11 to understand is how this is different than that. It's 

12 still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it, 

13 it in fact has lots of great uses. 

14  MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think there are two 

ways -- two ways to look at that. 

16  First of all, if you want to look at it from 

17 the -- the perspective of the so-called product of 

18 nature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous 

19 consequences if it's not cabined and understood 

correctly. But if you look at it strictly from a 

21 product of nature doctrine, you could say, well, that's 

22 the same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative 

23 history of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are 

24 unmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for 

patents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and

1 genetics and that sort of thing. 

2  But the product of nature doctrine is 

3 troublesome for this reason, modern medicine -- go 

4 beyond just the isolated DNA patents here. Modern 

medicine, particularly the area of personalized 

6 medicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are 

7 administering to individual patients is giving them the 

8 opportunity to mimic the actions of the body. And -- so 

9 actually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to 

nature, rather than farther away. And anything that 

11 takes the product of nature doctrine beyond the simple 

12 truism that the product of nature is something that is 

13 not a human invention, then that's very dangerous, not 

14 just for our case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But when you -- when you 

16 isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as 

17 a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals 

18 that make it probe. 

19  MR. CASTANIAS: As a probe, that's true. As 

a primer, that wouldn't be required. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seemed to me your --

22 your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well, 

23 it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer. 

24 Neither can the isolate without some additions.

patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point 


6 of Justice Kagan's question. 


7  MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I will say that 


8 that is the final inventive act. It's not the only 


9 inventive act. It's the final inventive act. If -- if 


indeed you were creating it --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you concede -- Do you 

12 concede at least that the decision in the Federal Circuit, 

13 that Judge Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is 

14 the Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too? 

That is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments 

16 did not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that 

17 wrong. 

18  MR. CASTANIAS: No, what -- I think 

19 Justice -- Judge Lourie was exactly correct to say that 

there is nothing in this record that says that isolated 

21 DNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body. Neither does 

22 Dr. Lander's brief, for that matter. And for that 

23 matter, those isolated fragments that are discussed in

3  JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't this just a 


4 question of probability? To get back to your baseball 


bat example, which at least I -- I can understand better 

6 than perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that 

7 in, you know, I don't know how many millions of years 

8 trees have been around, but in all of that time possibly 

9 someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen 

into the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves, 

11 and then something's been washed up on the shore, and 

12 what do you know, it's a baseball bat. 

13  Is that --

14  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- is that what Dr. Lander 

16 is talking about? 

17  MR. CASTANIAS: That's pretty much the same 

18 as what he's talking about, is that there might be 

19 something that was out there somewhere. But -- but 

that's really -- the search for this sort of thing that 

21 might be very similar to the thing but never was known 

22 before. The patent law has taught -- the patent law is 

23 all about pushing the frontiers. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. When you are 

on that, that's good. A more basic question to me is

1 when you use the word "dangerous." I had thought -- and 

2 you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the 

3 patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on 

4 the one hand, we do want people to invent. On the other 

hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind 

6 of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself 

7 could be used for further advance. 

8  And so that the compromise that has been 

9 built historically into this area is, of course, if you 

get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the 

11 plant in the Amazon, patented. Of course, if you get 

12 the sap out and you find that you can use it, you 

13 manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use 

14 it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented. But what you 

can't patent is the sap itself. 

16  Now, in any individual case that might be 

17 unfortunate or fortunate. But consider it in the mine 

18 run of things. It's important to keep products of 

19 nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, 

so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers 

21 50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers 

22 them, although that expedition was expensive, although 

23 nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the 

24 thing itself. He gets a patent on the process, on the 

use of the thing, but not the thing itself.

1  Now, that's my understanding of what I'd 


2 call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably 


3 understand better than I. 


4  MR. CASTANIAS: Well --


JUSTICE BREYER: And I would like you to 

6 express your view on that because that's the framework 

7 that I am bringing to the case. 

8  MR. CASTANIAS: I -- I will offer the view, 

9 Justice Breyer. 

First of all, in this Court's decision in 

11 Brenner v. Manson, followed repeatedly by the Federal 

12 Circuit, it has been hornbook patent law, to use your 

13 term, that you do not need to -- to call out the utility 

14 of an invention in a particular claim. What you do have 

to do is have utility for the invention itself described 

16 in the specification. 

17  And that's what the Patent Office looked to 

18 in its Utility Guidelines in 2001. But ultimately, 

19 neither -- I think this case is very -- very easily 

decided on a straightforward ground that does not 

21 require the Court to go making fine distinctions between 

22 cDNA and DNA. 

23  And that ground is this: The reasoned 

24 Utility Guidelines issued in 2001 by the Patent Office, 

who has not, in a very significant decision, joined the

1 brief of the Solicitor General in this case -- and which 

2 they continue to apply under Section 2107 of the Manual 

3 of Patent Examining Procedure, this -- these guidelines 

4 not only tell examiners what to do, but in the Federal 

Register they had notice and comment and 23 specific 

6 reasoned, supported by case law, supported by science, 

7 responses to the objectors. Almost every objection that 

8 is made to our patents here was made there and answered 

9 there. 

The PTO issued those guidelines to the 

11 public. They have been relied on now for 12 years, and 

12 they confirm a practice that has been in place much 

13 longer than that. And if you take -- whether you can 

14 call it Skidmore deference or just giving respect to 

the agency that sits at the intersection of law and 

16 science -- Justice Breyer, as your opinion for the Court 

17 in Dickinson v. Zurko pointed out -- those -- that 

18 decision by the Patent Office is entitled to respect, 

19 the reliance that has been placed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even 

21 though the government has disavowed it, even though the 

22 government, representing the United States --

23  MR. CASTANIAS: Even though, and -- and the

2  MR. CASTANIAS: I think you can dilute it a 

3 little bit, but you can't take away the fact that it is 

4 a 30-plus year practice that the Patent Office, despite 

the executive's position in this Court and in the 

6 Federal Circuit, continues to follow. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Castanias, could I take 

8 you away from the deference point and just ask again 

9 about the -- the kind of law that you would have us 

make. Do you think that the first person who isolated 

11 chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that? 

12  MR. CASTANIAS: I think in theory that is 

13 possible, but I should say this because this case is 

14 about Section 101, I'm trying -- I'm answering your 

question as though it's about 101, patent eligibility. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. 

17  MR. CASTANIAS: Would it be obvious, would 

18 it be novel? I'm not sure. Those are different --

19 those are different analytical structures. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. 

21  MR. CASTANIAS: But would it -- and I think 

22 really, the -- the statute does the work here. It is 

23 new and useful composition of matter --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, because --

3 because, like Justice Breyer, I consider uses -- patents 

4 on uses in a different category. 

So I'm just asking, could you patent the 

6 isolated chromosome? 

7  MR. CASTANIAS: Again, I -- I perhaps am not 

8 making myself as clear as I should. In Section 101, a 

9 patent claim must be shown to be useful. And that --

that is a utility that it has to be shown --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Chromosomes are very 

12 useful. 

13  MR. CASTANIAS: -- in any case. 

14  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: The first person who found a 

16 chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that 

17 that was a very useful discovery. 

18  And the question is, can you then -- can the 

19 person who found that chromosome and isolated it from 

the body, could they have gone to the PTO? 

21  MR. CASTANIAS: If they -- if --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: And the PTO seems very 

23 patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they 

24 have had a good patentability argument?

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, of course it does. 


MR. CASTANIAS: -- diagnostic way in the way 

6 that we're talking about here, then yes, it would pass 

7 through the Section 101 gate. Whether it would pass 

8 through the Section 102 gate or the 103 gate, I don't 

9 have any opinion on. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Would -- would -- okay. 

11  MR. CASTANIAS: And then there's the 

12 further --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's interesting --

14  MR. CASTANIAS: Sure. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because then it's not a 

16 question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds 

17 or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about. Right? 

18  So you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not 

19 the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you 

know, we could just go up from there and talk about all 

21 kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we? Couldn't 

22 we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?

1 what you're doing. That's very, very interesting. 

2 Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything 

3 under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've 

4 rejected more often than we've followed it. 

And particularly with a thing found in 

6 nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just --

7 human kidneys and so forth. Everything is inside 

8 something else. Plants, rocks, whatever you want. And 

9 so everything will involve your vast taking something 

out of some other thing where it is, if only the 

11 environment. And it's at that point that I look for 

12 some other test than just that it was found within some 

13 other thing. 

14  MR. CASTANIAS: And I think, Justice Breyer, 

there is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you 

16 about the different functions, the different values. If 

17 you think about patents as economic instruments, the 

18 different economic values that come out of this, the 

19 different things that patients now have as a result of 

this human ingenuity, they didn't have the BRCA1 

21 isolated gene before the Myriad invention. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we could have said 

23 that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the 

24 choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the 

patent was that we have a uniform rule for all

1 industries. 

2  MR. CASTANIAS: Right, but in --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and that avoids 

4 giving special industries special subsidies, which is 

very important it seems to me. 

6  Let me ask you this, and it's consistent 

7 with my -- my preface. If we were to accept the 

8 government's position that the DNA is not patentable but 

9 the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient 

protection for innovation and research? And if not, why 

11 not? 

12  MR. CASTANIAS: The -- the problem of making 

13 that decision now is that so much has happened since 

14 these gene patents issued and since the Utility 

Guidelines. I can't tell you for a certainty whether it 

16 will hurt the industry as a general matter to not have 

17 isolated gene but only have cDNA patents. 

18  But here's what I think it will hurt, and I 

19 think it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this 

Court comes out of this case with. Because what you 

21 will then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is 

22 to draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between, 

23 well, how much more manipulation. 

24  My friend on the other side used the term, 

in response to Justice Ginsburg, "further manipulation

1 is required to take it out of the product of nature." 

2 He -- he said no alteration, to Justice Alito, would 

3 make it a product of nature. But there's no dispute in 

4 this case that there has been some alteration of the 

isolated DNA molecules. 

6  And that brings me back to the Utility 

7 Guidelines. This line was drawn. It was drawn by an 

8 expert agency that sits at the intersection of law and 

9 science, and it has said, without any apparent -- other 

than the declarations and amicus briefs that have been 

11 put into this case -- without any apparent effect on the 

12 explosion in biotechnology and the successful, 

13 economically successful, technologically successful, and 

14 life-saving industry that is at the heart of these 

inventions. 

16  That has not -- those -- that parade of 

17 horribles has not happened. And you don't have to 

18 hypothesize at this point because you've got all of 

19 these years of experience between the time these patents 

issued and the time that this -- this challenge 

21 belatedly came along. 

22  Justice Breyer, a point about no 

23 impermissible preemption before I sit down. Your 

24 opinion for the Court in Mayo made that very much an 

important point, but I think what you -- what is 

59

Official 

1 important to understand here is that these patent claims 

2 aren't for methods. They don't prevent -- present that 

3 problem that the Court identified in that argument and 

4 in the argument in Bilski. These are for specific 

molecules that exist in the physical world. That --

6 that concern that is present with method claims is not 

7 here, these patents cover -- these patent claims cover 

8 only what is claimed and no more. 

9  There is no risk of a natural law or a 

physical phenomenon like energy or electricity, neither 

11 of which falls within the statutory categories. There 

12 is no risk of anything being preempted other than what 

13 the claims properly claim, which are human-made 

14 inventions of isolated molecules. 

And I think one last point to close on. 

16 It's important to note that molecules have been patented 

17 for a very long time. That's what drugs are. And drugs 

18 are often made by taking one molecule and another 

19 molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a 

test tube, which is a very common thing, its reactions 

21 have been around 100 years just like snipping has been, 

22 but they make something new and useful and life saving 

23 from that. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

how this is at all like that because there you're

6  MR. CASTANIAS: Well, again, 

7 Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I -- the discussion we had 

8 earlier, the -- in -- in fact, the sequence that's 

9 claimed in Claim 1 of the '282 patent was not created by 

snipping. If I can just conclude with one more 

11 sentence? 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 

13  MR. CASTANIAS: Only once it was created can 

14 a scientist ever know how and where to make the decision 

to snip. 

16  Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HANSEN 

21  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

22  MR. HANSEN: Thank you, Your Honor. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there some value to 

24 us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA? 

If we were to do what the government is proposing in

Official 

1 this case, what's the consequences? 

2  MR. HANSEN: Of -- of course there would be 

3 value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it 

4 reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more 

importantly, the effect of the patents in this case 

6 allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the 

7 human body. If you uphold the patents in this case, 

8 Myriad can -- has the authority given it by the 

9 government to stop anyone from doing research on a piece 

of the human body. That would be a significant advance, 

11 if you were to -- to make it clear that was 

12 impermissible. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, how do you 

14 understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA? 

I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into 

16 cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with 

17 the description of that claim because it included 15 

18 nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says 

19 reoccur in nature. 

MR. HANSEN: Well, and yes, I -- I agree, 

21 Your Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6, 

22 which are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or 

23 longer. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I'm making your job 

harder. How could they write it to do what he thinks

1 would be patentable? 

2  MR. HANSEN: Well, all --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So assuming we believe 

4 that there is some human invention in this process, 

whether it's obvious or not, separate question. But 

6 he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature 

7 naturally. 

8  So make that assumption. Make the 

9 assumption that they can make a claim for it. How do we 

avoid his problem? 

11  MR. HANSEN: Well --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you are helping 

13 your adversary by answering this question. 

14  MR. HANSEN: That's fine, Your Honor. I 

think that the -- all of the claims in this case, all 

16 nine claims that we are challenging include both 

17 fragments and the whole gene. So I don't think there is 

18 anything you can do with respect to these nine claims. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am putting that aside. 

MR. HANSEN: I think by saying that when 

21 genes are transformed in such a way that the scientist 

22 decides their sequence rather than the nature deciding 

23 their sequence --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only if they do a 

recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.

1  MR. HANSEN: Right, right. Now I don't 

2 think cDNA is recombinant DNA, that's what we've argued, 

3 but that's -- that's at least one plausible way of 

4 looking at it. 

The genes in this case, the patents on the 

6 genes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman, 

7 and child in the United States. And as I just said, it 

8 gives the -- the government has given Myriad the 

9 authority to stop research on every one of our genes. 

That simply can't be right. 

11  And I would like to make one other point 

12 with respect to Dr. Lander's brief. On page 16 of Dr. 

13 Lander's brief he discusses specifically that the BRCA 

14 genes appear in the body with covalent bonds in 

fragments. There isn't any real -- there isn't any 

16 scientific dispute about that fact. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you take 

18 another minute. You weren't afforded an opportunity to 

19 use the time you were reserved. 

MR. HANSEN: Well, I guess the only other 

21 thing I would say then, Your Honor, is to respond to 

22 what I may have left a misimpression with Justice 

23 Kagan's questions. We agree that you could get a patent 

24 on a use of the leaf that is pulled out of the Amazon or 

a plant that is pulled out of the Amazon. We don't

2 the thing -- the plant itself just because you pulled it 

3 out of the ground and took it to the United States.
