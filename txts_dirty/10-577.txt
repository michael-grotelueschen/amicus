3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 10-577, Kawashima v. Holder.

 Mr. Whalen. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8  MR. WHALEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 Mr. and Mrs. Kawashima came here to the 

11 United States as legal immigrants in 1985. And later 

12 on, they pled guilty to filing a false statement under a 

13 corporate tax return. The issue we bring to the Court 

14 is whether that conviction under 26 U.S.C. 7206 is an 

aggravated felony, specifically under (M)(i) of the 

16 aggravated felony statute. 

17  This Court many times has held that it is 

18 the elements of the crime of conviction that determine 

19 whether a crime is an aggravated felony. And the 

elements of 7206 do not change when they go over to the 

21 immigration statute. And the terms of that statute is 

22 basically as the Department of Justice has written in 

23 its Tax Manual. It is basically a tax perjury statute. 

24 If you don't tell the truth, and you know what you're 

saying is false, and you do it under oath, that's 

3

1 perjury. 

2  There are other statutes, perjury statute, 

3 which in essence says the same thing. And 18 U.S.C. 

4 1001 is also a perjury statute. And none of them 

require the Justice Department or a court to determine 

6 whether fraud and deceit was an element of that crime. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: How would you prove fraud 

8 and deceit beyond proving that the person lied, 

9 intentionally lied? What -- what is added to 

intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or 

11 deceit? 

12  MR. WHALEN: It's the intention to deceive 

13 or the intention to defraud. And simply --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't intentionally 

lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive? 

16  MR. WHALEN: It does not, Your Honor. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't? 

18  MR. WHALEN: It does not mean, because you 

19 are saying a false -- making a false statement, that 

that is evidence of an intent to deceive. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Whalen, the common 

22 definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a 

23 false impression, intentionally giving a false 

24 impression with the intent that someone will act on it. 

So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return 

4

1 is. You give a false impression of what your income is 

2 with the intent that the IRS will accept it. 

3  MR. WHALEN: Justice Ginsburg, the 

4 difference I'm trying to ask the Court to consider, it 

is the intent which is an element of fraud and deceit. 

6 Under section 7201, the tax evasion statute, that 

7 includes both a requirement or a finding of fraud and 

8 deceit. Section 7206 does not. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why isn't it obvious? 

What proof would you need? You submit a document 

11 because you want to convey a false impression for 

12 someone to act on. Why do you have to have anything 

13 more than that to establish deceit? 

14  MR. WHALEN: Because the requirements, Your 

Honor, of 7206 is a finding of -- of simply making a 

16 false statement. That's all that's required. The IRS, 

17 when they go after a taxpayer because they have not 

18 provided -- they have not disclosed all of their income, 

19 the IRS comes in, or rather the Department of Justice, 

and all they have to prove is that it's false. They 

21 don't have to prove --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that it's willful. 

23 And that it's willful. 

24  MR. WHALEN: Pardon me, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That it's willful.

2  MR. WHALEN: Yes, Your Honor, but as this
 

3 Court held --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it's not correct.


 MR. WHALEN: No, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, correct me if I'm 

7 wrong. It would seem to me, just from reading the 

8 statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think 

9 it's true but it's false, from the way you were 

indicating, would be a violation. That's not the way I 

11 read it. Now, have we said something other than that in 

12 later cases? 

13  MR. WHALEN: If I may, Your Honor. This 

14 Court has written in the Spies case, and specifically in 

the Bishop case, that in order to be convicted of any 

16 tax offense under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS or 

17 the Department of Justice must show it was done 

18 willfully. Willfully is not intrinsic to any -- it's 

19 really intrinsic to all of the tax offenses. 

"Willfully" does not mean deceit or fraud. It simply 

21 means that the IRS cannot bring a criminal information 

22 or indictment against somebody who does something 

23 unintentionally. They must do it willfully. 

24 "Willfully," as this Court defined in Bishop, is simply 

evidence that -- to commit any of these IRS crimes you

1 must -- it must be shown to have been done willfully. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: You must know that it's 

3 false when you say it. Isn't that what "willfully" 

4 means? You must know that the statement you're making 

is false. 

6  MR. WHALEN: "Willfully" means 

7 intentionally. The false, I submit --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want another 

9 adverb.

 MR. WHALEN: No. All right. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I want you to describe what 

12 it means in the context of a statement. Doesn't it mean 

13 that you have to know that the statement you are making 

14 is false? Isn't that enough for willfulness?

 MR. WHALEN: That's what -- that -- yes. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Now, you tell me 

17 what deceit involves beyond that. 

18  MR. WHALEN: Deceit involves an intention to 

19 induce somebody to act. And what I'm arguing to this 

Court is that simply making a false statement under a 

21 tax perjury statute such as we have in this case does 

22 not meaning and does not evidence an intention to 

23 deceive or a finding. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little 

bit lost here.

1  Your definition of "deceit" is a false
 

2 statement with an intent for the other party to rely.
 

3 And you don't see that when you file your tax returns
 

4 that the government is relying on your statement to
 

calculate your tax and to ensure that you've paid it? 

6 You don't see any reliance by the government on the 

7 truthful statements there and its collection of taxes? 

8  MR. WHALEN: I -- I do see reliance as 

9 generally is what happens. What I'm saying is that 7206 

is a perjury statute and the government does not have to 

11 prove, and did not have to prove in this case, anything 

12 more than the -- the income was unreported or the tax --

13 the tax return was -- was false. If --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it also had to prove 

that the government relied? Is that what you're saying 

16 the --

17  MR. WHALEN: I'm saying that the 

18 government was -- if the government wanted to prove 

19 fraud or deceit, they -- that would be an element of the 

crime of tax evasion --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not even sure why, 

22 because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax 

23 evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax. You 

24 don't have to make a statement at all. You can take the 

money from the bank, withdraw it openly, and stick it in

3  MR. WHALEN: And the --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where's the false and 

deceit in that? 

6  MR. WHALEN: The government would have to 

7 prove fraud or deceit, because an intent to evade is --

8 the Court -- the -- the government has to prove --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there's a -- if there 

are cases that say otherwise, what does that do to your 

11 argument? Of which there are many that say that the 

12 avoidance of taxes, tax payment, doesn't require an act 

13 of fraud or deceit? 

14  MR. WHALEN: I would be surprised by 

those --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose somebody 

17 goes -- he goes to a country where we have no 

18 extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a 

19 postcard to the IRS every -- once a month saying 

ha-ha-ha. 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, why wouldn't that 

23 be an attempt to evade? That's why he went; he didn't 

24 like to pay his taxes.

 MR. WHALEN: Then the government would bring

1 an action under the --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, 7201. Why can't 

3 you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201? I mean, my 

4 simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you 

are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section 

6 (43). And you read -- you try to get the fraud and 

7 deceit crimes, okay? So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and 

8 (2). And you see for both of those, you can't be 

9 convicted unless you materially and willfully make a 

false statement. 

11  So, you think, hey, I don't need a special 

12 section on that one. But then you go to 7201, and you 

13 say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate 

14 this by going off to some special country, taking all 

his assets and writing ha-ha-ha. Now, there's no fraud 

16 and deceit in that. He's totally open about it. But he 

17 sure has evaded it. So, therefore, I better write a 

18 special section. 

19  Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but 

what's wrong with it? 

21  MR. WHALEN: What's wrong with it, Your 

22 Honor, is that what we're talking about is the 

23 aggravated felony statute. And the issue -- and it may 

24 be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the 

conviction under 7206, which does not require anything 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 more than filing of a false statement without any intent 

2 to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated 

3 felony. And this Court has said time and again that it 

4 is the elements of the offense that determines 

aggravated felony. 

6  If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a 

7 conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as 

8 including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the 

9 Justices have indicated, that, you know, that when 

somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be 

11 deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop 

12 a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil 

13 collection action. 

14  So, this is what Commissioner Walters was 

concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in 

16 effect would undermine the ability of the government to 

17 get an easy conviction based simply on a false 

18 statement. 

19  Similarly, if you are convicted of tax 

evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud. 

21 He is collaterally estopped. And as we know, when the 

22 government goes to seek recovery -- that is, getting the 

23 taxes back in a civil proceeding -- there's no statute 

24 of limitations.

 The intention of Congress is also reflected 

11

Official 

1 in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a 

2 person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks 

3 to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding, 

4 Congress particularly said that where there's a 

conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of 

6 proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or 

7 rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there 

8 was an attempt to evade the tax. But the conclusion is 

9 the same.

 If Congress had intended that proof of fraud 

11 and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at 

12 all for Congress to put that in 70 -- 6501. 

13 Therefore --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That's 

26 U.S.C. 6501? 

16  MR. WHALEN: Yes. To be more precise, 

17 6501(c)(1). 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

19  MR. WHALEN: That is the exceptions to the 

running of the statute of limitations. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have that in the 

22 briefs? 

23  MR. WHALEN: I have it in my reply brief. I 

24 don't have the particular statute, but I refer to it in 

the reply brief.

2  MR. WHALEN: I --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't like counsel 

4 getting up here and talking about statutes that they've 

never put before us. If you're going to rely on it, we 

6 -- we would like to have the text somewhere. 

7  MR. WHALEN: Yes. I apologize for that, 

8 Your Honor. 

9  I would like to move to the second part of 

my argument, if Your Honor please, that the -- this 

11 Court has been very clear on deciding statutes invoking 

12 canons of construction. And one of the important canons 

13 is that different words have different meanings. 

14  So, in (M)(i), we have loss to victim or 

victims in excess of $10,000, and in (M)(ii), we have a 

16 revenue loss to the government in excess of 10,000. And 

17 as this Court said in Nijhawan, referring to (M)(ii), 

18 this is the Internal Revenue provision, a correct 

19 assessment I suggest, and that (M)(i) deals with 

injuries or damage to third parties, not to the 

21 government. 

22  If you take the government's position that 

23 fraud and deceit crimes are in -- fraud and deceit 

24 revenue crimes are in (M)(i), then (M)(ii) would be 

worthless or pointless.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why? Because it 

2 wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or 

3 defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a 

4 willful lie. It would be adding to the -- to the fraud 

and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie. 

6 It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing 

7 postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I 

8 just ain't gonna pay it. There's no fraud and deceit 

9 there. It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to 

evade or defeat tax. 

11  MR. WHALEN: Well, anyone who leaves the 

12 country with an intent to avoid tax is committing tax 

13 evasion. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. That's my 

very point. 

16  MR. WHALEN: And that is --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Without lying -- without 

18 lying -- without making a single lie. 

19  MR. WHALEN: What I'm saying is that fraud, 

such as you suggest, Your Honor, is going to be an 

21 aggravated felony. It's the only one that Congress 

22 says -- only revenue offense, only offense under the 

23 Internal Revenue Code which Congress designated as an 

24 aggravated felony.

 What I'm saying is that if tax evasion were

1 also included in (M)(i), then Congress would have 

2 created a useless, pointless provision. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And my point is that 

4 it would not have been included within (M)(i). There is 

no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it 

6 does not involve fraud or deceit. It does not involve a 

7 lie, as 7206 does. 

8  MR. WHALEN: 7201 involves, I'm suggesting 

9 that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: An attempt to evade or 

11 defeat -- "who willfully attempts in any manner to evade 

12 or defeat any tax." And one can do that without lying. 

13 One can do that by simply not report income, for 

14 example. Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful 

example, by going to Cuba. Was it Cuba or somewhere 

16 else? 

17  (Laughter.) 

18  MR. WHALEN: Well, the point I am trying to 

19 make, Your Honor, is that if your example is an example 

of fraud and deceit, which I agree it is, then a crime 

21 of fraud and deceit would not be in (M)(i) because it 

22 would be -- it would already be captured in (M)(i) if 

23 the government's position was upheld. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point that was 

being made is not that it's fraud and deceit. Quite the

1 opposite. I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, 

2 Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the 

3 evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading 

4 payment where you say nothing. What would be the crime 

if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a 

6 return, so you are not filing anything that's false? 

7 Where would that come in the Internal Revenue --

8  MR. WHALEN: That would be a violation of 

9 one of the other Internal Revenue crimes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it be evasion 

11 simply not to report your income? 

12  MR. WHALEN: If the government chose to 

13 prove that it was an attempt to evade the tax, it would. 

14 The Internal Revenue's statute and crimes all carry the 

duty to -- it's a legal duty we all have of fairly 

16 reporting our income, our deductions, what have you. 

17 It's the same legal duty whether it's in 7201 or 7206. 

18  The difference is, in tax evasion, there 

19 must be a proof of fraud or deceit. That's inherent. 

From the beginning of this country -- rather, beginning 

21 of the tax statutes, Congress has always separated 

22 revenue statutes from other crimes. In this case, 

23 (M)(i) deals with crimes involving third parties; 

24 (M)(ii) deals with revenue loss crimes to the 

government. Only (i) is an aggravated felony.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

7  MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

8 please the Court: 

9  Congress's specific reference to tax evasion 

in subparagraph (M)(ii) of the INA's definition of 

11 aggravated felony did not remove all other tax offenses 

12 from the scope of subparagraph (M)(i). 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gannon, do you think 

14 that you can commit tax evasion without committing 

either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show 

16 that? 

17  MR. GANNON: The cases that we cited in our 

18 brief on page 34 that discuss this are ones that are 

19 evasion of payment cases as opposed to evasion of 

assessment cases. And those -- those are instances in 

21 which somebody could accurately file a tax return and 

22 say I owe you this amount of money and then take steps 

23 to prevent the IRS from collecting on it, usually by 

24 removing their assets from the IRS's reach.

 As a factual matter, it so happens that most 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 of those cases will often involve some concealment along 

2 the way. If somebody's taking more than $10,000 in gold 

3 coins out of the country to take them to a Swiss bank, 

4 they often don't mention that when they're leaving the 

country. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about just not filing 

7 a return? 

8  MR. GANNON: Just not filing a return is 

9 probably not going to be enough to establish tax 

evasion. That would be an offense under 7203, which 

11 doesn't necessarily involve fraud or deceit. The thing 

12 that distinguishes 7201 is the need for the government 

13 to establish that there is an attempt to evade either 

14 the assessment or payment of taxation.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, I suppose what 

16 confuses me is that when somebody is convicted of 7201, 

17 they can't -- they're estopped from contesting a civil 

18 fraud suit; isn't that right? And it also counts as a 

19 crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud. And all 

of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases 

21 as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud. 

22  MR. GANNON: Well, certainly in the context 

23 of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has 

24 concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an 

understatement due to fraud. And the reason why it has 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 refused to reach that conclusion in the context of 7206 

2 offenses, like the ones at issue in this case, is 

3 because the 7206 offense does not require the government 

4 to have proved that there was any understatement to 

begin with. And so, there could not have been an 

6 understatement due to fraud. 

7  I'd also note that it's not at all clear 

8 that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that 

9 I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion, 

that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be 

11 applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is 

12 triggered by an understatement of an amount required to 

13 be shown on the return. And, therefore, if it isn't --

14 if it isn't actually something that's done in the 

context of filing a tax return that understates how much 

16 you owe the government, then -- then that may well not 

17 trigger the collateral estoppel effect in the follow-on 

18 civil case. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what did 

you --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Are there

1  MR. GANNON: Any tax crime --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Felonies, I should say. 

3  MR. GANNON: There are several tax offenses 

4 that don't necessarily involve fraud or deceit. So, 

parts of 7202, which is the willful failure to collect 

6 tax, would not necessarily involve fraud and deceit, but 

7 it also covers failing to truthfully account for 

8 collected tax. So, some of those offenses would involve 

9 fraud or deceit, and it may be divisible. 7203, which I 

just mentioned --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that fall under tax 

12 evasion, or that's a separate statute? 

13  MR. GANNON: That's not tax evasion. The 

14 only thing that counts as tax evasion is 7201.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I cut you off. Which 

16 are the other ones? 

17  MR. GANNON: I was saying that I already 

18 mentioned to Justice Scalia that section 7203 -- all of 

19 these offenses I'm talking about are in 26 U.S.C.; 7203, 

the willful failure to file a return or to pay tax or 

21 maintain records or supply information doesn't 

22 necessarily involve fraud or deceit. Parts of 7204, 

23 which is failing to furnish a statement to the employee 

24 reflecting the amount of taxes, but not -- but then, 

again, I think it could be divisible because it would

1 also apply to furnishing a false statement to your 

2 employee. Even the misdemeanor offense under 7207 for 

3 presenting false documents might be covered for fraud or 

4 deceit, but in practice it's only used when there's --

it's only used when the tax deficiencies are de minimis. 

6 And so, it would never trigger the $10,000 loss 

7 requirement that (M)(i) would also require us to 

8 establish in order to make it an aggravated felony. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what --

what is your answer to your friend's 6501(c)(i) 

11 argument? 

12  MR. GANNON: Well, my answer is that I don't 

13 think it proves really any more than the collateral 

14 estoppel cases in the civil fraud context. The 

provision that we're talking about is not reprinted in 

16 any of the briefs, but 6501(c)(1) is an exception that 

17 -- that lifts the limitation on when the IRS can levy an 

18 assessment or seek collection; and it refers to the case 

19 of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade 

tax. And I think that in context, the reference to a 

21 false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax is 

22 not something that clearly connotes that Congress is 

23 just speaking to 7206 offenses. It uses not only the 

24 word "fraudulent," but also "the intent to evade tax," 

which I think --

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, but I 

2 think your friend's argument, which has some appeal, is 

3 7206 is fraud and false statements. And he said if 

4 you're right that that includes deceit, they wouldn't 

have had to add "with the intent to evade tax," which is 

6 what they do in 6501(c)(1). 

7  MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think if you look 

8 to (c)(2), it also refers to a willful attempt in any 

9 manner to defeat or evade tax. So, the next provision 

also applies more broadly to 7201 and more closely 

11 tracks the definition in 7201. So, I think just like 

12 the statute of limitations provision that we note, 

13 Congress is probably using a belt and suspenders 

14 approach there, that -- we noted that Congress may well 

have had reason to be concerned that 7201 offenses would 

16 not necessarily be seen as having fraud or deceit as an 

17 element of the offense in light of this Court's decision 

18 in Scharton, which was an old case, but it had said that 

19 in the -- in the statute of limitations context, that 

the -- the extended statute of limitations that apply to 

21 offenses in which fraud was an element was not triggered 

22 by the statutory predecessor to tax evasion. And so, to 

23 the --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But Scharton was a very old 

case which had been distinguished away by many courts.

1 It really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell 

2 me if I'm wrong, but --

3  MR. GANNON: Well, to this day section 6531, 

4 which is the statute of limitations provision which we 

do reprint in our appendix, includes provisions that 

6 refer not only generally to offenses involving fraud but 

7 also specifically to a tax evasion offense. And so, I 

8 think that the fact that Congress had already felt like 

9 it needed to be expressed, to pull in not just fraud 

offenses but also tax evasion offenses in 6531, makes it 

11 unsurprising that they would have pursued a similar 

12 approach here. In addition, I would --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, the paradoxical 

14 thing about your argument is that, one, it makes us 

think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about 

16 this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses 

17 were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost 

18 always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was 

19 thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that 

maybe there was going to be some conviction out there 

21 that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress 

22 is being super-careful about this; and yet, at the same 

23 time, that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly 

24 clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction 

which is that one does not write superfluous language.

Official 

1  MR. GANNON: But, Justice Kagan, we don't 

2 think it's superfluous, in part because of the evasion 

3 of payment cases we're talking about, but I think also 

4 if you look at the context of the rest of paragraph 

(43), the aggravated felony definition, you'll see that 

6 there are several other provisions that have significant 

7 overlap in them. And so subparagraph (A) refers to 

8 murder and rape; those would also generally be covered 

9 in crimes of violence in subparagraph (F). The same 

thing is true in paragraph (E)(i); it pulls in various 

11 explosives offenses including arson, destruction of 

12 property or building by fire or explosives; that's the 

13 reference to an 8441 --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, our rule of statutory 

construction when it comes to this aggravated felony 

16 statute is that superfluity doesn't matter? 

17  MR. GANNON: No, Justice Kagan, I think that 

18 in context, there is a lot of overlap among the 

19 different provisions in -- in paragraph (43) already, 

and I -- I was also going to mention subparagraph (K)(i) 

21 and (ii), which like (M)(i) and (M)(ii), are ones that 

22 have little (i), which has a generic reference there to 

23 offenses associated with managing a prostitution 

24 business, and little (ii) then expressly refers to 

certain enumerated Federal statutes, all of which

1 involve transporting individuals for purposes of
 

2 prostitution in the case of seeking commercial
 

3 advantage.
 

4  And I think that virtually all of those
 

offenses would have been included within (K)(i), but 

6 Congress wanted to be sure and, therefore, added 

7 (K)(ii). And as -- as Justice Breyer, I think, pointed 

8 out before, textually it -- it had reason to think that 

9 7206 would be picked up by fraud or deceit here in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But 7206 is the lesser 

11 offense. I mean, you don't take -- you don't dispute 

12 that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is, 

13 evasion. It gets a more severe penalty. And when 

14 Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only, 

why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant 

16 with respect to aggravated felonies? That there's one 

17 tax crime, the most serious tax crime, that fits that 

18 label. And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many, 

19 many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and 

loss to the victim? 

21  MR. GANNON: The reason why we don't think 

22 that's appropriate is in part because, as I've 

23 explained, there would -- there is some aspect of which 

24 (M)(ii) is not superfluous. But, more importantly, we 

don't think that the specific controls -- the general 

25

25

Official 

1 canon is triggered here, and we don't think that (M)(ii) 

2 talks about a category of tax crimes or tax offenses 

3 more generally, because it only refers to one offense. 

4  And so, the cases that Petitioners invoke 

here, in order to establish that there is a category 

6 that's being pulled out of (M)(i), are HCSC-Laundry and 

7 Leocal. Those are both cases in which the statute 

8 actually identified the category of offenses in 

9 question, whether it was the cooperative hospital 

service organizations in HCSC-Laundry or DUI offenses in 

11 Leocal. 

12  And so, here we don't have Congress actually 

13 saying tax offenses are covered by (M)(ii). What it 

14 says is tax evasion is covered by (M)(ii). And --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what about -- what 

16 about -- suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201. 

17 Suppose we only had 7206, and the question before us 

18 was, does 7206 fit within the term "aggravated felony"; 

19 i.e., does it involve fraud or deceit?

 So, we read 7206; it doesn't say anything 

21 about fraud or deceit. It says perjury and making a 

22 false statement. So, then we go look up what were the 

23 torts of fraud and deceit. And he's right. Fraud 

24 traditionally requires an intent to get another person 

to act, but you don't have to have that intent to

1 violate 7206. And deceit -- it not only involves that; 

2 it also involves the person having acted. 

3  So, the traditional tort of deceit, you have 

4 to intend the acts, and he actually has to have acted to 

his detriment. Fraud, you have the first of those and 

6 second. You read the statute and say, well, say neither 

7 of those is present here. This is just perjury, which 

8 isn't good, but it's not fraud or deceit. And there we 

9 are, not in the statute. What's the answer to that?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I don't think that the 

11 common law definitions of fraud and deceit are the ones 

12 that this Court has always applied in the context --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not always. But 

14 here we were dealing with a very serious statute, 

aggravated felonies. That has terrible consequences for 

16 the persons who fall within it. 

17  MR. GANNON: And --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: So -- and in most of these 

19 M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to 

statutes by number so most of it, though not all of it, 

21 is very specific. So, when we read these words "fraud" 

22 and "deceit" here, why don't we say fraud and deceit 

23 means fraud and deceit? 

24  MR. GANNON: Well, in the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The traditional elements.

1  MR. GANNON: In the criminal context, the 

2 Court has recognized that fraud offenses don't require 

3 the government to prove reliance or damages. And that 

4 makes sense. If you think about the tort action, the 

classic tort action, you would need to be an injured 

6 plaintiff; and, therefore, you would need to be able to 

7 say I relied on this to my detriment --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. 

9  MR. GANNON: -- and I want to recover.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You have to prove that the 

11 -- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment. 

12  MR. GANNON: And --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Which he may or may not 

14 have done. I mean, when you commit -- a person who 

commits perjury may or may not have intended that a 

16 victim rely to his detriment. Which you don't have to 

17 prove here. 

18  MR. GANNON: We do not have to prove as a 

19 separate element that there's reliance or intended 

reliance here, but we do need to prove what we think 

21 satisfies the plain meaning of the term "deceit." We're 

22 not focusing on fraud here but deceit, and that's the 

23 act of intentionally giving a false impression, because 

24 the elements of this offense are making and signing a 

return under the penalties of perjury that it is false

3 You're absolutely right. 

4  MR. GANNON: -- does not believe to be true 

or correct, and it's all done willfully. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No, the tort didn't involve 

7 that. The tort involved the same element of fraud which 

8 you don't want to rely on. 

9  MR. GANNON: That -- that's right, and we 

think here Congress has used the -- the term --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any -- is there 

12 any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument 

13 other than that you just think that and you could argue 

14 the other way? I mean, can we get anywhere?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that Congress did 

16 use the terms disjunctively here. And I think that now 

17 the plain meaning of "deceit" is -- it sort of operates 

18 in the opposite direction of the one that you're talking 

19 about, Justice Breyer. And if you look at the way the 

Court in Yermian discussed the difference between an 

21 intent to defraud and intent to deceive, it talks about 

22 an intent to defraud includes actually obtaining 

23 something, whereas an intent to deceive just involves 

24 creating a false impression. And so, I think that 

actually the difference can run the other direction in a 

29

1 way that supports the definition that we're relying upon 

2 here. 

3  But going back to the point that I was 

4 trying to make about this not ruling out all tax 

offenses, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the reference 

6 to 7201 alone doesn't do that, nor do we think the fact 

7 that Congress then added a limited -- limiting language 

8 that said that when the revenue loss exceeds $10,000, it 

9 would satisfy (M)(ii).

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure, 

11 Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about 

12 superfluity? Because when I asked whether (M) -- the 

13 second provision was superfluous, you pointed me to 

14 these evasion-of-payment cases. And you cite two of 

them. But then you say even those cases will almost 

16 invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud. So, 

17 are there, in fact, any cases, evasion of payment or 

18 otherwise, which do not involve some affirmative acts of 

19 fraud?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's as a 

21 factual matter, Justice Kagan. We were --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: As a factual matter, are 

23 there any? 

24  MR. GANNON: We were observing that as a 

factual matter, those evasion-of-payment cases probably

1 would not happen without there being acts of 

2 concealment, but that doesn't --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's what I'm asking. 

4 As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that 

do not involve affirmative acts of fraud? 

6  MR. GANNON: I don't believe that I can, but 

7 I think that to the extent that the Court is looking to 

8 the elements of the offense in 7201, if they're talking 

9 about evasion of payment, that will not necessarily 

require deceptive acts of concealment. And so, that's 

11 the reason --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: I know, but we have a very 

13 active IRS, which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and 

14 you're saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases 

under this section that don't involve affirmative acts 

16 of fraud. 

17  MR. GANNON: Well --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: And that makes me wonder why 

19 Congress was so worried about this problem that it 

ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation. 

21  MR. GANNON: Well -- and I believe that the 

22 reason that they were worried could be because of the 

23 Scharton decision, in which this Court had already said 

24 that evasion does not necessarily require fraud, because 

the textual cues in 7201 are much further from fraud and 

31

1 deceit than those in 7206; that there's also -- there
 

2 would be less certainty. Even assuming that Congress
 

3 was well aware of the established practice at the
 

4 Federal level of having 7201 tax evasion cases be
 

compared with fraud, this is also a provision that 

6 applies to State and foreign offenses. The penultimate 

7 sentence of paragraph (43) says that the term applies to 

8 an offense whether it's in violation of Federal or State 

9 law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was one of the 

11 problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which 

12 actually you considered, that reading the (M)(i) to 

13 include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in 

14 offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and 

local level. It would really swell the category of tax 

16 crimes that lead to deportation. That -- did Congress 

17 really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons? 

18  And then there was a very practical point 

19 made, that the government is going to be hurt more than 

helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that 

21 very often the government will try to make a bargain. 

22 It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard 

23 to prove. So, they offer as a plea bargain 7206. And 

24 if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there 

will be many, many people who will say: If it's a

2 States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead 

3 to something that will mean immediately when I serve my 

4 time I will be thrown out of the United States.

 MR. GANNON: Well, that may well be the 

6 consequence of the definition that Congress has adopted 

7 here of aggravated felony. And I would note that in the 

8 plea agreement that Mr. Kawashima filed in this case, 

9 paragraph 4, which is reprinted on page 117a of the 

petition appendix says Mr. Kawashima recognizes that he 

11 may be deported as a result of his conviction. That's 

12 in his plea agreement to the 7206 offense here. 

13  And so, it is, to be sure, the case that the 

14 government may well find it more difficult to secure 

guilty pleas when an alien is -- is admitting to an 

16 offense that is an aggravated felony. But we think that 

17 that's a consequence of Congress having expanded the 

18 definition. In --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me go up to start with 

Justice Ginsburg's first question. I mean, if this 

21 falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury? 

22 Is every perjury statute within it? And what about 

23 lying to an FBI agent? And what about lying to a 

24 government official, which is -- which is -- you know, 

there are all kinds of statutes on that one.

1  MR. GANNON: Well --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Are all those aggravated
 

3 felonies?
 

4  MR. GANNON: Congress has given us two
 

different metrics for determining whether those --

6 whether those offenses are aggravated felonies. If they 

7 involve fraud or deceit and there is loss to the victim 

8 exceeding $10,000 --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.

 MR. GANNON: -- then that it could fall 

11 within (M)(i). If it's perjury statute that doesn't 

12 involve loss or a false statement to an FBI agent that 

13 doesn't involve loss to --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: The government's view is 

that, of course, you have to meet the other 

16 requirements. But as far as the words "fraud" or 

17 "deceit" is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every 

18 perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI 

19 agent, lying to this or lying to that. And has that 

been the consistent policy of the immigration service? 

21 Have they deported people where the other two conditions 

22 are fulfilled? 

23  MR. GANNON: In the beginning, when the 

24 amount of loss was $200,000. I think most perjury 

offenses don't involve a loss of more than $10,000 --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: But all I need are a few. 

2 I mean, I just wonder, is it the policy of the INS and 

3 the government to deport people where these other things 

4 are met -- which they would be perhaps rarely; I don't 

know -- but to deport them where the crime, the 

6 underlying crime, is perjury, lying to an FBI agent or 

7 lying to other government officials? 

8  MR. GANNON: There -- yes, there are such 

9 cases. Sometimes they go under (S), which is the 

paragraph for perjury, which was actually not in 

11 existence when (M)(i) was added to the statute. It was 

12 added 2 years later. But, more generally, I would like 

13 to mention that there are other tax offenses --

14 Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I'm confused by 

16 the $10,000 requirement. Does that have to be an 

17 element of the offense? 

18  MR. GANNON: It does not need to be an 

19 element of the offense. It's a consequence of the 

Court's decision in Nijhawan. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Just a consequence of the 

22 -- of the fraud or deceit, right? 

23  MR. GANNON: It needs to be tied to the 

24 offense of conviction under this Court's decision in 

Nijhawan. And most instances where somebody lies to an

1 FBI agent probably don't involve costing somebody more 

2 than $10,000. And so, I think that it doesn't often 

3 come up in (M)(i). But many other tax offenses are 

4 prosecuted under other provisions that potentially 

involve fraud or deceits and could -- can cost the 

6 government more than $10,000. 

7  And Petitioner's reading of saying that all 

8 tax offenses have to be pulled into (M)(ii) and then 

9 only tax evasion is covered would require the Court to 

bifurcate all of these other provisions. And I'm 

11 thinking of, for instance, 18 U.S.C. 371. This is the 

12 provision for defrauding the United States by 

13 obstructing or impeding the IRS in its efforts to 

14 collect taxation. This Court cited 371 as one of the 

fraud offenses that it thought was covered by (M)(i) in 

16 the Nijhawan decision. 

17  The same is true for mail fraud. The 

18 criminal division, the tax division can prosecute tax 

19 cases in which somebody mails a false tax return under 

18 U.S.C. 1341. False claims under 18 U.S.C. 287, 

21 conspiracy to false claims under 286, false statements 

22 to the government -- these are all provisions that are 

23 used to prosecute tax offenses. And Petitioner's 

24 reading of saying that all tax crimes are pulled out 

would require the Court to bifurcate these offenses and

1 make whether it's an aggravated felony turn on whether 

2 the government has lost revenue as opposed to some other 

3 form of money. And we don't think that that's what 

4 Congress intended when it went to the trouble of just 

stating that tax evasion was expressly covered.
 

6  And going back, Justice Kagan, to your
 

7 concerns about superfluity, I do think it's important
 

8 that in the context of this statute, there's lots of
 

9 other overlap. Congress had reasons to be unsure in
 

light of the Scharton decision, in light of the 

11 evasion-of-payment cases because, even though as a 

12 factual matter --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: But it would have been 

14 perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which 

said just in case that you -- you know, just in case 

16 this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean 

17 tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that 

18 appears to exclude all other tax offenses. 

19  MR. GANNON: I don't see how -- if Congress 

wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they 

21 should have put that exception in (M)(i). They should 

22 have said offenses involving fraud or deceit, but not 

23 tax offenses, in which the loss to the victim or victims

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's just arguing 

2 against our application of the normal rule of avoiding 

3 superfluity where we can. 

4  MR. GANNON: Well, yes. I agree that the 

Court avoids superfluity where it can. Here we have 

6 contextual reasons to think that Congress was just 

7 trying to add more offenses to the definition rather 

8 than rule out an entire class. And I also think that 

9 there is no way to avoid the consequence of bifurcating 

all of those other provisions under Petitioner's 

11 reading. 

12  And so, if you were to say that the 

13 reference to 7201 pulls out all revenue loss offenses, 

14 that would mean that some mail fraud cases against the 

government in which the government loses more than 

16 $10,000 count and some don't. Same for wire fraud. 

17 Same for false statements. Same for false claims, 

18 conspiracy to false claims, and Klein conspiracies under 

19 section 371, which -- which are -- have a great deal of 

overlap with 7201. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: They still wouldn't -- no. 

22 Why? They still wouldn't be tax offenses. 

23  MR. GANNON: Well, I -- they would be --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you use the mail to 

avoid -- still, what you're being prosecuted for is use

1 of the mail to defraud.
 

2  MR. GANNON: But the -- I mean, as I
 

3 understand Petitioner's argument, it is the fact that
 

4 (M)(ii) refers to revenue loss that is the thing that
 

makes it pull in or define a category of cases involving 

6 tax offenses. And I think that if a mail fraud offense 

7 against the government involved taking -- getting more 

8 than $10,000 worth of refunds from the government as 

9 opposed to getting more than $10,000 in an ill-gotten 

government contract or government benefits from the 

11 government, that that could still be characterized as 

12 revenue loss. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he put it -- he put 

14 it wrong. He should have said -- just tax statutes are 

covered. 

16  MR. GANNON: Well, that --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Then -- then you wouldn't 

18 have to bifurcate, right? 

19  MR. GANNON: Then I just don't see how the 

reference to a single provision of 7201 refers to all 

21 other tax provisions --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not just that. 

23 It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the 

24 victim or victims. And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to 

the government has to exceed 10,000. I mean, in one 

39

Official 

1 case, it's the loss to the victim or victims. Why --

2 why did it use parallel language? Why -- or why did it 

3 say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the 

4 loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i) 

involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section 

6 7201 of Title 26? I mean, if -- if you read it, it 

7 seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with 

8 revenue loss to the government. 

9  And I find it hard to regard the government 

as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the 

11 truth. 

12  MR. GANNON: Well, I -- none of the courts 

13 of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the 

14 government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000 

in a fraud case or, indeed, in a tax evasion case. And 

16 so, here, there is a different phrase, but I think 

17 what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of 

18 revenue loss offenses. Instead, it defines a class of 

19 tax evasion offenses. It only refers to the one 

statute. And -- and then in that context, where there 

21 has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a 

22 7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency. Then 

23 it's natural to talk about the relevant losses being 

24 revenue loss to the government.

 The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it 

40

Official 

1 also applies to other types of frauds. And I think that 

2 the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is 

3 intending to read out all tax offenses. 

4  As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before, 

although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty, 

6 which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies 

7 under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that 

8 particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter 

9 the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing, the 

-- the same criteria that are both tied to loss. And 

11 more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like 

12 371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18, actually have longer 

13 maximum punishments. 

14  So, if the government wants -- has a 

particularly big fraud that they want to -- to get after 

16 somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've 

17 cost the government a great deal of money, it may choose 

18 to proceed under one of the other provisions where it 

19 can get an even greater punishment. And so, just 

referring to 7201 as the capstone I don't think allows 

21 it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a technical 

23 aspect of this case I don't understand. Maybe you can 

24 explain it. There was a question about what might be 

the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife. Why

1 should the revenue loss be different? She's -- she's 

2 convicted of aiding and abetting. 

3  MR. GANNON: She -- although it's -- the 

4 statute itself refers to aiding, assisting, procuring, 

or advising, it's not a traditional aiding and abetting 

6 statute. It doesn't require there to be an underlying 

7 primary violation. It's an independent offense. 

8  And so, as it happens in this case, we all 

9 know and it's not disputed that they're for the same 

underlying false tax return, the same tax return that 

11 ended in 1991 for one of the corporations that 

12 Petitioners co-owned, but -- but we just didn't have 

13 that evidence in the record. 

14  And so, I think even though it's an aiding 

and abetting, it's -- it's not a classic aiding and 

16 abetting violation that depends on the husband's 

17 conviction. She could have been convicted under 7206, 

18 too, even if the husband didn't know anything about the 

19 false numbers that she was providing him from the 

restaurant that they were operating. 

21  So, if there are no further questions, we'd 

22 urge the Court to affirm the court of appeals.

Official 

1  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

2  MR. WHALEN: My colleague mentioned the 

3 Yermian case, which is in our brief, but I failed to 

4 present it to the Court today. And it's a very 

important case decided by this Court, which said that 

6 filing a false statement is not -- is not indicative, 

7 not evidence, of an intent to deceive. 

8  Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, as also 

9 decided by this Court, said that -- and the Court held 

that making a false statement about Mr. Bridges' 

11 involvement with the Communist Party does not evidence 

12 fraud. 

13  And these cases, I believe, of this Court 

14 control the issue that deceit or fraud is not an 

essential element of this crime of conviction. 

16 Following up what Justice Kagan has said or has asked, 

17 that the rules -- canons of construction that the 

18 Petitioner has invoked, the rules of superfluity --

19 against superfluity; the idea that the court must give 

cognizance to different words mean different things; 

21 that is, revenue loss from the government is different 

22 from loss to a victim or victims; and the specific 

23 versus the general. 

24  The answer of the Government is simply 

speculation and conjecture of, among other things, 

43

25

Official 

1 courts make the wrong decisions; Congress didn't 

2 understand that tax evasion does involve fraud; and, 

3 therefore, it will be superfluous. 

4  The position of the Government in this case 

is simply that tax evasion may not be in 72 -- or may 

6 not be in (M)(ii), the reason that -- rather, that fraud 

7 and deceit may not be in tax evasion, but that a lesser 

8 revenue offense is in (M)(i). 

9  I would like to remind the Court, as many of 

the Justices have indicated, that we're not looking at 

11 an idea of someone who suffers a penalty because -- as a 

12 result of the tax offense. We're talking about 

13 banishment. And we're talking about deportation. And 

14 the statute in which we're -- of which we're involved 

should be read in favor -- where the Congress has not 

16 been clear, the statute should be read in favor of the 

17 immigrant. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Although it's not a 

19 criminal statute?

 MR. WHALEN: Pardon me, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a criminal 

22 statute. 

23  MR. WHALEN: This Court in the Fong case 

24 said that the rule of lenity applies to an immigration 

case. And the holdings of this Court have been 

44
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 consistent that the rule of lenity applies to both 

2 criminal cases as well as immigration cases. And I 

3 invite the Court to look at the cases we have cited that 

4 the rule of lenity has applied, in fact, to immigration 

cases. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there's one 

7 technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand. 

8 The particular tax here in question, the failure to 

9 report was 76-some thousand dollars, but the number that 

was given for the total failure to report is over 

11 1 million, and the -- the loss to the IRS at -- is 

12 245,000. Well, the 245,000 loss must refer to more than 

13 the failure to report 76,000. 

14  MR. WHALEN: The threshold amount is not an 

issue in the case. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd just like to know how 

17 we got -- how the 245,000 revenue loss was calculated, 

18 given that the crime that was charged, the failure was 

19 to report only 76,000?

 MR. WHALEN: I don't know. It was in 

21 negotiations between the government and the Kawashimas. 

22 In any compromise, the government chose only to charge 

23 them with a crime under 7206, which -- and to settle on 

24 that basis. As Justice Alito has mentioned in the 

Padilla case quite emphatically, that attorneys

1 representing immigrants deal with the government in 

2 order to avoid deportation. And that -- in this case 

3 whether the Kawashimas in fact had filed false returns 

4 in an attempt to deceive, that was by the boards, 

because the government and the taxpayer agreed that 

6 their offense would be solely 7206, which as you read 

7 the elements -- and you can read the Justice Department 

8 handbook which tells you what the elements are, and it 

9 does not include fraud and deceit.

 If there are no further questions, I --

11 finally, I would like to mention one case which hasn't 

12 been brought up, which evolved from the questions by the 

13 Justices, and that is a Third Circuit case which we 

14 cited, Nugent, mentioned in response to Justice Breyer's 

question, that the Nugent case said that you must 

16 fulfill both elements, that is perjury, (S) under the 

17 statute, and if it's included in fraud and deceit, you 

18 must fulfill the elements of both crimes at issue. 

19  And, of course, in this case, the Kawashimas 

did not -- were imprisoned for 4 months and did not meet 

21 the statutory requirement for an aggravated felony of 1 

22 year. 

23  But in any event, I want -- I would like the 

24 Court to keep in mind that what we are dealing here with 

is perjury, and we're not dealing with fraud or deceit,
