(10:04 a.m.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 12-71, Arizona v. the Inter 
Tribal Council of Arizona. 

General Horne. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HORNE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 
and may it please the Court: 

The NVRA should not be construed to preempt 
Arizona's Proposition 200 for three reasons. First, 
prohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the 
citizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if 
Congress had intended that, it would have put the 
prohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not 
do. Congressional silence should not disable States 
from taking sensible precautions to exclude noncitizens 
from voting. 

Second, when Congress wanted to expressly 
prohibit something, it knew how to do it. It expressly 
prohibited notarization and other forms of 
authentication. This Court has frequently held that 
statutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one 
thing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition:

The expressio unius rule. 

Third, Proposition 200 is consistent with 
the purposes and objectives of the NVRA because the 
purpose of the NVRA --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If I see the purpose of 
the NVRA to simplify registration --

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how is Arizona's 

provisions consistent with that objective and purpose? 
MR. HORNE: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Given that some of the 

amici explain that many people don't have the documents 
that Arizona requires? 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. First of all, 
the -- simplifying the procedure is one of two important 
purposes of the NVRA. The other is the integrity of the 
system --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but why does one 
take precedence over another? 

MR. HORNE: I would say, Your Honor, that 
neither takes precedence over the other. They're both 
equally important. And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if something you do 
conflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it 
preempted by the Federal law?

 MR. HORNE: Your Honor, I think the question 

is, if you take the two purposes together, does -- does 
the Proposition 200 strongly fulfill one and have a 
minimal burden on the other? And, Your Honor, I would 
rely on the findings of the -- of the district court in 
this case. In fact, this Court instructed the Ninth 
Circuit to defer to the factual findings of the district 
court in the Purcell case, which was this case in an 
earlier stage. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would you think that 
Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't 
consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had 
arrived at the balance it wanted? 

MR. HORNE: Because, Your Honor, the -- the 
Congress did not specify what the States could or could 
not do. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it did -- but 
Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. 
And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation 
subject to -- to the penalty of perjury. So it's not as 
though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship. 
It did. And it said this is the way we deal with 
citizenship. Then Arizona adds something else. 

So I would like, General Horne, for you to 
respond to a question that's already been raised in --

by the -- the panel that decided this case originally, 
which was, the statute said -- says each State must 
accept and use the Federal form, period. That's the end 
of it. 

And then it says, in addition to that, the 
State can do other things. The judge who asked that 
question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the 
Federal form, and if you want to do something in 
addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form 
and not add something to it. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. I think it's 
very clear that this statute does not say the signature 
is the only thing that the States can use to verify the 
eligibility of the applicant. Now, in -- in using the 
term "accept and use," Your Honor, accept and use in 
ordinary language -- we've given lots of examples in our 
briefs -- one can accept and use a form for a particular 
purpose without that form being sufficient to accomplish 
that purpose. 

I came here from Arizona on an airplane. If 
the airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you 
don't need to bring a paper ticket. And then I got 
there and they said, we want to see identification to 
prove that you are who you say you are, that would not 
contradict the statement that they are accepting and

using the e-ticket. They are accepting and using the 
e-ticket for a specific purpose --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Horne, wouldn't 
it contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like 
you to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you 
also to have a paper ticket. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. If they --
JUSTICE KAGAN: That would be inconsistent 

with the accept and use language, isn't that right? 
MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

Yes, Your Honor. And if I take that analogy to our --
to our facts, if we had changed the Federal form, I 
think we would have been in violation. But we did not 
change the Federal form. We used the Federal form 
exactly as it's printed by the Federal government. And 
we --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you added something 
to the Federal form, and that essentially creates a new 
set of requirements and a new form. 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, we -- we accept and 
use the Federal form. We ask, in addition to that, for 
evidence that the person is a citizen, that they're 
eligible to vote. The form is not exclusive. The form 
does not bind us to use only the form and nothing else. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -- do you think that

you could have said -- you know, we have our own State 
form, which we're allowed to have under the statute. 
Anybody who requires the Federal form has to append the 
State form as well. 

Could you have done that? 
MR. HORNE: I think not, Your Honor, because 

I think that would have been contrary to the purposes 
and objectives of the Act. I think what we did is 
consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act. 
But if you --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we draw the 
line? Where does the line get drawn between adding just 
your own form, and adding a new set of requirements, 
which -- you know, you could just as easily have called 
a form? 

MR. HORNE: Because the statute contemplates 
that it -- that it is the burden of the States to 
determine the eligibility of the voters. The -- the EAC 
was given the duty to develop the form, and we don't 
argue with the fact that the form belongs to the EAC. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that form should have 
included the eligibility requirements that your State 
demands. And it seems to me your complaint is that the 
Federal form does not require proof of citizenship, 
unless you consider just the statement that I'm a

citizen to be proof of citizenship. 

But why didn't you challenge the form? I 
mean, that's -- that's my problem with this. I frankly 
think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless 
it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting. 
And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal 
of the Commission to include on the form, as additional 
State requirements, the proof of citizenship? 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, under Section 
6(a)(1) of the statute, the burden of determining 
whether the citizen is eligible rests with the State. 
That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. Sure. 
MR. HORNE: The form belongs to the EAC. 

The determination of whether the applicant is eligible 
belongs to us. So whether or not they put what -- what 
we're asking for on the form doesn't matter. We are 
fulfilling our duty under Section 6(a)(1) by determining 
the eligibility of the applicant by asking for 
additional evidence of citizenship. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- you're 
simply denying then that the Federal government can, so 
long as it protects the requirements that your State 
imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government 
cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter

registration. 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal 
government can prescribe the form, but the form is not 
exclusive. The responsibility to determine the 
eligibility --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can't it make it 
exclusive? Let's assume -- I think -- I think that --
that accept and -- and employ, whatever the language 
is --

MR. HORNE: Accept and use. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- suppose -- suppose I 

think that that does mean that it's supposed to be 
exclusive. What harm is there so long as the Federal 
Commission requires, as part of the Federal form, all of 
the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the 
State imposes? 

MR. HORNE: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 
form is -- cannot be exclusive. I mean, even the ITCA 
Respondent and the United States Respondent admit that 
we can look to external evidence to determine whether 
the voter is eligible. The argument is, they say we can 
look at external evidence, but we can't ask the 
applicant himself, who has the most information, to pull 
out his driver's license and write down a number. 
There's no --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Horne, there --

there are a whole list of State-specific requirements 
that get appended to the form. And I think Justice 
Scalia was raising the question, did you ask to have 
Arizona's requirement -- just as the other 
State-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal 
Commission to include, as a State-specific requirement, 
this proof of citizenship? 

MR. HORNE: We did, Your Honor, and the 
Commission itself took no action. The executive 
director rejected our request. The executive director 
has no power to make determinations. Congress 
explicitly stated that the EAC can act only by a vote of 
three out of four of its members. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you did nothing more 
about that? 

MR. HORNE: Yes, sir. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you didn't go to 

court to say you have to include this as one of the 
State-specific requirements. 

Why didn't you do that? 
MR. HORNE: Your Honor, that -- that was 

under a predecessor of mine, so I don't know the reason. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Okay. 
Why didn't he do it?

MR. HORNE: I'm -- I'm not sure I would be 

competent to answer for him, Your Honor. But I think --
but I don't think it makes any difference because the 
form is -- is one thing that we accept and use to 
determine the eligibility of the voter, but it's not the 
only thing. 

My friends on the other side --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a -- I have a 

hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that 
people can mail in this form. 

MR. HORNE: Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how your 

rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using 
it when you're refusing to register someone when they do 
exactly what the Federal law permits them to do: Mail 
it in. There -- there's -- I don't -- I have a real big 
disconnect with how you can be saying you're accepting 
and using, when you're not registering people, when they 
use it the way the Federal law permits them to. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. That is the 
position that the executive director took, that if the 
form is fully filled out and on its face it shows the 
person is qualified we must accept the application. We 
then pointed out in our brief that that would mean that

even if we had documentary proof that the person was not 
a citizen, we'd still have to accept the application. 

In response to that, the Respondent ITCA and 
the Federal government said, no, you can look at 
external evidence, if it shows that the person is not a 
citizen. So the only question remaining then is there 
any basis in the statute for drawing a distinction 
between our looking to external evidence that we have 
and our asking the applicant to write down a -- a number 
from his driver's license. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you also ask for an 
address, for proof of the address, or proof of date of 
birth? 

MR. HORNE: If that were consistent with the 
purposes and objectives of the Act we could, Your Honor. 
And in determining that, one would have to weigh our 
interest in the integrity of the system versus what 
burdens that places on the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then again, it seems 
to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have 
indicated, is not worth very much. 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form 
sets forth certain minimum requirements that -- that 
have to be met. In fact, the -- the Act says 
specifically in Section 7(b)(2) that they must ask for

the signature under oath of the applicant. The Federal 
form also provides under 7(a)(1) that additional things 
that are necessary to determine the eligibility of the 
applicant can also be put on the form. 

The EAC chose not to put anything additional 
on the form, which was their right. It was permissive. 
But they did set -- set up a system of State-specific 
requirements. I think that reflects the fact that the 
States have the burden of determining whether or not the 
eligible -- the applicant is eligible. 

That's -- that's our burden. We must accept 
and use the Federal form as a tool in doing that, but it 
is not the exclusive tool, and my friends on the other 
side have admitted that it's not the exclusive tool 
because they've admitted that if we have documentary 
evidence the person is not a citizen, we can reject the 
application. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How could you establish 
citizenship without having something mailed in, in 
addition to the form? What are the other State-specific 
requirements? You have to put down your driver's 
license number or some other numbers? I -- I guess you 
could -- you could make them check off place of birth 
and if that place of birth is not the United States, you 
could require them to write down some number of -- of

their admission to citizenship. Are there -- are there 
numbers that you could demand? 

MR. HORNE: Well, some States require the 
Social Security number --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 
MR. HORNE: -- which is not -- which is not 

provided for in the statute. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 
MR. HORNE: But the -- but it's not 

prohibited. And the States were held in -- in the cases 
that were brought under that, the States were held that 
they could add it because it's not prohibited. 

The State of Louisiana -- inconsistently on 
the part of the EAC, the State of Louisiana has a 
requirement that was approved by the EAC and is in the 
form that says, "If the applicant has neither a 
Louisiana driver's license, a Louisiana special 
identification card, or a Social Security number, the 
applicant shall attach one of the following items to his 
application: A copy of a current and valid photo 
identification, a copy of a current utility bill, bank 
statement, government check, paycheck or other 
government document." So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's the kind of 
thing you should have had and that your predecessor

should have asked for to be included in the Federal 
form. 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form is 
not exclusive. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but, General, doesn't 
the -- the statute make the EAC the decision maker with 
respect to what can be added to the Federal form? The 
Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a 
floor. But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7 
does is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum 
necessary, and it consults with the States and the 
States can come to it and tell it what it needs, and the 
EAC can take action. But the EAC is driving the bus, 
according to Section 7 of this statute. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. The EAC is 
driving the bus as to the form, but the States are 
driving the bus as to what is necessary to determine the 
ultimate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think they're 
driving the bus as to the form. They can't drive it 
into a ditch. They're -- they're -- they're subject to 
arbitrary and capricious limitations, just as any other 
agency is. And to allow Louisiana -- to include what --
what they've allowed a Louisiana to include and to say 
that the only proof of citizenship -- there is a

provision in the statute which says consistent with 
determining, the States being able to determine the 
qualifications. 

Isn't there a provision which makes it clear 
that the Federal form has to make allowance for the 
States determining the qualifications? 

MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. And 
the -- and the -- but the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now --
MR. HORNE: The -- the duty of the States, 

Your Honor, to determine whether or not a voter is 
eligible, that is a duty that rests with the State, not 
with the EAC. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. 
MR. HORNE: The EAC can only --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the form has to enable 

the State to do that. And it seems to me you were quite 
able to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to 
include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some 
indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing 
else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen, 
right? So it's under oath. Big deal. If -- if -- if 
you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose 
you're willing to violate the perjury laws.

Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So I think you should --
you should have challenged the commission's refusal 
to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form. 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form 
is -- is a tool that we have to use to determine the 
eligibility of the voter, but the ultimate 
responsibility under -- under Section 6(a)(1) of -- of 
this very Act is with the States to determine the 
eligibility of the voter. 

My friends on the other side are admitting 
that the -- that we're not stuck with the four corners 
of the form because -- because we've pointed out that 
would result in a ridiculous conclusion that we could 
have documentary proof that the person is not eligible. 
So, if we're not bound by the four corners of the form, 
as in the ordinary use of the term "accept and use," we 
accept and use the form for a specific purpose, but it 
does -- it is not sufficient to satisfy that purpose. 
All parties agree to that. 

The only question is, is there a 
distinction, which we do not find in the statute, 
between using external evidence that we already have and 
asking someone to write down the -- the number on his 
driver's license, which he is the one that has the most

information. It's the logical way to do it. In fact, 
there is no Federal register of American citizens. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm a little bit confused. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take it -- I take 

it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side 
will disagree with that and they say, well, this is --
this is the line to be drawn. The -- the postcard is 
presumptive evidence of registration and -- and of 
qualification. And if you have evidence to the 
contrary, then it's different. But otherwise, the whole 
utility of the single form is missing -- is gone. 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, there -- there is 
nothing in the statute to draw a distinction between our 
having other extrinsic evidence, which they agree we can 
use outside of the form and our asking people to say, 
write down --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than the statutory 
words that authorize the use of the form. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, but -- but they don't make 
the form exclusive. Congress could have said the form 
is exclusive and you can't ask for anything else. They 
didn't do that. And they had shown when they dealt with 
authentication that they knew how to prohibit something 
if they wanted to prohibit it. They chose not to 
prohibit this exclusively and -- and so therefore, it

don't. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But at least 

one of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did he point to himself? 
One of the concurring judges below said that 

he found the statute ambiguous, but that with the 
legislative history there just could be no conclusion, 
but that Congress rejected your reading. Legislation 
history is very clear that this issue of what States 
could add to the form was raised and permission to do so 
was proposed explicitly and rejected. 

How do you -- assuming that I believe in 
legislative history, don't argue to me that I shouldn't, 
okay? 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you get around 

that? 
MR. HORNE: Your Honor, if the -- if the 

legislative history were consistent, I would -- I would 
say that was an argument that could be made. But the

legislative history here is extremely self-contradictory 
and one cannot conclude from any part of that 
legislative history what was the intent of the majority 
of the Congress. 

The House committee which dealt with the 
very act that -- that we have said, "Only the elected 
officials designated and authorized under State law are 
charged with responsibility to enroll eligible voters on 
the list of voters. The NVRA should not be interpreted 
in any way to supplant that authority. The committee is 
particularly interested in ensuring that election 
officials continue to make determinations as to 
applicants' eligibility, such as citizenship, as they're 
made under current law and practice." 

And the FEC, which is a predecessor to the 
EAC, relying on that House committee report, said that 
an application received by a local voter registration 
official is only an application and be subject to 
whatever verification procedures are currently applied 
to all applications. 

In addition, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, if I believed -- if I 

believed in legislative history, I would find that very 
persuasive.

(Laughter.) 
MR. HORNE: Could I just add one quick 

point, and that is that the sponsor of the bill was 
opposed to that amendment in conference committee, 
saying it wasn't necessary, that the States could 
already verify applicants under the existing law, as it 
was written before that amendment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: There's probably a 
perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in 
this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration 
form shall contain. 

MR. HORNE: Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there are four 

subsections and only one of those refers to a particular 
thing, and that is, identifying information. It shall 
include a statement, including citizenship, saying --
that contains an attestation the applicant meets that 
requirement. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.

MR. HORNE: Yes.

include like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a 
birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other 
things that show you're a citizen, correct? 

MR. HORNE: Yes, those are very unusual. 
Normally, you just write down the number from your 
driver's license.

MR. HORNE: Well, there have been --

actually, there have been prosecutions for perjury, Your 
Honor. But it's not -- it's not at all a verification 
of the eligibility of the citizen because --

making of the Federal provision that's there in the 
form: I am a citizen. What use are you making of that? 

MR. HORNE: Well, Your Honor, we are making 
use of it and I just mentioned --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know -- I'm sure 
you are and then my question is how? 

MR. HORNE: By prosecuting -- there have 
been ten prosecutions in one year alone of people who 
swore falsely. Out of the hundreds that were caught 
swearing falsely, ten, in fact, were prosecuted. 

JUSTICE BREYER: By? 
MR. HORNE: But that -- but that is not a --

that is not a sufficient use or that is not a sufficient 
measure of determining eligibility because literally 
hundreds have been caught swearing jury -- jury 
commissioner forms -- swearing they are not citizens 
after they had already registered to vote. Other people 
were caught in their applications to citizenship when 
they checked and found that they had previously 
registered to vote and voted. 

So -- so we are making use of it, but it is 
not a -- it is not a functional way to determine 
eligibility. And in 7(a)(1), Congress said that -- that 
both the Federal form and the State form as incorporated 
under Section 4 may ask for such additional information,

only such additional information as is necessary to 
determine the eligibility of the voter. That shows that 
Congress did not intend to prohibit us from getting 
additional information as is necessary to determine the 
eligibility of the voter. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: General, could -- could I 
take you back to this distinction that you're making. 
You said you can't append an additional form, you can't 
use an additional form, but you can require additional 
information. 

MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE KAGAN: So how do -- what's the 

difference between requiring additional information and 
requiring an additional form? Isn't -- when you say you 
need information A, B, C, D, E, that's just a form, 
isn't it? 

MR. HORNE: No, Your Honor, it's not a form. 
It's -- it's an instruction to -- to write down on the 
Federal form a number. And there is -- item six on the 
Federal form has a block where you write down the number 
and if you don't have either number -- you can write 
down a -- a driver's license number, you can write down 
a naturalization number, you can write down an Indian 
tribal identification number. If you don't have any of 
those numbers, then you can send in one of these

additional documents. 

But that is not an additional form. The 
reason -- the distinction I draw between the --
incorporating another form or the State form and asking 
for additional information is the purposes and 
objectives of the Act. The Act indicates that the State 
form is an alternative to the Federal form, but cannot 
take its place. So I'm saying it would not be 
consistent with the purpose and objectives of the Act to 
attach the form, but it is consistent --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what is the -- what 
would be the purpose of requiring a Federal form if you 
could just say, and in addition to that, you have to 
give ten more items of information? I mean, then the 
Federal form just becomes another hoop to jump through. 

MR. HORNE: No, Your Honor. I -- I don't 
think that's correct. First of all -- for two reasons. 
First of all, the Federal form does provide minimums. 
You must -- you must answer the questions set forth in 
the Federal form. 

But secondly, to the extent we add things to 
the Federal form, those things must be consistent with 
the purposes and objectives of the Act. And I -- and 
I -- and I justify my assertion that Prop 200 is 
consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act

by relying on the findings of the trial court that 
relate exactly to that question, finding that it was a 
minimal burden, overcome by a major interest that the 
State have -- has in protecting the integrity of the 
system, where the -- where the trial judge found a lot 
of evidence to show that there was voter fraud going on, 
although not the fault of the individuals, the fault of 
the organizations that often fool people into signing 
the form when they don't intend to -- or they don't 
intend to break the law; but as -- but as against that, 
that the -- that the burdens are minimal. 

And the trial court, the district court, had 
a lot of findings justifying the statement that the 
burdens are minimal, including the fact, for example, 
that if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the 
increase in Hispanic registration would have only have 
been .1 percent, which is statistically insignificant, 
including the fact that out of a population of $6 
million, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one 
can imagine, if you look at the list of plaintiffs, 
could only find one person out of six million people 
that could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who 
could not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot 
of other findings by the trial court.

you either have it or you don't. That's why the Federal 
form says are you or aren't you. 

MR. HORNE: Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's -- that 

qualification has been set by Arizona and the Federal 
system. 

MR. HORNE: The qualification has, but 
our -- our objection to the Ninth Circuit decision 
preempting Proposition 200 is that it leaves us unable 
to enforce our qualification requirement, which under 
the Constitution clearly is a State function. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you have proof, 
there are people that you have rejected, even without 
these forms? 

MR. HORNE: It's extremely inadequate, Your 
Honor. It's essentially an honor system. It does not 
do the job. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's what the 
Federal system decided was enough. 

MR. HORNE: That's what they decided as a 
minimum in the Federal form, but they did not say that 
we could not ask for additional information. Congress 
could have said that, just as they said we can't ask for 
notarization. They chose not to say that.

additional evidence to perform our function of 
determining that citizens --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I go back to Justice 
Kagan. If you don't have a driver's license to put a 
number down --

MR. HORNE: Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- this list of things 

says you have to append to the form other items: A copy 
of your birth certificate, a copy of your naturalization 
certificate. Why isn't that just creating another form? 

MR. HORNE: Your Honor, incidentally, there 
have been references to a postcard. The EAC itself says 
put the form in an envelope. And -- and just as you put 
the form in an envelope, you can put a copy of your 
birth certificate in an envelope. But I would point out 
under Crawford v. Marion County, the holding in this 
case, if there's a minimal burden on the great majority 
of the people and a somewhat higher burden on a few 
people, that does not negate the interests of the State 
and the integrity of the system. 

May I reserve time for rebuttal, Your Honor?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
Arizona simply disagrees with the balance 

that Congress drew. And when it comes to registration, 
Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, you're both correct, 
the whole point of the Federal form is that Congress had 
to draw a different balance. It confronted a situation 
in which 40 percent of eligible voters were not 
registered because State procedures and burdens were 
standing as an obstacle, a barrier between -- in the 
direct line of accountability between individual 
citizens and their Federal government. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And enclosing your driver's 
license number is that immense barrier, right? 

MS. MILLETT: First --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what's keeping 40 

percent of eligible voters away? 
MS. MILLETT: First of all, with -- with 

respect to the driver's license, it's only driver's 
licenses issued after 1996, October 1996, and those that

were not -- that someone did not obtain when they became 
naturalized. So you have to be about 33 years of age. 
Anyone older than that, their driver's license isn't 
going to work. And, in fact, Mr. Gonzalez in this case 
used his driver's license number and got bounced. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I still think that's a 
relatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the 
driver's license, then you can use your naturalization 
certificate. 

MS. MILLETT: You can -- Mr. Gonzalez did 
that as well and the naturalization certificate got 
bounced because the naturalization certificate, when put 
into the computer, does not produce records. It is a 
mistake in Arizona's Proposition 200. Neither one of 
these worked. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that 
about any certification procedure that, now and then 
there will be a mistake. I mean the fact that there is 
one person where -- where the computer spit out the 
wrong number or something, that is the basis for 
rejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes? 

MS. MILLETT: Joint appendix page 263, the 
district court found that 31,550 people were rejected 
from voting because of Proposition 200. Even on that 
same page he finds that 11,000 of them subsequently

registered, but they had to do the double gauntlet that 
Congress was trying to eliminate. The other 20,000 
swore under oath that they were citizens and Mr. Horne, 
before the Ninth Circuit, conceded he had no evidence 
that they were not citizens --

JUSTICE ALITO: The statute --
MS. MILLETT: -- of the United States. 
JUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that 

Arizona must accept and use the Federal form. What does 
that mean? Let me give you two possible definitions: 
One, the person must be registered if the Federal form 
is properly completed and submitted; two, the State may 
not make any further inquiry of the person who submits 
the form. 

Maybe you have other definitions, but what 
is the -- what do you interpret "accept and use" to 
mean? 

MS. MILLETT: We interpret "accept and use," 
it's mainly the latter, your second one, and that is 
that it is a limitation on what can be asked of the 
individual and that's not just from the Section 4 
language where accept and use comes from. But what's 
critical here is Section gg-7 which is on 26H of the 
petition appendix here. And that's where they say on 
this form.

 The form may require only, may require 

only -- from the applicant, I'm adding that in -- such 
identifying information essentially as the Commission 
determines is necessary to allow the State to make its 
decision. 

Now this is not just a ticket into the 
State's own registration process so they can go thank 
you very much for throwing it in the garbage can, now do 
what we would like you to do. It is a registration 
form, and when filled out completely and submitted under 
oath, it has the same legal --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this 
example --

MS. MILLETT: -- as the registration form. 
JUSTICE ALITO: A person rides up to a place 

to register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the 
Federal form. This -- this boy looks like he is 13 
years old and he is carrying school books, he is wearing 
a middle school t-shirt, but he has filled out the form 
properly. 

Are they required to register him or can 
they ask him, could you show me some proof of age, like 
he would have to if he tried to buy alcohol or 
cigarettes?

else from the applicant, but they can certainly apply 
their own evidence that they obtain, whether it's from 
their own eyeballs or whether it is through records or 
databases that they run these through, which is the more 
common one, and make a decision. 

Now a decision, the decision isn't simply we 
would like more from you. That's not an appropriate 
decision. 

JUSTICE BREYER: His point is, he keeps 
making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that 
isn't what it says. What the statute says is it may 
require only such identifying information as is 
necessary to assess eligibility. In other words, it's 
telling the people who write the form what they can put 
on it. And they can't put other things on it. But it 
nowhere says that the State can't do other things. 

Now that's his point. And when I asked him, 
well, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be 
able to use, oh, he says, we use it. We use the citizen 
part and these things on the form to prosecute people 
for perjury. So we're doing what it says, we're using 
it and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things. 

Okay. Now, that's his argument. Now, your 
answer, which would be very helpful to me, is?

26H it's talking about the form. And first, we know 
that the commission is the one that decides what is 
necessary on this form, a decision that wasn't 
challenged --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that conclusive or can 
that be challenged? 

MS. MILLETT: It can certainly be challenged 
under the Administrative Procedure Act but was not in 
this case. 

But it says what is necessary on the form. 
Now, when you give a -- now when you say what's 
necessary on a form you're talking about from the 
applicant. So this defines what is necessary from the 
applicant, what can be requested or demanded from the 
applicant --

JUSTICE BREYER: On the form. 
MS. MILLETT: -- on the form, exactly. On 

the form. And that is the necessary information to let 
them apply their own tools and make the decisions that 
the States make --

JUSTICE BREYER: But his problem is how do 
you get to that conclusion? He says you can't get there 
from the language because the language doesn't say that. 
It says what the Commission can put on the form. It 
doesn't say anything about whether some other agency,

such as a State or -- you know, a sovereign, can add 

something. 

Now, that's his problem. And I would like 

to hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about 

that is? 

MS. MILLETT: The Commission, let me just --

if we turn to 26H at the very top line --

JUSTICE BREYER: 26H. 

MS. MILLETT: 26H, where it has a number 1, 

let's insert the Commission before I get to the word 

"may." And that's all you need to do. We know from the 

prior page the Commission is the one doing this. The 

Commission may require only from the applicant. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. MILLETT: That's all the Commission is 

allowed to require from the applicant. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. 

MS. MILLETT: Exactly. And then the burden 

shifts to the State to do it. If, Justice Breyer, if the 

question is they may require that, and then the State can 

require anything else it wants, it is an utterly pointless 

form. And what we know from six --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, they may require 

it. It doesn't say they must require it. So it leaves 

it open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to

require some materials that is necessary to enable the 
appropriate State election official to assess 
eligibility? Isn't that -- isn't that what the language 
means? 

MS. MILLETT: I don't think that's a fair 
reading of what Congress would have assigned to them. 
But even if it were, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: May means may. 
MS. MILLETT: -- that's something to be 

challenged through the Administrative Procedure Act --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, we're talking 

about -- right now we are talking about the consequences 
of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may 
is may. It does not even require the Commission to 
include within the form everything that's necessary for 
the State to determine eligibility. 

Now, why would Congress ever create such a 
system where the Commission need not require what's 
necessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State 
cannot, cannot require anything further than what the 
Commission says? 

MS. MILLETT: The relevant phraseology is 
may require only, and that is not your normal permissive 
language. It's actually Congress -- it is language of 
limitation when used that way. "You may require only"

does not mean that you may -- that you may run freely 

and do what you want, and they have further down --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It says what you only may 

require. It doesn't say what you only shall require. 

MS. MILLETT: But you may require that is 

necessary to enable. So the language here, I think any 

fair reading -- and we don't strain the language in this 

context -- the natural reading is that they may require 

only the information from the applicant that's necessary 

essentially to shift the burden. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Where you're going 

is this, as I heard you before: It is true that there is 

no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't 

add things. But it does make a huge point approving 

citizenship in a particular way on the form. What would 

the point of that be if the State could add things? 

So we must look back to the purpose, not 

necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what 

that particular provision be, in particularly one as you 

quote adding to, what could it have been? And there the 

legislative history in my view is helpful because it 

makes clear, for example, in at least one place that 

Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that 

allows the State to do just what it's doing here because 

that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.

 So I'm putting words in your mouth, but 

don't accept them because I put them there. 
(Laughter.) 
MS. MILLETT: I would just like to add to 

them, Justice Breyer, two points, and that is with 
respect to citizenship in particular, not only does the 
statute, the NVRA flag it, but the Help America Vote Act 
in 2002. 

So even if you don't want to go just with 
the legislative history, Justice Scalia, in 2002 
Congress revisited the citizenship requirement for the 
Federal form and it added a box that you have to check 
that you are a citizen -- that you are a citizen. So 
Congress revisited this issue after the statute had been 
in effect for nine years. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Millett, I want to 
give up --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, is 
there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC 
allowed Louisiana to do was wrong. 

MS. MILLETT: It's unclear. It's a little 
different in that context, in two ways. First of all, 
the Commission made the decision so they have that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know. I'm 
assuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong.

 MS. MILLETT: Oh, I'm sorry. And then the 

second thing is the information that's required there is 
information, for the most part, that is -- that the Help 
America Vote Act allows States to require of 
individuals. Now, in the Help America to Vote Act, it's 
an either do it at the polls or do it in the 
registration. 

Maybe the Commission thought it could 
forward it, but at least there you have two profound 
differences and that is it's at least information that a 
separate statute has said States can require from 
individuals. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those are what? 
MS. MILLETT: But I think it's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are they? 
MS. MILLETT: That is the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the 

additional -- the question here is, is proof of 
citizenship an additional thing the State can ask. Now 
you're telling us that there are some additional things. 

MS. MILLETT: No, it's not proof of 
citizenship. What it is, is an identification 
requirement that can be applied at the polls or the Help 
America Vote Act says at the time of registration.

explain -- it's puzzling. You have all these 
State-specific and pages of State-specific requirements. 
What State-specific requirements are permitted and what 
State-specific requirements are not permitted? You're 
putting the citizenship on the not permitted side of the 
line. What is permitted and what is not permitted and 
what's the difference in the two categories? 

MS. MILLETT: Okay. First of all, the State 
requirement of citizenship, it's permitted in the sense 
that Congress requires in three different ways that 
citizenship be affirmed. It's simply disagreeing about 
proof. So it's not as though citizenship is left off 
this form, it's simply a question of how it's proved. 
But the Help America -- just to get right to your 
question -- there's two aspects to the Help America Vote 
Act that change this form a little bit. 

When you go through those instructions, what 
you will see -- here's what those State-specific 
instructions are: They are the requirement that you put 
in an ID number that is required by the Help America 
Vote Act required. Required. So clearly, that is to be 
on the form because another statute requires it. And 
then you put on -- it says to put on party 
identification for the States that have it. Some States 
have race identified, and then the instructions tell you

mentioned for us. 
MS. MILLETT: Just the

MS. MILLETT: Well, there's two -- those are 

things that are in the State -- when you look at those 
State-specific instructions, they are not add-ons. They 
are not adding attachments. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Millett, I mean, suppose 
it were true that the EAC has been inconsistent in this 
respect. That would be a different kind of lawsuit. 

MS. MILLETT: That would be a very different 
lawsuit that was never brought in this case. And this 
just -- the Louisiana thing just happened in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got a great 
deal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm 
saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd 
question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going 
to implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act 
reads the way you say it does.

 MS. MILLETT: But the Act, I think, by – by 

its own plain language and by its normal -- it can't 
have no -- there is only two ways to look at this 
statute. It either created a form that is simply to be 
the servant of every State and they can pile on to it 
anything else they want, and that is utterly 
irreconcilable to Congress's findings and the entire 
purpose of this statute, or this is Congress's 
registration mechanism that it chose exercising its 
power. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not anything else that they 
want. Not anything else that they want. But what is, 
in the words of the statute, necessary to enable the 
appropriate State election official to assess the 
eligibility of the applicant? It's clear that the 
statute intends the States to be able to do that. And 
you say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has --
has required its -- its own proof and the State wants a 
different kind of proof. The proof the Commission 
requires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen. This 
is proof? 

MS. MILLETT: This is -- statements --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is not proof at all.

statements under oath in a criminal case --

which we execute them. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact 
that --

MS. MILLETT: It's a very serious oath --
I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I didn't mean to interrupt 
your sentence. What -- what do you make of the fact 
that States can create their own forms? Arizona has its 
own form, right? And I don't believe you argue that its 
form is illegal. Maybe you think it is and you'll 
explain that. 

But what -- how -- and Arizona could put on 
its own form a demand for the information that it -- it 
wants to apply to people who submit the Federal form. 
It seems like a very strange system. So, if somebody 
happens to fill out the Arizona form, their application 
may be rejected; whereas if they had filled out the 
Federal form, it would be accepted. How can that be? 

MS. MILLETT: Well, there is two responses. 
One, it's an open question whether what -- whether the 
State form, for purposes of Federal elections, can add

new requirements, but we haven't challenged it, we 
haven't challenged here and I think it's --

JUSTICE ALITO: What statutory provision 
would you challenge that under? There's -- there's a 
provision under the statute, the numbers are complicated 
and I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says 
what the State form must do and I didn't see anything in 
that that would -- that would preclude their requiring 
this additional proof. 

MS. MILLETT: I think -- I think it's 
actually a very complicated question. And so to be 
clear, there is statutory language, I think, going both 
ways on this question. There is in 4(a)(2), which says 
the State form has to meet the criteria of 7(b), but 
then -- and then there is in 5(a)(6), which says, if 
you're going to be handing it out as your public office, 
it's the public agencies that have to provide the form, 
it has to be equivalent. 

But then in Section 2 -- I'm sorry to throw 
all these numbers, but I'm just trying to show you how 
it's complicated. In Section 2, the very background for 
the Federal form is that it's in -- it's in addition to 
whatever the States are already doing --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I've read all those 
provisions and -- all right. Let's assume for the sake

of argument that Arizona could do this on its own form. 
You haven't argued that their form is illegal. 

MS. MILLETT: Correct. 
JUSTICE ALITO: This seems to me like a 

crazy system. This is like the -- you know, the IRS 
creating two different tax returns with different --
with different tax rates and different tax tables and 
how much you pay would depend on which particular form 
you happened to pick up and submit. 

MS. MILLETT: No, not -- not in this sense. 
First of all, it would be very respectful of the States 
and Congress to arrive at a balance here, if it did 
that. But Congress has made clear that there is this 
essentially safe harbor role for the Federal form and 
that -- and they can't hide it away. It has to be 
available for the -- the driver's license and motor 
voter process. 

It has to be handed out at the relevant 
public agencies, and the mail form is available to be 
handed out or online for people to find. And so yes, 
could it be different -- it's an open question whether 
that's what Congress wanted for Federal elections or not 
or whether --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just 
different forms. You'd have different voter rolls then,

MS. MILLETT: Oh, I'm sorry. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

since you allow -- contemplate a State form that has 
different requirements than the Federal form, you would 
then end up with two different voter rolls. 

MS. MILLETT: No --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some people that 

registered under the State form, some people that 
registered under the Federal form. 

MS. MILLETT: As -- as of now, Arizona is 
doing it as a unitary system. Because anyone who fills 
out the State form necessarily satisfies the requirement 
of the Federal form. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but it doesn't 
work the other way. 

MS. MILLETT: It doesn't work the other way. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can satisfy the 

Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not 
satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list. 

MS. MILLETT: It doesn't work the other way 
at least for State elections. For Federal -- for 
Federal elections, it has to be the same. And so for

Federal elections, there's a single roll. It's up to 
States to decide how they want to deal with the State 
form. At the time the Congress enacted this statute, 
about half of the States in 1993, including Arizona, had 
a postcard form where you just attested to citizenship 
under oath. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Court of Appeals said 
that there's a different preemption test under -- for 
this law under this Constitutional provision than there 
is under the Supremacy Clause. It seems to me that that 
ignores the proposition that the State has a very strong 
and vital interest in the integrity of its elections, 
even when those, and perhaps especially when those are 
elections of Federal officials. And it seems to me the 
Ninth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight 
to that interest. 

MS. MILLETT: Well, first of all, the Ninth 
Circuit's test came out of this Court's language in 
Siebold. It had both conflict language and 
harmonization, both of which appear in this Court's 
decision in Siebold. But to get directly to your 
question of whether there should be a different test, I 
don't think it matters on the outcome in this case 
because the preemption is in those 31,550 people who 
couldn't register.

 But, I think the Election Clause is going to 

be very different in this sense -- in two critical 
senses. And that is that the Elections Clause involves 
an authority in the States that is conferred by the 
Constitution itself. 

May I finish? 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please. 
MS. MILLETT: It -- it has no reserve power 

that's being protected there, and by the very nature of 
the Election Clause is that Congress only acts when it 
means to displace or change what the States are doing. 
And so the necessity of having a presumption makes no 
sense in this context, particularly when you're talking 
again about a Federal form for Federal elections of 
Federal officials by Federal voters who need a direct 
line of accountability.

streamline the process of registration for applicants, 
and the provisions that provide for the establishment of 
a Federal form embody that objective. 

And I'd like to point to three features of 
the relevant statutory language that I think support our 
reading. And the particular critical provision is at 
page 22A of the appendix to the government's brief. And 
I'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a 
number of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the 
critical provision in our view, which is one that 
Ms. Millett was pointing to. And that's gg-7(b)(1). 

Now, what this provision embodies is this 
understanding: That the EAC is the one who determines 
what the content of the Federal form is. Not the 
States, but the EAC. The States do have a role in this 
scheme, and I think it's important to understand what 
that role is. 

The States have a consultative role at the 
front end. And this is back at page 21A -- I'm sorry 
for skipping back. But at page 21A at the bottom of the 
page, the EAC is to develop a form in consultation with 
the chief election officers of the States. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, the problem 
that I have with that is that the provision you're 
alluding to says that -- not that the State shall – not

that the commission "shall" require the information 
necessary to enable the appropriate State election 
official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that 
it "may" require only that information. Now, is it 
conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission 
may not require some information that is necessary to 
enable the appropriate State election official to assess 
eligibility, but that the State may not require it 
either? 

Is that a conceivable disposition of 
Congress? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think it is, 
Justice Scalia, but I think the problem with that is in 
the premise. I grant you that the statute says "may 
require," but it says "may require only," and I think 
the only fair way to read this provision is that the 
commission is to require the information that's 
necessary, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think "may require 
only" means shall require only? Is that -- is that your

think the statute would make very little sense if the 
EAC discharged its statutory responsibility by having a 
Federal form that required nothing other than the name. 
That wouldn't be within anybody's conceivable conception 
of a rational objective of Congress that would enable 
the EAC to satisfy --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It would not be a problem 
if the State could require it. It would not be a 
problem. When -- when the commission fails to do 
what -- what enables the State to assess qualifications, 
the State will do it. No problem. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: But I think the whole point 
of this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started, 
with all due respect -- is to come forward with a 
Federal form that streamlines the process of 
registration for applicants. And if the regime that 
resulted were one in which the Federal form served very 
little purpose other than to set a floor, but then each 
of the 50 States could superimpose whatever additional 
requirements they wanted to, I think that would largely 
defeat the entire purpose of the Federal form. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And that's the grand 
purpose -- to go back to your -- I see that as your 
grand purpose. That's the grand purpose argument. And 
then there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you

started to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do 
with (b). It says may require only such identifying 
information. So I thought, well, they could require 
less, less than what's necessary. They could. It says 
you can't require more. They could require less. 

But suppose they put a statement in and they 
say, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do 
with citizenship: This is what is necessary. No more. 
But we've done everything that is necessary. Then could 
a State come along and say, we think more is necessary? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice 
Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And it's the word 
"necessary" that you thought -- that that would be 
dependent upon? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Coupled with the statutory 
objective because what this provision says is that the 
EAC, in consultation with the States, is supposed to 
create a form that imposes the following burden on 
individuals, on individuals. That's the key. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know I'm not -- I'm 
just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to 
think up was this --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. 
JUSTICE BREYER: It does say "may require

only" – 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct. 
JUSTICE BREYER: -- "that which is 

necessary." So if they said -- and this what is 
necessary. Fine. Pretty tough for the State to say I'm 
going to add some things. But the very next subsection 
does use the words "shall include." So I wonder -- and 
that has to do with citizenship. So I wonder if that is 
a statement by Congress that in respect to citizenship, 
that is what is necessary. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I do think that that's what 
Congress contemplated was necessary, but it's not to the 
exclusion of this, which is that if a State comes 
forward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with 
responsibility for defining the contents of the Federal 
form, and says we think something more is necessary. 
Take a look at what we want to submit to you, and you 
should amend the Federal form, or you should at least 
amend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to 
include this requirement in it, the EAC could make that 
determination. 

Congress made that responsibility --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, I think 

General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the 
Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the

Commission didn't act on it. Only the legal director. 

So how could they get court review of an agency decision 

that was never made? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: No, Justice -- Justice 

Ginsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General 

Horne will disagree with this, the executive director 

initially responded to the request by rejecting it, but 

it did go to the full Commission, and at that point, 

there was a fully-constituted Commission. The 

Commission divided by a vote of 2-2. 

And so in that instance, the Commission took 

no action. But a 2-2 vote is a -- qualifies as a 

rejection. And that is something that could --

potentially could have been the subject of judicial 

review. Now, I'm obviously not going to give away any 

Federal defenses, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And since you believe 

that "may require only" means "shall require only," in 

judicial review, the determination before the -- the Court 

would be whether indeed this information is necessary to 

enable the State to assess the qualifications, right? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the district court here 

certainly thought that was necessary. So you're going 

to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to

be -- the next time somebody does challenge the 
Commission determination in court under the 
Administrative Procedure Act. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I mean, obviously, I'd 
respectfully disagree with that. I think we'll be in 
perfectly good shape. And I think part of the reason is 
that this -- requiring a statement under penalty of 
perjury is the traditional way in which States enforce 
their qualifications. 

The legislative history shows that Congress 
understood that that was the traditional way. What the 
State seeks to do here is do something over and above 
the traditional way to enforce qualifications. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As -- as Louisiana 
has done. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Louisiana is not --
is not citizenship-specific, Your Honor, as Ms. Millett 
was pointing out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's certainly 
things that were not required on the Federal form. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. And that 
was submitted to the EAC, and the EAC approved of it. 
And I think that's the critical distinction here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 
consistent with the statutory purpose to streamline

registration? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Because the statute -- the 
statute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not 
an objective to the exclusion of all other objectives. 
And the EAC is charged with balancing the various 
competing statutory objectives. And it concluded in – 
with respect to the Louisiana submission -- that that one 
was okay. I do think that's different. A, because the 
EAC approved of it; and B, because the specific forms of 
identification that are outlined in Louisiana addition 
were exactly those forms of identification that Congress 
already said was okay at either the registration stage 
or the voting stage. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You got to stop saying the 
Commission approved of it. 2-2 is not approving. You 
could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think we are 
talking about two different things, Justice Scalia. I'm 
talking about Louisiana. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
MR. SRINIVASAN: I was trying to answer the 

Chief Justice's question. 
In Arizona, it was 2-2. 
Now, I want to point out one other critical 

feature of the statute, and General Horne alluded to

this and said that there's no way to look in the statute 
and see a distinction between on one hand what the 
individuals can be required to provide, and on the other 
hand what the State can then do with the individual 
information to crosscheck it. 

And the statute presupposes that the State 
can conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the 
information that the individual supplies. And maybe the 
critical provision to see that is at page 19A of the 
appendix to the government's brief. And that's a 
provision that deals with a different qualification, 
felony history. But it operates on this assumption that 
States can conduct their own investigation, which makes 
all the sense in the world. 

This one -- this provision that's in 
subsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973 
gg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States 
Attorney's Offices that when there is a Federal 
conviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Offices are 
supposed to give written notice of that conviction to 
the chief State election official. 

And what's the State -- chief State election 
official going to do with that? Well of course, what 
they're going to do is they're going to take a look at 
the Federal form, they're going to see what the

individual said about their felony history, and they're 
going to crosscheck it – against the information that 
they got from the United States Attorney -- to make sure 
that the information on the form is accurate. 

JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you a question 
that I asked Ms. Millett? Does the United States think 
that the Arizona form is illegal? And if it is not, 
what sense does it make to have a system in which 
whether or not someone will successfully register 
depends on the happenstance of the particular form that 
the person fills out. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Here is the sense it would 
make -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add 
to the Federal requirements on its own State form, the 
sense it would make is this: That the Federal form 
always operates as a floor. 

It's always there for somebody to use to 
register, regardless of what the State form might do in 
addition. And that has -- I take Your Honor's 
assumption -- if I can just briefly finish -- I 
understand Your Honor's point that there is a practical 
question about whether that would ever be practical or 
useful, given that an individual will want to use the 
State form for State, local and Federal elections, but 
there is also the -- the well-understood practice of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HORNE: Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll 
apologize in advance for talking really quickly. The --
my friend says in discussing Section 7(b)(1) that it 
would not be rational to require only the signature. 
But that's exactly what they did. All they required was 
the signature, and 7(b)(1) has nothing to do with that; 
7(b)(2) requires a signature. So what the EAC chose to 
do under 7(b)(1) was exactly nothing, zero, which --
which emphasizes the point that this is the 
responsibility of the States, and that's how they 
understood it. 

With respect to the license having -- we 
cited ARS Section 28-3173, an Arizona statute in our 
reply brief that provides that you -- you must renew 
every 12 years. So by 2004, the problem that my friend 
spoke about was completely erased. Everybody had a new 
license which would be sufficient for this purpose, 100

percent. 

They admit that we can reject applications 
by reference to other -- by reference to other 
documentation, but they try to draw a distinction 
between that and asking the person to write down the 
driver's license number. But there is nothing in the 
statute that justifies that distinction. A reference to 
criminal history has nothing to do with -- with whether 
or not there is a distinction with respect to 
citizenship between looking at other documents and 
asking the person for their driver's license numbers. 
In both cases, it's something outside of the form and 
they have admitted we can go outside the form. 

With respect to legislative history, Your 
Honor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in 
your question was, it's only in one place. There are a 
lot of other places that go the other way. So we cannot 
conclude from that one place what the majority of 
Congress expected. 

With respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress 
had another opportunity to expressly state that the 
State could not look to external evidence and ask for 
additional evidence, and they chose not to do that. And 
so I would say that HAVA is further evidence that 
Congress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for

additional information to fulfill our function, if it's

With respect to the Siebold case, the court 
in Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption 
unless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent 
of that conflict, and in that connection -- one last 
sentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible 
interpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say 
one should not choose the interpretation that results in 
preemption, and the same thing applies with respect to 
the canon of constitutional accordance. 

Thank you, Your Honor. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 
The case is submitted.
