CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 

in Ayers versus Belmontes.

 Mr. Johnson. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case concerns the constitutional 

sufficiency of California's catchall factor (k) 

instruction, which was given in the penalty-phase portion 

of California capital cases, and which directed the jurors 

to consider any other circumstance that extenuates the 

gravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse 

for the crime. 

In this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 

held that this instruction violates the Eighth Amendment 

because it allegedly misled the jurors to believe they 

could not consider so-called forward-looking evidence that 

did not relate directly to the defendant's actual 

culpability for the crime itself. 

In the State's view, the Ninth Circuit's 

conclusion is fundamentally flawed, because it rests on an 

illusory distinction between different forms of character

evidence in a way that is inconsistent with this Court's 

prior decisions in California -- or Boyde versus 

California and Brown versus Payton.

 In Boyde, this Court addressed, and rejected, a 

virtually identical challenge to the factor (k), and 

concluded that this instruction did, in fact, allow jurors 

to consider non-crime-related evidence; specifically, it 

allowed the jurors to consider evidence of the defendant's 

background and character. There was nothing in the Boyde 

decision to support the Ninth Circuit's distinction 

between different forms of character evidence. In fact, 

Boyde implicitly acknowledged that the factor (k) would, 

in fact, be understood to encompass Belmontes' good 

character evidence, in this case, because, for all 

practical purposes, there is no meaningful distinction 

between the nature of the background and character offered 

in Boyde and the nature of the background --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Johnson, would you comment 

on the footnote on the -- on the -- drawing the 

distinction with regard to the dance contest that the 

defendant won in that case, between -- it's over here; I'm 

asking the question -- between facts that occurred before 

the crime and facts that might have occurred after. 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. In footnote 5, 

this Court addressed a contention, raised for the first

time in argument, that Boyde's evidence might be 

admissible under Skipper versus South Carolina, and this 

Court distinguished Boyde from Skipper, for a couple of 

reasons. First, as the -- as Your Honor pointed out, the 

evidence in this case related to good-character evidence, 

events that occurred before the crime itself, unlike in 

Skipper, which dealt with post-crime events. The Court 

also pointed out that the evidence in Boyde -- his dancing 

achievement, his good character evidence in that case --

was not offered for the specific inference that the 

evidence in Skipper was offered. The Court, in footnote 5 

-- and in the opinion, in general, in Boyde -- nonetheless 

found that this evidence did, in fact, constitute good-

character evidence of the -- of the defendant's present 

good character, because it showed that his crime was an 

aberration from otherwise good character. Or, as Justice 

Marshall put it in his dissenting opinion, that Boyde had 

redeeming qualities, which is a decidedly forward-looking 

consideration.

 And, as I was saying, the evidence in this case, 

and in Boyde --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be forward-

looking, does it? I mean, I thought we've said "so long 

as it can be taken into account in any manner," whether 

backward-looking or forward-looking. Haven't we said

that, explicitly? 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes Your Honor. The -- and, in 

fact, the Court has, in Franklin versus Linite, said that 

they have not distinguished between different forms of 

character evidence. And I understand that, in the past, 

we've always discussed background and character evidence 

as sort of the same thing. In this case, however, the 

Ninth Circuit's conclusion does, in fact, rest on a 

distinction between different forms of backward-looking 

and forward-looking character --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well it was --

MR. JOHNSON: -- evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it was addressing itself to 

the fact -- to the words of the factor (k) instruction. 

How does post-crime prison conduct reduce the seriousness 

of a previous crime? 

MR. JOHNSON: It does not -- it does not relate 

to the seriousness of the -- of the crime at all. The --

Boyde's dancing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it has to relate 

to the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor 

(k), doesn't it? 

MR. JOHNSON: It would relate to the gravity --

to circumstances that extenuate the gravity of the crime, 

for purposes of a jury's sentencing determination. And

the point I'd like to make on that point is this, Your 

Honor. In California, jurors are well aware what their 

task is at a sentencing determination. In California, the 

guilt and the death eligibility determinations are made 

during the guilt-phase trial and the jurors are expressly 

told, during the penalty-phase trial, that their lone 

determination, their one concern, is to decide between a 

sentence of death or a sentence of life without the 

possibility of parole. And, in that light, the jurors are 

very well aware that their only determination in a 

California case is to make a moral, normative 

determination, a single normal -- moral normative 

determination, as to whether this man, this defendant 

standing before them in this Court today, deserves death 

or life without possibility --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, now, do you --

MR. JOHNSON: -- of parole. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do you have an instruction 

that supports what you've just told us, that the jury is 

told they have to make a single moral determination? Is 

that what the court instructed the jury? Or was --

MR. JOHNSON: No, that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- instructed in items of 

factor (k)?

 MR. JOHNSON: The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think you have to rest 

on your argument, that what we are talking about is the 

gravity of his crime "for purposes of sentencing." I 

understand that argument. But then, when you go on to 

make the argument you just made, the jury understands it 

is a single moral judgment, what -- is there some specific 

instruction you can point to, other than the factor (k) 

instruction itself? 

MR. JOHNSON: No, they are -- and I may have 

been misleading. The jurors are expressly instructed that 

is -- that it is their duty to determine, and their only 

duty to determine, whether the defendant should receive 

life or death and parole, and -- or life without the 

possibility of parole -- and in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

MR. JOHNSON: -- light of that determination, 

jurors, naturally, would understand that they could take 

into account anything that extenuated the gravity of the 

crime. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what they 

were told, right? They're instructed that the mitigating 

circumstances, including factor (k), are merely examples, 

right? 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes. In this -- yes. In --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about that?

This case is unusual, because it has that separate 

instruction that, "The mitigating circumstances are merely 

examples, and you should pay careful attention to those, 

but you may -- but you may rely on other mitigating 

circumstances." 

May I ask you, would it have been constitutional 

if the judge had added a sentence at the end of that 

instruction which said, "However, you may not consider 

anything mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of 

the crime"?

 MR. JOHNSON: It would have been constitutional, 

to the extent that it would have allowed the jurors to 

give some use whatsoever to Belmontes' proffered evidence 

in mitigation, and that's what this Court's prior cases 

has -- and, particularly, the various Texas cases have 

said that jurors must be given an avenue to make use of 

the evidence. In California --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure you've answered 

my question. Would it have been a constitutional addition 

to that instruction to say, "But I want to -- you to 

clearly understand that it is not to be considered 

mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime"? 

Would that have been permissible?

 MR. JOHNSON: It would appear to -- no. It 

would appear not to be, because --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because that would have 

foreclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence, 

right? 

MR. JOHNSON: It would have -- well, it would 

foreclose consideration of all present good-character 

evidence, I believe. It would -- it would have foreclosed 

the consideration of Boyde's evidence, of Payton's 

evidence. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, then the question in this 

case is whether the jury might have understood factor (k) 

to limit them to the consideration of factors that 

extenuate the gravity of the crime. 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, the -- yes, the question is 

whether the jurors would reasonably understand the 

instruction to preclude the consideration of 

constitutionally -- of relevant evidence. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This Court, in Payton, 

said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that 

evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime. 

So, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the 

lines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been 

perfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the 

crime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?

 MR. JOHNSON: Well, to the -- to the extent --

the jurors would have likely understood that, it -- that

instruction in Belmontes and in Payton, to extenuate the 

gravity of the crime for purposes of their sentencing 

determination --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what I thought 

your position was. And --

MR. JOHNSON: Yes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- then you back off of it, and 

you say, "extenuate the gravity" of the crime doesn't 

relate to anything that's after the crime. I would have 

-- I would have interpreted the phrase to mean "anything 

that justifies you in giving a lesser punishment for the 

crime." 

MR. JOHNSON: That's precisely my argument. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then your answer to 

Justice Stevens should have been different. 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, if -- and I apologize if I 

was misunderstood. My --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think --

MR. JOHNSON: -- question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the jury in this very 

case understood that, given the questions that were asked? 

MR. JOHNSON: Oh, yes, Your Honor. In this --

in this case, I -- there is certainly no reasonable 

likelihood that the jurors felt precluded, because, as was 

previously discussed, first there was this additional

instruction that supplemented the other instructions in 

this case that made it very clear that the aggravating 

factors, the various factors listed in the standard 

instruction A through G, that those were the -- they could 

only rely on those two for aggravating factors, but their 

understanding of mitigating factors was not limited. In 

fact, they were expressly told that the previous factors 

were merely examples. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- what 

actually went on? I mean, the jury first came in and 

said, "What if we can't decide? Can we decide by 

majority?" And then the question was asked, that seemed 

to indicate the jurors' understanding, that we take all 

those factors that you told us about, and we just take 

those factors into account. And there were clarifying 

instructions asked by the defense that were not given. 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, there -- to answer your 

questions, Your Honor, first, there was no indication at 

this conference that the jurors were, in fact, confused 

about whether they could consider any particular evidence 

as being mitigating. The conference itself was called to 

address, as you mentioned, the jurors' concern -- or the 

jurors' inquiry about the result -- what would happen if 

they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict in this case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be why they had

the conference, but they got into the colloquy that 

Justice Ginsburg described. And the last -- as I recall, 

the last reference to "factors," whether aggravating or 

mitigating, was simply in terms of the list, or "the 

listing," I guess the term was, so that the -- it seems to 

me at least, there's a fair argument on the other side of 

this case, that the last reference that the -- that the 

judge made to the jurors with respect to aggravation or 

mitigation was to refer to a listing. The listing itself 

didn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the 

instruction that you are not limited to the listed 

mitigating factors.

 So, the concern is that, because the last 

reference was to the list, that the list included factor 

(k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give 

-- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest 

emphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions 

in response to questions. Isn't it a pretty good argument 

that, in this case, there is -- there's a reasonable 

likelihood that the jurors went back to their task 

thinking that they were limited to the list? 

MR. JOHNSON: Respectfully, no, Your Honor. And 

the reason why is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I'm not necessarily 

saying that's my position, so you don't have to be

respectful to me about it. Just --

MR. JOHNSON: I'll be respectful anyhow, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- knock it down if you can. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Be respectful anyway. 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes. The point is, with this 

instruction conference, there -- the -- an argument that 

this reference to "the listing" reflected some 

unconstitutional -- or constitutionally restrictive view 

presupposes that the jurors reasonably would have 

misinterpreted the meaning of the factor (k); and there is 

nothing in there -- in any of these questions to put 

anybody on notice that that -- that they had any such 

concerns. And first --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except for the language 

of factor (k) itself. And if -- without some 

embellishment, isn't it a bit of a stretch to think that 

factor (k) goes as far as Skipper evidence? 

MR. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor, it's not a stretch 

at all, because any evidence relating to the defendant's 

background and character, his present character in court, 

could be seen as extenuating the gravity of the crime for 

sentencing purposes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- California itself 

recognized that there was a problem here of jury 

confusion. And now they have amended the provision so 

that it would be clear to any juror. 

MR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor, in 

People v. Easley the California --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or maybe they thought that was 

a problem of Ninth Circuit confusion rather than jury 

confusion. 

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, having that opinion in 

front of them, you would think they would amend it, of 

course, to prevent that kind of decision again. 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, they -- what they were doing 

was certainly a prophylactic measure here, to -- they 

recognized that perhaps there might be some concern of 

confusion, and so they wanted to forestall any chance of 

that happening. But notably, this case and -- this case, 

and no other California Supreme Court case, has found that 

the factor (k) instruction, the pre-Easley version of it, 

by itself, did mislead the jurors. In fact, the Supreme 

Court, in this case, came down 7-0 in support of the 

conclusion that the jurors were properly told about the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does this factor (k) 

come from? What was the source of it?

MR. JOHNSON: The factor (k), as the entire 

standard instruction given in these cases, recites 

verbatim the language of the California statute, which is 

California penal code section 190.3. And, interestingly 

enough, the -- not only the California Supreme Court, but 

this Court, implicitly has -- have both said that not only 

the California statute, but the instruction -- this 

standard instruction, upon -- which is based on the 

statute, do allow consideration of all relevant mitigating 

factors. In fact, as far back as 1983, in this Court's 

California v. Ramos decision, this Court stated, albeit in 

dicta, that the factor (k) -- or that the standard 

instruction would allow consideration of background and 

character evidence; and, in fact, the Court stated, in 

footnote 20 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Johnson, I don't mean 

to interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your

MR. JOHNSON: Okay.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- because you -- I think you 

changed your answer after Justice -- the Chief Justice and 

Justice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake.

 Are you -- is it your position that it would be 

constitutional to instruct the jury that, "You may not

consider any evidence mitigating, unless it extenuates the 

gravity of the crime"? 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor, because the 

jurors would -- even if that instruction were given, the 

jurors would understand that an instruction that 

extenuates the gravity of the crime would encompass any 

relevant character evidence. And this Court has made 

these determinations all the time. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is --

MR. JOHNSON: That --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that answer consistent with 

the position of defense counsel, who said he would not 

insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them 

that the religious conversion of the defendant did not 

extenuate the gravity of the crime? 

MR. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor. What the -- what 

the counsel actually said was that the defendant's 

religious conversion did not provide an excuse for the 

crime itself. And, in fact, that argument was, itself, 

echoing the language of the factor (k) instruction, which 

of course --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's right. 

MR. JOHNSON: -- directs the jurors to consider 

any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the 

crime, even though it's not a legal excuse for the crime.

And so, counsel was dovetailing his very effective 

argument with the -- with the instruction itself. And 

what's significant here is that, like in Payton, like in 

Boyde, this case involved virtually all of Belmontes' 

penalty-phase evidence. And the entire main thrust of his 

argument to the jury was that he could not make it on the 

outside, but he could fit in the system and contribute to 

society in the future, if given a chance on the inside. 

And again, as was true in Boyde and Payton --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If that were true would that 

have extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get 

along in prison? 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes, for purposes of jurors -- at 

jury's sentencing determination, absolutely, because it 

would be viewed as good-character evidence, precisely --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you think juries would 

clearly understand that what he did in the future in 

prison would extenuate the gravity of the crime. 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor, because, in light 

of everything that's been said and done in this trial, as 

the Boyde Court noted, jurors do not parse instructions 

for subtle shades of meaning; they understand instructions 

in a commonsense manner, and in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The prosecutor didn't 

object to any of this mitigating -- mitigation evidence

that was submitted by the defendant, did he? 

MR. JOHNSON: The prosecutor objected to none of 

this evidence. And, in fact, the prosecutor, in closing 

statement, argued that the -- not only could the jurors 

consider Belmontes' forward-looking prospects, but the 

jurors should consider those prospects. So, in this case 

what we have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the prosecutor's 

closing was schizophrenic, because he said, "But really 

this shouldn't matter."

 MR. JOHNSON: He acknowledged it was something 

that -- this argument was something that was proper for 

consideration, but -- however, he argued that the evidence 

of Belmontes' religious conversion, which happens -- you 

know, and then lapsed immediately before he committed the 

murder, in this case -- was very weak evidence. But he 

did, nonetheless, tell the jurors that they could consider 

Belmontes' prior character as bearing on his present 

character now. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But, didn't he go beyond saying 

it was weak? He did say that, but didn't he say that he 

doubted that it fit within (k)?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. JOHNSON: He's -- yes, the prosecutor first 

stated that the factor (k) was a catchall, a true

catchall. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, the prosecutor, I take it, 

would have answered Justice Stevens's question the other 

way. The prosecutor would have said, "Well, no, this 

probably would not be understood by the jurors to refer to 

the gravity of the offense." 

MR. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor, because in the --

in the previous page, the prosecutor did State that it was 

a catchall, you know, which, by implication, incorporates 

everything, but -- and the prosecutor's argument, that, 

"I'm not sure if it fits in there," signifies that there 

-- not that the evidence -- that such evidence could not 

be considered as mitigating as a -- in a general matter, 

but that -- just that the religious evidence in this case 

was extremely weak, to the point of having, as a practical 

purpose, no mitigating value. The prosecutor followed 

that comment. I'm not sure it fits in there, in next 

breath, with, "It's" -- something to the effect of, "It's 

no secret that Belmontes' religious evidence is pretty 

shaky here," and went on to conclude that. But then, in 

the next breath, he said, "But, nonetheless, this is 

something that's proper for you to consider." 

And, again, reasonable jurors, hearing this --

having been given the instruction here -- would reasonably 

interpret this -- all of this evidence as something they

could use to extenuate the gravity of the crime. And 

particularly in this context, because, like in Boyde, in 

addition to this factor (k), the standard instruction 

directed the jurors to consider all the evidence. The 

first factor of the enumerated factors -- (a) through (g), 

in this case -- told the jurors that they should -- that 

they should focus on -- that the first thing to consider 

was the -- or the circumstances of the crime itself. 

The final factor, therefore, that any other 

circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime 

would clearly be understood to relate to matters outside 

the crime itself. And, to the extent that there was any 

ambiguity about the meaning of that in this particular 

case, the argument by counsel, the additional instruction 

here, clarified that to the point that there is certainly 

no reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt that they 

were constrained in considering any mitigating evidence in 

any way they thought fit. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Johnson, when I asked you 

about the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a 

California statutory cite, but is there -- does it come 

from any model code? Does any other State have such a 

provision? How widespread is it? 

MR. JOHNSON: Of the -- the actual wording of 

this instruction?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many States have an 

instruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances 

of the crime? 

MR. JOHNSON: I'm not sure, Your Honor. I'm not 

sure. I know that this -- that this instruction itself 

came from the statute, which, in turn, was adopted from 

the California Briggs initiative in the 1978 statute. I'm 

not aware of any -- of any other States -- there may or 

may not be -- who have adopted the same statutory model 

that California has. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- California hasn't 

had it since 1983, right? 

MR. JOHNSON: Pardon me, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: California hasn't used this 

instruction since 1983. 

MR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor. After 

People v. Easely, the California Supreme Court augmented 

the instruction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, is this a one-of-a-kind 

case? I mean, you said, in your brief, that the Ninth 

Circuit decision threatens many other valid California 

death judgments. But these would all have to be rather 

ancient cases. 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes. And, unfortunately, there's

this date, I can't give you an actual -- an absolute 

number, but I believe there is approximately 15 cases 

pending, like this one, that involve the factor (k) 

instruction -- this factor (k) instruction -- that involve 

evidence of -- somehow, future-looking evidence, which --

all character evidence, frankly, is future-looking --

convictions are more than -- more than 23 years old? 

MR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately, 

there's -- they're -- I believe all of them are being 

litigated now in the Federal court system in California.

 If you have no further questions, I guess I'll 

reserve the rest of my time.

MR. MULTHAUP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Here is Respondent's 60-second nutshell summary 

of our core position. This case does not turn on the 

constitutional factor (k) standing alone. Rather, it 

turns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test, 

to the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during 

the arguments, instructions to deliberations at the 

penalty trial of this case. 

Here are the two key components of our claim. 

During arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the 

jury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious 

experience was not covered by factor (k). However, both 

counsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered 

anyway. Now, this is unusual, because, of all -- of all 

the things that the district attorney and the defense 

counsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on, 

and it's likely that the jury would have taken note of 

that. 

The case then proceeded to instructions and 

deliberations. The jury came back to court, announced 

that they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority 

favoring life. The turning point occurred when one juror, 

Juror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the 

specific list of factors previously given was the only

base -- was the only framework within which the penalty 

decision could be made. At that point, the trial court 

had a constitutional obligation to disabuse Juror Hern and 

the rest of the assembled jurors of that misapprehension 

and, at the very least, to reinstruct the jurors that the 

enumerated factors were merely illustrative and not 

exhaustive, and instruct the jurors that the jury had to 

consider all of the mitigating evidence. 

The trial court did neither, with the result 

that the jury all too likely returned to its deliberations 

with the belief that the only factors -- the only matters 

they considered -- could consider were those encompassed 

within the enumerated factors, and believing -- based on 

counsel's prior arguments -- that factor (k) did not 

include the Youth Authority religious-experience evidence. 

JUSTICE ALITO: When did the defense counsel say 

that this evidence did not fit within factor (k)? 

MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, it occurred in 

argument. And my counsel -- esteemed co-counsel will give 

me the exact page -- but it occurred in the context -- the 

context -- during the prosecutor's argument, the 

prosecutor said to the jury that, "I suspect" -- and then 

he, for emphasis, said, "I can't imagine that you won't be 

told that the religious-conversion evidence doesn't fit 

within factor (k)." And, at that point, he expressed

reservations, doubts, as to whether it did fit in factor 

(k) or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- any other factor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that matter? 

Because the jury was told that the factors were merely 

examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider. 

MR. MULTHAUP: I'm more than --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It probably didn't fit 

into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Well, it has -- if it -- oh, Your 

Honor, the -- calling your -- or you've called my 

attention to the instruction that said that the set -- in 

the prior set of -- or in the general set of instructions, 

that the enumerated factors were merely illustrative. 

Now, that instruction had a cloud of confusion surrounding 

it, because the way it was phrased was, the Court said, 

"The mitigating factors that I have expressed to you are 

illustrative." There was no list of mitigating factors. 

There was only a single list, unitary list, of factors 

that could be either aggravating or mitigating, depending 

on a jury's decision. 

The instruction that you're referring to, Your 

Honor, was a -- was the result of the trial court denying 

some, and granting some, parts of the special instructions

requested by the defense. And so, when the trial court 

said to the jury, "The list of mitigating factors is 

illustrative only," I -- we, who know the background of 

this, understand what -- the point he was trying to make, 

but the jury, hearing it, they would think, very 

reasonably, "There's no list of mitigating factors." 

JUSTICE ALITO: You said this case is different 

because both counsel told the jury that the evidence that 

you're relying on did not fit within factor (k). And I'm 

not sure what you're referring to. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Okay. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Now, as to defense counsel, are 

you referring to what you quoted on page 9 of your brief, 

where he says, "I'm not going to insult you" -- what you 

highlighted on page 9 -- "I'm not going to insult you by 

telling you I think it excuses, in any way, what happened 

here"? That's what you -- is that what you're referring 

to? 

MR. MULTHAUP: That's one of the passages that I 

am referring to, and it came as a direct response to the 

District Attorney, in effect, calling out the defense 

attorney, "I can't imagine that you won't be told that 

this fits within factor (k)." So, at that point, the 

defense counsel had to make a decision, "Okay, either I 

have to argue that my Skipper evidence is -- my square peg

of Skipper evidence has to fit in the round hole of" --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't he --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- "factor (k)" --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- saying something very 

different there? He isn't -- he's not saying, "This 

doesn't fit within factor (k)." And he makes no reference 

to factor (k). He says nothing about "extenuating." He 

says "excuses." Isn't that something very different, 

"excusing" the crime? 

MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, this Court has used 

the terms "extenuate" and "excuse" as synonyms in Boyde 

and --

JUSTICE ALITO: If you had been --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- in Payton with --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- if you were arguing this to 

the jury, would you have said, "You know, my client earned 

a position of responsibility on the fire crew that 

patrolled the Sierra Foothills, and, therefore, that 

excuses the crime that you've found that he committed 

here"? 

MR. MULTHAUP: No. No. The --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see, anywhere in Mr. 

Schick's statement, at least from 165 to 170, where he 

says what you said he said. Now, maybe he says it some

-- what I have him as saying is that -- he says, for 

example, several times, "The presence -- I don't suggest 

that the -- that the presence of religion, in itself, is 

totally mitigating." Well, it certainly wasn't, in this 

instance. I gather I'm right. Am I right in thinking 

that all this religious conversion took place before he 

murdered the girl? So, this is not a case of your trying 

to get some evidence that took place after the crime.

 MR. MULTHAUP: That's right. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- then --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that's right, then maybe it 

does more easily fit within factor (k). The prosecutor 

told the jury they should consider it, or they could. The 

judge told the jury they could consider it -- it sounded 

as -- says, "You take it -- this is an example" -- he 

says, "It's an example in factor (k)." Maybe he's wrong, 

but they certainly likely think they can consider it. And 

Mr. Schick doesn't say it's not in factor (k). At least, 

I don't see it. That's why I'm asking. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, the whole point of 

factor (k) is that -- evidence that's an excuse for the 

crime. And if we're --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I know the point of 

factor (k). I'm trying to be absolutely certain, before

thinking --

MR. MULTHAUP: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- he didn't say it, that I've 

made every effort to get from you the place where -- that 

this -- where the defense counsel says, "Jury, I agree, 

you cannot put this into factor (k)." 

MR. MULTHAUP: Okay. And, Your Honor, looking 

at it in context, given the district attorney's argument, 

the district attorney says, "I can't imagine you won't be 

told that it doesn't -- that it -- that it doesn't fit 

within factor (k)." So, the defense attorney gets up and 

says, "I'm -- I am going to tell you that it doesn't 

within -- fit within factor (k). It doesn't" --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- "constitute" --

MR. MULTHAUP: "It doesn't excuse, in any way," 

Your Honor. And we -- as a matter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but, in a sense, that's 

right, just like remorse. Remorse doesn't excuse the 

crime. It's a consideration that you take into account in 

assessing the gravity of the crime for purposes of 

punishment. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Okay. Your Honor, this is a 

point of, perhaps, semantics. But the -- by the time you 

get to penalty phase, there's nothing to excuse the crime, 

in the sense of self-defense or "not guilty by reason of 

insanity." The only thing --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- "in any way." 

MR. MULTHAUP: It does say "in any way."

your brief. The --

JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's on 166 of the joint 

appendix. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Thank you. 

And if the -- if trial counsel was trying to 

make the point that, "Well, it doesn't constitute a legal 

excuse, but it does constitute a partial excuse or some 

kind of mitigating evidence under this factor," he would

have put that in there. The clear import, from the 

context here, is that defense counsel was not trying to 

sell the jury a position that was, on its face, untenable, 

but, rather, to acknowledge that it did not fit within the 

"excuse the gravity of the crime" factor, which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only if you think that excusing 

the crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same 

thing, which I don't really think. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Well, Your Honor, there's two --

I'd like to make two responses to that. First of all, 

this Court has used those terms interchangeably, in Boyde 

and Payton, with respect to mitigating evidence. Second 

of all, let's -- as a -- as a practical matter, we have a 

defense attorney arguing a case to a jury in a Central 

Valley California county. And if the defense attorney has 

a choice between two synonyms, one which is used in common 

parlance, "excuse," and one which is not used in common 

parlance, "extenuate," it hardly constitutes an -- a 

defect or concession on his part if he were to say, "This 

does not excuse the crime in any way." That's plain 

speaking to a jury, that -- and what he -- what he --

counsel --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't a jury think all 

this evidence must have some purpose? The only purpose it 

could have is to -- is to propel us toward life rather

than death. I mean, the bulk of the evidence at the 

sentencing phase -- wasn't it? -- was how he behaved when 

he was a prisoner before.

 MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, not -- that's not 

exactly what happened at penalty phase here. This is not 

a case like Boyde, where all the evidence was background 

and character evidence, and it's not a case like Payton, 

where the only evidence was a post-crime conversion. This 

case involved a mixture of evidence, where first there was 

the grandfather who testified to what a bad upbringing he 

had, traditional background and character evidence. The 

mother testified to her undying love for her son, 

traditional evidence. Friends testified to his good 

characteristics. And then, at the end, there was a clear 

segment that related to his good performance in Youth 

Authority and his religious conversion. So, it was only a 

-- it was a partial part of -- partial part of the 

penalty-phase presentation, but it certainly wasn't the 

entire presentation, as it was in Boyde and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even so, there was --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- Payton.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there was extensive 

testimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison 

setting.

 MR. MULTHAUP: Well, certainly, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the jury must have 

thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that 

evidence in. And what reason could it be, other than to 

show that, if he is given life, he will be a good 

prisoner?

 MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, that's a very 

logical, sensible thing for the jury to have thought. And 

now I'd like to drop the second shoe of the key components 

of our claim. The first shoe was the arguments of counsel 

that we've discussed the various permutations on. The 

most likely -- so, the jury began deliberating based on 

the instructions and the arguments that they had -- that 

they had had. And it's entirely likely that when the jury 

was favoring a life verdict during the first part of their 

deliberations, Belmontes' prospects for good behavior in 

prison and contributions were part of the debate.

 When Juror Hern asked for judicial clarification 

-- not clarification, confirmation -- of a very specific 

view that only the enumerated factors could be considered 

in the penalty-phase deliberations, the jury -- and the 

trial court assented without qualification to that -- at 

that point, the jury would have very likely thought, "The 

trial court who holds a position of great deference to us, 

much more than most other authority figures we have in our 

life, just told us what the marching orders are here.

This is the framework for decision." 

Now, what happened during the -- during the 

trial is the defense -- and I'm suggesting what the jury 

might have thought, in relation to your question -- that, 

"The defense attorney was taking his best shot for his 

client, pushing the envelope, maybe went over the top a 

little bit. But defense attorneys do that. The 

prosecutor was being a very decent stand-up kind of 

person, and -- but, right now, when we get down to the 

business of making the decision, we have to follow the 

rules. And the rules are what the -- are what the -- are 

what Judge Gisson just confirmed to us, that we are 

limited to the enumerated factors, and factor (k) does not 

include the Skipper evidence, because that was explained 

to us by counsel."

 I would like to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you move on, 

Counsel --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- don't you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- don't you -- excuse me. 

Excuse me.

address the Teague question a little bit? You -- you're 

entitled to this new rule adopted by the Court of Appeals

only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the 

judgment became final. Isn't that kind of a hard argument 

to make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v. 

Payton? 

MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, I don't see -- as to 

the first part of Your Honor's question, I don't believe 

that there is any new rule whatsoever in the Ninth Circuit 

opinion. It's a straightforward application of Boyde to 

the totality of circumstances that occurred. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of Boyde? It's 

straightforward application of Boyde? 

MR. MULTHAUP: Yes. The Ninth Circuit began 

with Boyde, and it went through all of the proceedings at 

trial, and concluded that there was a reasonable 

likelihood that the jury didn't consider Skipper evidence. 

And that's what we're asking this Court to do, the exact 

same -- applying the Boyde test to the rule -- the rule of 

decision that was clearly established by this Court as of 

1986, and reiterated and expanded by this Court in 1987, 

with Skipper. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what has to be clear 

under Teague is not just the rule, but the rule's 

application in circumstances like this. There are a lot 

of rules that are clear, but if Teague means anything at 

all it has to mean that you should have known that, in

this case, the rule would produce this result. So it's 

not enough to say that there was a rule. There are a lot 

of rules out there, but the question is whether the 

outcome should have been clear at the time. Isn't that 

what Teague means? 

MR. MULTHAUP: Certainly, Your Honor. And 

applying -- because when we -- when we take a look at 

Penry I, this Court said -- in response to a Teague 

argument by the attorney general, this Court held that 

Penry got past the threshold Teague issue because of -- at 

the time of the finality of his direct appeal, in 1986, 

the rule was well-established that the sentencer may not 

be precluded from considering relevant evidence in 

mitigation, by Lockett, Eddings, and others. So if that 

was a firmly established rule as of 1986 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Penry was 

considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in 

Graham versus Collins, though. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Graham v. Collins was an AEDPA 

case, as was Payton. So, we have a very, very different 

standard of review. And, if I may, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know Payton was an 

AEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not 

unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read 

instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be

considered. And I would have thought, if it was not 

unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary 

reading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit 

adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated 

by existing precedent. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Ah. Well, the -- our position in 

relation to that is, the direct quote from -- direct quote 

from Payton itself, in which the Court said that, assuming 

the California Supreme Court was incorrect, Payton, 

nonetheless, loses. Here we're arguing that the 

California Supreme Court was incorrect, and, therefore, 

Belmontes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because if it was --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- should win.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because, even if 

incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable. And I'm just 

having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position 

is dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180 

degrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this 

Court as reasonable. 

MR. MULTHAUP: The unusual facts of this case 

are much stronger in favor of relief under the Boyde test 

than were those in Payton. Therefore, applying the 

longstanding rule of Lockett and Eddings to the different, 

and more compelling, facts of this case, there is no

reason -- there is every reason to provide Belmontes 

relief, where it was denied to Payton. And there's no 

reason to believe that the California Supreme Court was 

being incorrect, but reasonable, in -- to presume, or 

find, based on Payton, that the California Supreme Court 

was being incorrect, but reasonable, in this case. 

Penry could not have won his case under the --

under the -- that particular analysis, because the Texas

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Graham didn't win his 

case. 

MR. MULTHAUP: And Payton didn't win either, but 

we're operating under the prior regime. So -- I 

understand the -- the Court is suggesting, I believe, that 

somehow Payton is a sword, in some sense, to deny relief 

as to all California defendants under penalty-phase 

instructional claims cited by the California Supreme 

Court, even under different facts and under more egregious 

circumstances. And I -- I may have -- be misinterpreting 

the Court's argument, but I would argue that there are any 

number of scenarios, notwithstanding Payton, that would 

require relief under the pre-AEDPA standards when you 

apply the test of Boyde to all the circumstances of the

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Multhaup, one aspect of 

your argument I wish you would clarify, and that's in your 

brief at page 20, footnote 3. As I understand it, you are 

saying -- you are not challenging factor -- the factor (k) 

instruction as excluding Skipper evidence. Your challenge 

is limited to this particular case. Is that what you're 

saying in that footnote?

 MR. MULTHAUP: Yes, Your Honor. I'm not here to 

refight the battle of Boyde. You know, I spilled tons of 

hours of time and printer's ink in an amicus brief in 

1989, and I understand the concept of "you lose." What we 

are arguing is that the Boyde test should be applied to 

the circumstances of this case, and that factor (k), 

standing alone, in a -- in a case where defendant relies 

on Skipper evidence, does not warrant relief by that fact 

alone. Here we have much more than that fact which, under 

Boyde, does call for relief.

 I would like to give --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- Respondent's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the "much more" is the 

questions that the jury asked? 

MR. MULTHAUP: The "much more" includes the 

arguments by counsel, which, notwithstanding different --

reasonably differing views of it, does put a context on 

the -- put into context what defense counsel was arguing. 

We have the confusion inherent in the instruction that the 

Court gave the -- the putatively proper instruction about 

them being illustrative rather than exhaustive. We have 

the colloquy during the penalty deliberations. We have 

Juror Hailstone's follow-up question regarding the 

possibility of considering the availability of psychiatric 

treatment, which was explicitly rejected, and very likely 

confirming the message that had just been given to -- via 

the answer to Juror Hern's case, that only the enumerated 

factors can be considered. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no 

evidence on that question presented, right? The reason 

that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be 

considered is because neither party had put evidence on 

that question before the jury. 

MR. MULTHAUP: Well, Your Honor, you know that, 

because you're the Chief Justice, but the people of San 

Joaquin County had no idea that that was the reason, and 

if not explained --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. It's a question 

of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury. The 

jurors couldn't consider that, because it was the -- quite 

proper for the trial judge to say, "You can't consider

that, because there was no evidence on it."

 MR. MULTHAUP: It would have been perfectly 

proper for the trial court to say, "You can't consider 

that, because" -- appended exactly the -- the explanation 

that you gave. And the jurors would have understood that 

they had to consider the evidence presented, but they 

couldn't speculate about other things. If, at the crucial 

point in the proceedings, the trial court had said, "Juror 

Hern, you do have to pay attention to those factors, but 

they're illustrative rather than exhaustive, and you must 

consider all of Belmontes' evidence. Please go back and 

deliberate," that would have cured the errors here.

 However, the error occurred when the -- when the 

court didn't do that. And Juror Hailstone's question --

the trial court's answer could only have reaffirmed the 

misimpression that the court returned to the -- to 

deliberate with. 

I have a -- just a few minutes, and I would like 

to give Respondent's answer to Justice Kennedy's question 

to Petitioner, paraphrasing somewhat, How does Skipper 

evidence extenuate the gravity of the crime? And the 

answer is, it doesn't at all, logically, ethically, or 

morally. As defense counsel conveyed to the jury, the 

circumstances of the crime are what they are, and there's 

nothing that can be done about that. The circumstances of

the crime are immutable and irreparable. The only thing 

that can be extenuated in a penalty presentation is 

Petitioner's culpability for the crime. And counsel 

argued that Petitioner's culpability was some -- to some 

extent, extenuated and mitigated because the evidence 

showed that there was no plan to kill the decedent when 

they went to her house. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have said that remorse 

extenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment 

purposes, under factor (k). 

MR. MULTHAUP: Well, of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that --

MR. MULTHAUP: -- course --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that -- and that -- that's 

post -- that's post-crime.

 MR. MULTHAUP: And, Your Honor, this pre- and 

post- distinction, I don't believe has -- is a relevant 

distinction. It's whether it's functionally related to 

the culpability for the crime, because when a defendant 

expresses remorse --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, you think pre- and crime --

pre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case? 

I thought that was really the linchpin of your argument? 

MR. MULTHAUP: No, Your Honor. It's that 

Skipper evidence is a specific and different kind of

mitigating character evidence that doesn't extenuate the 

gravity of the crime, but it provides a different kind of 

reason for sparing the defendant's life. There is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And yours is both pre- and 

post- -- that is, you're referring to conduct that took 

place before this crime was committed -- that is, his 

prior incarceration -- and asking the jury to project that 

forward to say, "That's how he behaved in prison, before 

he committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's 

likely to behave again." 

MR. MULTHAUP: Well, all of the Skipper evidence 

in this case occurred as a matter of historical fact 

before the capital crime and -- which, in fact, gives it's 

much -- gives it much more weight, because it can't be 

suggested that he contrived his good conduct after being 

arrested for a capital crime.

 But, I'm going to make a broad statement here. 

There is no reported case in California where either a 

defense attorney or the California Supreme Court makes a 

text-based argument that Skipper evidence extenuates the 

gravity of the crime, because it's illogical and doesn't 

work. Look what the defense attorney did in Payton. He 

argued that, "Well, of course you have to consider that 

evidence under factor (k), because it's a catchall. It's 

supposed to be inclusive." That's not a text-based

argument, that's a circumstantial-evidence kind of -- kind 

of argument.

 When we look at that -- when we look at that 

phrasing of "extenuating the gravity of the crime," with 

its plain meaning in English, and the distinction made, in 

Skipper itself, that Skipper evidence does not relate to 

Petitioner's culpability for the crime, the jury is going 

to appreciate what the -- what the attorney said to them, 

that the -- that the Youth Authority religious evidence 

does not extenuate the gravity of the crime, but has 

independent mitigating effect outside those enumerated 

factors. There's nothing -- that's a perfectly 

appropriate position to take, no constitutional problem 

there until, during deliberations, the trial court 

confirmed that they could only consider the enumerated 

factors and could not consider nonstatutory mitigation, 

the -- any other kind of mitigation, because that, in 

effect, closed out consideration of the -- of the Skipper 

evidence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If the judge's response to 

Juror Hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to 

it, if it was as obviously misleading as you say? 

MR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, it's like being --

stepping off a curb and being hit by a bicycle that you 

didn't see coming. This occurs in the middle of jury

deliberations. Nobody expected a juror to ask a question 

of this type. And, of course, I'm speculating here, but 

the trial court fielded the questions, responded off-the-

cuff, and the juror -- jury went back. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's why you have counsel 

there, to help the court when the court makes a real 

boo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say, 

one would have expected some objection from defense 

counsel. 

MR. MULTHAUP: One could also have expected the 

trial court to say, "Let's take a minute to think about 

that. We're going into recess, and I'd like counsel's 

opinion about this, because this is a difficult question. 

It's not a simple yes-or-no answer." Under --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Your Honor.

 In a minute, I'd like to briefly touch on the 

Teague issue. At the time Belmontes' judgment was 

pending, there was no precedent that would have dictated 

the Ninth Circuit's conclusion here regarding the 

sufficiency of the factor (k) instruction. And, indeed, 

this Court's subsequent holdings, in Boyde and Payton,

bear out the fact that it was at least -- that that 

decision certainly was not dictated by precedent.

 In Boyde, this Court dealt with evidence of good 

character that was precisely the same as the evidence of 

good character here. The -- Belmontes' evidence of having 

succeeded during a prior commitment and religious 

conversion, that he might be able to help others in the 

future, was good-character evidence in the same way that 

Boyde's evidence of having won a dancing prize, of having 

helped children, of having helped artistic -- having 

artistic abilities, was all good character. And there is 

certainly nothing in Boyde to suggest that there is any 

distinction. But, even if there was, it would not be one 

that would compel all rational jurists to distinguish the 

two cases. 

And that's further buttressed, of course, by 

this Court's more recent opinion in Payton, which found 

that it was at least reasonable for the State Court to 

conclude that Payton's post-crime forward-looking evidence 

would be understood to fall within the factor (k) 

instruction if it was at least reasonable for California 

to find that such forward -- post-crime forward-looking 

evidence would fit within the factor (k). The Ninth 

Circuit's conclusion, to the contrary, regarding pre-crime 

good-character evidence, certainly was not dictated by

precedent. 

I'd also like to address, quickly in my 

remaining time, Mr. Multhaup's arguments regarding the 

jury -- or the argument of counsel and the jury questions. 

Again, Boyde counsels that the relevant 

consideration is whether there is any reasonable 

likelihood that the jurors view the instructions in a way 

as to foreclose consideration of constitutionally relevant 

evidence. In this case, both -- the jurors were 

instructed with the factor (k). As I've said, they were 

given the supplemental instruction that said that the --

that the previous listing -- factors were only examples of 

some. And then, both counsel clearly said that the jurors 

could, and should, consider this evidence.

 Is there some possibility out there that some 

juror might have misinterpreted this in a -- in a -- in a 

different manner? I suppose so, but there is certainly no 

reasonable likelihood, especially in light of the fact 

that Belmontes' evidence, virtually all of it, was 

directed at this main thrust of the argument. And, just 

like in Payton and Boyde, for the jurors to have believed 

that they could nonetheless not consider that evidence 

would have turned the whole proceedings in a virtual 

charade or a pointless exercise.

 So far as the questions during juror

deliberations, it's, first, important to recognize, none 

of these jurors said anything to suggest that they were 

actually confused about whether they could consider any 

evidence offered. Their question -- Juror Hern's question 

merely related to her -- she wanted to confirm her 

understanding about the role of balancing mitigating 

versus aggravating factors under California law. And 

certainly the parties there if -- would have been in a 

better position to realize it if these questions somehow 

suggested some ambiguity. There was no objection there. 

Moreover, in the same conference, the judge advised the 

jurors to review the instructions again, which, of course, 

again included the factor (k), and which, of course, 

included the supplemental instruction that said that their 

consideration of mitigating factors was not limited to 

those that had been listed, but those that had been listed 

were merely examples.

 If the Court has no further questions, I will 

submit the case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

 The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
