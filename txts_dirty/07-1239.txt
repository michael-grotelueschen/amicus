 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument

 first in Case 07-1239, Winter v. Natural Resources

 Defense Council. General Garre.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Mr.

 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The ability to locate and track an enemy 

submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar 

is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike 

groups deployed around the world and therefore critical 

to the nation's own security. In this case the Ninth 

Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places 

serious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in 

training exercises that in the judgment of the President 

and his top naval officers are in the paramount 

interests of the United States. That injunction is 

fundamentally flawed for three principal reasons.

 First, it is based on an erroneous 

assessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's 

NEPA claim. Second it is based on an erroneous 

conception of the showing of irreparable injury 

necessary to secure what this Court has aptly called

"the extraordinary and dramatic remedy" of a preliminary 

injunction. And finally, it fails to take account the 

vital public interests in conducting the training 

exercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's 

restrictions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, when you 

address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as 

originally ordered by the district court or are you 

taking account of the modification made by the Ninth 

Circuit, and would you say that the three points you 

just made would apply as well to the injunction as 

modified?

 GENERAL GARRE: Certainly we would, 

Justice Ginsburg. Obviously our position on the NEPA 

claim is the same with respect to any aspect of the 

injunction. So too with the risk of irreparable harm 

which we think Respondents haven't shown. The Ninth 

Circuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial 

stay. It's important to keep in mind that its 

modifications were tied only to a stay. It didn't 

actually modify the injunction. So even if this Court 

thought those modifications were appropriate, it would 

have to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again? I'm not sure 

I --

GENERAL GARRE: The Ninth Circuit framed its 

modifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision 

affirming the district court's preliminary injunction. 

That stay and therefore those modifications remained in 

effect only until this Court issued its decision in this 

case.

That's the temporary 

I think what 

Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can 

correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from 

the initial preliminary injunction and the modified 

preliminary injunction.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, yes, we are here 

complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard 

shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes 

within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these 

strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as 

well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when 

significant surface ducting conditions are present 

regardless of the presence of marine mammals.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You mentioned the effect on 

naval operations. On the other side, could you say what 

the record shows about the number of marine mammals that

are likely to be killed or receive actual physical 

injury if the -- as opposed to some sort of behavioral 

modification, if the injunction is allowed to continue?

 GENERAL GARRE: The record -- and here I'm 

referring to the environmental assessment and the 

opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the 

petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates 

that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of 

these exercises. The environmental assessment predicted 

there would be eight instances of injurious harm. These 

eight instances would take place only with respect to a 

common species of dolphins of which there are hundreds 

of thousands in the Southern California Operating Area.

 Now, the environmental assessment also 

predicted that there would be a much greater number, 

170,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level 

B takes. These are temporary and by definition 

non-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at 

pages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the 

JA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances, 

the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the 

environmental assessment, are temporary and 

non-injurious.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just as to dolphins?

 GENERAL GARRE: The vast majority of those

disturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to 

dolphins.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what percentage is 

that of the total population in the area?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, I think that the 

statistics I have indicate that there are more than I 

think 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there. As 

to -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in 

the Southern California Operating Area. But this is --

no one suggests that is in any way a threatened species.

 With respect to the species that are 

endangered, threatened, or even strategic under the 

Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine 

Fisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse 

harm on the population level or with respect to annual 

recruitment rates with respect to those endangered or 

threatened species in the biological opinion that the 

district court sustained and that Respondents are not 

challenging on appeal.

 The focus of their claim of irreparable 

injury -- and keep in mind that that environmental 

assessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year 

history of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern 

California Operating Area at the same frequency and, if 

anything, during more frequent training exercises than

have been conducted in recent years.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the 

564 exposures that were typed Level A in the 

environmental assessment.

 GENERAL GARRE: With respect to beaked 

whales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. Those 

disturbances are temporary, non-injurious disturbances. 

That's important. Let me give you the page cites to the 

record on that because it's an important point. JA 178 

to 180, JA 185 to 188, and JA 198 to 200 discuss each 

species of the beaked whales and explain that the harms 

that are predicted in the environmental assessment are 

non-injurious, temporary harms.

 Now as a policy matter --

JUSTICE ALITO: In lay terms, what does that 

mean? Does it mean an alteration of their swimming 

pattern, their migration pattern? What does it mean?

 GENERAL GARRE: In most cases it means that 

there's an alerting response, they hear the sound and 

they go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a 

noise that disturbs them would ordinarily do. It can 

also mean that they could have some temporary effect on 

their feeding or breeding patterns, but it's a temporary 

effect.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It doesn't necessarily mean

that there's a physical injury to them, does it?

 GENERAL GARRE: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It means that they may just 

swim in a different direction.

 GENERAL GARRE: That's right. By definition 

only a Level A take involves an injurious harm, that is 

a physical harm which results in permanent damage to 

tissue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the 564 number 

was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure 

resulting in severe harm.

 GENERAL GARRE: It is confusing, 

Justice Ginsburg. The Navy as a policy matter described 

for purposes of the environmental assessment the Level B 

takes with respect to beaked whales as Level A takes 

because the Navy acknowledged that there is uncertainty 

about the effects of sonar on beaked whales. But when 

you look at what the environmental assessment says as to 

the actual injuries that the National Marine Fish and 

Wildlife Service and the Navy predicted based on the 

best science available to them and to us today, they are 

non-injurious, temporary exposures, and that is made 

clear at the portions of the JA that I mentioned.

 Now, the Navy -- there is nothing that 

prevents an agency from characterizing the particular

harm one way or the other as a policy matter for 

purposes of an environmental assessment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, 

Mr. Solicitor General. Is it understood, though, that 

there is a duty to prepare an environmental impact 

statement?

 GENERAL GARRE: Yes, there is, because we're 

not here arguing that, at this point, that we had no 

duty to prepare an environmental impact statement 

because of the intervening event of the Council for 

Environmental Quality's emergency circumstances 

alternative arrangements determination. That's the 

pertinent administrative event for purposes of 

Respondent's claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me follow that. 

You concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of 

the CEQ's emergency circumstances?

 GENERAL GARRE: Yes, it's one of the 

alternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is 

that the environmental impact statement which has been 

under way will be completed by January 2009 with respect 

to all activities in the Southern California Operating 

Area. Now, that's not to say that we concede that an 

environmental impact statement was not required -- was 

required at the outset. The Navy doesn't concede that.

It litigated this case up to the point of the Council 

for Environmental Quality's determination.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why didn't you -- I 

mean, you emphasize the level of detail and 

comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that 

the Navy prepared. Why didn't you just make -- why 

didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset 

if you were going to engage in such effort with respect 

to the environmental assessment?

 GENERAL GARRE: Because the Navy devoted its 

best resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate 

bide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded 

that there would not be a finding of significant 

environmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees 

an environmental impact statement is not required.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you have to do it. 

Given all your work so far, how long would it take? You 

had several months already, so how long? When could you 

do it by?

 GENERAL GARRE: It's going to be completed 

by January 2009, Justice Breyer, under the alternative 

arrangements that have been approved --

JUSTICE BREYER: So we're talking about two 

months.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, at this point we are.

The point that the Navy faced in January of 2008, where 

it had an injunction against its use of sonar in these 

training exercises and only an environmental impact 

statement, it faced, as the Council of Environmental 

Quality found, emergency circumstances in terms of the 

need to conduct these training exercises.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that you're are 

here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit, 

and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the 

government on an ongoing basis; and what are the 

principal reasons for that?

 GENERAL GARRE: Because of its impact on 

national security, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what particular 

errors? The standard for review -- pardon me. The 

standard for the grant or denial of injunction? What 

are the principal areas you want to present to us?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think there are three 

fundamental flaws, as I indicated. One, we think the 

Ninth Circuit just got the NEPA claim wrong. The Navy 

is complying with NEPA through the alternative 

arrangements and the regulations, but the CEQ found --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where was the statutory 

authority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS? 

You mentioned a regulation. Where in the statute does

it say that the Council on Environmental Quality can 

dispense with this requirement?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think we would point to a 

couple of things. First, in terms of the statute, NEPA 

says that the obligations of the statute should be 

complied with to the fullest extent. And it doesn't 

specifically say what happens if they are not followed. 

These are procedural requirements. Secondly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's not the 

question I am asking. I am not asking about the 

consequences of not complying. I am asking what is the 

statutory authority for the Council on Environmental 

Quality to dispense with the statutory obligation to 

prepare it?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what -- as I 

understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as 

an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance. 

And I want to know what the statutory authority is for 

that. I don't see it in NEPA.

 GENERAL GARRE: The statutory authority that 

we find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for 

alternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged 

by this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority. The 

Court acknowledged that in Department of Transportation

v. Public Citizen. So we take that as a given.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. As a general 

proposition that's fine, but what's the statutory 

authority for them to engage in rulemaking authority 

that dispenses with the government's obligation to 

comply with an EIS requirement?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, let me -- I'll answer 

the question, but let me be clear: The government's 

position is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by 

complying with the alternative arrangements provided by 

the Council on Environmental Quality.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- I mean, the 

claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time 

the request for an injunction was brought, and 

everything else is consequent on that. So I want to go 

back to the point, in effect, at which the claim was 

made that the government is not complying. One of your 

answers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent 

Council on Environmental Quality action, we're not in 

the same situation that we were in when the suit was 

brought. And I want to know what the statutory 

authority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to 

take the action with the effect that you claim it has.

 GENERAL GARRE: And I would point, Your 

Honor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be

complied with to the fullest extent possible --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That --

GENERAL GARRE: -- and I would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- seems to cut against 

you. I am not getting it.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, that language, coupled 

with -- which seems to us to suggest that compliance to 

the fullest extent possible would depend on the 

circumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't 

impose, doesn't say what the consequences of 

noncompliance would be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --

GENERAL GARRE: -- but other --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- I don't 

know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ? 

I mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory 

authority -- EPA, CEQ. And it seems to me that CEQ is 

an odd entity to be doing this. They're more or less an 

office in the White House, rather than a free-standing 

agency.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, this Court has 

acknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the 

Public Citizen case a few years ago, that NEPA gives CEQ 

rulemaking authority, and that this Court gives 

substantial deference to the CEQ's rules.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rulemaking to do what? 

To set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to 

carry out their obligations under NEPA?

 GENERAL GARRE: To implement the statute, 

that's right. And there are a number of important 

procedural requirements that go far beyond what the 

statute requires that the CEQ has laid out in its 

regulations. One of the regulations -- and this has 

been on the books since 1979 and has been implemented 

some 40 times. So this isn't something that was made up 

in this case. It's an established regulatory practice 

under NEPA that where there are emergency circumstances 

an agency can come up with alternative arrangements to 

comply with its NEPA obligations. And here those 

alternative arrangements were: One, to complete an EIS 

that is under way for all sonar activities and all other 

activities by the Navy in the Southern California 

operating area by January 2009. The Navy is going to 

meet that goal. Two, to adopt the mitigation measures 

spelled out in the alternative arrangements. Three, to 

provide for public participation so that there could be 

comment on any concerns to marine mammals in the area. 

And four, to provide for research into harms to marine 

mammals. These were significant arrangements that the 

Navy agreed to.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what good is it if, 

as I understand it, the whole training program will be 

over in December, and then the environmental impact 

statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to 

come after the whole project is concluded?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, it has -- it's 

important because the environmental impact statement 

that's going to be completed pertains not only to 

COMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the 

Southern California Operating Area in the future, but 

all activities. So that environmental impact statement 

is going to be very meaningful.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me switch 

back. Chief?

 Let me switch back in time for a second to 

the beginning of these exercises. One of the -- I mean, 

one of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I 

guess the appropriateness of the Council on 

Environmental Quality's action, if it has any power to 

act, is emergency circumstances. My understanding, and 

correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the 

exercises began in February of 2007. My understanding 

is that it was in that same month of February 2007 that 

the Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment, 

so that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy

disclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at 

just about the same moment that it began the exercises.

 GENERAL GARRE: I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And I guess my question is, 

to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the 

emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any 

timely action? I am assuming in my question that the 

Navy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was 

going to have these exercises. So it sounds to me as 

though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the 

Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS 

preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect 

to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark 

until the last moment. So, why -- why shouldn't we say 

that -- even assuming the Council on Environmental 

Quality can somehow dispense with the statute, why 

shouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except 

one which was created by the Navy's apparently 

deliberate inattention?

 GENERAL GARRE: For several reasons, 

Justice Souter. First, there was a gap between when the 

Navy issued its environmental assessment and when the 

first training exercises began.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was a gap of less 

than month, right?

going to engage in these exercises, didn't it?

that it was in the process of finalizing an 

environmental impact statement that it prepared in good 

faith, a 293-page statement, which concluded that there 

would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: An environmental 

assessment.

 GENERAL GARRE: An environmental assessment, 

that's right, with the finding of no significant

environmental impact.

 This Court presumes the regularity of 

administrative actions. There's no reason for the Navy, 

particularly on this record, to have assumed that that 

EA would not have been sustained. The emergency 

circumstances arose in January 2008, when the district 

court enjoined the use of MFA sonar in these exercises 

when the Navy had several exercises.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but they wouldn't 

have been in the situation in January of 2008 if they 

hadn't been in the situation I described in February of 

2007. And it sounds to me as though the Navy played its 

cards very close to its vest --

GENERAL GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in 2007.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, with respect, I don't 

think that a 293-page environmental assessment with the 

kind of detail and support that this assessment has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Look, the problem you face 

-- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are 

effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is 

necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these 

alternative arrangements. But you should not be 

estopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued 

that was not a good faith completion of all the Navy's

responsibilities. And that's the argument that is being 

made against you now. It assumes that the EA wasn't 

enough. And I'm not sure that we -- that that 

assumption is valid.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, that's right. And as 

I indicated earlier -- I want to be clear -- the Navy 

believes that its environmental assessment was not only 

prepared in good faith, but was appropriate and reached 

the right conclusions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what 

Justice Kennedy started to ask. I mean, I said why 

doesn't this thing go away after two months. I mean, 

you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because 

you want a holding from the Court that will help you in 

other cases because you think what the court below did 

here was wrong. And you said "three reasons," and you 

got out the first one, and I would like to hear the 

other two.

 GENERAL GARRE: The other two are: One, the 

injunction. Even if you agree with Respondents on the 

likelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a 

showing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally 

flawed. The Ninth Circuit and the district court looked 

to whether there was irreparable injury under a 

possibility standard.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't both the circuit and

fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was 

-- beyond question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Near -- "near certainty."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: "Near certainty."

 GENERAL GARRE: They did, Justice Souter, 

and we think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There is no -- there is no 

harm. I mean, the standard may or may not be bright, 

but there is no harm to the Navy in this case from --

from the use of that standard, I take it.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't think that a 

court could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of 

reasons.

 First, when a lower court applies a 

fundamentally wrong standard to assess -- to make a 

determination, this Court usually corrects that legal 

standard and gives the -- the lower court an opportunity 

to do it again.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we -- we may, but so 

far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently 

do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no 

harm in this case, the error was harmless.

is a sentence in the district court decision repeated by 

the court of appeals, of "near certainty of harm to 

marine mammals" is utterly belied by the environmental 

assessment in this case as well as the fact that -- and 

the Ninth Circuit acknowledged this -- the Navy has been 

using MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating 

Area for more than 40 years and no one can point to any 

harm to marine mammals.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, could I ask you 

a question?

 GENERAL GARRE: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If this were not a Navy 

case with all of the implications of the Navy, but an 

ordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS 

had to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action 

to enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was 

filed? Because the -- the very fact that you need an 

EIS is -- is because you don't know what environmental 

consequences may ensue. That's the purpose of the EIS. 

So isn't it the normal practice to enjoin government 

action until the EIS is filed when it is clear there is 

a duty to file?

 GENERAL GARRE: I don't think it is, 

Justice Stevens. I think it is -- the normal practice

is to require someone who seeks the extraordinary remedy 

of a preliminary injunction to show irreparable injury, 

a likelihood of irreparable injury.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the irreparable 

injury have to -- and this just repeats 

Justice Stevens's question. It is the same concern I 

have.

 Let's assume an EIS is required; let's 

assume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the 

government project is going to proceed. You still have 

to show irreparable harm before you can get the 

injunction?

 GENERAL GARRE: You do.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have authority for 

that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't have authority 

for that precise proposition because I don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes, you do, but it 

may not be in the circuits. Our cases say that 

procedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that 

confers standing; that there has to be some concrete 

harm.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the only injury 

that -- that follows from the mere failure to file an

EIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire 

population.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then, let's -- let's 

assume standing. Let's assume standing. Let's -- let's 

assume people have standing.

 GENERAL GARRE: I -- I think that that's 

right, Judge Scalia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I wouldn't -- look, 

you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself, 

once it reads it, might decide to do something else. 

That's the whole point of an EIS. So if the agency goes 

ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes 

committed to that course of action, and the chances that 

the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the 

chances that any big agency will back up once it's 

committed to a course, namely a lot lower. And that I 

always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there 

to stop.

 GENERAL GARRE: Clearly, the purpose of the 

requirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency 

has -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't 

think there is any question that the Navy was after its 

293-page assessment.

are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.

 GENERAL GARRE: No, I'm not, Justice Souter. 

I am saying --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the difference 

between them? I -- I assume the difference is the EIS 

is a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of 

conclusions.

 GENERAL GARRE: That's right, but then --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that without the EIS, 

the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree 

of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it 

had done -- done the EIS.

 GENERAL GARRE: I -- the EIS --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that, I presume, is the 

harm that the -- that the statute is intended to 

prevent.

 GENERAL GARRE: But it is not a likely --

they have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The EA demonstrates in your 

view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that 

this -- this action by the Navy is okay. And since that 

is the case, there is -- there is no probability of 

irreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the 

probability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, we agree with that.

We think it's important, though, to separate out the 

likelihood of success on the NEPA claim with the 

distinct question of whether there is irreparable injury 

and look to the record of whether there is irreparable 

injury. And we think they have not come close to 

establishing that. The one final --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any authorities 

in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable 

injury is not required when there's standing, when an 

EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and 

when the government is ready to proceed? There is 

always irreparable injury before you can get an 

injunction? That's what all the circuits say?

 GENERAL GARRE: Justice Kennedy, I haven't 

completed that -- that research with respect to all of 

the circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not 

aware of a decision in which a court has said that the 

irreparable injury requirement does not have to be met 

or is automatically met.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The whole theory of the --

of the environmental impact statement is that we don't 

really know what the harm will be. So how can you say 

that in order to get an injunction against the 

government action you have to prove irreparable harm?

cases than others, Justice Stevens. But I think in this 

case where you have the record that has been compiled, 

they cannot -- they cannot --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're really arguing 

that an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will 

always be enough.

 GENERAL GARRE: We're not taking that 

position, Justice Stevens. We're taking the position 

that the record in this case does not show a likelihood 

of irreparable injury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In all -- in all of these 

cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an 

EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary. So if the 

mere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an 

allegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a 

preliminary injunction in all cases?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think that's right. I 

think that fundamentally --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you were 

not suggesting --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is a finding 

that it is necessary, and here we have that finding as I 

understand it.

success on the claim that you had to file an

 GENERAL GARRE: We -- we are contesting 

that. And if I could reserve the remainder of my time. 

And one must -- I can explain, if you would like, 

Justice.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I thought you 

conceded that point.

 GENERAL GARRE: If I misspoke, I apologize. 

My point was that the administrative determination that 

is at issue now in evaluating the NEPA claim is the 

finding of alternative arrangements. The Navy has never 

conceded that it was required to do an EIS at the 

outset. It simply has agreed to live with the 

alternative arrangements approved by the Council on 

Environmental Quality.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. KENDALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

very traditional question of equity jurisprudence. The

fundamental question is whether the district court's 

factual finding that the injunction will permit the Navy 

to train and certify its sailors is supported by the 

evidence. Because if it is supported by the evidence it 

cannot be clearly erroneous. And if it is not clearly 

erroneous, it cannot be reversed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there something 

incredibly odd about a single district judge making a 

determination on that defense question that is contrary 

to the determination that the Navy has made?

 MR. KENDALL: Justice Alito, I submit not, 

and here is why. This was an issue of fact. The 

question was whether, in light of the Navy's past 

training, which was abundantly shown in the record, 

their post-complaint, during the litigation, lawyer-

crafted declarations were sufficiently persuasive to 

undo all that evidence that showed that the Navy had 

repeatedly used safety zones.

 Now, what happened here was that the judge 

was extraordinarily deferential to the Navy. The judge 

rejected most of the measures that plaintiffs sought, 

crediting where the evidence was not to the contrary the 

declarations of the Navy saying, for example, we need to 

train at night.

the contrary on two important points. The first was 

that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I 

read them. Maybe I just missed the contrary. But they 

said that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the 

sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever, 

whenever we had to run into a situation called layering 

of different temperature levels. And we tell you, as 

naval officers, that that's just where submarines like 

to hide. And we also tell you that if we can't train 

people to do that they will miss out on an important 

part of how to find these submarines.

 I saw no answer to that.

 The second thing they said was that: We're 

willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine 

mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter 

of a mile, about. But you insist that we turn off the 

sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter. 

And that's quite a big distance more. A lot of animals 

come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all 

those times, we are not going to be able to get much 

training done.

 Now, those two things seem to be quite 

important. And I just might have missed, which I might 

have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by 

equivalent experts to those points.

MR. KENDALL: Justice Breyer, the response 

in the record appears in the after-action reports of the 

eight prior exercises in Southern California. There 

were four from the series that we challenge and four 

after-action reports, prepared earlier ones. And you 

will find those in the joint appendix at 326 to -45.

 What the court found was that the Navy had 

trained and certified its troops during those eight 

SOCAL exercises despite the complete absence of surface 

ducting conditions. And it was conceded --

JUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, despite 

the complete absence?

 MR. KENDALL: Because surface ducting 

conditions are, as it happens, quite rare.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the whole point. 

That's why I thought they didn't prove anything. Fine, 

they went on some exercises and they didn't run into 

these layered things. So obviously they couldn't have 

training.

 MR. KENDALL: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they are saying 

is, when you do run into that situation you've got to 

train people to deal with it. It doesn't prove much 

that when you didn't run into it they didn't train 

people to deal with it. How could they have?

MR. KENDALL: Well, the question before the 

court was balancing the requirement that the Navy comply 

with the law and the environmental harms against the 

Navy's interest. And our point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, with one 

important qualification. The question was the balance 

of those equities on a preliminary basis. In other 

words, before we reach a final decision, we're going to 

prevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises 

that they think are necessary. Not even after we have 

decided they were wrong, just because we think there is 

a likelihood that they might be wrong.

 MR. KENDALL: That's quite right. And of 

course, in this litigation that was the whole ball game, 

because by the time you had reached trial in this case 

all of the exercises --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that 

would have been the whole ball game until I read your 

brief. Your brief does not spend a page defending the 

decision on the merits of the lower courts. Nothing 

about emergency circumstances or CEQ. Instead, you 

raise other arguments on which the district court did 

not rely in finding likelihood of success. So given 

that, I would have thought we would have a lot more to 

talk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on

the merits.

 MR. KENDALL: I respectfully disagree. We 

took the position from the beginning --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes, yes. You 

certainly raised those issues. I'm not saying that. 

What I am saying the district court didn't rely on those 

in finding likelihood of success.

 MR. KENDALL: Well, I also disagree on that 

point. You will find at page 97a of the appendix that 

was submitted with the petition for certiorari the 

court's declaration that there was no emergency. You 

will find --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. KENDALL: But that's the question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the 

district court relied on. Where in your brief do I see 

a defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed 

to the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and 

everything else, issues the district court didn't reach?

 MR. KENDALL: The district court did reach 

the question of whether the Navy could train. That 

negated any emergency under any definition of the term. 

It doesn't matter whether -- and there was debate about 

this below -- an emergency can be foreseeable and 

expected, as Justice Souter was -- his questions were

probing, or whether the emergency can be -- must be 

unexpected. There was debate about that below. But the 

position that we took and the position that the district 

court took was there is no emergency.

 The reason there is no emergency is because 

the Navy -- the Navy is perfectly able to train under 

these circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I can't --

look, I don't know anything about this. I'm not a naval 

officer. But if I see an admiral come along with an 

affidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible --

that you've got to train people when there are these 

layers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there 

with all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that 

under oath. And I see on the other side a district 

judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look 

to see what the basis is, because I know that district 

judge doesn't know about it, either.

 So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this 

one is zero. That's -- because what you have told me is 

they completed some exercise where they didn't find any 

layering.

 MR. KENDALL: There was also prior exercise 

in Hawaii. You will recall from the brief that we had a 

prior litigation that resulted in the consent decree in

Hawaii. In that consent decree the Navy agreed to train 

with a surface ducting powerdown. So, they had 

previously told the same judge that they were capable of 

training in surface ducting conditions with that 

powerdown, else they would not have agreed to that 

decree. There was evidence in the record.

 The problem that the judge had is that the 

Navy cannot be judge of its own cause. Deference does 

have its limits. And this judge was in a position of 

reviewing facts of prior exercises and what the Navy --

JUSTICE BREYER: Generalities. You see --

of course, I agree with you as a generality. What I am 

missing here is the specifics, because I am nervous 

about it, as you can see. And what I am nervous about 

is that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on 

your side.

 MR. KENDALL: If I may proceed then to the 

safety zone specifics, because that's the other issue. 

Remember there were a number of injunctive measures that 

the Navy objected to in the district court that they no 

longer object to. They ceased to object to them in the 

court of appeals and they haven't brought them up here.

 So the next issue is the 2200-yard safety 

zone. Now, first, why was the safety zone chosen? It 

was chosen because that is the Navy's preferred method

of mitigation. They have always mitigated using safety 

zones. They have preferred to mitigate using a safety 

zone that is 1,000 yards. We asked for one that was 

2,200 yards.

 The question was, what is the difference in 

training capability in the two zones? So we looked at 

that. And where did we look? We looked at the 

statistics from the after-action reports.

 Now, in this case we had helpful information 

to use, because the after-action reports reveal that the 

effect of widening the safety zone would have been at 

most one more shutdown or powerdown each exercise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would have 

increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to 

scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals 

there.

 MR. KENDALL: Incorrect. Incorrect. It 

would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 

increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards. But 

it's 1,000 yards of circle. And if I remember high 

school geometry right, that's a squared increase.

 MR. KENDALL: But think about how this is 

being done. The way it's being done is that you have 

somebody on the deck with binoculars and they are

looking straight ahead and they can either look out 

1,000 yards or out 2,000 yards.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there are people 

in airplanes?

 MR. KENDALL: Yes. Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just straight 

ahead.

 MR. KENDALL: There are people in airplanes 

and they are looking down and they can see as much as 

they can see within that area. And if they see a marine 

mammal, there will be a shutdown or a powerdown; and if 

they don't see it, there won't be one. You can only 

shut down or power down when you see one.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question 

was, that increases the area exponentially that has to 

be scrutinized. And I don't see why, as you said, that 

was wrong.

 MR. KENDALL: Because they argued -- and 

perhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice, that you 

were referring to their argument -- which is not that 

the area was exponentially larger and that creates 

difficulties of observation; they argued it would create 

an exponentially greater number of shutdowns. And that 

is mathematically proven false by the after-action 

reports, because it's one per exercise.

And this judge, keep in mind, had been 

listening to the Navy make factual assertions from the 

very beginning. And the factual assertions that the 

Navy made at the start of this case about the nature of 

the environmental harms were completely disproven by the 

EA and by the expert evidence that was brought to bear. 

And there are a number of statements that General Garre 

may that I think I should address.

 One of them in answer to questions from 

Justice Ginsburg had to do with the Level A takes on 

beaked whales. The Navy tries to dismiss those by 

saying we only graded the effects on beaked whales as 

Level A because we did that as a matter of generous 

policy.

 They didn't do it for policy reasons. They 

did it because that's what the science compels, because 

beaked whales have stranded repeatedly around the world 

correlated -- caused by in the views of scientists, and 

the evidence is overwhelming, by sonar. And the reason 

that happens especially to beaked whales is because they 

dive for very long periods of time. And when they dive 

for very long periods of time, and they are then 

bombarded with sonar, which by the way in sound 

intensity, in this courtroom if we had a jet engine and 

you multiplied that noise by 2,000 times, correcting for

water, that's the sound's intensity that would be going 

on in the water if you were a marine mammal near that 

source. The beaked whales, the scientists believe, 

adjust their diving patterns; since they dive down for 

so long, if they come up too fast, they get the bends so 

there is evidence of -- when they do the necropsies of 

these beaked whales, they find hemorrhaging, the 

embolisms in various parts of the bloodstream and many, 

many deaths. So there is enormous scientific evidence 

that there is a greater harm to beaked whales that is 

caused by sonar and that is precisely why the Navy was 

compelled in the EA to recognize that evidence.

 Now, one thing that was said here which I 

found --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where in the record -- this 

was the question I asked General Garre. Where in the 

record is there evidence of -- that beaked whales would 

be killed?

 MR. KENDALL: The evidence of the prediction 

of the Level A takes, in the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what does Level A take 

-- maybe can you put this in lay terms. Let's start 

with kill. Where is the evidence that beaked whales 

would be killed?

table on page 223 of volume 1 of the joint appendix. 

And then there are the discussions of beaked whale 

injuries that General Garre referred to, and what they 

show is that beaked whales will experience the effects I 

described. But there is also expert evidence in the 

record in the form of a number of declarations by 

scientists who have studied beaked whales for -- for 

quite some time. The evidence you can find, and it's 

referred to on page 4 of our brief. Joint appendix 

600-602, 673-89, 738-41, 760, the supplemental excerpt 

of record at 180; also joint appendix 601, 666-667,

on page 4 of our brief.

 I also wanted to talk about the behavioral 

changes, because it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is -- I want to give 

you a chance to say what's so terrible about what 

they're doing. I will express a little frustration. 

Not your fault. But why couldn't you work this thing 

out? I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot 

of conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have 

more conditions. And you are asking us who know nothing 

about whales and less about the military to start 

reading all these documents to try to figure out who's 

right in the case where the other side says the other

side is totally unreasonable. And the issue at law 

seems to be something that is going to last for two 

months.

 So -- so, why? What is so -- what is the 

important thing here?

 MR. KENDALL: The important thing here is 

that the Navy is focused on having it its way or no way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's very 

unfair. There were six conditions imposed by the 

district court. The Navy didn't even appeal four of 

them. They gave up on four out of the six issues. 

That's not insisting on having it their way.

 MR. KENDALL: No -- I agree, although the 

reason I believe that they conceded those is that the 

record was -- was so overwhelming on each of those 

points, they hadn't even put in evidence to suggest that 

those measures would cause them any problem. They 

simply didn't have the declaration, and even the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The other ways it 

struck me how the district court relied on the fact that 

the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in 

the past to say well, there can't be any problem with 

adding more protection. No good deed goes unpunished.

 MR. KENDALL: Well, if I can -- if I can 

answer that this way. We negotiated with the Navy for

months and months and months, the Brinpack case, I 

settled with them. We tried very hard to resolve this 

case, but keep in mind that the Navy until the district 

court ruled refused to agree to any measures that we 

proposed -- any measures. So it was a binary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They had already 

taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals. 

Now you say that wasn't.

 MR. KENDALL: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they were taking 

some actions.

 MR. KENDALL: That's right. And -- and so 

we had a litigation that was focused on were there 

additional actions that should be taken; and there is 

extensive evidence taken and extensive argument and then 

the district court ruled. And the correct path, if the 

Navy was aggrieved by that decision, was a higher court. 

But instead, in order to avoid the clearly erroneous 

standard -- and remember, that the clearly erroneous 

standard as this Court said in the Anderson v. Bessemer 

City case, says when there are two permissible views of 

the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them 

cannot be clearly erroneous.

 So in order to evade that, and this is 

typical of the tactics that we experienced and the

uncompromising nature of their approach that we 

experienced, they went to CEQ to try to trump the entire 

injunctive process. Now that they did without any 

authority in NEPA --

JUSTICE BREYER: How does the basic thing 

work? Because to a layperson, when I think of the armed 

forces preparing an environmental impact statement, I 

think, the whole point of the armed forces is to hurt 

the environment. I mean --

understand how it's supposed to work. Of course they 

are going to do something that is harmful.

the armed forces, I think is to --

JUSTICE BREYER: You see the point, I am 

trying to give you a -- overstating it.

 MR. KENDALL: I think the point of the armed 

forces is to safeguard our freedoms causing the least 

damage possible to our environment. And this Court has 

recognized that repeatedly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You go on a bombing 

mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact 

statement first?

 MR. KENDALL: They don't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work?

 MR. KENDALL: We have never, ever contended 

that any of our proposed restrictions should apply to 

combat at all, and it doesn't.

 This training was planned for a very long 

time. Had -- there were questions earlier, 

Justice Scalia I think raised a question is the EA as 

good as the EIS? There is a big, big difference. There 

are really two, between an EA and EIS. The substantive 

difference is that an EA doesn't have the same 

alternatives analysis that an EIS has, and the 

procedural difference, which in a country that values 

transparency and ideas and exchange with the public, is 

the notice and comment that EIS requires.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I didn't assert that 

they are -- that they are the same thing substantively. 

My -- my only question is whether your assertion of bad 

faith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long 

as they were doing an EA. If -- you do an EA to see if 

an EIS is necessary. And you say if there's no -- if 

there is no significant harm to the environment, you 

don't even need an EIS.

 MR. KENDALL: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's how they 

started. That's step one, and many agencies do that. 

They are authorized to do that. I don't know why you 

have to attribute bad faith to the Navy simply because 

it began with an EA.

 MR. KENDALL: That focus is not an element 

of our case. I was simply responding to 

Justice Breyer's question as, I admit, a somewhat 

frustrated lawyer who tried to work things out as to why 

it happened that they weren't worked out.

 I do want to speak a bit about some of the 

comments that General Garre made in response to 

Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia's questions about--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I 

derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of 

equities question? As I read the opinions most of the 

balancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the 

district court. I found the district court's balancing 

in only one sentence. The court after all of its 

prior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of 

hardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an 

injunction. " It goes on. But it's just one sentence.

 The Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to 

the district court but in fact it supplied all the 

balance of the analysis for the balance.

MR. KENDALL: Well, I -- with respect I 

think the district court spoke in several different 

opinions. So you can -- you can find out what the 

district court was thinking by looking not only at the 

injunction, but also at the -- at the responsible 

district court denying the motion to vacate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose it's still 

fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its 

attention on likelihood of success on the merits and 

irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the 

equities.

 MR. KENDALL: Well I would disagree in one 

respect, which is the court was very focused on which 

measures to impose and which measures not to impose. 

There were, you know, at least 10 pages of her 

injunctive opinion going through that, and each -- and 

the denial of the motion to vacate did the same thing, 

because -- after the Ninth Circuit ordered Judge Cooper 

to issue a tailored injunction, each side briefed very 

extensively, with a huge amount of supporting evidence, 

the issue of which measures should be imposed. And 

Judge Cooper decided that certain measures would not be 

imposed and certain ones would, and she explained why. 

And she did that against the background of the harms 

that were designed to be prevented. And so what I would

submit is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's -- I 

think that's quite right.

 My question, though, is that at no point 

that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the 

equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm 

to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your 

point about the record -- and putting on the other side 

the potential that a North Korean diesel electric 

submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor 

undetected. Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance. 

And the district court never entered -- never went into 

that analysis.

 MR. KENDALL: There's a good reason why she 

didn't balance that. And that gets back to my opening 

remarks, which is that the premise of that question and 

why, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be concerned about 

that is that there would be an exposure to that 

submarine, that North Korean submarine. But the judge 

had made a factual finding, and the factual finding she 

made was that training would not be affected. So, on 

the one hand, you have a factual finding that there is 

no harm to the training at all, which means that in the 

balance the harms to the environment are much heavier.

deference, if any, do you think the district court was 

obligated to give to the Navy on that military issue 

about whether the training would be effective? Is judge 

Cooper an expert on antisubmarine warfare?

 MR. KENDALL: No. Judge Cooper, like all 

judges, has to sift through the evidence of experts, and 

Judge Cooper gave great weight to the Navy on everything 

that the Navy said. But there was a place where she had 

to stop because, after all, she's a judge, and where she 

had to stop was where the evidence belied the 

declarations. And, you know, this Court has had in a 

number of decisions to confront the question of whether 

wartime exigencies forced the courts to suspend their 

powers of judgment. I submit that what happened here is 

that this court didn't, and that's what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even the district --

even the district court recognized, in the words of her 

opinion, that it would propose "a substantial challenge" 

-- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime 

that she imposed in the injunction.

 MR. KENDALL: That's right, and it will in 

fact pose a challenge and the proof is then in the 

pudding, which is that the Navy has now conducted 13 out 

of 14 exercises, the last 8 of which had been conducted 

under this regime as modified by the circuit. And they

have not, as they were invited, had to come back and ask 

for relief despite the fact that they had the 

opportunity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: By the time this case got 

back to the court -- the district court a second time, 

the President had made a determination that this was in 

the paramount interest of the United States. The 

Defense and Commerce Department jointly had made a 

determination that this is necessary for the national 

defense. And it seems to me, even if those 

determinations don't resolve the EIS statement, they 

certainly must be given great weight by the district 

court in determining whether to continue the injunction. 

If you could comment on that, incorporate it also in 

what you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument 

with reference to the standard.

 MR. KENDALL: Yes. First, responding to 

that very point, it's common ground among the litigants 

and certainly with the court that the interests ascribed 

by the President and by every other government official 

with respect to Naval training are of the highest 

importance. The question was -- and this is the court's 

factual finding, and the question is whether there was 

sufficient record evidence to support it, whether she 

was right that there wouldn't be an adverse effect

except for possibly some logistical changes, but no 

adverse effect in terms of an achievement of the 

training. If there's no adverse effect, then what the 

President is speaking to is speaking past what's 

concerning the court.

 Now, with respect to irreparable harm, the 

argument that General Garre made I think mistakenly 

collapses the normal equity issue in this following 

sense: Once a plaintiff satisfies Article III, very 

important, and under the Japan Whaling case, the Lujan 

v. National Wildlife case, there is no question that 

these plaintiffs deserve to be in court, and it has 

never been contested.

 Then you move to the traditional equity 

standard for assessing irreparable harm, Hecht v. 

Bowles, but in the environmental area we have a 

decision, the Amoco v. Gambell decision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That 

irreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of 

the injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the 

harm which is the basis for standing, is it not?

 MR. KENDALL: It always does, and the 

question is somewhat different. And I think, 

Justice Scalia, if you look at your opinion in the 

second Lujan case and you think about the imminence

requirement of standing there, what irreparable harm 

adds to that is the traditional need to show that the 

harm you suffer cannot be quantified in damages or it's 

difficult to quantify, and that a remedy at law will not 

achieve the adjustment between the parties that's 

required. That's what equity does. Equity preserves 

the positions of the parties.

 And as this Court said in Amoco, 

environmental injury, by it's very nature, can seldom be 

adequately remedied by money damages and is often 

permanent or at least of long-lasting duration, i.e., 

irreparable; that is Amoco at page 545. If such injury 

is sufficiently likely, therefore, the Court said, the 

balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an 

injunction.

 Now, there's one other point which was 

briefly touched on here. Justice Kennedy was asking 

what the circuits have said. Now, the circuits have 

said different things about irreparable harm. The 

leading edge of discussion in the circuits began with 

then-Judge Breyer on the First Circuit in the 

Massachusetts v. Watt and Sierra Club v. Marsh cases, 

where he pointed out that NEPA itself has, while it's a 

procedural statute, a substantive purpose, the 

substantive purpose being informed decisionmaking. And

if there is not informed decisionmaking before there is 

an agency committed to action, a harm has occurred. 

That's the harm that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's unfortunately 

contrary to what our opinions have said, which was quite 

clearly that procedural --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- procedural injury is not 

the kind of injury that gives rise to Article III 

standing.

 MR. KENDALL: Can I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The whole country can 

complain about the failure to issue an EIS. That is not 

the kind of injury that gives standing.

 MR. KENDALL: I was only responding to 

Justice Kennedy's question as to what the circuits have 

said. That's the leading edge of what the circuits have 

said.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why you backed 

down on this.

questioning, but I know you responded to some. Are you 

MR. KENDALL: That's very kind. I think 

there's just one other point perhaps I should make, 

which is there was some discussion of whether NEPA 

actually authorizes CEQ to conduct this kind of 

examination of a district court's ruling. I submit that 

there is nothing anywhere in NEPA and certainly not in 

the "fullest extent possible" language which gives that 

authority. This Court has already decided that point in 

the Flint Ridge case, where it said that NEPA does not 

give way unless there is an irreconcilable conflict 

between NEPA and another statute. They have pointed to

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Garre, have you one minute remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 First, the Court of Appeals did not 

adequately consider the balance of equities. It 

completely disregarded the President's determination of 

the paramount interests in these exercises. It 

disregarded the Chief Naval Officer's evidence on the

harm of the 2200-yard shutdown, at Pet. App. 344-345A. 

It disregard the harm as to surface ducting, Pet. App. 

33 A.

 Justice Alito, there is -- the EA says, 

quote, on page 200 of the JA, "No serious injury or 

mortality of any marine mammal species is reasonably 

foreseeable because of these exercises." Page 170 makes 

clear that that applies to beaked whales as well.

 And finally I think I heard my colleague, my 

friend, concede that you have to show Article III injury 

in order to show irreparable injury. They not only have 

to show irreparable injury to marine mammals, which they 

haven't; they have to show irreparable injury to 

themselves, and particularly as to beaked whales, which 

none of the declarants and none of their members have 

ever asserted they have seen. They can't possibly 

establish any irreparable injury from any conceivable 

harm to beaked whales, even though the record in this 

case makes clear that all harms to the marine mammals 

that we have been discussing today are temporary 

non-injurious harms.

 We would ask this Court to set aside the 

decision of the Ninth Circuit, which seriously 

interferes with critical training exercises that the 

President, his chief Naval officers have determined to

be in the paramount interests of the United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- before you sit 

down. I thought I recalled something in your briefing 

dealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point 

regarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very 

substantially showed that they were caused by sonar. 

You had something in your briefs about beaching, but I 

wasn't sure whether it was beaked whales or only 

dolphins.

 GENERAL GARRE: It pertains to beaked whales 

as well. Page 256 of the petition appendix is the 

National Marine Fisheries Service's determination that 

the conditions which led to strandings with respect to 

beaked whales in other parts of the world are not likely 

to lead to strandings in the Southern California 

Operating Area. Those conditions are taken into account 

in the national defense exemption mitigation measures at 

page 258 of the petition appendix. There have been 

beachings of beaked whales in Southern California. None 

have been tied to sonar operations, and that further 

underscores the absence any injury to any marine mammal 

in Southern California despite 40 years of the Navy's 

use of sonar operations in that area.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
