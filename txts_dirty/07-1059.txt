 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

and 07-1058, USEC v. Eurodif.

 Mr. Stewart.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 IN NO. 07-1059

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The question presented in this case is 

whether the provision of enriched uranium under 

separative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the 

Federal antidumping duty law. The resolution of that 

question turns on whether the performance of SWU 

contracts results in merchandise being sold in the 

United States. The Department of Commerce, which is the 

Federal agency entrusted by Congress with the 

administration of the antidumping duty law, concluded 

after an extensive investigation that SWU contracts do 

result in sales of enriched uranium. That determination 

was reasonable and should be sustained by this Court.

 Now, the fundamental bargain in a SWU 

contract is that the customer, the utility, provides a

combination of feedstock or feed uranium plus cash, and 

receives in return a specified quantity and assay of 

enriched uranium, and by "assay" I mean the percentage 

of weight of U-235 within the final product. Now, the 

customer has discretion to choose among varying 

combinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete 

the transaction for a particular quantity and assay of 

enriched uranium; but the enricher has its own 

discretion. That is, having received the consideration 

paid by the utility, the enricher is free to make its 

own determination based on economic considerations as to 

the relative proportions of feedstocks and SWUs that 

should be used to make a given quantity of enriched 

uranium.

 So the overall -- the character of the 

overall transaction is comfortably characterized as a 

sale, because it involves the acquisition by the utility 

of a product, merchandise, that it didn't own at the 

outset of the transaction in exchange for consideration.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I can imagine you could 

have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain 

absolute identical one to the other. And the farmer 

takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he 

drives away with the grain, milled. Now, it may make no 

difference to anybody whether the identical molecules

are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they 

are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.

 MR. STEWART: Well, indeed, as we've 

explained in our opening brief, at common law the 

distinction between a bailment and a sale in that type 

of circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the 

equivalent processor was under an obligation to return 

the very same thing in processed form. And if that 

was --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are saying if we have 

that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some 

farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be 

milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they 

come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the 

identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they 

have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the 

Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and 

the antidumping statutes apply?

 MR. STEWART: We are saying that Commerce 

could treat it as a sale. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, would it or not?

 MR. STEWART: I think Commerce in that 

hypothetical -- again, if we were talking about grain 

being provided by the customer to a miller overseas --

overseas, and then the finished product being brought

back into this country, I think the logic of the 

Commerce determination here would suggest that it would 

be a sale.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you, and I 

just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any 

businessman involved in any of these or related things 

before this decision of the Commerce Department would 

have thought that that is how the Commerce Department 

would have treated such a transaction?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I don't think that 

Commerce had before this incident dealt with exactly 

this type of situation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but common law would 

have treated it that way, you say?

 MR. STEWART: Common law would have treated 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's pretty good 

authority.

 MR. STEWART: It certainly suggests that 

Commerce could permissibly treat it as a sale.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. I'm 

asking -- the question is the same as the last case, to 

me: Not whether they could have done it; sure they 

could have done it. My question is based on my question 

of whether they had a rule that any reasonable person

would have thought that is how they treated it --

MR. STEWART: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because after all, you have 

three precedents in related areas, not the direct area 

but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't 

have treated the millers that way.

 MR. STEWART: I'm not sure exactly which 

precedents you mean. If -- the one that is -- the 

administrative determination that is cited most 

frequently is SRAMS from Taiwan, in which the design 

house provided, I believe it was a design mask to the 

foundry, and the foundry manufactured the finished 

equipment and in concluding that it was the design house 

rather than the foundry that was properly treated as the 

producer of the goods, the Commerce Department relied in 

part on the fact that the design house had intellectual 

property rights in the design mask.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You know what, I'm thinking 

of those things, they're something called "tollers." I 

don't know exactly what tollers are. They seem to be 

like people who give haircuts. They're sort of 

servicers of some kind. They're talking about tollers 

and -- and subcontractors. And that is a related area.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And the SRAMs 

cases is one of the toller or subcontractor cases. And

the Department of Commerce relied in part on the fact 

that the design house had intellectual property rights 

in the design mask. So it was not fungible property, it 

was not an input that the foundry could have gotten from 

another source.

 The other thing we would say about the grain 

hypothetical is that when you hear about the farmer 

providing grain to the miller or the utilities providing 

feedstock to the enrichers, it may conjure up images of 

a tangible good that is in the physical possession of 

the farmer or the utility that is then physically 

transferred to the enricher. In the case of the miller 

that is correct.

 But the way that a utility provides 

feedstock to an enricher is not by taking physical 

possession of the feedstock and then by transporting it. 

Rather, the utility simply makes financial arrangements 

with the supplier of feedstock, basically cuts a check 

or transfers funds --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I ask a 

question about the scope of discretion involved here? 

Assume the facts were not exactly as they are here, it 

is not a fungible product, but that each shipment was 

separately identified and each shipment was processed as 

a different batch in France and then sent back. That I

assume would not normally be treated as a sale of goods?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think that Commerce's 

determination suggests, without squarely holding, that 

it would treat that as a sale of goods because it would 

involve substantial transformation of the original item.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's really what I 

wanted to ask you. Even if the facts were more extreme, 

just as in the example I gave, do you think the Commerce 

Department would have discretion to treat that as a sale 

of goods?

 MR. STEWART: We do. And I think it's 

important, to carry on with the thought I was sketching 

out previously about the way in which the raw materials 

are provided to the enricher.

 If you imagine my buying a suit from a 

tailor, and the tailor says: The price is $600; $300 of 

that accounts for the cost of the cloth; $300 is the 

labor that's involved in sewing it into a suit. 

Clearly, that's a sale of merchandise, even though the 

price has been broken up --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But then supposing they 

send the suit back to a different person for 

alterations, and they say, well, this is part of the 

sale, so we want to treat it as a sale of goods?

 MR. STEWART: Well, the alterations would

just be a finishing process and that wouldn't involve 

substantial --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the difference 

between that and what we've got here?

 MR. STEWART: But the point I was going to 

make about the suit, and it applies equally to the 

uranium enrichment process, is if I say to my tailor, 

rather than I pay you $600 and you pay your cloth 

supplier $300, how about I just give you $300 and I will 

give $300 to your cloth supplier, and it will amount to 

the same thing in the end, because you won't have to pay 

for the cloth? If the tailor accepts that arrangement, 

the economic substance is exactly the same. And it 

would seem strange to say that it's a sale if I just pay 

$600 to the tailor, but it's not a sale if I break down 

the cost in the way that I've described.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you articulate 

precisely what your test is, because you have been going 

back and forth between whether the raw materials are 

fungible and whether there is a fundamental 

transformation in the product? So, how would you merge 

those two in an articulable test so that business people 

can know when they are going to be subject to this 

regime and when they were not?

 MR. STEWART: I think that the Commerce

determination -- that Commerce did not purport to either 

promulgate a regulation or announce a test that 

precisely defined the term "sale". I think the thrust 

of the Commerce Department's determination was that 

substantial transformation was enough, but that the case 

was much easier by virtue of the fact that the 

producer -- the enricher dealt with fungible goods and 

also had substantial discretion to decide how much of 

the feedstock would be used vis-a-vis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would say your 

ultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial 

transformation, and whether it's a raw material or 

discretion, those go into that determination?

 MR. STEWART: That's correct, although it 

would certainly be appropriate for this Court if it 

didn't want to address the situation in which only 

substantial transformation was present, to say that at 

least when both circumstances were present there was a 

sale.

 And again, to distinguish this somewhat from 

the miller hypothetical, the miller in making grain into 

flour may have discretion as to which individual grains 

to use for a particular batch of flour, but it won't 

typically have discretion as to what weight of grain 

will be used to make what weight of flour. And the

enricher has that discretion as well; that is, to 

produce a particular quantity and assay of enriched 

uranium, the enricher can either use more feedstock and 

fewer SWU's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's a SWU? You lost me 

on the SWU. What's a SWU?

 MR. STEWART: A SWU is a unit of work and 

it's work in the sense of output; that is, it is the 

work necessary to separate out a particular quantity of 

enriched uranium --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you put in more time 

with the uranium, with the same amount of 235, if you 

put in more time you can get out more?

 MR. STEWART: That's right. The amount 

of -- the separation process or the enrichment process 

involves a separation of the original feedstock into the 

enriched uranium and what is referred to as the tails, 

which is the residue or the depleted uranium.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure you're 

prepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals. What 

about a diamond? You have a chunk of rock that contains 

a diamond. You send it to Antwerp and they carve it 

away into something that, I guess you could say it's 

been substantially transformed. It's not just a rock. 

It's now a glittering diamond. Is that covered by --

MR. STEWART: I'm not sure whether Commerce 

would treat that as substantial transformation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Neither am I, and 

it's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern. It's a 

fluctuating test that is hard to determine how it's 

going to be applied in a wide variety of cases.

 MR. STEWART: Now, in this case -- in this 

particular case, Commerce noted that there was no 

dispute among the parties that the enrichment process 

did result in substantial transformation. So that --

that uncertainly is not present here.

 But I agree that there is a gray area with 

respect to substantial transformation that isn't present 

when you are trying to answer the question: Is the 

customer getting back the same thing in modified form or 

is he getting back a different thing? That is, although 

the contracts between the utility and the enricher deem 

the enriched uranium to have been produced with the 

customer's own feedstock, everybody acknowledges that 

that is not the fact in the real world.

 And so, what the customer receives back is 

not like your diamond hypothetical, in which he receives 

an improved version of the original product. It is as 

though you had a diamond company that said, we need 

inventory all the time, and we're prepared to work out

an arrangement where if you send us a raw diamond plus 

cash, we will send you back a different cut diamond. 

That would be a sale, regardless of whether there was 

substantial transformation, because you would have 

payment of consideration for a product that you 

indisputably didn't own at the outset.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, we're 

reviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit. And the 

Federal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power 

case in which the same issue was presented, albeit under 

a different statute.

 But I -- reading that Florida Power, where 

the Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position, 

the Government's position then was that this very same 

transaction involved the rendition of services and not a 

sale of goods.

 Does the Government have a distinction 

between those two cases, or are you now saying in 

hindsight you realized that the position that you took 

before the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?

 MR. STEWART: I don't think we have 

disavowed the position we took in the Florida Power & 

Light case. Now, in all candor, I would have to say the 

question of the Contract Disputes -- Disputes Act's 

applicability to SWU contracts is of a lot less interest

to the Federal Government now than it was then, because 

the reason that arose in a case involving the Federal 

Government was that at that time USEC was a Government 

instrumentality and we were representing USEC in its 

governmental incarnation.

 Now that USEC has been privatized, the 

Federal Circuit is unlikely to confront the question 

whether the Contract Disputes Act applies to this sort 

of, because these are not -- this is not a Federal 

entity, in any event.

 The reason that we think the two cases are 

reconcilable is that the Contract Disputes Act, as its 

name implies, is a statute that governs the resolution 

of disputes between contracting parties. And in that 

situation, it's much more appropriate to look to the 

form of the parties' arrangement. And the court -- the 

Federal Circuit in Florida Power and Light placed a lot 

of emphasis on the fact that the contract was styled as 

one for enrichment services. And that is an appropriate 

consideration to take into account when you are 

resolving disputes between the contracting parties, but 

when the whole purpose of the antidumping statute is to 

prevent contracting parties from entering into 

arrangements that are mutually beneficial to themselves, 

but that would and unfairly disadvantage domestic

competitors, it was appropriate for Commerce to look 

behind the form of the contract and to look at physical 

and economic reality.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it correct that 

the universe of transactions that is the subject of this 

Act is sales? Is that not right? Rather than service 

contracts.

 MR. STEWART: Well, it is true that the 

antidumping statute requires that merchandise be sold in 

the United States, and we don't contend that the statute 

applies to price discrimination in services like 

insurance or banking.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you -- do you 

contend the word "sold" is an ambiguous term, requires 

construction by a particular agency?

 MR. STEWART: It is ambiguous at the 

margins; that is, the classic arrangement, the classic 

sale is an exchange of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think Congress 

intended the ambiguity to be resolved by an agency 

rather than judges applying the rules of common law and 

the rules of sales law generally?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, and I think this is a 

statute that has been around for, I believe, close to 

90 years now; and in order for it to remain efficacious

in this area, Commerce has to be able to adapt its 

principles to new forms of transactions. Again, that 

doesn't mean that Commerce's discretion is limitless, 

but it has some discretion at the margins.

 If I may, I would like to reserve the 

balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 IN NO. 07-1078

 MR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would submit, as the questions this 

morning have indicated, one of the difficulties in this 

case, obviously, is this is the kind of transaction that 

can be thought about reasonably enough in different 

ways. It is possible to look at this very narrow set of 

circumstances where a customer is providing raw 

materials of the kind that the producer uses to make a 

good, and to say in that circumstance we could look at 

it as the customer providing two kinds of consideration 

for the good it's receiving; or we could look at it, as 

the Respondents do and as the Federal Circuit did, as

saying, the other way to look at it is this is 

essentially the customer receiving a service on its own 

goods.

 Now it seems to me to begin with, the 

question that is before the Court properly is whether 

Commerce, which is undoubtedly the agency charged with 

enforcing this statute, has adopted a reasonable view 

when it's taken one of those two positions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what do we do about 

the question that is bothering me? Maybe at some 

point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I 

will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have 

the power to classify it either way.

 What is bothering me, and maybe that's not 

in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer 

just said, this statute has been around for 90 years. 

There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign 

commerce during that time. Yet I don't find cited here 

any instance in which Commerce ever before said that 

when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad, 

for even a big change in it, and then it comes back, 

that that is a sale.

 Now, I might -- I don't know all the 

Commerce cases; maybe they did. But what I found here 

is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the

tolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to 

the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a 

client, and that client said if I keep title to the 

good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.

 MR. FARR: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now that's the -- the 

question I want responded to in the legal context of, 

has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?

 MR. FARR: Several things about that, 

Justice Breyer. First of all, as we have indicated in 

our brief, Commerce did have a policy prior to the 

tolling regulation, where it did treat these kinds of 

transactions as sales of goods.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I read -- at what page 

do I find all these cases?

 MR. FARR: That is in our brief. I'm sorry, 

I don't have --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, roughly. I'll find 

it. I will find it.

 MR. FARR: But it's in --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I will see a lot of 

cases where --

MR. FARR: Where we discuss Commerce's 

tolling precedent. And then it went and it essentially 

decided that what it had done in that precedent, it

wanted to reexamine that, because it thought in the end 

what was happening in all of those cases is there was a 

resale of the merchandise; and it thought it would be a 

better practice to focus on that sale of the merchandise 

for purposes of applying the statute.

 When it did that, however, it found it had 

created a loophole in the case where there wasn't a 

further sale. So it has gone back to that. So at least 

in terms of the precedent, Commerce has been on 

different sides of that, but they have been wrestling 

with exactly the problem that I outlined at the 

beginning, which is dealing with a question that 

essentially has no ready answer to it and trying to pick 

among the plausible answers that were available to it.

 Secondly, just about the specific situation 

here, I don't believe that there is any chance that the 

utilities and the enricher in this case could claim 

unfair surprise or unjust reliance; because they say in 

their own briefs, they did not set their transactions up 

in this way in order to try to comply with prior 

decisions of Commerce.

 They say -- they make a point in their brief 

in saying we have perfectly innocent intentions here, 

that they set their transactions up purely for 

historical and commercial reasons.

So -- now, the other question that 

Justice Breyer raises is about the cases, and 

Justice Ginsburg I think mentioned earlier the Florida 

Power & Light decision. And again, Florida Power & 

Light is a case in which there is no agency that is 

before the Court.

 So at that point there is no question of 

Chevron deference, no question of whether this is a 

reasonable position; all that the Court had to decide 

was, given the possible choices, which did it think was 

the better choice under those circumstances? And 

particularly I think it's important in that case, is the 

Federal Circuit said, this is a case that doesn't fall 

readily into either of the two categories. So it went 

ahead and had to decide it on its own.

 But it seems to me that when you say in a 

case with an agency involved, and the agency has made 

one determination, that a case could fall within either 

of categories -- of categories --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Farr, are there 

earlier cases that applied Chevron deference to the 

Commerce's determination of what a sale is?

 MR. FARR: No, there are not, Your Honor, 

that I am aware of. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that the Chevron

case is not a substantial evidence case?

 MR. FARR: I do think so, although I must 

say the line between the two is not enormously clear to 

me, to be honest. But -- but the fact is if I were 

trying to figure out where on the side of the line it 

goes, it seems to me that this is a case in which you 

are talking about the application of a legal standard to 

a particular set of circumstances.  I mean, in Chevron, 

you have the situation, is a certain kind of facility a 

stationary source or whatever? I mean that -- you could 

say, well, that is a factual question in some way, but 

it seems to me ultimately the better way to think about 

it is Commerce's responsibility is to interpret the law 

in the light of cases that come up.

 I mean, an agency does not -- is not 

expected by Congress just to sit back and imagine all 

the possible situations that could be a sale of 

merchandise. I think what the agency is supposed to do 

is, confronted with the circumstance in a particular 

transaction, to apply its judgment on the statutory 

language and say, yes, we do think this is a sale of 

merchandise or no, we don't.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we are to defer 

to the agency's interpretation, what -- how would you 

phrase its interpretation, apart from "this is a sale"?

MR. FARR: Well, I think -- the narrowest 

interpretation, and it seems to me the one that is most 

readily dealt with is, to say, in a situation where a 

customer provides raw material that is the type of, but 

not the precise raw material, used by a manufacturer to 

make the good that it then delivers to the customer, in 

that situation, we are going to treat the manufacturer 

as having made a sale of that good for the consideration 

of the cash and the raw material.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter 

whether there is a substantial transformation or not?

 MR. FARR: I think it does, 

Mr. Chief Justice, in this sense, that we are talking 

about the sale of the merchandise and that is a new 

good. So the substantial transformation is essentially 

what moves the ball from -- from being the -- the raw 

material supplied by the customer to something 

different. And the question would be in this case, 

could Commerce reasonably think that the manufacturer 

had sufficient control over the new good to be deemed 

the owner of that?

 And I think it's important to look, if you 

look at the -- there are two different commodities that 

are being talked about in the case of this transaction: 

One is the feedstock, the raw material; the other is the

LEU. And the idea that the Respondents posit is, well, 

this is just a service performed on our material. All 

we are doing is getting our material back after a 

service has been performed on it.

 But as everybody agrees, as a matter of 

fact, that is simply not so. They are not getting their 

material back with a service performed on it. They are 

getting a product that has been produced, manufactured, 

from raw material that is fungible and in the general 

inventory of the manufacturer. And in that case, it 

seems to me, Commerce can say, we are going to disregard 

the fiction of the parties' contracts that say this 

really is made from our material, and say we are going 

to look at the actual nature of the transaction. And in 

the actual nature of the transaction, as I said, it is 

not made from their material.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that -- so that 

is the critical factor, whether it's made from their 

material, regardless of whether there is a 

transformation? If the domestic entity provides wood, 

wooden two-by-fours, and the foreign entity coats it in 

a certain way, but they can use any two-by-fours, they 

are indistinguishable, you would say in that case 

there's still -- that's still subject to Commerce's 

position?

MR. FARR: No, I don't think Commerce would 

say that. I am to some extent speaking for them here. 

But I think what Commerce would say is, when you have a 

fungible raw material in substantial transformation 

without --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's got to be 

both?

 MR. FARR: I think that Commerce would say, 

if you have both, that clearly can be regarded as a sale 

of merchandise, and we will regard it as a sale of 

merchandise. On the other hand, if you only have 

substantial transformation but not fungibility, then I 

believe Commerce would say, even in that situation, 

because it's ultimately the effect on the domestic 

competitor is exactly the same, we would retain the 

discretion to treat even that as a sale of merchandise.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you --

MR. FARR: I would emphasize that's not the 

case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you do that if you 

thought it was clear as a matter of common law or under 

the Uniform Sales Act, or something like that, that it 

was not a sale?

circumstances, under the common law, for example, I

should make very clear -- but I should make first my 

answer to you, Justice Stevens. Under the common law, 

the particular transaction we were dealing with here, 

where it is not made from the identical material, is 

clearly a sale under the common law. But if you -- if 

Commerce were going to say, in a situation where it is 

made from the identical material, we want to depart from 

the common law, I think they would have to justify that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Under common law, you 

don't need deference.

 MR. FARR: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. If it were 

clearly a sale under common law, you wouldn't need to 

rely on deference.

 MR. FARR: Well, in the end, I think, in the 

commercial setting, there is a reasonable chance, not 

necessarily certain because you do have the UCC and you 

have the possibility, in those situations, the courts 

might say, in a commercial setting, we are going to pay 

more attention to the parties' efforts to structure 

their contracts in a particular way, so that between 

them, we are going to treat the contract differently. 

All our position is, is that Commerce, in applying the 

antidumping law to protect a third party doesn't have to 

observe the fictions in the parties' contract.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. FARR: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Halligan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to start with Justice Breyer's 

question about the way in which the Department of 

Commerce has treated transactions for the processing of 

goods and the uncertainty that their position in this 

case will cause, not just in this industry but across 

industries.

 As you suggested, Justice Breyer -- you 

referred to -- the Department of Commerce has treated 

processors who are called "tollers", in the language 

that Commerce uses, as performing a service. And the 

transaction for the sale of that service has not been 

treated as a cognizable sale under the antidumping law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And those have been cases 

where the very same product is returned with value 

added, right?

 MS. HALLIGAN: Not necessarily. Sometimes 

that is the case, Your Honor, but not always. For 

example, in the Taiwan Semiconductors case, which Mr.

Stewart referred to and which is cited in our brief, 

what the U.S. company provided was simply a design to 

for a chip. The Taiwanese company, which was the 

processor in the case according to the Department of 

Commerce, manufactured the chip, provided the silica, 

used the design of the U.S. company, but no raw 

materials at all. The Department of Commerce, in its 

explanation as to why it treated the sale for purposes 

of the antidumping law as the eventual sale by the U.S. 

company and did not and could not treat the sale by the 

processor as a cognizable sale, explained that the 

statute itself requires Commerce to compare the U.S. 

price, which is called the export price, the price at 

which a good is sold or imported into the United States, 

with the price at which the product is sold in the 

company's home market. And because a processor does not 

and cannot either provide all the essential components 

of the product, because it's only providing the 

processing service and not the raw materials, and 

because it does not and cannot set the price at which 

the product is sold in the United States, it is 

therefore not the appropriate sale to look at that in 

terms of the antidumping statute. That's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do about 

the substance versus formality question? I mean, if you

do have fungible raw materials, why should it make a 

difference whether the domestic company supplies those 

to the foreign company or simply says -- gives them 

money and says, buy them yourselves? And in the latter 

case, you would say that's a sale, and in the former 

case you would say it's not a sale?

 MS. HALLIGAN: First of all, the Department 

of Commerce has not until this case suggested that 

fungibility of goods might make some sort of a 

difference. In fact, in one of the cases that we cite 

regarding flanges which were, according to the 

Department of Commerce, fungible, they concluded that 

the processing service there was not the cognizable 

sale, the downstream sale of that product was.

 But more importantly it doesn't change the 

substance of the deal between the two parties. What the 

utilities come to the table with is cash, and they 

provide the feed. It is fungible as a matter of its 

physical properties. It is a gas. And when the feed is 

put into the gaseous diffusion chamber, which is the 

large installation that the enricher uses to concentrate 

the two different molecular isotopes, it takes a month 

for the gas to work its way through this plant. The 

enricher cannot feasibly segregate different lots of 

feed, just like you can't with a grain elevator.

The analogy would be, with respect to a 

grain elevator, you would have to run in one farmer's 

bag of feed, run it all the way through the elevator and 

through the mill, and wait until the product comes out 

at the end, and then run another farmer's bag of feed 

through. That's economically impractical and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, old mills used to do 

that. The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill, 

and it would be ground right there while he was waiting.

 MS. HALLIGAN: But -- but there is nothing 

about the economic transaction that requires that it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's absolutely true.

 MS. HALLIGAN: -- that happen, and more 

importantly, the enrichers don't end up at the end of 

the day with any feed. They are also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your brief constantly 

assumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the 

entire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately 

becomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same 

feedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately 

delivered. And that is simply not true. There is a 

change -- there is a change of ownership. The feedstock 

that somebody else put into the mix is now transferred 

to the -- to the electric utility.

 MS. HALLIGAN: It may be the same molecules;

it may not be. There is no way to know or to tell. And 

there is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's exactly right. You 

don't know. So, you had cannot say that there has been 

no transfer of ownership.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Respectfully, Your Honor, I 

disagree. If you look at the contracts, and the 

substance squares with the contracts because, at the end 

of this transaction, what the enricher walks away with 

is cash and what the utilities walk away with are the 

same number of uranium molecules that they came to that 

plant with.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, we've got the same 

molecules. I mean, when you are talking about whether 

there has been a transfer of ownership or a transfer of 

title, you are talking about molecules; you are not 

talking about whether you ended up the same in, you 

know, in monetary terms. You are talk about whether you 

have the same thing that you delivered to the person 

overseas. And you don't, or at least you can't say that 

you do.

 MS. HALLIGAN: You can't say for sure 

because the gas molecules can't be segregated that way.

 I think that you need to look at two things: 

I think that you need to look at what each of the

parties to the transaction come to the table with and 

what they walk away with. And with respect to the 

utilities, they come to the table with uranium. It's a 

very expensive commodity. The contracts are clear that 

they hold title to it through the process until such 

time as they take possession of the concentrated 

uranium. It is clear from the contracts that there is 

an intent to maintain a continuous stream of ownership.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That makes no sense, what 

you just said. That contract makes no sense. They hold 

title to it until they get the uranium rods, right?

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, they hold title to it 

until -- just to provide a --

MS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, the contracts 

provide several things. First of all, they provide that 

the utilities will deliver their feed within a certain 

number of days prior to the date on which they will have 

the concentrated uranium product provided to them. It's 

60 to 90 days, depending on the contract.

 So, pursuant to the contract, they deliver 

the uranium feed. The utilities run it through their 

system. And at the end of that diffusion process, they

take the concentrated isotopes out and they provide that 

to the utility. The enrichers don't receive any amount 

of feed that they can then take on to the open market.

 By distinction, if you look at a used car 

sale, for example, which is an analogy the government 

uses. If I want to trade my car in, I come to the 

dealer and I bring with me two pieces of consideration. 

I bring the used car, which is payment in time and I 

bring cash. I walk away with my wallet a little bit 

lighter and a new car, and the used car dealer has cash, 

but also has an item that he can then go out onto the 

market and sell.

 That does not occur here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's only -- that's only 

true because apparently they use up all the feed that 

they get. If, in fact, they found a way to manufacture 

to enrich more efficiently so that some feed was left 

over, I presume you would not be here arguing that they 

could not sell that feed on the open market even after 

they had delivered the enriched uranium to the buyer?

 MS. HALLIGAN: The price terms of the 

contract provide only for the utilities to pay for the 

amount of energy that is expended.

 I would distinguish this from another kind 

of contract per uranium feed, which we don't contest is

covered by the antidumping laws. There is a very small 

percentage of concentrated uranium, of low enriched 

uranium that is sold pursuant to what the parties call 

an enriched uranium product contract, an EDP contract. 

That sort of a contract is one in which the enricher 

goes out into the market procures feed and performs a 

processing service. The utility comes to the enricher, 

pays them cash and walks away with the product.

 By comparison, in these contracts, the 

utilities are providing something that is very valuable. 

The feed company --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but why are they 

providing something that is very valuable that, in fact, 

could not be obtained by the enricher on the open market 

if those were the contract terms? The enricher buys it 

in the -- in the -- I forget the acronym in the case 

that you just described -- and we don't know -- we have 

no reason to believe the enricher couldn't go out on the 

market and buy it if, in fact, the utility didn't supply 

the feed.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Those are very different 

kinds of contracts, though, Your Honor.

 The contract in which the enricher simply 

provides some amount of enriched uranium for a price and 

procures the feed, which is a sliver of the total

contracts -- it's 5 percent even for USEC -- is one in 

which the enricher is bearing the cost of the feed and 

the risk of those price fluctuations.

 The reasons that the contracts are 

predominantly, almost exclusively structured as services 

contracts by distinction is that the utilities choose to 

manage the process of procuring fuel themselves.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. They would rather 

manage the risk of price fluctuation than, in effect, 

pay the premium that the processor would have to charge 

in order to hedge against price fluctuation --

MS. HALLIGAN: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's why they are doing 

that.

 MS. HALLIGAN: And so, they go out into the 

market and procure the feed pursuant to whatever 

arrangements they have with their feed suppliers. By 

comparison, all they are coming to the enricher for is 

the service of concentrating that positional isotope 

into the assay --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That is a way of looking at 

it. But another way of looking at it is because they 

choose to, in effect, take the risk of price fluctuation 

as preferable to paying a higher ultimate price, they 

are simply, for that reason, choosing to pay both in

cash and in a -- a valuable commodity, i.e., unenriched 

uranium. You can look at it either way.

 MS. HALLIGAN: They are. But they are 

choosing to pay two completely different entities in two 

unrelated and two unlinked transactions. So, it 

doesn't -- we are not disagreeing that there is a 

transaction for feed that the uranium -- that the 

utilities engage in to procure their feed. There has to 

be. But that is not part of the distinct services 

contracts for processing only, which is all that the 

Department of Commerce is looking to shoehorn into this 

statute here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Halligan, try this 

hypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the 

doubt. Let's assume a department store buys raw wool 

from some sheep herder, sends it overseas. And it's 

worth $1,000, this raw wool. It is processed, spun and 

knitted into sweaters, and then shipped back to the 

department store. The sweaters, all made from the same 

wool, not even fungible, so that's why this is even 

better than your example -- the sweaters when they come 

back, are worth not $1,000, but $20,000.

 Do you think it would be unreasonable for 

the Commerce Department to treat that as a sale of 

sweaters by the European knitting wool or -- or home

knitters who did the sweaters?

 MS. HALLIGAN: It would be perfectly 

appropriate for the Department of Commerce to do what it 

has done in the past, which is to treat the sale of the 

sweater by the U.S. companies for $20,000 as the 

cognizable sale.

 The only thing that makes this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again?

 MS. HALLIGAN: In your hypothetical --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about the --

I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to 

the American department store.

 MS. HALLIGAN: That would be a processing 

transaction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A processing transaction. 

It has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what 

did I say -- $20,000? And that's just processing?

 MS. HALLIGAN: Let me give you an example of 

what the Department of Commerce has looked at. They --

they looked at the processing of pasta. And the --

there the manufacturer came to a company -- this is a 

place called Certain Pasta from Italy -- it's referenced 

in the brief -- the company came to the processor with 

wheat and presumably whatever other products went into 

the pasta, some milk or eggs. The pasta was processed

and made into pasta from the wheat and given back to the 

U.S. company.

 The Department of Commerce concluded that 

the appropriate sales target was not the making of the 

pasta, the processing of the pasta, but the downstream 

sale of the pasta in the United States.

 And that is what the statute requires.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They said there was no 

sale.

 MS. HALLIGAN: They said that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When the pasta was 

imported, there was no sale into the United States.

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, they said that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's what we are 

talking about here.

 MS. HALLIGAN: We don't disagree, Your 

Honor, that there is a product that comes into the 

United States, it's low enriched uranium. But the 

statute doesn't target the importation of products. And 

in that way it is distinct from the companion statute, 

the countervailing duty statute. What this statute, the 

antidumping statute, covers is the sale of merchandise 

into the United States.

 That means that you have to have merchandise 

as distinct from services, but by comparison to

countervailing duty statute covers both, which is part 

of how we know that Congress means that distinction 

tolls. And you have to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Get back to your pasta 

case. Was the holding of that case that there was no 

sale into the United States?

 MS. HALLIGAN: The question before Commerce 

was which transaction is the appropriate transaction for 

us to treat as -- as the one that establishes the price 

all over the United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different issue. 

We are not talking here about which transaction 

establishes the price. We are talking simply about 

whether there was a sale into the United States.

 MS. HALLIGAN: It turns on the same issue, 

Your Honor, and here's why. In all of these processing 

cases that the Department of Commerce has looked at, 

they have explained that the reason why the cognizable 

sale is the sale of the finished product in the United 

States, the pasta, the sweater, or whatever it may be, 

is because the statute gets at price discrimination. 

And it instructs the Department to look at the price at 

which the product is sold in the United States.

 The price for the weaving of the sweaters, 

even if it does add the sort of value that you are

talking about, is not the price at which the product is 

sold, nor does it reflect all of the components of the 

transaction, because there is some components that the 

wool request. So to determine whether there is price 

discrimination, you have to look apples to apples at 

which the product is sold in the United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait. Suppose these 

knitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their 

sweaters for a much higher price in Europe. Instead of 

$20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are 

selling it for $40,000. And they nonetheless sell the 

wool back into the United States for only $20,000.

 You are telling me that that transaction 

doesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping 

law?

 MS. HALLIGAN: To the extent that it may --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That you have to look at 

the price at which the department store then sells to 

individuals?

 MS. HALLIGAN: That's right. Because that's 

what the statute is intended to capture. The statute 

was enacted --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the department store is 

not dumping. It's -- it's the knitting mills that are 

dumping.

MS. HALLIGAN: But the question, Your Honor, 

is -- is the price at which the product is sold in the 

United States. Section 1677(a) defines "export price" 

and "constructed export price" as the price at which the 

subject merchandise is first sold in the United States. 

And that is what you have to look at.

 It may certainly be true that you may be 

able to sell a product at less than its fair value to 

the extent that you are obtaining processing services at 

a price lower than what you could obtain them in a 

foreign country. But the -- the bottom line is you have 

to look at what the statute explicitly instructs, at the 

price at which the subject merchandise is sold in the 

United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And accepting that, 

you -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with 

a sale, with a sale into the United States, right?

 MS. HALLIGAN: A sale and I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought this is --

this is what you say fails in this case. That is the 

link of the chain that doesn't exist. You say there is 

no sale in the United States.

 MS. HALLIGAN: There is an importation of 

LEU into the United States by the utilities. The 

utilities consume that fuel in their reactors. They do

not sell it onward as the company would sell a sweater 

or would sell a pasta or would sell Rya rugs. That is 

something that makes this case somewhat different and --

JUSTICE BREYER: That is pretty important. 

Tell me -- this is a hard area, obviously. But the --

imagine -- think of all the toller cases that they've 

had.

 Now -- now, is this right: That in every 

one of those cases there were two companies, A and B; 

and in every one of those cases A sells a finished 

product into the United States. And also A sends the 

product to B to have some major thing done on it. In 

every one of those cases the Commerce Department could 

say: We can take A as a Respondent; i.e. we think A 

might violate the law, because maybe it's an Italian 

company, or we think B might violate the law. Is that 

true of all those cases?

 MS. HALLIGAN: It is true.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if it's 

true of all those cases, then I think what the opposite 

position is, what Mr. Farr said, I think -- I think, you 

know, I will -- he will say: Look at page 40 and 41 of 

their brief. When I look at those pages, I am going to 

see a lot of cases. And I bet, when I look them up, 

those Commerce cases are all going to use the word

"substantial transformation." And he will say: You 

see, that's what they did here.

 Then he's going to add -- I don't mean to 

put words in his mouth if the words are wrong, but --

but he's going to add: Look at those tolling cases. 

Those are all cases where Commerce had a choice of which 

to consider the sale. It could have considered the sale 

from the processor A to -- to B to A, the sale if it 

wanted to; or it could have considered the sale into the 

United States if it had wanted to, to be the sale for 

purposes of calculating the price.

 And so in choosing between those two, either 

of which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale, 

the final sale, because that's how they could calculate 

the price.

 But in your case there is no such person A, 

because the utilities are not people who could be 

respondents. I mean they are not in the same position. 

There is no sale onwards that they could choose. So we 

will go to the other guy, the party -- the person who 

does the processing. Are you following what I am 

saying?

that?

 MS. HALLIGAN: And here is why that's not 

sufficient. It's the problem of the tail wagging the 

dog, right? What the United States is saying is that 

because in this single circumstance we do not have a 

downstream sale of pasta, or a sweater, or whatever the 

item might be, and we can't go after that transaction, 

that, therefore, we are asking this Court to sign off on 

essentially rewriting the statute.

 The statute refers to a sale of merchandise.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But, remember, they 

are saying in the tolling cases, in my words: Hey, we 

could have gone after the processor if we wanted --

MS. HALLIGAN: But that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if there had been a 

substantial transformation, because the key to this 

concept of "sale" is the word "substantial" 

transformation.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Two responses, Your Honor:

 First of all, the statute doesn't allow 

that, and I would recommend to the court the remand 

response that Commerce provided in the Taiwan 

semiconductor case.

which is cited in the brief. It explains why the 

definition of "export price" and "constructed export 

price" means you can't go after a processing 

transaction.

 Secondly, in order to find for the 

government here and reverse the Federal circuit, you 

would effectively have to agree with the government's 

position that processing services where they are part of 

the manufacturing operation somehow are within the terms 

of the statute. And so that would mean that the 

government can say in this case that because there's no 

downstream sale that it can capture, it will choose to 

go after the processing transaction. But there is no 

way to gauge down the road whether it will make the same 

choice. And here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What does -- what does the 

government do with respect to these other transactions 

where, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed 

uranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting 

the rods?

 MS. HALLIGAN: In those cases --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no down -- you 

know, there is no domestic sale there, either. Is it 

conceivable that there, therefore, can be no dumping in 

such a case?

MS. HALLIGAN: No. Those cases -- we -- we 

do not disagree -- are a sale of merchandise because the 

utility is paying for the entire commodity.

 What -- that is a substantial transformation 

point, Justice Breyer. I would like to -- to return to 

that.

 There are many processing transactions which 

involve some kind of substantial transformation where 

you have a product like wheat and you turn it into 

something else like pasta, or wool and you turn it into 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that in all 

of those cases there is no transfer of ownership of the 

basic product? And here -- and I am not sure you have 

really addressed it --it is a fungible product, and you 

are assuming you can't tell whether -- when it is in 

process or whether it is one party's or the other's.

 But if you could tell and you had some way 

of identifying just which one here, but they wouldn't 

care because they are all equally valuable, and if it 

developed that it was actually a third party's product 

that was being processed, then there would be a transfer 

of ownership, and there clearly would be a sale. Isn't 

that true?

certainly not for the same reasons that you would have 

that in -- in a grain elevator. If the enricher goes 

out and purchases the feed and holds title to that feed 

while it is enriching it, then, yes, there would be a 

transfer of ownership.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you have the same 

contract you've got here, but you are able to identify 

that, in fact, there is a difference in the -- in the 

commodity that -- that -- at least not a different raw 

material that was sent to France and returned. It is 

just a substitute. It seems to me that -- in that 

context, within the meaning of your argument, that there 

would have been the transfer of title to that -- that 

commodity.

 MS. HALLIGAN: First of all, you can't tell 

-- and I don't think there is any -- any dispute as to 

that fact. But, secondly, if you look at the common law 

of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, isn't it true, if 

you can't tell, the odds are that there is some product 

the title to which has been transferred?

are two sources for the uranium, A and B, and it goes to 

the enricher. A gives it; B gives it. A ends up with 

B's uranium. Justice Stevens is saying at some point 

there is a transfer of title.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: At what point did that 

title transfer?

 MS. HALLIGAN: It -- maybe the useful 

analogy is money -- is money in the bank, Your Honor. 

If I take $100 and I bring it to the bank, ten 10's, and 

I take away five 20's, I may not have the same dollar 

bills that I brought to the bank, but I don't think 

anyone would argue that, somehow, the bank takes title 

to my money. I retain ownership of that, and there is 

nothing in the contract which suggests that there is any 

change of ownership that is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you 

don't retain ownership of that. And if you go to the 

bank and say: Show me my money, they are not going to 

say: Well, here's your money. They -- they have title 

to it. They own it, and you have a claim against the 

bank to what you gave them.

 MS. HALLIGAN: But the bank could not hold 

title to that as against me if I came and tried to take 

the money out of my safe deposit box, nor could the 

farmers at the -- at the grain elevator be told that 

they -- they don't have title to the grain.

if they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility 

could get ahold of the product?

 MS. HALLIGAN: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay.

 MS. HALLIGAN: And let me clarify this 

because it's an important issue. These are very 

expensive, offshore transactions that the utilities 

engage in in order to purchase a feed. It is a very 

valuable commodity. So what is critical to the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if they go 

bankrupt because -- I mean let's say they don't have all 

the uranium. They have got five people who shipped them 

uranium, and they have only got enough for four. Each 

of the five can't say: I'm entitled to get mine back.

 MS. HALLIGAN: But -- but the system doesn't 

operate that way, Your Honor. The contracts provide 

that the utilities have to deliver feed. And it's a 

very different sort of business that the utilities are 

engaged in, to go out into the market and make bets 

based on the price fluctuations for uranium and procure 

that uranium.

 The enrichers are not in that business, and 

so there would be no economic reason or any reason 

provided for in the contracts for them to proceed that 

way.

I would like to touch briefly, if I can, on 

the purpose of the statute, because the government 

relies very strongly on this notion that somehow the 

processors' sales have to cognizable in order to further 

the antidumping statute.

 This law is not a boundless license to 

protect domestic industry from any competition. There 

are other statutes that are are written much more 

broadly in the trade laws; for example, the 

countervailing duties law, the safeguards law which 

allows the Department of Commerce to impose quotas or 

tariffs on the import -- not the sale but the import of 

any goods, statutes regarding the protection of 

intellect0ual property rights, all of which are cited in 

the -- in the briefs.

 So the notion that somehow to protect the 

integrity of the statute you need to rewrite it to allow 

them to address processing sales exclusively is really 

not -- not well-founded.

 Finally, with respect to the loophole 

question that the government has relied on, I think it's 

important to focus on what is specifically at issue 

here. The government initially argued that it was 

critical to address this case and these particular 

transactions because of concerns about agreements with

the Russians.

 That has been addressed as to U.S. concedes 

in its -- legislation that has been implemented by 

Congress. The government has consistently in court and 

in its decisions -- not just in the Contract Disputes 

Act that you referenced Justice Ginsburg, but in other 

cases regarding the UCC which relates to the sale of 

goods, the government has said: These very kinds of 

contracts for the processing of uranium are contracts 

for services. They are not covered by statutes that 

reach the sale of goods or the disposal of property.

 There is nothing that has changed with 

regard to the statute or with regard to these kinds of 

transactions; and, accordingly, we would ask you to 

affirm the Federal Circuit. If there are no other 

questions --

that utilities come to the enricher for services and not 

for goods. And to understand what it is that utilities 

acquire, I think it may be helpful to ask: Under what 

circumstances would the utility have a valid breach-of-

contract right?

 And it is very clear that the enricher's 

obligation under the contract is to deliver a specified 

quantity and assay of enriched uranium at a specified 

time and place. And if the enricher complies with that 

obligation, it doesn't matter that the enricher decided 

to -- what they call in the industry -- "overfeed"; that 

is, use more feed staff stock and fewer SWU's to produce 

the final product.

 And the utility in that circumstance 

couldn't file a breach-of-contract claim by saying: I 

paid for more SWU's than I actually received. Because 

what the utility had contracted for was a given product.

 The second thing -- and I think the 

corollary to that is -- it's potentially misleading to 

say that every contract is either one for merchandise or 

one for services, especially when you are contracting to 

acquire ownership of a commodity that doesn't exist at 

the time the contract is formed. The only way you are 

going to get to your ultimate objective is for somebody 

to create it. And that can generally be described as a

service, but it still results in the sale of goods.

 With respect to the used-car analogy, I 

understood Ms. Halligan to acknowledge that -- that that 

would be a sale even though the consideration paid by 

the customer is partly in cash and partly in kind. And 

if the customer and the car dealership characterize 

their contract as one for car-refurbishment services and 

said that the new car the customer receives shall be 

deemed to be the used car that it traded in in 

refurbished form, nobody would contend that that deeming 

quality should be controlling.

 Now here the -- the falseness of the 

proposition that it's the same feedstock is less 

apparent, but it's equally the case that the utility 

doesn't receive back its original feedstock.

 And finally the perspective of tolling 

regulation in cases, Commerce has essentially said three 

things:

 First, we were dealing with a separate 

question; that is, who is the producer, which sale is 

relevant, and not whether the goods are covered at all.

 Second, they said in those situations the 

tollee was exercising much more control over the 

ultimate process than is the case here where the 

utilities don't manufacture anything. They simply pay

for one of the inputs.

 And, finally, Commerce said that if at some 

level of abstraction there is a tension or contradiction 

between what we said previously and what we decide 

today, then what we decide today controls. And Commerce 

is entitled to make that determination.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Stewart. The case is submitted.
