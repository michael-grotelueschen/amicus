 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-1181, Dada v. Mukasey.

 Mr. Meade.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress has provided that certain aliens, 

including those with good moral character, are eligible 

for voluntary departure. Congress has also provided 

that all aliens may file one motion to reopen raising 

new facts within 90 days.

 The question is how to reconcile these two 

provisions. The parties agree on two key points: 

First, the Government agrees that the statute can be 

read to preserve motions to reopen for voluntary 

departure recipients. Second, the Government agrees 

that such aliens can file a motion to reopen; and if the 

immigration official happens to act quickly enough, the 

alien will receive a ruling. But, under the 

Government's view, if the official does not act quickly 

enough, the alien is denied an adjudication.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we consider that in

your case, given that the application to reopen was made 

when there were only two days left to run for the 

termination of the voluntary departure time -- in other 

words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that 

made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?

 MR. MEADE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I 

have two responses, one relating to this particular case 

as well as the cases in general.

 But, as to this particular case, Mr. Dada 

found new counsel, which took a week; and in the 

remaining time he prepared a motion to reopen with 80 

pages of exhibits including affidavits, five letters, 

medical documents, financial records including tax 

returns. And that's why it took an additional 

two-and-a-half weeks to do the motion to reopen.

 But, as a general matter, aliens file at 

different periods during the period. For example, in 

the Eleventh Circuit case of Ugokwe the alien filed with 

30 days left in the period, and the Government, the 

agency, didn't act in time.

 But what happens in the agency is that 

motions to reopen are, in fact, decided relatively 

quickly -- just not quickly enough.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many of those 

are -- are granted?

MR. MEADE: How many --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What percentage of 

motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?

 MR. MEADE: We've looked for that statistic, 

and we have not been able to find the statistic. 

However, there are numerous cases presenting very 

sympathetic facts which show grants of motions to 

reopen.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many -- do 

you know how many are filed on an annual basis?

 MR. MEADE: Yes, I do. As a general matter, 

there are 10,000 motions to reopen filed, but that's for 

all aliens, for all removal proceedings. Since 

voluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all 

removals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions 

to reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there would be no 

reason not to file one of these if you were subject to 

voluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it 

extended your time to stay, right? Seemingly, everybody 

would file one of these if we rule in your favor.

 MR. MEADE: Not necessarily. There are --

the statute governs when a motion to reopen is proper, 

and the Attorney General determined, even under the 

previous statutory scheme --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're dealing with 

people who have already broken the law. So you're 

saying they are likely to follow the statute that says 

only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?

 MR. MEADE: Well, two responses: First, 

there are sanctions for frivolous filing under the 

immigration proceedings.

 Second, the Attorney General, under the old 

regime that wasn't tightened -- the Attorney General 

concluded that there was no pattern of abuse of motions 

to reopen.

 And, third, going forward, this is not a 

risk because --

JUSTICE ALITO: If an alien has not been 

diligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue 

the person was still entitled to equitable tolling if 

the alien files a motion to reopen?

 MR. MEADE: When you say that they're not 

diligently pursuing their rights, I am not clear --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that generally a 

requirement for equitable tolling: A person has to have 

been diligently pursuing his rights?

 MR. MEADE: Generally, yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't advocate the 

adoption of that here. You say if you file a petition

-- a motion to reopen, you get automatic equitable 

tolling.

 MR. MEADE: Yes. Not necessarily equitable 

tolling, but, yes, automatic tolling under the statute. 

But to show quickly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't -- why isn't it 

fair to say: You have the short time frame by statute 

to leave the country if you've left in voluntary 

departure. Yet, the Government has provided reopening 

for all aliens. Okay.

 Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by 

asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to 

voluntarily depart within "x" days, you are 

relinquishing your voluntary departure status?

 MR. MEADE: That --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that a perfect 

reconciliation of the two?

 MR. MEADE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That's 

the option that the Government is proposing 

prospectively. It is also something that my client 

requested at every stage of the proceedings before the 

Board, before the Fifth Circuit, and the cert petition, 

and in our opening brief. That is one way to reconcile 

the two statutory provisions which the Government is 

proposing on an ongoing basis that will not apply to our

client.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you raised the 

question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert 

petition. The Government advised against granting on 

that question and limiting it to the question of having 

it -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary 

departure and moving to reopen.

 MR. MEADE: Yes, that's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, another way 

to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to 

your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to 

address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily 

depart, your motion to reopen is automatically 

withdrawn. That is, as I gather, set forth only in a 

regulation and not the statute.

 Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I 

thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be 

much more concerned about that interpretation -- that 

the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than 

I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling 

rules and all of that.

 But, I take it, the vulnerability of that 

regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.

 MR. MEADE: Well, that regulation is subject

to litigation. That would be another way to solve the 

problem as you suggest. It would be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it wasn't directly 

challenged here, was it?

 MR. MEADE: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That regulation was not 

directly challenged in this case?

 MR. MEADE: It was not directly challenged 

because the Fifth Circuit is one of the circuits that 

says that the motion -- that regulation is valid.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't 

address it here, there's going to be another case in a 

year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?

 MR. MEADE: Your Honor, as to voluntary 

departure recipients, this Court can construe the 

statute to avoid the conflict here. And, moving 

forward, the Government has a proposed solution which, 

if adopted, will resolve the question on an ongoing 

basis.

 Some of the examples of the facts that arise 

in motions to reopen are seen in various cases. For 

example, a child newly diagnosed with mental 

disabilities as in the Azarte case in the Ninth Circuit, 

a parent newly diagnosed with health problems as in the 

BIA case of Diaz Mucho --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in all these 

cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion 

to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits 

that you have availed yourself under voluntary 

departure, and then the motion to reopen is not 

automatically withdrawn.

 MR. MEADE: With respect, that's not an 

option to our client. Our client tried to do that, but 

was not permitted.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean he -- you 

should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.

 MR. MEADE: Well, the problem is because of 

the very nature of the motion to reopen. A motion to 

reopen, by its very nature, is based on changed 

circumstances, circumstances that were not available at 

the original time of the hearing.

 So a person could enter and accept voluntary 

departure at the time of the hearing and, because of 

circumstances that change, that, by definition, he or 

she could not have known about, is then in a bind when 

he wants to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What were those 

circumstances here?

 MR. MEADE: The circumstances here is that 

previous counsel had failed to submit an application and

supporting evidence. And under the BIA case law that's 

a proper vehicle for a motion to reopen.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it existed? You're 

not saying something that came up later? What was the 

ground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by 

the first counsel?

 MR. MEADE: It was a file for adjustment of 

status, an application for adjustment of status and 

supporting documents, as well as the supporting evidence 

showing that this was a bona fide marriage. And the BIA 

has numerous cases which says that a motion to reopen of 

this type is a valid motion to reopen.

 Now, of course, the agency didn't rule on 

whether the facts did or not -- did or did not need a 

motion to reopen. So that question isn't before the 

Court. But the other cases show the various kinds of 

tracks that come up to establish a motion to reopen and 

why it's an important part of the immigration process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Meade, why was your 

client not allowed to withdraw the voluntary departure 

option, withdraw from it?

 MR. MEADE: Justice Souter, that's unclear. 

The agency didn't ask -- didn't answer that in the first 

instance. There has never been a reason given 

throughout the entire litigation, and now there is some

irony --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So all we have on the 

record is just an IJ's determination that he would not 

accept it?

 MR. MEADE: Well, it wasn't the IJ. It was 

before the Board. It was presented to the Board, and 

the Board's order only said he is ineligible for this 

relief because he has overstayed the voluntary departure 

period. But there is some irony --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the time he filed, 

he had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday 

afternoon, right?

 MR. MEADE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so maybe the point is 

we didn't have time to rule on it simply because he 

filed it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on 

Sunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a 

determination that had he filed in time for timely 

action by the court he would have been denied.

 MR. MEADE: The agency has never given a 

reason for why they did not accept the withdrawal, 

although there is some irony in the fact that the 

proposed solution going forward would give aliens 

exactly what my client asked for if the agency --

JUSTICE ALITO: If the voluntary withdrawal

had been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been 

subject to the alternate order of removal?

 MR. MEADE: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And he could have been 

removed immediately?

 MR. MEADE: That's correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And that would have mooted 

the motion to reopen, wouldn't it?

 MR. MEADE: It wouldn't have mooted the 

motion to reopen. Motions to reopen are available to 

all aliens subject to a final order, including criminal 

aliens, including some accused of terrorism.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it remain pending once 

he had left the United States?

 MR. MEADE: Not once he had left the United 

States. But all my client wants -- all my client wanted 

at that time was to be placed in the same circumstance 

as all other aliens subject to a final ruling.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but he's not in the 

same circumstance. I mean, he's made his choice. He 

was offered voluntary departure, which had advantages. 

He could arrange his affairs and go when he wanted 

within 60 days. What he gave up was the ability to 

appeal the determination.

 That doesn't seem to me as, as outrageous.

I mean, it happens all the time.  When a criminal 

defendant pleads to a lesser charge, he gives up the 

ability to appeal. And that's what's going on here. He 

has gotten the advantage of a voluntary departure and 

given up the ability to appeal. I don't bleed for him.

 It seems to me it's an option presented 

before him and he took it.

 MR. MEADE: I have three responses, Justice 

Scalia.

 First, I'll agree that the alien can file 

the motion to reopen. The only question is whether it's 

going to be adjudicated in time.

 Second, as for the question of the bargain, 

whether giving up appeals is part of the bargain, all 

parties agree that an alien who accepts voluntary 

departure can continue to appeal to the Board, to the 

courts of appeals. The only, the only adjudicatory 

process that the government says that my client is not 

entitled to now is one motion to reopen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Still and all, it's part of 

the deal. Even better. Even better. He hasn't even 

given up all his appeals.

 MR. MEADE: One final --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just, part of the deal 

he gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's --

that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary 

departure.

 MR. MEADE: One final response is that in 

the government's proposed regulation, an alien is 

permitted to file a motion to reopen notwithstanding 

having been granted voluntary departure, which indicates 

that the government itself does not think that the 

bargain includes -- or that Congress did not intend the 

bargain to include a waiver of the one motion to reopen 

which all aliens are entitled to file.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to the 

question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would 

then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first, 

like any other removable alien. And Justice Alito asked 

you: Well, then he could be removed immediately, is 

that not so? My understanding was, yes, that's so, but 

you can move for a stay of removal when you have a 

reopening pending. Is that true?

 MR. MEADE: Yes. If you have a final order 

of removal, yes, you can file for a stay once you have a 

final order. So my client is in a worse position. 

Because he's under the voluntary departure grant, he 

cannot get the same ability for a stay that those who 

are subject to a final removal. So the irony is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you say that tolling is

automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be 

possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not 

automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the 

hearing officer?

 MR. MEADE: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or are we then just 

inventing something that's not in the statute at all?

 MR. MEADE: Well, the problem, Justice 

Kennedy, is that the agency would need to act within the 

short time period. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. All it needs to do is 

to say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at 

this.

 MR. MEADE: That's true, Justice Kennedy. 

But that's essentially the same action that would be 

needed to decide the motion to reopen in the first 

place. Motions to reopen are discretionary. They go to 

the same Board member that had decided the original 

appeal. So it does not take much time or effort for the 

agency to be able to decide these, as is reflected by 

the general time periods for adjudication.

 For example, in the Dekoladeno case on the 

Fourth Circuit, the motion was decided in 23 days. In 

the Sidikhouya case out of the Eighth Circuit --

doesn't take them much time because when someone elects 

voluntary departure they don't have to address it. I 

mean, this would obviously increase the volume of 

motions to reopen. As I said, I don't see know why 

anybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it 

extends their stay.

 MR. MEADE: It's a discretionary 

determination to the single Board member. And the Board 

member could deny the motion to reopen, even when 

there's a prima facie case. All they have to do is look 

to see if it -- in the subset of cases that the agency, 

exercising its own discretion, where they agree that a 

motion to reopen is proper. And all we're asking for in 

this case, not special procedures, not anything added to 

the motion to reopen process, but only the right to have 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there appeal? I mean, 

what happens? They file a motion to reopen, denied. 

Now, can they appeal that?

 MR. MEADE: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And how much time 

does that take?

 MR. MEADE: Well, the denial of a motion to 

reopen, at that point there would be a final order in 

effect.

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. But how -- do they 

then appeal the motion to -- they appeal the motion --

the denial of the motion to reopen or how long -- where 

do they go? Do they have -- this is the Board, so they 

go right to the court of appeals?

 MR. MEADE: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And how long do those take 

on average?

 MR. MEADE: One difference, though, between 

petitions for review and motions to reopen is that 

petitions for review can be decided from outside the 

country under the 1996 amendments. And motions to 

reopen under the agency's regulations, cannot. So the 

problem is that there is no ability for an alien --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in the 

problem. I'm interested in how much added time it 

actually means. So let's go -- if you win, how much 

additional time in a typical case would the alien have 

before he has to leave?

 MR. MEADE: Petitions for review take 

longer. According to the agency's current regulations, 

they take approximately, I believe, 13 months or so is 

what the --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then, and then do you 

in addition ask for cert or is it not in addition? Are

 JUSTICE BREYER: Or would you just guess on 

the basis of your experience? I'm not holding you to 

it.

 MR. MEADE: There might be cases where alien 

seek cert as well. But for the most part --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. What I'm 

wondering here, and this is because I see two contrary 

things, if for to you win it means that you are adding 

an average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress 

said we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120? 

That's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the 

truth.

 MR. MEADE: Well, one of the answers on that 

question on the petition for review front is exactly 

what the government has proposed in its rule going 

forward, which is that an alien who has voluntary 

departure can file a petition for review, but by doing 

so the voluntary departure grant terminates and they're 

in the same position as other aliens, on the same level 

playing as other aliens. That's the solution being 

proposed by the government going forward, and as to the 

petition for review hypothetical that would also apply.

That would just put my client in the same position as 

all other aliens, including criminal aliens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure I understand 

it. Are you asking for automatic tolling just until the 

motion to reopen is decided or until the motion is 

decided and also the appeal process has run?

 MR. MEADE: Just for the motion, just for 

the time that the motion to reopen is decided.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, that's the 

answer to my question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But in your discussion with 

Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang 

around right through the appeal.

 MR. MEADE: Thank you for the correction, 

Justice Scalia.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your 

position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as 

under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken 

away?

 MR. MEADE: No, Chief Justice Roberts. The 

difference is that petitions for review can be 

adjudicated from outside the country, so whether the 

alien is here or abroad he can get an adjudication of 

his motion -- of his petition for review, and that was a

change under the 1996 act.

 The problem for motions to reopen is that an 

alien cannot receive an adjudication at all. He can't 

stay. He can't go. There's no way for those new facts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's by regulation, 

though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of 

the country.

 MR. MEADE: Yes, that's true. That is 

not -- that is by regulation, although that regulation 

applies to all motions to reopen, not just for the 

subset of motions to reopen or voluntary departure 

recipients.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If your client or some 

other client, assuming the government wins in this case, 

leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for 

rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits 

and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much 

longer?

 MR. MEADE: No. The problem is that for an 

alien, for many aliens covered by voluntary departure, 

once they leave the country they are subject to various 

unlawful presence bars. So by leaving the country these 

bars are triggered and they cannot get the same relief 

from outside the country.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even with voluntary

departure?

 MR. MEADE: Even with voluntary departure. 

Leaving the country triggers these bars. Once you're 

outside the country you cannot reapply for admission for 

in some cases up to 10 years, and that precludes the 

ability to leave the country and seek the relief, even 

if you have a marriage to a United States citizen, even 

if there are extreme circumstances in a particular case 

that need to be addressed and that would be addressed 

under a motion to reopen.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have to argue 

that the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's 

say it's the government's proposed regulation and the 

motion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to 

enable you to consider the motion to reopen. They can 

proceed with deportation at that time, correct?

 MR. MEADE: Absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you almost 

have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the 

time for deportation as well, right?

 MR. MEADE: No. We just want -- under the, 

under the question -- under the government's proposed 

rule or under the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, under your 

position, I guess, is what your position is on that.

MR. MEADE: Right. Well, the tolling 

solution, the tolling construction, would permit tolling 

during the voluntary departure period and during the 

voluntary departure period there is no final order in 

effect. So yes, it would toll the time for leaving the 

country.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 

government cannot enter a deportation order during a 

voluntary departure period.

 MR. MEADE: Yes. That's governed by the 

agency's own regulations that say that there's no -- the 

ultimate order of deportation does not go into effect 

until an overstay of a voluntary departure period.

 One thing that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So I'm not following this. 

I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the 

government's new proposed system, in which the 

acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you 

file a reopening petition, right. So can the government 

then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also 

going to be stayed until, until completion of the 

reopening petition?

 MR. MEADE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. 

You're absolutely right. I was addressing the tolling 

construction with Mr. Chief Justice. But as to the

government's proposed rule under the proposed rule and 

what my client asks for, the time -- the alien would be 

automatically subject to a final order and could be 

deported involuntarily so long as the alien did not get 

and obtain a stay of deportation from the agency or the 

court, so yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that, that involuntary 

deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition 

for reopening, right?

 MR. MEADE: If the agency acted quickly 

enough and involuntarily deported someone within that 

time --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why are you willing to 

leave the involuntary deportees in that position, 

whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary 

deportees in that position, that their reopening 

petition just vanishes? Why is it any fairer for the 

involuntary deportees than for the voluntary? In fact 

it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made 

their choice.

 MR. MEADE: Your Honor, I agree with you 

that that regulation is problematic, although the Court 

does not need to address it in this case.

 With the court's permission, I would like to 

reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The filing of a motion to reopen does not 

automatically suspend the obligation of an alien to 

leave the United States within the time that was 

specified in the Board's order granting permission to 

depart voluntarily. The grant of voluntary departure 

reflects an exchange of benefits between the government 

and the alien and Petitioner's automatic tolling rule 

would greatly subvert that reciprocal arrangement by 

giving the alien the unilateral and automatic ability to 

extend the substantive terms of the immigration relief 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I think, I 

think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good 

answer to that. I also thought it was a quid pro quo, 

but it's a very strange quid pro quo. I could 

understand the government saying, look, if you accept 

voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to 

choose between asking for reopening or voluntary

departure. But that's not the quid pro quo you're 

saying that the government is adopting. The quid pro 

quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the 

dice as to whether your reopening petition will be 

decided in time. It isn't dead. It's still there, but 

you just have to hope that it will be decided before you 

get deported.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me make one --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very 

strange statutory quid pro quo, it seems to me.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Let me make one point clear 

at the outset. Petitioner's motion to reopen was not 

dismissed because he was not able to file one. It was 

denied because he was not eligible for the underlying 

substantive relief that he requested in this motion. 

Overstaying a voluntary departure period does not, for 

example, bar an alien from obtaining asylum or 

withholding of removal on a motion to reopen. It's only 

the particular substantive form of relief that he 

requested in his motion to reopen that is at issue, and 

that was denied.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be. But 

Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right 

to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is. 

And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry

Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what 

seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted 

that right in effect across the board, regardless of 

what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would 

have done so knowing that the, that the time for 

adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than 

the period of the, prior to the moment of required 

departure. It sounds as though Congress on your view 

would be -- would have been giving a right to reopen 

that in practical terms in most cases will avail the 

alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out 

before there can be an adjudication.

 MR. KNEEDLER: With all respect, that's not 

correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Again, both prior to 1996 and 

after 1996 Congress specified that an alien who 

overstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible 

for three forms of discretionary relief. Now it's 

voluntary departure, cancellation or removal, or 

adjustment of status. That was true both beforehand and 

afterhand. Before 1996, there was no statutory 

limitation on the time for either a motion to reopen or 

voluntary departure. Congress was concerned about 

abuses on both of those fronts, and what it did in 1996

was to compress the voluntary departure time for 60 days 

because it was concerned about how long the agency was 

allowing agents -- aliens to remain in the country under 

orders of voluntary departure. And what it did with 

respect to motions to reopen was very modest. It just 

put in statutory form a limitation that the agency had 

put in place pursuant to a statutory directive to place 

time and number limitations on motions to reopen because 

of Congress's concern about abuse.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but isn't the 

question in this case whether what Congress did was as 

modest as you say? Because if it is as modest as you 

say, then in at least a substantial category of cases in 

which a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact 

be no time in the real world to act on that motion 

before the voluntary departure date. And the question 

is did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is 

as modest as that.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And it seems strange that 

it would have.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Two responses to that. With 

respect to the voluntary departure, Congress anticipated 

that the alien was going to leave under the order of 

voluntary departure, not remain here. And prior to

1996, just to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was -- was the 

regulation -- was the current regulation in place at the 

time of the '96 Act, that the -- that the departure of 

the alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to --

MR. KNEEDLER: That regulation has been a 

fundamental part of motions to reopen going back at 

least until the 1960s.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, we assume that Congress 

knew that.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, we do have. And 

that's part of the arrangement. The only thing -- and 

that regulation was repromulgated as part of General 

Motion to Reopen Regulation in 1995.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then Congress knew at 

the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to 

reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably 

couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the 

alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or 

(b) will have departed and, under the existing 

regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen. 

And it's the strangeness that Congress would want --

would have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a 

statutory level under these circumstances unless it 

contemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would

avoid this sort of Kafka-esque result.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. Again, if I may, the --

what Congress had in mind with the deal of granting 

voluntary departure was it greatly constricted the time 

to leave. You have to leave in 60 days, and if you 

don't leave in 60 days, you're not going to get 

voluntary departure adjustment of status or cancellation 

or removal. It didn't affect the eligibility for other 

substantive relief that an alien might file for in a 

motion to reopen, such as asylum, such as if he has new 

evidence going to the ground of removal. But Congress 

was particularly concerned not to allow these three 

forms of discretionary relief to remain available. And 

so I think Congress necessarily would have been 

unconcerned about whether, if an alien did file a motion 

to reopen within that greatly constricted 60-day period 

-- in fact, in this case the Board gave 30 days --

Congress wasn't concerned about preserving the 

underlying substantive eligibility for those forms of 

discretionary relief, because it made that part of the 

deal, that alien was giving up if he left -- if he 

didn't leave the country, he was giving up that. Those 

were lesser order forms of relief that Congress was 

making available, but it did did not take away, for 

example, the right to apply for asylum or withholding.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, why did the 

Government advise this Court not to grant cert on 

question number 1, which was: I want to apply to reopen 

and simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary 

departure and be just like any other removable alien, 

take my chances just like anyone else? The Government 

said don't present that -- Court, don't consider that 

question. Why?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Because that had not been --

led to widespread litigation in the courts. This 

automatic tolling rule is -- was what we were 

fundamentally concerned about. In fact, we told the 

Court not to take the case at all because the new 

regulations were under consideration. But that 

particular provision -- issue has not generated that 

much litigation. This automatic tolling rule has, and 

more than --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it seems that this 

litigant said, number one, I don't want to take 

advantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can 

do so voluntarily. The first thing I want to do is to 

move to reopen, withdraw my voluntary departure. And 

then the second thing was, if I can't do that, please 

extend my voluntary departure time while I move to 

reopen. It seems that this litigant is being put in a

bind by not allowing this Court to consider what was the 

alien's first preference, that is, to withdraw the 

voluntary departure.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But the Court rewrote the 

question presented so as not to -- not to address that, 

so I think it's not before the Court right here. But --

but beyond that, the deal, the arrangement -- the 

Attorney General has a lot of discretion how to 

implement the voluntary departure provision. In fact, 

he has the authority to eliminate voluntary departure 

for additional categories of people who are not eligible 

under the statute itself. So whether to --

rule that an alien can't withdraw, can't seek to 

withdraw a request for voluntary departure?

provide for it, and it's inconsistent with the --

JUSTICE ALITO: There is no regulation that 

prohibits it. Is that right?

 MR. KNEEDLER: As far as I'm aware there is 

no regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a 

grant of voluntary departure, and the Board of 

Immigration Appeals order says you're granted permission 

to depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the 

following consequences flow from that. Nothing in the

Board's order would allow the alien to avoid those 

consequences by saying on the 28th day, after all I 

don't want to do that. And this matter of implementing 

the voluntary departure agreement is part of a general 

scheme of a quid pro quo between the alien and the 

United States. The voluntary departure is granted under 

circumstances where the alien doesn't have that option. 

So unilaterally -- allowing the alien unilaterally to do 

that now is not provided for. Now, that doesn't -- that 

doesn't take away from the Attorney General's 

discretionary authority in implementing the Act to 

provide for that, which is what he has proposed in the 

new rule. But this case has to be decided under the --

under the rules that are now in effect.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm having a lot of trouble 

understanding the case, because it's so complicated. If 

you -- could you track it through for a minute? I mean, 

as I understand this, this probably doesn't concern 

people who want to voluntarily depart before their case 

is finished, right? Where they don't reopen because 

there is nothing to reopen?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, but the people --

who is before the Board or before the hearing examiner

chance to get into court, right?

would be correct unless -- I don't think this has ever 

come up that I'm aware of, about whether you could go to 

court from an immigration judge's decision where you've 

left the country and therefore can't appeal to the BIA.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: There's no reason to assume 

that you could.

 MR. KNEEDLER: I just don't know the answer 

-- I just don't know the answer to that, because I'm not 

sure that scenario has come up, because usually, if 

somebody wants to contest, they're not going to leave 

the country before they have to, and if you appeal from 

the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration 

Appeals, that suspends the finality of the order of 

removal or the order of voluntary departure that the 

immigration judge has entered. So if you appeal -- if 

you want to stay in the country, all you have to do is 

file an automatic appeal with the Board of Immigration 

Appeals and that suspends the finality of the departure 

time.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And by doing that you do 

preserve your right to appeal; and you will preserve 

your -- will you also preserve your right to go to court 

if you lose in front of the BIA.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes. You do.

JUSTICE SCALIA: So why, if you want to have 

a petition for reopening, why don't you just file an 

appeal and then file a petition for reopening and the 

appeal will enable you to stay in the country until your 

-- your petition for reopening is --

MR. KNEEDLER: If you appeal to the Board of 

Immigration Appeals, a motion to reopen arises only 

after the Board has issued a final order on your appeal. 

So if you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, if 

the Board rejects your claim on the merit, and 

reinstates the voluntary departure period to allow you 

to enter again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're appealing the 

immigration judge's decision.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The immigration judge's 

decision, you're appealing that to the BIA.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

judge's --

MR. KNEEDLER: With the immigration judge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose you could do 

that, but the -- but the appeal -- it would be like a 

motion to reopen in the district court while you've got 

an appeal to the -- to the BIA. I -- I think once the 

appeal goes to the Board -- this case involves motions 

to reopen filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals, 

not with the immigration judge, and so -- the alien here 

conceded his deportability, sought a continuance, and 

that was denied. He had no other substantive grounds of 

relief. He asked for voluntary departure. That was 

granted. He took an appeal to the BIA arguing he should 

have been granted a continuance; the Board affirmed; 

reinstated a 30-day departure period; and then he wanted 

to seek reopening.

 And one question that Justice Breyer asked 

about, what if reopening is denied would the automatic 

tolling rule continue? I suppose the alien could file a 

motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen, 

and if you had an automatic tolling rule, it would -- it 

would last as long as it took the Board to act on the 

motion to reopen, which is -- which 60, 90, 120 days.

resolved I think only about 55 percent of those within 

90 days. The Board has a huge backlog, and we're 

talking -- and so we are talking about the very kind of 

abuse of the immigration system that this Court was 

concerned about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask one question? 

And I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer 

was going to begin. I take it that the motion to reopen 

has -- shows new evidence, new factors, new 

circumstances; and that would be unavailable on the 

appeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented. Or 

am I wrong about that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's true. It has 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: While you have an appeal 

-- while you have an appeal from what was in the record.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, although --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you don't have the 

motion to reopen then the -- then the new material is 

not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It's not subject to the 

appeal as such but the Board procedures take account of 

developments that happen while the case is on appeal, 

which is that you can file with the Board while your 

appeal is pending and ask for a motion to remand on the

ground that new evidence has come up. For example, in 

the case of adjustment of status, where -- the alien's 

wife has filed a petition for immediate relative status 

to let the alien get a visa, if while the case is 

pending on appeal that petition has been granted, then 

-- then it would -- then all the alien has to do is file 

a motion with the Board and say there is new 

information; please remand it back to the immigration 

judge. So a lot of times what has happened is -- maybe 

intervening things have happened but the alien doesn't 

do anything about it during the year that the appeal is 

pending with the Board of Immigration Appeals; then 

there is a final order and the alien rushes in with the 

-- with the new information at that point, where if you 

had only brought it to the attention of the Board while 

the appeal was pending, it could have been remanded.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So your basic is -- don't 

tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please. The --

the -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position 

is and why you've got into this, is because you think 

any really meritorious case where there should be 

reopening will be pointed out to the Board before there 

is a final order in effect and before voluntary 

departure becomes an issue?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if we decide against 

you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in 

every case is after there is a final order, the alien 

will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a 

few extra days.

 MR. KNEEDLER: It's more than a few extra 

days.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He gets a -- several --

MR. KNEEDLER: It's an automatic tolling 

period.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Have I got it right, what 

your point is?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That is correct and I 

-- and I think it's fair to say if you're talking about 

changed circumstances or new evidence that arises after 

the IJ has rendered his decision, that's a period that 

might be a year; it might be a year and a half. New 

developments or changed circumstances are far more 

likely to have happened during that period of time than 

they would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure 

that -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of 

the appeal.

 So an alien in this position who has been 

granted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to 

reopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to

the solution to that is to be alert and attentive and 

file something with the Board, if there are in fact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't the solution to 

withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?

be one -- as the Attorney General said in his proposed 

regulations, that would be one way to administer the 

program, but the Act does not compel that. The Act does 

not compel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you do that, the 

alien is still subject to deportation, right?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. The alien is still 

subject to deportation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: With the provision that 

he can get a stay.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, he could get -- he could 

get a stay of removal, and the same -- same thing is 

true here, if the -- if the alien remains in the 

country, his voluntary departure period expires, he 

could file for a stay of removal with the Board or he 

could file for a stay of removal with the court of 

appeals if he wants to file a petition.

He is like any removable --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. Right. But -- but 

like any person, he could file a motion for a stay with 

the court of appeals to prevent his deportation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not to stay -- but he 

would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure. 

That's gone.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, that -- that is correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any reason he 

could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary 

departure status as distinct from having to get approval 

from the Board or bureaucrat?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as I say, the way that 

-- the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary 

depart and says the following consequences will attach 

if you do not. Nothing in the Board's order allows him 

to withdraw. It grants him that permission.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I know it doesn't --

it doesn't address the issue, and my question is --

forecloses it.

60 days to depart and if you do not, the following 

consequences attach.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the Board is 

saying, look, I'm granting your request -- we are 

granting your request for a voluntary departure status 

and there are certain consequences that that status 

carries. He is saying, on my hypothesis, I relinquish 

that status. Why are conditions that attach when he has 

the status an indication that he cannot voluntarily 

relinquish that status without further action by the 

Board?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- the statute and 

regulations just don't provide for it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if they don't provide 

for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it 

arbitrary not to let him do it? I mean -- what -- if 

it's -- if it's arbitrary --

MR. KNEEDLER: He -- he requested it at the 

outset. The case has proceeded on the sense that that 

is -- that that is the arrangement, that -- that the 

reciprocal benefits and burdens that the Government and 

the alien have undertaken --

reasonable.

adjustment.

defending the contrary position as an overarching policy 

matter, because after all the Attorney General's 

proposed regulations provide for that. My --

JUSTICE BREYER: So why not apply them to 

this person?

 MR. KNEEDLER: As they are now drafted they 

would apply prospectively. But my only point is that 

voluntary departure and motions to reopen are 

administered under the statute and the regulations and 

the BIA orders that are entered under the current 

regulatory framework, which has a different sort of deal 

between the alien and the government in mind, and that

that under the current regime, the voluntary departure 

application, granted, is irrevocable. That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The regulations don't say 

that. The regulations are just blank. It doesn't say 

and if you do this it's irrevocable.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And I want to qualify 

my answer in a further respect -- that regulations with 

respect to voluntary departure being granted by the 

Board don't say anything like that. But I am informed 

by the executive office of immigration review that if 

the immigration judge grants voluntary departure and the 

alien appeals to the Board, the ordinary course would be 

for the Board to reinstate voluntary departure if it 

rejects the alien's appeal. But if on appeal the alien 

requests that voluntary departure not be reinstated once 

the Board's order is entered, then the Board will omit 

that from its final order of removal.

 But Petitioner here did not request on his 

appeal to the Board that the Board not reinstate a --

order a voluntary departure if it had affirmed on the 

merits. And so the Board went forward on the assumption 

that the alien had requested voluntary departure, 

entered an order on that assumption, and once it's 

entered, it's a final order that would require some 

amendment of the order, in order to -- in order to be

changed under the current regime.

 JUSTICE GINSBERG: But the order didn't say 

he couldn't withdraw?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it didn't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what about this? I'm 

just trying this out. You don't have to respond if you 

don't want to. But you say, look, the AG in his rules 

here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that 

we talked about in our prior conversation. Now 

hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable 

way of going about this, and we remand for consideration 

about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do 

that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or 

your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain 

class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive 

discretion?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think if the 

Court wants to get into the question of whether he could 

withdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would 

be to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an 

automatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally 

inconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to 

impose a short deadline and not let the agency extend 

that, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals 

for an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his

request for voluntary departure.

 I don't think the Court should decide that 

question on its own. I think that should be remanded to 

the Board. If in the meantime the Attorney General 

issues regulations that provide for withdrawal of the 

request, maybe because his case would be back before the 

Board, those new regulations could be applied. But 

whether that -- the alien should be allowed to do that 

is fundamentally a question for the Attorney General in 

the first instance.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In one of your -- in one 

of your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of 

voluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and 

so forth. I assume that voluntary departure is never 

elected as an option before the Board rules.

 MR. KNEEDLER: It is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, it -- or 

am I wrong?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It was elected before 

the immigration judge. That's where you request it. If 

the immigration judge rejects your arguments against 

removability, grants you voluntary departure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the removal -- at 

the outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the 

outset of the hearing?

MR. KNEEDLER: You can. And you can get 120 

days of time to depart. You can do that. People who 

don't want to contest the removability at all --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. I mean in a 

contested case.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. In the contested 

cases, you would ask for that at the conclusion of the 

hearing before the immigration judge. That gets 

suspended if you appeal to the BIA because the order is 

not final. It doesn't become final until the Board of 

Immigration Appeals affirms.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, do you 

know what percentage of these motions to reopen are 

granted?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I do not. I asked that 

question, and I do not know the answer to that.

 I would like to come back to the fundamental 

automatic tolling rule that -- the fundamental 

inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what 

Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days 

the time limit in which an alien can depart.

 It also eliminated a prior exception that 

had been the law that allowed an exception to the 

consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much 

longer voluntary departure period for exceptional

circumstances. Congress repealed that exception.

 Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite 

in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an 

alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion 

to reopen, it rejected two arguments. One is that the 

filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional 

circumstances that eliminated the deadline. It rejected 

that. It also in an en banc decision rejected the 

automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for 

here under a situation in which Congress had granted a 

long time for aliens to voluntarily depart.

 We think it defies common sense to suggest 

that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it 

meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had 

done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling 

rule, not even one under the control of the immigration 

authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter 

of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion 

to reopen.

 And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed 

all of those things. The Board of Immigration Appeals 

has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening 

years since 1997 -- and importantly, I would like to 

point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for 

reopening, he relied on a Board decision called

Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an 

alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get 

adjustment of status if there has been intervening 

development with respect to an immediate relative 

petition filed by a spouse.

 The Board adopted that rule in this en banc 

published decision Villarde, but said one of the 

qualifications for being eligible for that relief is 

that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which 

means you not be barred by having overstayed your 

voluntary departure period.

 So, in the very procedure that Petitioner 

invoked in this case, there is a published Board 

decision post-1997 that relies on that -- that relies on 

that rationale, and the Board has followed that 

consistently. It is at the very least a reasonable 

interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not 

to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary 

departure system by providing for reopening.

 I should also point out that this is not 

tolling in the normal sense. Tolling usually arises 

where a person has a claim and there is a statute of 

limitations for filing a claim before a forum.

 Petitioner here was already granted 

voluntary departure. The 60-day time limit is not a

procedural statute of limitations. It is a limitation 

on substantive immigration relief. And we think it's 

particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion 

to reopen would have the effect of changing the 

statutorily limited time in which an alien could 

voluntarily depart the United States.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MEADE: The government's arguments on 

the statutory interpretation in this case are undermined 

by its own proposed rule for at least five reasons.

 First, their proposed rule makes clear that 

the government agrees that the statute can be read to 

have multiple meanings.

 Second, the proposed rule makes clear that 

Congress did not intend voluntary departure recipients 

to waive the motion to reopen in accepting voluntary 

departure.

 Third, the rule stresses the importance of 

motions to reopen and their importance in bringing 

changed facts to the agency's attention.

 Fourth, the proposed rule turns on

unilateral action of the alien and permits that

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with counsel 

for the government as to how long it typically takes for 

these motions to reopen to be disposed of? He said 

something like 55 percent take, what, more than --

MR. MEADE: My understanding is that the 

time, that the time is actually relatively short, that 

they are generally decided within 90 days. They're 

procedures passed by the -- by regulation which indicate 

that they go to the same Board member. There has been 

streamlining procedures by the agency in the early 2000, 

2001, 2002 period which helped expedite these. And 

actually, the time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any 

estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have 

to be considered if your client prevails in this case?

 MR. MEADE: I do not think that there will 

be many additional motions to reopen, if that happens. 

Certainly, if the government has a -- if the proposed 

rule is adopted, the number of motions to reopen will 

not be affected, because prospectively, the solution --

the problem will have been solved, and this case we'll 

only be dealing with people in the pipeline, people who

have already made decisions about whether to file a 

motion to reopen or not.

 So assuming that the government's proposed 

rule is enacted in anything like its proposed form, then 

there will be no problem going forward.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I don't 

understand that, because my -- as I understand it, it 

would in every case grant an effective extension of the 

time which you would have to depart if you had filed a 

motion to reopen.

 MR. MEADE: No, that's not correct, with 

respect. Under the government's proposed rule, the 

alien would be placed in the same position as other 

aliens and would be -- and there would be no additional 

incentive to file a motion to reopen.

 Under the government's proposed rule, the 

period would not toll, the voluntary departure grant 

would expire, and the alien would be placed in the same 

position as otherwise --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it your position that 

the statute requires tolling?

 MR. MEADE: Our interpretation is the 

statute is subject to multiple interpretations. But the 

one thing that the statute does not permit is the 

solution, the construction that's being proposed by the

government in this case. The government -- the statute 

would permit tolling. The statute permits reconciling 

the provisions as the government proposes going forward. 

But the one thing that the statute does not permit is 

the government's position in this particular litigation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You answered my 

question with respect to the government's proposed 

regulation. But under your position that would allow 

the voluntary departure option to remain open, then 

anyone who exercised that option would want to file a 

motion to reopen because it would extend their time?

 MR. MEADE: The motions to reopen are 

subject to statutory and regulatory limits. Moreover, 

the time period --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answer is yes?

 MR. MEADE: I'm saying that there -- aliens 

could choose to do so, but I disagree that there would 

be a -- many additional motions to reopen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer is yes, but the 

Attorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed 

rule would --

MR. MEADE: Yes. That's part of the answer, 

yes, Justice Scalia.

 But in addition, the length of time of 

adjudication is entirely within the agency's control.

It can take two days, two weeks, two months, or if it 

takes longer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not if it has 10,000 

of these a year, as you told me in your opening 

argument. I mean, it takes some time to address them. 

You can't say all they have to do is decide them all 

within two days.

 MR. MEADE: No. But the answer is that 

there -- it is within their control, so the length of 

tolling under any tolling rule is not within the control 

of the alien. It's within the control of the agency.

 This Court -- as to your question, Justice 

Alito, on the -- with the regulations with respect to 

withdraw in this case, the agency is silent on that. 

It's unclear to me why the agency -- may I finish --

it's unclear why the agency did not give my client the 

request he requested, and we ask that this Court either 

grant tolling or interpret the statute consistent with 

the government's proposed rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
