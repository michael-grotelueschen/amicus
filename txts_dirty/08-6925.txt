 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-6925, Johnson v. United States.

 Ms. Call.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA CALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. CALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Mr. Johnson's conviction for battery in the 

State of Florida can be sustained by the slightest 

contact. Such a conviction does not qualify as a 

violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. A 

violent felony means one that has as an element the use, 

attempted use, or threatened use of physical force 

against the person of another. Physical contact is not 

the same as physical force.

 Physical force in this context means 

something more than a mere quantum of physical contact, 

and it requires violent aggression that is likely to 

cause physical injury. This conclusion is guided by the 

rules of statutory construction in this Court's 

precedents. The better-reasoned circuits have applied 

these principles to find that physical force means 

something more than de minimis contact.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's -- you say 

that's Federal law. Would it make a difference if, 

contra what Florida held in the Hearns case, a State had 

typed a battery statute as a crime of violence?

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. If the State 

statute required that the offender admit the use of 

force as part of the elements of his prior offense --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no, no. It's exactly 

the -- it's exactly the statute Florida has. And 

somebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record 

what the conduct was. But the State, unlike Florida, 

says, our battery statute for our State law purposes is 

a crime of violence; therefore, for our State law 

enhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery 

offense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of 

violence, if that's the State law.

 MS. CALL: Then -- no, Your Honor, I'm 

sorry. Then the mere fact that the State found that it 

qualified under its own recidivist statute would not 

bind the Federal court. Why we say that Hearns is 

binding is the proposition that it found the elements of 

a battery offense and the -- the ACC looks to those 

elements to determine whether it is a violent felony. 

Congress didn't say that it -- the offender had to have 

conduct that involved the use of physical force, but a

prior that had as an element the use.

 So the fact that the State statute may 

qualify under its State recidivism wouldn't be the same 

determination that it didn't have as an element the use 

of force. Here --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what -- before 

we can even get into this, I think we have to decide if 

those words "striking or touching" describe one crime or 

two. And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of 

the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase 

matters in this respect. If you think of the seven 

different things covered by one statute in James or 

Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough 

and failing to return from work in day release, seem to 

me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two.

 Now, how do we know that striking or 

touching describes two things? I couldn't find any 

instance, and we had the library looking. I couldn't 

find any instance in Florida where those two things have 

ever been charged separately. And they looked at 

hundreds.

 So -- so why do we think it's two crimes, 

rather than just one called "striking or touching"?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, two reasons. First, 

the face of the statute itself has "or," so it doesn't

require --

JUSTICE BREYER: It does, too, in Chambers. 

It's "not returning from furlough or not returning from 

work release." You know, and I'd -- I would say the 

behavior is the same. It's not like burglary of a 

dwelling versus burglary of a boat. Those are two 

separate things.

 MS. CALL: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Here, why do you think they 

are two separate things?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, because Hearns, the 

Florida State Supreme Court decision, described them as 

three separate offenses and spelled out that this 

statute could be violated and it said by: First, 

touching someone intentionally and against their will; 

second, by striking; or third, by causing bodily harm.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If they are separate 

things, what is the evidence? There is a legal 

question. You say the touching. Spitting, is that 

enough to rise under the -- to fall within the Federal 

statute? Suppose I agree with you on that; the answer's 

no.

 How do I know whether touching as applied in 

Florida as a separate matter in the mine run of cases, 

involves spitting or involves something that causes far

more serious harm? How do I know?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, you would apply first 

the plain language of the statute, and "to touch" means 

the slightest contact, as the courts have held. At 

pages 41 to 42 we spelled out the offenses of spitting, 

making slight contact, that justified a battery 

conviction. "Strike" obviously has to mean something 

else or the legislature wouldn't have included both 

types of conduct within the battery provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this statute is a 

misdemeanor statute, isn't it?

 MS. CALL: For a first offense, yes, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. And the only reason 

what happened here was elevated to a felony was that he 

had a prior offense.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's understandable that 

the slightest touch could -- could constitute a 

misdemeanor.

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, the problem with 

saying that just because it's a felony, therefore it 

can't be considered is that the statute first describes 

the prohibited conduct and says that the conduct is in 

the first subparagraph, the penalty is in the second.

So the very same conduct is necessary for either a 

felony or a misdemeanor, and essentially no force times 

two is still zero.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, ACCA uses the words 

"physical force," and any touching involves some 

physical force. Now, how do we determine how much more 

than the minimum physical force is necessary in order to 

fall within the Federal statute?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, it is a qualitative 

line that sentencing judges would have to make, like all 

of the other difficult decisions that they're called on 

to make in the sentencing guidelines in these 3553 

factors. We've asserted as a proposed test that it be 

conduct just like the Begay test, that it would be 

physical force of a kind that is violent and aggressive 

and likely to cause injury.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there -- most -- this 

statute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be 

used, particularly the touching part, also to cover 

unwelcome physical, sexual advances. And it's not hard 

to consider such matters to have involved force of 

exactly the kind that the Federal statute is aimed at. 

And there was no striking, but there was in fact use of 

harmful force, touching. That was serious.

 Now, how do we know which is more normally

the case when this statute is used in its touching 

respect?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, the government has 

cited a footnote of 6,000 convictions, and there is no 

way to know of those convictions whether they were 

charged as to touch, to strike, or to cause bodily harm.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't have to know 

what's more normal anyway, do we?

 MS. CALL: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if any conviction is 

possible under the element of the crime to touch, when 

there is simply slight physical force, your argument 

still stands, right?

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I would say that's 

certainly wrong under our cases. I mean, I would have 

thought that the reason that burglary, for example, is a 

violent crime is not because in every instance there is 

a risk of physical harm, because in the mine run of 

instances there is a risk of physical harm, and I 

thought we said that in at least three cases.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, as to looking to 

both the enumerated offenses and those that fall in the 

otherwise. The first prong of the ACC, though, does not 

talk about conduct and it does not refer to an ordinary

case. It says an offense that has as an element. And 

therefore it is directed to looking at a particular 

Florida State statute rather than a generic battery or 

how battery might ordinarily --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but an element --

you mean we should interpret "element" in the first part 

of this in a radically different way than we have 

interrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we 

should say that burglary -- in other words, assault 

or -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of 

prosecution there is going to be force actually applied 

or something like that, that it doesn't fall within one? 

I'm surprised at it. I mean, I guess it's possible. 

What would be the argument for doing that, which would 

be totally different than we have handled the other one?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, the reason why is 

that Congress was directing in the first prong those 

crimes that were directed against persons and would be 

defined by their elements. In the second prong Congress 

did list out four enumerated offenses that they thought 

were committed, A, by career criminals, and, B, that 

created that substantial risk. In the first part it 

does not talk about risk to others. It's that 

offender's conduct and an elements-based test.

statute that made it a battery to engage in offensive 

and unwelcome sexual touching, your argument would be 

that that would not fall within the first prong of ACCA, 

because there is not a -- it's not likely to cause a 

physical injury?

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is that right?

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. Because --

JUSTICE ALITO: If there was a statute that 

said -- in the old days I'm told people used to throw 

the contents of chamber pots out the window. If there 

were a -- a State statute that said it is a crime to 

dump the contents of a chamber pot on somebody's head, 

you would say that's -- that doesn't fall within the 

first prong of ACCA?

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, I would say that 

that does not qualify under the first prong.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Even -- those are classic 

batteries --

MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and the language of the 

first prong of ACCA really tracks the language of the 

common law crime of battery?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, it does because it 

talks about in Florida the element is the slightest

contact. And we were not arguing that that offender who 

spits or touches or does these other disrespectful acts 

doesn't deserve to be charged and can't be charged with 

battery under Florida's State law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what about an 

assault? I guess, using a law school hypothetical, I 

mean, a statute for assault -- I guess you could assault 

somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow at them.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, assault is out 

of the statute.

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, again, it depends on 

each particular statute and its elements.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I mean, on 

your definition, as you and Justice Scalia were 

suggesting, because it is conceivable that you could 

assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow, 

that means assault is no longer a crime of violence, and 

that can't be right.

 MS. CALL: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course it's right. 

You don't have to touch somebody for an assault.

 MS. CALL: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can just threaten 

somebody.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Assault is not a crime of 

violence; it's not a use of force.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly not.

 MS. CALL: Two responses to that, Your 

Honor. The first is, looking at the underlying facts 

would violate the categorical approach of saying we're 

not looking at what each offender might have done in any 

particular case, but what are the elements that he 

necessarily admitted. And under the Florida statute it 

would qualify as a violent felony because the Florida 

statute defines it as an offer to do violence coupled 

with the --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about attempted 

murder?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, yes, if it has as an 

element the use of force. And that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But it didn't --

MS. CALL: Yes, but under the ACCA, which is 

one of the phrases that the government elides out of its 

analysis, it's not simply the actual use of force, but

an attempted or threatened use of force.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you something? 

In your definition, you appear to hinge it on the fact 

that the force used has to cause injury of some type, 

that. That appears to be the only definition you can 

give. But the use of physical force means just the use 

of force, strong force, violent force, aggressive force, 

but it doesn't mean that it necessarily has to cause 

injury.

 Would my rearing back and slapping you? In 

those instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury 

as that term is defined in the common law, which is an 

injury of lasting effect. You may have some redness for 

a second, but that's all. Would that qualify as a crime 

of violence?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, some of these 

questions will be difficult lines for the court -- a 

sentencing court to draw. We have offered the 

definition that violent felony, the word "violence" 

encompasses sort of a rough use of force that could lead 

to injury or is likely to lead to injury, not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but violence has a 

broader meaning. It generally means a strong force or a 

strong -- physical force generally has some relative 

degree of -- of impact. I agree with you, the common

definition talks that way. Why should we read something 

more into it, like physical injury?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, the Court wouldn't 

have to, and part of where we drew this from is the 

Court's language in Begay that indicated that crimes 

within clause (1) of ACCA are those crimes which are 

also likely to present a serious risk of potential 

injury to others.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Many will, but don't --

serious use of force doesn't necessarily always.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, and that's why 

the qualitative line falls somewhere higher than mere 

contact, which would simply be the standard for Florida 

battery conviction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose we knew -- knew 

what happened. It's the same statute, and it would be 

possible to have a conviction for a rude touching under 

it. But this man, instead of pleading guilty, in fact 

went to trial, and we know that he beat somebody badly. 

If -- if that were the case, if we knew what the facts 

were, then would the ACCA enhancement be in order?

 The statute covers the waterfront from a 

rude touching to beating somebody to a bloody pulp. But 

we know, because there's been a trial, exactly what this 

person does, and what he does would fall under the

aggressive violence, capable of doing physical injury to 

another.

 MS. CALL: No, Your Honor. Knowing the 

added fact of the actual conduct would not answer the 

question because it is based on the elements. However, 

if the prosecutor charged it as to strike, or there was 

a division -- for example, at page 19 of our reply brief 

we showed the Fifth Circuit case in Robledo. It tracked 

the exact same Florida statute that is at issue here and 

said the offender did touch or strike the victim, comma, 

by striking him with a vehicle. And the Fifth Circuit 

said under the modified categorical approach to look at 

the charging document and the offender's necessary 

admission shows that was, in fact, a crime of violence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there a separate -- a 

separate battery crime, aggravated battery, in -- in 

Florida, which --

MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. There are two 

other felony battery statutes, apart from this one that 

do --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this isn't -- this 

isn't a felony battery statute. This is a misdemeanor 

battery statute, which has been elevated to a felony in 

this case only because the fellow had a prior.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA: But, besides the 

misdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony 

battery statutes in Florida, right?

 MS. CALL: There are. Two other separate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And how -- how are they 

defined?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, they add the mens rea 

of whether or not the battery was intended to cause 

great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement, or permanent 

disability; and the other says simply that you committed 

a battery and did cause -- the higher standards. But --

and, in addition, the misdemeanor battery includes the 

element of causing bodily harm, and offenders can be 

charged simply with that provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Misdemeanor does?

 MS. CALL: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. The 

felony version is to cause great -- great bodily harm.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MS. CALL: And the misdemeanor is to cause 

bodily harm, which Florida law defines as low as causing 

a bruise or mark like that.

 So, if someone were charged with, in State 

court, a predicate that involved that kind of injury, a 

prosecutor using his or her discretion could charge 

under causing bodily harm and -- which showed facts that

could support the finding of a violent felony.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what about 

the government's argument that your interpretation would 

dramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA 

because of the number of States that define battery in 

the same way Florida does?

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, I think that the 

government exaggerates the concerns of that because 

there are statute that both require an admission of the 

use of force or have that as an alternative that could 

be prosecuted in the appropriate case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but it's --

it's usually easier just to charge the lowest common 

denominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily 

require violent force, and the point -- this was the 

argument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the 

interpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that 

case, would mean that there be a vast number of States 

that weren't covered.

 I mean, presumably, Congress meant to cover 

all the States.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. However, 

because the -- in Hayes, the Court was looking at the 

"committed by" and whether that was the -- the necessary

 Here, given the fact that the statute can be 

charged both in Florida and many other statutes to be 

included, shows that those cases would -- it would only 

be a small number of cases that are likely to be 

affected where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would have to 

have other States which only have a battery statute that 

is defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery 

statute in Florida.

 If they have a higher degree of battery, 

just as Florida does, which is a felony, then, if the --

if the prosecutor wants this fellow to be convicted of a 

violent crime, he -- he could charge him with that --

with that higher degree.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any States that 

have only this simple battery statute, which is -- which 

is met by a simple touching?

 MS. CALL: According to LaFave, only Florida 

and I believe one other State has such a broad 

definition --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. You mistook my 

question.

 MS. CALL: I'm sorry.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any States in 

which the only prosecution for battery that can be 

brought is under a statute as broad as this one, which 

is -- is covered by even a touching?

 MS. CALL: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't all of the other 

States that have a touching statute also have higher 

degree of battery statutes?

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, according to 

LaFave, all States have aggravated battery statutes that 

include either the use of a deadly weapon or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought the 

evidence was pretty clear that Congress was adopting the 

common law definition of battery here, which doesn't 

require that higher degree of force or violence.

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, in the legislative 

history, the only time that they talked about battery --

in one House report it references battery and assault, 

simply by those descriptions.

 Every other time, they talked about assault 

and battery with a deadly weapon and something more than 

a simple touching.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they use battery in the 

statute here? I am looking for it. I don't -- I don't 

see the word "battery" at all.

MS. CALL: No, Your Honor. There is no 

enumerated offenses in the first prong.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what worries me more 

than -- than your application to battery is the 

methodology, because, if it's true that in Section 1, 

unlike Section 2, a single instance of where you could 

commit the crime without using force is sufficient to 

take it out of the statute, then, just looking through 

this, generally, you would take out assault, probably 

have to take out kidnapping. You would probably have to 

take out domestic violence. You would have to take out 

extortion, certainly, explosives laws.

 I mean, the very -- laws that I would think 

Congress certainly intended to include in that first 

definition.

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, when they --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's very worrying, 

and why I don't think it's the right methodology.

 MS. CALL: Well, Your Honor, they did use 

the word "element," and an element is a constituent --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but an element could 

be an element that is a -- the word is "element," the 

use or threatened use of physical force. Now, an 

element, say like abduction, could be an element that 

uses physical force if in the mine run of cases it uses

physical force, even though one can sometimes think of 

an exception. That's how we have interpreted 2.

 So if we interpret 1 a different way, we are going to 

take outside the statute the very things that Congress 

wanted inside; and, if we interpret it the same way, I 

think we would get to the right result.

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, I would have two 

responses to that. The first is, in the second prong, 

Congress used the word "conduct." And if they had meant 

conduct to be included in 1 rather than the elemental 

definition, that would have been a very easy definition.

 Second, when they talked about the crimes 

intended for category 1, they gave the examples of 

someone with murder convictions, rape convictions, a 

gangland enforcer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Rape can be convicted 

without -- rape can be conducted without force.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now rape is 

out.

 MS. CALL: Your Honor, it depends on the 

element of the offense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the element of rape 

is not force; it's lack of consent.

depends upon the elements, but what about 2 and 

especially the residual provision of 2, "any other 

conduct that presents a serious potential risk of 

physical injury to another"? I would think rape 

qualifies under that.

 MS. CALL: And, certainly, if the government 

believes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And many of the other 

crimes that Justice Breyer has been talking about.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. I certainly 

agree that -- -

JUSTICE BREYER: You do? You agree that, 

then -- in other words, Section 2 is not about property 

crimes that involve force, which is what Congress 

happened to say nonstop in the legislative history, 

which I know isn't read by everyone. But it seemed to 

me reading that history, the first part is dealing with 

those things that aren't property crimes. The second 

part, like arson, extortion, which they had in mind of a 

certain kind, and whatever, the explosives-related 

things, were things that they thought didn't -- could be 

property crimes that also involved harm to people.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, and --

both of us.

MS. CALL: Well -- I agree with Your Honor 

that the legislative history certainly indicates that 1 

and 2 had different purposes, but this Court didn't find 

Begay and Chambers on the easy test, to say simply that 

DUI is not a property crime, therefore it doesn't 

qualify. So I hesitate to offer that as a solution to 

the Court, but keeping in mind that the government --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I dare say that the next 

time somebody comes to argue before this Court that a 

crime is not included within Section 2 because it's not 

a property crime, I don't think that person is going to 

get one vote.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They wouldn't have to say 

that. They would have to say that it is not a crime 

like the three that are mentioned, which I can't 

remember -- it's arson, extortion -- and what's the 

third? Using explosives.

 MS. CALL: It is burglary, arson, extortion, 

and --

that. It's DUI; it was not like that.

prove that a predicate qualified under the first prong, 

it could offer argument in evidence to the sentencing 

judge to show that it met the Begay test and was, in 

fact a serious risk of injury, that -- purposeful 

violence, et cetera. It's simply not that battery by 

touching qualifies.

 And, Your Honor, if I may reserve the 

remainder.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you just clarify an 

answer that you gave. You described Florida as unique, 

but I thought there were many States that had a 

codification of common law battery that would include 

both touching and more aggressive behavior. I thought 

Florida was not alone in having that kind of statute.

 MS. CALL: There are other States, Your 

Honor, that have the common law definition, but they 

also have alternative versions. Many of the States also 

have alternative versions that require either the use of 

force or the aggravated if the underlying conduct or the 

underlying charge was that serious matter of involving 

physical force to qualify under a violent felony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said they all 

had such -- such aggravated statutes in your answer to 

me. Now you just said many of them do. Which is it?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The primary definition of violent felony in 

the Armed Career Criminal Act, as, Justice Alito, you 

have noted and, Mr. Chief Justice, as you have noted, 

almost precisely tracks the general definition of the 

crime of battery; that is, the unlawful application of 

physical force to the person of another.

 Petitioner's primary submission --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why 

didn't they say -- why didn't they just say battery, if 

that's what they meant? It's a lot simpler and also 

clearer than to say physical force against the person.

 MS. KRUGER: I think it's certainly true, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress could have defined the 

category of predicates for the ACCA in that way by 

listing certain offenses, which would then require the 

courts to determine what the generic elements of those

offenses were, as this Court did with respect to 

burglary in Taylor.

 But Congress instead decided to list in its 

primary definition of violent felony the common element 

that it thought as a categorical matter indicated a 

sufficient potential for harm that the crime ought to be 

singled out as a predicate for ACCA enhancement. And 

that single element was the use of physical force 

against the person of another.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- you would 

have us believe that by "violent felony" in this -- in 

this statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat? 

It doesn't even have to be the act. You know, if you 

don't shut up, I am going to come over and thwonk you on 

your shoulder with my index finger. I'm going to 

(snap). This is a violent felony under this statute 

which gets him how many more years?

 MS. KRUGER: It creates a mandatory minimum 

of 15 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fifteen years for (snap).

 (Laughter.)

 MS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think that 

there are a few responses to that question. The first 

is that a threatened use of force is normally considered 

and normally punished under the criminal law as a crime

of assault. And for the reasons that Justice Breyer has 

noted already in the arguments, it seems awfully 

unlikely, particularly in light of legislative history 

of this provision for those Justices who consider such 

considerations relevant, that Congress meant to exclude 

the crime of assault.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's all he's 

necessarily been convicted of. When a verdict is 

brought in in Florida under this misdemeanor statute, 

all you know for sure is that he threatened to go 

(snap). That's all you know for sure that he has been 

convicted of, and you are going to give him 15 years.

 MS. KRUGER: And again, two responses: The 

first is as a practical matter that is not a crime. 

Normally the law of assault, in order to constitute a 

criminal threat, there has to be more than simply the 

use of words. There has to -- the defendant has to 

manifest by conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there have been rude 

touchings where there is no danger of physical injuries 

to the person. There have been prosecutions in Florida, 

I understand, for what would be considered a rude 

touching as opposed to an aggressive use of force that 

would risk physical injury.

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct. There have

been a handful of cases, that are cited in Petitioner's 

brief, in the -- in which the Florida statute has been 

used to criminalize rude touchings. We think that those 

rude touchings, as a matter of general usage in the 

common law and in the general definition of battery, do 

in fact have as an element the use of physical force. 

That is a usage that has been in force in the majority 

of States for quite some time. And we think that it 

does no particular violence, if you will pardon the 

expression, to the statute to interpret it to encompass 

the full range of common law batteries, batteries as 

they are prosecuted --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How about pick pocketing, 

would pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a 

touching necessarily?

 MS. KRUGER: Pick pocketing actually doesn't 

involve a touching necessarily. Normally if you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess a very good pick 

pocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not 

touch the person, I'm not sure.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, pick pocketing, normally 

as it is criminalized in most states, does not, in fact, 

require as an element that the prosecution prove that 

the -- the defendant touched the victim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but you don't prosecute

them for pick pocketing. You have a clumsy pick pocket 

and you prosecute him for battery, right? And he gets 

15 years.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, the clumsy pick pocket 

would, in fact, be in most jurisdictions a robber. And 

robbery is precisely the kind of offense that we know 

that Congress was intending to cover in subsection 1 of 

the ACCA. It was one of the first ACCA predicates, and 

it remains, I think, a paradigmatic example of a crime 

that has as an element the use of force and is, 

therefore, covered under the plain statutory language. 

But I think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry. 

Please finish and then I will --

MS. KRUGER: But I think that the essential 

thrust of the argument so far has been that if it's 

possible to commit battery under the common law under 

the laws of 27 states, including Florida, under Federal 

law in the way that individual instances doesn't seem to 

present a serious risk of injury, then it can't possibly 

be a violent felony. And I think that we know from the 

way the Court has interpreted the statute to date that 

that is simply not the case.

 This Court addressed a very similar argument 

in Taylor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you see that 

you don't have the inquiry. The issue is not whether it 

causes serious injury or not, the issue is whether the 

nature of the force used is physical force. And, so, if 

you look at the common definition of "physical force" in 

the dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in 

their brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning 

the use of some strength, of some power, and generally 

kissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching 

someone on the shoulder, doesn't. All of these 

activities are prohibited by this statute if they are 

unwanted.

 So the question is not whether or not they 

present the risk of physical injury, the issue is 

whether in all applications or in a substantial number 

they don't require the use of strength to -- in its 

application. That's a different question.

 MS. KRUGER: Justice Sotomayor, I think that 

you are exactly right, that the inquiry that is set out 

in subsection 1 is simply, does this crime have as an 

element the use of physical force?

 Our submission is that every battery under 

Florida law, under common law and under the laws of 27 

states and the Federal Government does have an -- as an 

element the use of physical force.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mainly because -- now we 

are getting to Judge Easterbrook's argument about the 

dime -- you know if I touch myself, I have now used 

force.

 MS. KRUGER: Right. There is some 

suggestion in Judge Easterbrook's opinion that that 

usage is somehow peculiar to Newtonian physics. The 

fact of the matter is, it is actually a very common 

usage in the criminal law. There are a number of 

judicial opinions, for example, that we instead of using 

the formulation that we see in Florida's battery 

statute, instead use the formulation use of force of the 

slightest degree.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose we 

interpret the statute, the act of the statute as 

requiring more force than that, as requiring something 

more than spitting. Now, suppose that sometimes, as 

they have made a strong case, that touching is a 

separate thing under this statute because that's what 

the Florida Supreme Court said, and moreover, there are 

prosecutions that seem not to fit within striking. How 

do we know whether by and large this were a touching as 

used in Florida, covers things with mostly minimal 

touching, minimal force or enough force to get within 

the statute?

MS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

that's precisely the problem with the Petitioner's 

submission. It creates a kind of required element under 

the ACCA that has no clear parallels in the substantive 

criminal law. And it would require Federal sentencing 

courts to ask precisely the kinds of questions the law 

of battery has historically thought to avoid, just how 

much physical force is enough.

 The reason why a statute like Florida has 

reached the least touching of another in anger is as 

Blackstone told us, that too is a form of violence. It 

has so been considered for centuries.

 And, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your 

question earlier, Florida itself actually does classify 

the crime of battery as defined under its statute as a 

crime of violence for certain purposes. The ordinary 

understanding of the crime of battery --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not for recidivism. Not 

for recidivism purposes.

 MS. KRUGER: It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you saying that 

suppose to Florida split this statute, and some states 

do, so one crime is a rude touching crime, and the other 

is the use of physical -- aggressive physical force that 

endangers the physical safety of another. If you have

both of those statutes, I take it that you would say 

either one of them would fit under ACCA as a crime that 

has the use of physical force, because you are saying 

the rude touching is physical force? Even if you split 

off the touching from the striking, you would say that 

the touching falls under ACCA?

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. We think that both variants of that offense 

in your hypothetical would have as an element the use of 

physical force.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But only as a felony.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what Congress was 

trying to get at the worse of the worst in ACCA, the 

Armed Career, whatever -- that they meant to get after 

people who go around poking other people in a rude 

manner?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think, first of all, it would be a mistake to think that 

Congress defines the range of ACCA predicate with 

particular consideration to the ways that hypothetical 

defendants might -- might commit even quintessentially 

violent crimes in particular cases.

 This Court, for example, considered in 

Taylor v. United States a very similar argument, which 

was that the statutory reference to burglary ought to be

interpreted in a way that would limit it to aggravated 

burglaries of a certain sort, armed burglaries or 

burglaries of occupied buildings, in order to make sure 

that that reference to burglary better fit with 

Congress's purposes in selecting the worst of the worst.

 This Court declined that invitation because 

it decided that Congress's unmodified views of the word 

"burglary" indicated that Congress meant for that word 

to take on its ordinary meaning as it was used in the 

laws of the many states. It said that Congress would 

have recognized that ordinary burglaries can be 

committed in individual instances in ways that don't 

seem particularly harmful, by unarmed defenders of 

unoccupied buildings in remote locations, but that 

Congress nevertheless made a categorical judgment that 

burglaries as a whole present sufficient potential for 

harm that they ought to be covered as ACCA predicates.

 And I think a similar analysis applies here. 

Congress probably wasn't focused on the least amount of 

force that it takes to commit the crime of battery, but 

it was entitled to make a judgment that any battery, any 

unlawful use of force against another person, 

categorically presents sufficient potential for harm 

that --

by touching does seem a separate category. And at that 

point, you have to decide, is there an element there of 

force? And I think it requires more force than just the 

simplest touching.

 Now, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact 

that there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient 

to take it outside the statute. That's not my approach. 

I would say, in the mind run of cases, does there have 

to be more force than just spitting? And now I don't 

know how it's prosecuted. So why don't I say in this 

case, from my perspective, very well, I don't know. No 

one knows. No one has told me. No one has looked into 

it. It's very hard to look into, but not impossible.

 It's the Government's job, faced with a 

15-year statute, to do the looking. They have the 

resources. More than a defense attorney. Therefore, 

uncertain as I am, I must decide this in favor of the 

defendant. What's the response to that?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think the response is, 

first, we think that the proper approach is one that 

pays respect to the words that Congress used to define 

the crime. In ordinary criminal law, despite what some 

intuitions seem to be, the least touching of another in 

anger is a form of violence. It is a use of physical 

force.

I think to the extent that, Your Honor, you 

are inclined to look to the purposes of this statute, 

what Congress would have thought the mind run of cases 

that would fall under Subsection 1's use of force 

provision would cover, I think there you look at the 

reported cases in Florida, we see that the kinds of 

crimes that are prosecuted under the touching or 

striking prong of that statute are, in fact, quite 

harmful. It's not at all difficult to see why Congress 

would have been concerned about these types of crimes, 

both because in many instances they involve conduct that 

is probably better described as touching or striking but 

it is -- nevertheless risks substantial harm to the 

victim, like choking, like beating the victim's head 

against the car window, to use an example from one of 

those cases cited in our brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I guess it comes 

down to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was 

using technical language or Congress was using simply 

ordinary language, because you are quite right that the 

definition of -- of battery covers even the slightest 

touching. The use of physical force, which would 

include the slightest touching.

 But in using that definition to define the 

term "violent felony," I find it hard to believe that

Congress was using the term in a technical sense, and 

was not using the term "physical force," "the use of 

physical force" to mean something more than a mere 

touching.

 But that's -- that's basically what we are 

arguing, isn't it? Whether that -- whether that phrase 

there, "threatened use of physical" -- "use or 

threatened use of physical force," is technical language 

which is the definition of battery, or rather more 

common usage.

 You -- you would acknowledge that, that in 

more common usage, no one -- no one would think that if 

you go over to somebody and point your finger at him on 

his lapel and say, "Now, you listen to me," that that 

would be considered the use or threatened use of 

physical force?

 MS. KRUGER: I think it probably is not the 

way that we ordinarily talk in day-to-day conversation, 

but it certainly is the way that the law has talked 

about it for centuries, and I think there is a reason 

that Congress had in mind the technical definition of 

battery rather than ordinary parlance, if for no other 

reason because it tracked so closely the general 

definition, that technical definition of "battery," when 

it defines "violent felony" in Subsection 1. And also

because now that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask 

this, following up on Justice Scalia's point? Are there 

any other crimes other than battery that -- that create 

the same situation where in the first time it is 

committed it's a misdemeanor, but then it becomes a 

felony because it's committed twice? So what we have 

here is conduct that first time is misdemeanor, second 

time is a felony. Are there any other examples of 

crimes that fit that category that come within 

Subparagraph 1?

 MS. KRUGER: I am not sure of the answer to 

that, Justice Stevens. I do think that one reason why 

the misdemeanor versus felony distinction is somewhat 

unimportant to the interpretation of the "use of 

physical force" language in this case is that if the 

same language was deployed first in the "crime of 

violence" definition of 18 U.S.C. 16, which by its 

terms, applies to both misdemeanors and felonies, and 

Congress has of course subsequently used that very same 

language to define a class of misdemeanor crimes of 

domestic violence in Section 922(g)(9), we think to the 

extent that this Court is inclined to interpret the 

extent of the similar language in the similar statutes 

in a similar manner, the use of physical force language

should remain consistent across them.

 One of the principal vices of Petitioner's 

arguments is also that it would leave the Federal 

domestic violence provisions like Section 922(g)(9) with 

relatively patchwork and haphazard application, which is 

precisely one of the considerations that motivated this 

Court's decision just last term in the United States v. 

Hayes. Whether the Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are no 

provisions that would include domestic violence and the 

gun possession provision.

 MS. KRUGER: There are -- the range of 

predicate offenses that can be used for the Section 

922(g)(9) domestic gun violence prohibition, ordinarily, 

as this Court recognized in Hayes, encompasses the 

general assault and battery statutes of the United 

States. Twenty-seven of these states define battery in 

more or less the way that Florida does, to include a 

range of uses of physical force from the least degree of 

physical force to very severe beatings, so under 

Petitioner's reading, it would be impossible to say for 

sure in more than half of the country that a domestic 

violence conviction, even a battery conviction that is 

specifically denominated as a domestic violence battery 

conviction in many a state, would qualify under Section

922(g)(9).

 It seems unlikely that Congress, in enacting 

that statute, which was designed to create a nationwide 

solution to the nationwide problem of the combination of 

guns and domestic strife, would have intended for that 

statute to have such a haphazard impact. And yet that 

is precisely what the effect of Petitioner's reading 

would be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is the provision? 

922(g)(9), is that in your brief somewhere?

 MS. KRUGER: It is. It's in the statutory 

appendix to the gray brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am looking for it. I 

don't see it. 922(g)(9).

JUSTICE SCALIA: I hate people talking about 

statutes that I don't have in front of me.

 MS. KRUGER: It's on page 3(a) of the 

statutory appendix.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 3(a).

 MS. KRUGER: It contains Section 

921(a)(33)(a), which provides the definition of 

"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."

That's what I thought you said.

MS. KRUGER: That's correct. The 

substantive prohibition is in Section 922(g)(9), and the 

definitional provision is reprinted on page 3(a).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's really a question for 

Petitioner's counsel, and I didn't have time to ask as 

your white light goes on. I take it your position is 

that if you do not prevail on your argument, that this 

is under Roman -- small Roman 1, that if -- you have to 

remand for small Roman 2?

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an argument that 

you anticipate objecting to that remand? Or is this 

absolutely clear-cut that we must remand?

 MS. KRUGER: I think it's within the Court's 

discretion to decide how to dispose properly of the 

case. I think that the Section -- the Subsection 2 

issue was preserved in the courts below. The district 

court rested its decision on both Subsections 1 and 2, 

and the court of appeals addressed only Subsection 1.

 We think that if the Court decides that the 

court of appeals is wrong in its interpretation of 

Subsection 1, then the appropriate thing in order to 

determine what Petitioner's correct sentencing should be 

would be to remand to allow the court of appeals to 

address the alternative argument about Subsection 2.

But the reason why the Subsection 1 inquiry is so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- I'm sorry. 

Before you go on, your adversary claims you waived by 

not raising this as an -- as an alternative in the sorts 

stage. Could you fold that into your continuation of 

this answer?

 MS. KRUGER: Certainly. I think that rule 

15.2 of the rules of this Court requires us in a brief 

in opposition to raise any material matters that relate 

to the question presented.

 The question presented in this case concerns 

just the basis for the court of appeals decision in this 

case which was subsection (1) of the statute. We think 

it's not at all unusual for this Court to decide that a 

court of appeals judgment is in error and then remand to 

allow the court of appeals to address --

JUSTICE BREYER: Hear what they said, what 

the Eleventh Circuit said, it said that if battery under 

Florida law fits within the description of (1), then it 

is a violent crime for ACCA purposes. And then it says 

if not, then not. And as long as the issue was in front 

of them I would think that those last four words are a 

holding.

 MS. KRUGER: I think it's difficult to read 

those four words in that manner, Justice Breyer.

was briefed in the court of appeals, and the court of 

appeals --

given Begay, how this is like arson or, you know, the

JUSTICE BREYER: So, I mean, I don't know. 

Maybe the court of appeals felt -- what they said was, 

"if not, then not." And it was raised in argument.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think it's -- again, 

it's difficult to read that piece of loose language in 

the Court's opinion as a direct holding, particularly 

considering that the court of appeals didn't so much as 

cite the language or even the code provision that 

relates to the argument. But I think to the extent that 

the Court questions whether it would qualify under 

subsection (2), I think the answer is yes. Battery

is -- qualifies under this Court's interpretations of 

that subsection in Chambers and Begay and James. It is 

a crime that is typically purposeful, violent and 

aggressive.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but I -- I thought --

you know, it's -- it's like the other four listed out.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, it is like them in that 

it poses risks that are similar in --

JUSTICE BREYER: But then we are rereading 

these three other examples out because then "other" 

covers any crime that poses a risk of violence, or 

whatever the words are there -- I forget the words. 

Poses a risk.

 MS. KRUGER: No, I think it would still be 

consistent with this Court's analysis of subsection (2) 

in Begay in that battery by touching, if you consider it 

to be a separate crime, which again I think is a highly 

contested --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you think drunk driving 

doesn't present a serious potential risk of physical 

injury?

 MS. KRUGER: No, but what this Court said in 

Begay was that it doesn't present risks that are similar 

in degree and kind to the risks that are presented by 

the enumerated offenses. And battery, including battery

by touching or striking under Florida law, presents 

risks that are quite similar in degree and kind to the 

enumerated offenses, particularly burglary. It is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait, I don't follow 

that at all. I mean, I understand your argument that 

physical force means the slightest touching, but I don't 

understand the argument that the slightest touching 

presents a serious risk of potential physical injury.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think -- first of all, 

to clear up a misconception, simply because the 

statutory text covers the slightest touching doesn't 

mean that it covers only the slightest touching. It 

covers a wide range of degrees of physical force 

beginning with the slightest touching and including --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but your 

argument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest 

physical touching is covered by the statute.

 MS. KRUGER: Right. And the question before 

the Court in this case concerns only that question. It 

concerns the proper interpretation of subsection (1). 

Whether the crime is one that has as an element the use 

of physical force.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The district court thought 

that the two were related. The district court, if it 

thought a slightest touching was qualified under (1) it

was not unreasonable to say that it would also qualify 

under (2). But if that argue ment is rejected under 

(1), it seems to me it would follow necessarily that it 

would also be rejected under (2).

 MS. KRUGER: I'm not entirely sure why that 

would be true. But I do think that it's right as a 

descriptive matter that most of the crimes that are 

encompassed by subsection (1) would also qualify under 

subsection (2).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But (2) -- (2) looks to the 

conduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime. 

So you could actually look to the conduct of which the 

person was convicted, no?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, you have to look at the 

contact that the person was convicted of with respect to 

the elements of the crime, that is the nature of the 

category --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. You look to 

the crime -- under (1), you look to the crime he was 

convicted of, and if -- if -- if none of its elements 

require serious physical force, you can say it doesn't 

qualify under (1), but under (2) if in fact you see the 

misdemeanor he was convicted of was really whacking 

somebody really hard, then -- then it could possibly 

come within -- come under (2).

MS. KRUGER: With respect, Justice Scalia, I 

think that is incorrect. This Court has made clear that 

subsection (2) like subsection (1) proceeds by looking 

at the elements of the offense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just at the elements.

 MS. KRUGER: Just at the elements of the 

offense of which the defendant was convicted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about --

about 922? You point to the -- the definition there, 

the definition in 921. But that is a definition of the 

term, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And in 

the context of defining that term, I'm perfectly willing 

to believe that the use or attempted use of physical 

force means even the slightest touching, as -- as 

battery does. You are talking about a misdemeanor crime 

of domestic violence.

 But what we have before us here is a term --

a different term that is being defined and that term is 

violent felony. And I find it a lot harder to swallow 

that -- that that definition embraces merely the 

slightest touching.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Scalia, I would 

certainly be inclined to agree with you but it's 

particularly clear given the text and context of the 

purposes of section 922(g)(9) that battery ought to be

covered by that definition, misdemeanor crime of 

domestic violence. But we think that the reason why it 

is also clear under subsection (1) of the ACCA is that 

the use of force element of the definitional provision 

is separate from the degree of seriousness with which 

the State chooses to treat the crime, yet the crime is 

punished as a felony, and if has as an element the use 

of physical force, then it qualifies as a violent felony 

under the ACCA, just as if it is punished as a 

misdemeanor, it qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of 

domestic violence under section 922(g)(9).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I dare say that Congress in 

my view probably didn't even contemplate that something 

which is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if 

you did it the second time.

 MS. KRUGER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever approved that, 

by the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply 

because of recidivism?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, the Court in United 

States v. Rodriguez in analyzing the coordinate 

provision of the ACCA that covers serious drug offenses 

said that the felony aspect of that definition is 

satisfied by a recidivist enhancement. And we think 

that the conclusion in that case, and it is not disputed

among the parties, applies with equal force in this case 

to the proper interpretation of violent felony.

 But it was certainly true by the time that 

Congress enacted the ACCA, which the legislative history 

indicates Congress understood would cover assault 

crimes, for example, that there were certain kinds of 

batteries and assaults that, although otherwise may be 

punished as simple batteries and assaults, as 

misdemeanors, could be elevated to a felony if for 

example they were committed against a law enforcement 

officer.

 It simply was not unheard of for simple 

battery to be elevated to a felony under certain 

circumstances in 1986 Congress enacted the present 

version of ACCA. At the end of the day, we think that 

Congress -- every indication that we have in both the 

text, the context, the purpose of the statute and its 

background suggests that Congress was in fact 

deliberately tracking the definition of battery when it 

enacted the primary definition of violent felony in 

subsection (1).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, every 

indication except for the fact that they didn't use the 

word battery.

 MS. KRUGER: Aside from the fact that they

didn't use the word battery. Instead they chose to 

incorporate the general definition of the crime of 

battery; that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

 We think that to the extent that the Court 

is inclined to restrict the terms of -- that Congress 

chose to use itself to physical force as only exceeding 

a certain threshold, to include some batteries and not 

other batteries, the Court would be setting up a very 

difficult test for Federal sentencing courts to apply in 

the real world. Essentially --

JUSTICE SCALIA: States do it all the time 

when they have different degrees of battery. 

Misdemeanor -- felony battery -- they do it all the 

time.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, as the Chief Justice has 

noted, States don't have quite the same compulsion to 

sort different factual offenses into different boxes. 

Prosecutors, as the prosecutor did in this case, can use 

either of the two alternative prongs of Florida's 

battery definition to punish what is essentially the 

same offense, which is the crime of battery, that 

deserves the same punishment regardless of which prong 

the prosecutor proceeds under, whether the bodily injury 

prong or the touching or striking prong.

 And Petitioner's concession that at least

Federal sentencing courts could draw distinctions 

between touches and strikes, may have some resonance in 

the State of Florida, but has resonance for the rest of 

the country. Most State assault and battery statutes 

don't contain explicit references to striking, but 

subsume striking within the range of conduct prescribed 

by their offensive touching prong.

 So it simply wouldn't be possible, in most 

cases, for a court to look at the cold record of the 

underlying State conviction and try to discern exactly 

how much force was involved in the offense and whether 

that force satisfied the Petitioner's proposed 

threshold, whatever it means.

 At the end of the day, the principal 

question before the court is one that is, primarily, 

relevant to the Section 922(g)(9) provision and other 

federal misdemeanor domestic violence provisions and one 

that we think, in considering the purposes of those 

statutes and the very serious dangers that they address, 

the Court ought to interpret the plain text of the 

statutes in light of their plain meaning.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't want to waste 

too much of your time on the remand, but I can't really 

fault the government for waiving a right to raise a 

claim under Clause 2, which is your second reason for 

not -- not remanding, and it -- it does seem, to, me 

that the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was 

that they were just looking at 1, so that we would have 

to remand.

disagree with that because it was fully briefed, fully 

argued --

that when they indicated that the test was exclusively 

under the first prong.

 Second, Your Honor, I believe it would 

simply be a waste of judicial resources if the Court 

finds that this battery by touching doesn't have, as an 

element, the use of force, the test would be to remand 

it to decide whether it meets the Begay standard, which 

is purposeful, violent, aggressive, and all of those 

tests.

before as to make a definitive holding, but I will look 

at the Eleventh Circuit opinion again.

 MS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, and the other 

note I would make is, factually, at page 40 of the joint 

appendix, they indicated there were no other Shepard 

documents to offer to the Court, so the entire record is 

available for reconsideration and is available to this 

Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.

 MS. CALL: And, Your Honor, I wanted to note 

this is not just an academic exercise on noticing what 

physical force means. Absent this one finding of 

Mr. Johnson's prior conviction was a violent felony, it 

raised his guideline range, from 27 to 33 months, to a 

mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.

 So the danger of including this crime, when 

the art or criminal act was not designed to include all 

crimes or all offenders, means that it took all 

discretion away from the sentencing judge.

 In ACCA, Congress set a superior high 

standard requiring three priors on three -- that 

occurred on three separate occasions, and so looking at 

this decision, when Mr. Johnson was put inside the box,

felony, the sentencing judge could consider that under 

the guidelines in the 3553 factors. But to read 

physical force so broadly is to, in essence, collapse 

the distinction between those violent offenses that are 

meant to be included in the Armed Career Criminal Act 

and those that are not.

 Your Honors, I would also note one matter, 

that physical contact is used in the assault statutes 

under the Federal Code, so there is a different 

provision -- a different meaning to physical contact 

than to physical force, and the physical force, in this 

definition, is looking at what level and what sort of 

force Congress intended to require to impose this very 

high sentencing standard.

 And this Court had rejected, in Shepard, the 

government's same happenstance argument that 

prosecutions would depend on recordkeeping and charging 

decisions, and so, for all the reasons argued, 

Mr. Johnson would ask that this Court vacate the lower 

decision and remand for resentencing.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
