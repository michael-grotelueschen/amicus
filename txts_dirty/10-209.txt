3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-209, Lafler v. Cooper.

 Mr. Bursch.
 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

8  MR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
 

9 and may it please the Court:


 There are three points that I would like to 

11 press this morning regarding deficient plea advice. 

12 First, this Court has consistently limited the effective 

13 assistance right to ensuring the reliability of the 

14 proceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and 

sentenced. Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice 

16 standard. 

17  Second, when asserting an ineffective 

18 assistance claim, the defendant --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I -- can I stop you on 

the first? You say mere outcome is not enough, 

21 reliability of the proceedings. How does that fit with 

22 Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective 

23 assistance, does attach to suppression hearings, 

24 obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings 

more reliable?

25

Official 

1  MR. BURSCH: Justice Kagan, even in 

2 Kimmelman, the Court remanded back to the lower courts 

3 to determine whether there was prejudice, and the 

4 obvious implication was that if there was no prejudice 

on the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself, 

6 there would be no Sixth Amendment violation. 

7  The second point that I wanted to press this 

8 morning was that when asserting an ineffective 

9 assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a 

substantive or procedural right, and this Court has 

11 already held that a defendant has no right to a plea 

12 bargain. 

13  Third, every possible remedy for deficient 

14 plea advice creates intractable problems 

demonstrating the right --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, isn't there a 

17 right to make a critical decision on whether to accept 

18 or reject a plea bargain, once offered? There's no 

19 right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a 

right to make that kind of critical decision? 

21  MR. BURSCH: Justice Sotomayor, the -- the 

22 not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's 

23 constitutional rights. It's invoking the right to trial 

24 that the Sixth Amendment contemplates. And so this 

situation is really more like Fretwell. It's not a 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 decision that you have, for example, whether to have a 

2 jury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this 

3 attorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in 

4 each of those cases you have an underlying substantive 

or procedural constitutional right; and you have no 

6 right to a plea. And so this fork in the road is really 

7 an illusory one, because you have no right to choose the 

8 other side of the fork. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose this were a death 

-- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure --

11 failure to communicate. And that leaves me just one 

12 other question based on your opening remarks. We can 

13 think about adjudication as having a constitutional 

14 violation, injury, and remedy. Are you saying that 

there was a violation in the abstract here but no 

16 injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just 

17 no remedy? 

18  MR. BURSCH: I'm saying --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you could do all of 

that, including the death penalty, I --

21  MR. BURSCH: Yes, I'm saying that there's no 

22 violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment 

23 violation, you have to demonstrate unreliability of the 

24 adjudicatory process. I'm also saying that there's no 

reasonable remedy, and I'll talk about that in a minute.

Official 

1  With respect to the death penalty in 

2 particular, I would refer this Court right back to the 

3 Fretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his 

4 counsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection 

that would have changed the sentence to avoid the death 

6 penalty in that case. Collins obviously was overruled 

7 before habeas process, and this Court held that the 

8 defendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective 

9 assistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because 

he had no constitutional right in it. And so, really 

11 the remedy -- I'm sorry. The severity of the sentence 

12 doesn't enter the analysis once you've established that 

13 there has been no violation. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say no violation, 

you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance 

16 of counsel? I thought that was conceded, that there was 

17 ineffective assistance. 

18  MR. BURSCH: That's correct, Justice 

19 Ginsburg. We have conceded for purposes of argument 

that there was ineffective assistance. But Strickland 

21 is a two-part test, and even after you get past the 

22 deficiency prong, there's still the question of whether 

23 this casts some doubt on the reliability of the 

24 proceedings.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I thought that the 

6

1 second part of the test asked about harm. And here the 

2 person is sitting in prison for three times as long as 

3 he would have been sitting in prison had he had 

4 effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining 

stage. So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements 

6 of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice? 

7  MR. BURSCH: Well, that's actually the best 

8 argument that the Respondent has in this case. And the 

9 reason --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Sounds like a good argument. 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  MR. BURSCH: Well, the reason why it's wrong 

13 is because this Court has been very careful to define 

14 what that harm is. Specifically, the word was "outcome" 

in Cronic and Strickland. If you --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: And outcome -- there is a 

17 different outcome here. He's sitting in prison for 

18 three times as long. That's a different outcome. 

19  MR. BURSCH: Yes, but the Court went on to 

define "outcome" to mean reliability of the adjudicatory 

21 process. In fact, specifically, the language was 

22 whether absent the deficiency, the defendant -- I'm 

23 sorry. Absent the deficiency, the factfinder would have 

24 had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. And what we 

have here is a situation where everyone acknowledges --

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, take the sentencing 

2 cases. The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt 

3 is over, and the question is, is this person sitting in 

4 jail for 1 day longer because his counsel was 

ineffective? And if he is, we would find prejudice 

6 there. So, why isn't the same thing true here? 

7  MR. BURSCH: Well, I don't believe it's quite 

8 that simple. If there was some legal error, you know, 

9 an error to which he had a constitutional right, then 

certainly what you said is exactly true. But if you're 

11 talking about more or less days because of, for example, 

12 a judge thinking that the -- the difference between 

13 crack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other 

14 things that are really up to the discretion of the trial 

court judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are 

16 not Sixth Amendment violations. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I don't 

18 understand that answer, because that answer seems to 

19 suggest that the -- that the assistance being provided 

was not ineffective. But here, as Justice Ginsburg 

21 notes, you've conceded that the assistance is 

22 ineffective. That assistance has led to a much, much, 

23 much longer sentence. You know, as opposed to some of 

24 the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, 

this is 10 years or something. And, you know, that 

8

Official 

1 should be the end of the game, no? 

2  MR. BURSCH: Well, let's try another 

3 sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was 

4 deficient performance. Say that there's a local trial 

court judge and everyone knows that he has a certain 

6 predilection that if you like the local sports team, 

7 he's going to give you a break. If the attorney comes 

8 in and he does not press the argument that this 

9 convicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets 

a higher sentence, that's still not a Sixth Amendment 

11 violation. 

12  Really, once you shift to sentencing, the 

13 question is, were you legally entitled to the result? 

14 And simply because he failed to appeal to the right 

discretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't 

16 really make a difference. Here we're talking, 

17 obviously, about the guilt phase, and it's much easier 

18 here because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic 

19 and Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that 

outcome difference, the harm difference, has to be 

21 reliability of the process itself. It's a process --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge, though, 

23 that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're --

24 well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged. Let me ask 

you: Have you provided ineffective assistance of

Official 

1 counsel if you are a lousy bargainer? You're just no 

2 good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game 

3 of bargaining. And so, you do a bad job in bargaining 

4 down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job. Is 

that ineffective assistance of counsel? 

6  MR. BURSCH: Under the Court's first prong of 

7 Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the 

8 standards of professional practice were, and depending 

9 how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be 

deficient. But the important thing is if it didn't have 

11 any effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then 

12 it would not be a Sixth Amendment violation. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't even agree 

14 with the first part. I don't think our legal process 

is -- is a bargaining game. Shouldn't be. 

16  MR. BURSCH: Well, we could agree with that. 

17 Bargaining is not what this is about, and that's why 

18 this Court has held in Weatherford and other cases that 

19 there is no right to the plea bargain itself. And 

that's really the second --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can -- you can agree 

22 with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are 

23 disposed of by way of bargaining? 

24  MR. BURSCH: Because in the 95 percent of 

cases that are disposed of that way, this Court has 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1 already held in Padilla and Hill that there is a 

2 constitutional right to have effective counsel when 

3 you're accepting that plea. And the difference is when 

4 you're accepting a plea, you're being convicted. That 

is the conviction. And this Court frequently 

6 establishes different tests when you're waiving a right, 

7 for example the right to go to trial, versus invoking a 

8 right, going to trial. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can you talk about 

the reliability of a process or its fairness when you 

11 have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the 

12 law? How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going 

13 into a trial thinking his client can't be convicted 

14 because the shots fired hit below the waist?

 MR. BURSCH: Because --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how can that kind of 

17 trial ever be fair? 

18  MR. BURSCH: Because there's no evidence 

19 here, not even a contention, that his belief had any 

impact whatsoever on the fairness of the trial 

21 proceeding. And this Court has drawn a bright-line rule 

22 at trial. You know, if you look at the preliminary 

23 hearing, if there's attorney error there, deficiency --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you skipped over 

a step. I think we do assume that the deficient advice 

11

5

20

25

Official 

1 led to the -- the determination to plead not guilty. 

2  MR. BURSCH: Right. Again -- but that fork 

3 in the road is not one to which he has a substantive 

4 procedural right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the 

6 question -- that's the question we're confronting. So, 

7 I think --

8  MR. BURSCH: Well, I --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- your answer was a 

little too facile on that point. 

11  MR. BURSCH: I think --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have to assume there's 

13 ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client 

14 the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client 

can make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not 

16 guilty. 

17  MR. BURSCH: Right. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have to assume that in 

19 this case, correct?

 MR. BURSCH: Correct, we are assuming that. 

21 But what I would submit respectfully is that the plea 

22 stage isn't any different than a preliminary hearing or 

23 a line-up or a suppression hearing, where if there was 

24 some deficient attorney conduct, this Court would still 

then look to see whether it had an adverse impact on the 

12

1 adjudication of guilt. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the defective 

3 advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he 

4 would not have entered if he had been properly advised. 

Can he get relief? 

6  MR. BURSCH: Absolutely. Under Hill and 

7 Padilla, this Court has said when you give up your right 

8 to trial, that's a very different situation and that 

9 there is a remedy for that. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, explain why defective 

11 advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective 

12 advice causing defendant to turn down a plea --

13  MR. BURSCH: It's just --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- does not?

 MR. BURSCH: It's just like the difference 

16 between deciding to proceed with counsel, in which case 

17 there's -- there's no barrier to entry, or deciding to 

18 proceed without counsel, giving up the constitutional 

19 right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, the difference -- that's 

21 not the difference at all. It seems to me the 

22 difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself 

23 of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury 

24 before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a 

reasonable doubt. When you plead guilty, you give up 

13

1 that. 

2  When you don't plead guilty, you get what is 

3 the best thing in our legal system. You can't do any 

4 better than that.

 MR. BURSCH: Justice Scalia, you said it much 

6 more artfully, but that's exactly the point I was trying 

7 to make with Justice Ginsburg, that when you invoke your 

8 constitutional right, your right to have an attorney, to 

9 go to a trial, to have a jury, we don't set up barriers 

to entry. It's only when you give up those rights. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: I take it, then, Mr. Bursch, 

12 you would have the same answer if the State had never 

13 provided counsel at all. So long as -- if the plea 

14 negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and 

the individual defendant, and the -- and the State 

16 refused to provide the individual defendant with 

17 counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided, 

18 oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's 

19 all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?

 MR. BURSCH: That would be our position, 

21 because that's consistent with this Court's holding in 

22 Coleman and Wade and Kimmelman, that --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that would also be your 

24 position in a capital case?

 MR. BURSCH: Yes. Under Fretwell, this Court 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

20

25

Official 

1 held definitively that so long as the reliability of the 

2 adjudicatory process and sentence were intact, that the 

3 deficient advice didn't affect it, that the severity of 

4 the punishment was not legally relevant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, your position is you're 

6 entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you 

7 plead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective 

8 assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers? 

9  MR. BURSCH: I would say it slightly 

different --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 

12  MR. BURSCH: -- that you are entitled to 

13 effective counsel at every critical stage; however, it 

14 is not a Sixth Amendment violation unless it casts doubt 

on the reliability of the adjudication of guilt. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to my 

17 question: Is it a violation in the abstract then, of 

18 damnum absque injuria? 

19  MR. BURSCH: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Damage without injury. 

21  MR. BURSCH: No, because under the Strickland 

22 and Cronic cases, there is no damage, there's no Sixth 

23 Amendment violation, unless you can prove the prejudice. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, all of this is 

theoretically interesting, and it may be that capital 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 cases are sui generis here. But I thought the heart of 

2 your argument was that there just is no way to 

3 unscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no --

4 and that was your third point, and I understood it.

 MR. BURSCH: Correct. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: There is no remedy that can 

7 put the parties back into the position where they would 

8 have been had the error regarding the legal issue not 

9 occurred.

 MR. BURSCH: That's exactly right. And let's 

11 talk about the two remedies that are most frequently 

12 bandied about in the circuit courts. The first is to 

13 order a new trial. And to us, it makes no sense to 

14 order a second trial after you've already had a first 

error-free trial. 

16  In addition, you think about these habeas 

17 cases; if you're issuing a habeas writ and vacating a 

18 sentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here, 

19 essentially you're releasing the defendant, because 

witnesses will die, they'll move away, memories will be 

21 sparse. And so, that's the natural effect of that. 

22  And in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even 

23 advocate for a second trial; he asks for specific 

24 performance. The problem with that is there you're 

infringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 sacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be. And 

2 circumstances have changed once a trial has taken place. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, "sacred" is a 

4 little strong, don't you think? I mean, it is a -- to 

some extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows 

6 already he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he 

7 has to go back. But why is it so terribly difficult to 

8 tell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer 

9 if he wants, but then go through the normal process, 

which is it has to be approved by a judge and all that 

11 stuff? I don't see what's terribly difficult about 

12 that. 

13  MR. BURSCH: We contend it violates the 

14 separation of powers. But you bring up an important 

point because circumstances have changed in two 

16 respects. The first is that you learn more information. 

17 So, here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not 

18 only did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it 

19 while she was screaming and running away from him. 

That's a changed circumstance. He might not give the 

21 same plea. Even more so in Frye, where they learned 

22 that he was picked for another criminal violation after 

23 the plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he 

24 would have taken the plea back when he knew that.

 But the bigger changed circumstance is the 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

1 trial itself, because the prosecutor has now gone 

2 through the risk of having an acquittal. He has also 

3 put, for example, the 8-year-old sexual abuse defendant 

4 on the stand, something he tried to avoid with the plea 

offer. And it truly is an egg that cannot be 

6 unscrambled. 

7  And unless there are further questions, I 

8 will reserve of the balance of my time.

13  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

14  MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

16  Petitioner's convictions and sentence are 

17 reliable because the proceedings that produced them were 

18 reliable. And to collaterally attack his convictions or 

19 his sentence based on allegedly ineffective assistance 

of counsel, he has to show that the ineffective 

21 assistance of counsel prejudiced him. As this Court's 

22 Strickland cases have used that term, that means he has 

23 to show that a reviewing court should lack confidence in 

24 the proceeding that produced the convictions or the 

sentence.

counsel for defense, period. 

6  MR. JAY: The Sixth Amendment requires the 

7 assistance of --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, there's nothing 

9 in the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications. I 

haven't seen anything in any case which was other than 

11 case specific. That is, this issue hasn't been decided 

12 before, not to my knowledge. The language can be taken 

13 out of those cases, as you've very properly done. And 

14 so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases. 

Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself. In 95 percent of 

16 the cases, they do plead guilty. And what's the problem 

17 about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the 

18 offer he gave before?

4 several times. And I think that it's instructive,
 

Justice Breyer, to look at this Court's Strickland cases 

6 and look at what remedy they order when there has been 

7 ineffective assistance that shakes the reviewing court's 

8 confidence in the proceeding that produced it. They 

9 order a new proceeding. They don't order a specific 

sentence. That's why the outcome has never been the --

11 the yardstick by which ineffective assistance of --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to -- I want to 

13 stop you there because I don't understand it. The 

14 suggestion is -- I'm not taking this case; I'm making up 

a hypothetical since we're discussing it really based on 

16 the next case. The defendant never heard the offer, 

17 never heard it. It is crystal clear that if he'd heard 

18 it, he would have accepted it. Okay? I'm trying to 

19 separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me 

as difficult because of the facts, from the principle. 

21 And what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't 

22 accept the principle, and then we can worry about what's 

23 a clear case. 

24  MR. JAY: But I think the principle, 

Justice Breyer, is that you look at what the -- you look

1 at what it is the Court's being asked to set aside. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Death. Let's say death. 

3  MR. JAY: Right. So, in this case, you look 

4 at the death sentence. How was that death sentence 

produced? If the defendant can show, for example, that 

6 he got bad advice about the plea --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: He shows that never did he 

8 ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and 

9 moved on vacation and never told him about the plea 

offer. That's my hypothetical. 

11  MR. JAY: I think that's actually an easier 

12 hypothetical than the bad advice because you could show 

13 that if the lawyer then gets -- stands up and does a 

14 bang-up job at trial, right -- the defendant is 

convicted of capital murder. The defendant can't show 

16 any prejudicial effect on the trial. That means that no 

17 other lawyer doing a better job could have gotten the --

18 could even show a reasonable probability that a 

19 different verdict would ensue.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, the Court has said --

21  MR. JAY: That defendant has a reliable 

22 capital murder conviction. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: The Court has said that death 

24 is different. And did you think it is inconceivable 

that there could be a different rule for capital cases,

1 such as a rule requiring that, in a capital case, any 

2 offer of a noncapital sentence as part of a plea bargain 

3 actually be waived by the defendant in court so that 

4 this doesn't come up? This is not a capital case.

 MR. JAY: This is not a capital case, and I 

6 think that it certainly --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you don't 

8 want to do the capital case? I'm still trying to get to 

9 the principle.

 MR. JAY: I'm happy to do the capital case, 

11 Justice Breyer. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: I'll change my hypothetical 

13 and say all that happened was that this perfect trial, 

14 because of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison 

for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which 

16 would have given him 2 years. Now, he is in prison for 

17 48 years more, and I consider that that's at least 

18 harmful to him. So, where the amendment doesn't speak 

19 of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal 

clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it 

21 that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate 

22 assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific 

23 decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous 

24 unfairness and prejudice?

 MR. JAY: Two points, Justice Breyer. I'm --

1 and I want to make sure that I get out my answer to your 

2 capital hypothetical, because you don't look just at 

3 whether the sentence that resulted was worse than the 

4 sentence that could have resulted. If that were the 

case, Fretwell would have come out the other way. 

6 That's death if -- with no objection made, life sentence 

7 if the objection had been made. So, it's not an 

8 outcome -- it's not a narrow comparison of outcomes. 

9 What you look at is how the sentence was produced. Is 

this defendant entitled, had this -- to a lesser 

11 sentence? 

12  Is this -- had this defendant had a better 

13 lawyer at sentencing, is there even a reasonable 

14 probability that the -- that that lawyer, through a 

different strategy for identifying a legal error --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, you disagree with 

17 the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was 

18 unfair. This man deserved to get the sentence he got, 

19 didn't he? He had a full and fair trial. A jury of 12 

people, finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, 

21 determined that he deserved that sentence. How could it 

22 be unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved? 

23  MR. BURSCH: Yes, that's correct. In every 

24 case --

JUSTICE BREYER: The lists are legion where

1 people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, 

2 for example, the lawyer was inadequate. I mean --

3  MR. JAY: And in those cases, Justice Breyer, 

4 you show that the lawyer had a bad strategy at 

sentencing. That may well have been the same bad 

6 strategy that led the lawyer to recommend a not guilty 

7 plea. Let's go to trial on my crazy strategy. If he 

8 can show that and he can show that a better lawyer with 

9 a better strategy would produce a different result, then 

the Sixth Amendment entitles that person to a new 

11 proceeding. The Sixth Amendment never entitles the 

12 person to have a court order a particular sentence. 

13  And you can't use the prosecutor's offer 

14 made at a different time as the benchmark and say, well, 

the prosecutor was okay with it at this other time; 

16 therefore, the prosecution must be forced to live with 

17 it now. And that's because a plea offer rests on a 

18 number of considerations: the need to obtain the 

19 defendant's cooperation in other cases; the desire to 

spare the witnesses and the victim the burdens of trial; 

21 and, frankly, to avoid the risk of an acquittal. And 

22 the prosecution in this case and in cases like this one, 

23 where there has been a reliable conviction and reliable 

24 sentencing, the prosecution has already incurred all of 

those burdens. So, to look at the 51-month minimum

4 it's revealing about the Respondent's --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jay, you don't contest 

6 that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling 

7 somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you? 

8  MR. BURSCH: We don't -- we don't think --

9 that's not part of our argument here.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, because we've said that 

11 many times; isn't that right? 

12  MR. BURSCH: Well, the Court -- let me be 

13 precise, Justice Kagan, because there are two things 

14 that the Court can be talking about. There's the --

there's the -- the interaction between the State and the 

16 defendant, and that's where the Court has customarily 

17 used language like "critical stage," a confrontation 

18 between the defendant and the prosecution. 

19  That's not what we have here. This is about 

private advice between the lawyer and the client, and 

21 we're not contesting that he has a right to have that 

22 advice be effective. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: What we have recognized, 

24 right, is that plea bargaining is a critical phase 

because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal

1 justice system occurs in plea bargaining. And to
 

2 deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the
 

3 process, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is
 

4 inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment. That's what
 

we've said. Isn't that right? 

6  MR. BURSCH: Well, I don't think the Court 

7 has faced up -- faced this particular situation, Justice 

8 Kagan. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, it's not a critical 

phase. It's only a critical phase depending on the 

11 outcome of what happens at that phase? 

12  MR. JAY: We are -- we are assuming that --

13 that Mr. Cooper in this case had a right to receive 

14 effective advice about whether to enter this plea. But 

we're -- our position is that he wasn't prejudiced 

16 because what --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Has -- have you ever seen a 

18 critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment 

19 jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon 

what has -- what happens during that critical phase, 

21 where if one outcome results, there is no Sixth 

22 Amendment right, but if another outcome results there 

23 is?

in any way crucial to deciding this case, but

enough to explain our cases? 

6  MR. JAY: It certainly is correct that 

7 pleading -- that a guilty plea hearing, where the 

8 defendant --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's correct, but is 

it enough? Do you want us to write an opinion that plea 

11 negotiations are not a critical stage of the criminal 

12 process unless at the end of the day a guilty plea 

13 results?

19 know what your test is.

 MR. JAY: Our test to resolve this case is to 

21 look at what it is that the habeas petitioner is 

22 challenging. He's challenging conviction and his 

23 sentence. In the conviction, he was found guilty by a 

24 jury. He now says, page 14a of the red brief, that he 

is guilty and he wishes he had pleaded guilty sooner.

 MS. NEWMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

19 uncontroverted here that, as a result of that 

incompetent advice, Mr. Cooper is serving between 100 

21 and 134 months of extra time of imprisonment. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think that's not -- that 

23 he got ineffective assistance, yes, that's not 

24 controverted. But that he would have gotten the 51 

months or 68 is certainly controverted because of two

1 interventions. The prosecutor can say: No deal; I'm 

2 withdrawing it, even after an initial acceptance. And 

3 the judge can say: I think 51 to 68 is entirely 

4 improper for what this man did.

 MS. NEWMAN: Those are both true, Justice 

6 Ginsburg -- Justice Ginsburg, but, however, the 

7 Strickland test requires a reasonable probability of a 

8 different result. And on this record, we have no 

9 reasonable probability -- we have no reason to expect 

that that's not exactly what would have happened. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: The relief that you want is 

12 specific performance of the plea bargain. 

13  MS. NEWMAN: Correct. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that correct?

 What if it had come to light or come to the 

16 prosecutor's attention during this intervening time that 

17 your client had committed four or five other shootings? 

18 Would you still be entitled to specific performance? 

19  MS. NEWMAN: Yes. We evaluate the case, and 

the Strickland analysis is an imperfect -- the 

21 Strickland remedy is an imperfect remedy. It has always 

22 been an imperfect remedy. It will always be an

numerous times that it presumes a conscientious

9 I'm a conscientious decisionmaker, and I'm asking for

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know the details of this 

13 crime, which were more horrific than I would have 

14 expected, because I've heard them at the trial. Do I 

just somehow forget about that, prescind that?

18 proceedings. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the answer is "yes." 

I -- I ignore everything that I learned during the 

21 trial. 

22  MS. NEWMAN: Yes, because the deficient --

23 you evaluate things at the point of the deficient 

24 performance. And at the point of the deficient 

performance, the judge had a certain amount of

1 information before him, the prosecutor had a certain 

2 amount of information before him, and the defense

incredible. It doesn't matter what the defendant has 

6 done in the -- has been discovered to have done in the 

7 interim? Committed 5 murders, 10 murders? 

8  MS. NEWMAN: Well, in that case --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Wipe it out of your mind; you 

get -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an 

11 early point in -- in the investigation of the case? 

12  MS. NEWMAN: Yes, because what happens in 

13 ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the State 

14 has to bear the burden of the unconstitutionality. And 

so, that is a price that this Court has said the State 

16 will bear when there is -- when there's a constitutional 

17 violation, because there is no perfect --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can the judge -- the 

19 judge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows 

what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for 

21 one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the 

22 sentencing range is 81 to 135. So, without any --

23 considering anything that happened at trial, the judge 

24 knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man 

had been charged with -- only with a felon in 

31

1 possession. 

2  MS. NEWMAN: Yes, that's accurate. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it -- it seems most 

4 unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea 

bargain for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged. 

6  MS. NEWMAN: No, I would disagree with that. 

7 This -- in this Court -- and I can represent to the 

8 Court, in my practice before this Court, which I have 

9 practiced before this Court for many, many years, this 

plea bargain was an ordinary plea bargain. This was not 

11 anything extraordinary. It was very run of the mill. 

12 It was -- it was a run-of-the-mill case --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That may be, but is it not 

14 true that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon 

in possession? 

16  MS. NEWMAN: I did not -- typically, you only 

17 score out the guidelines for the most serious offense. 

18 So, the guidelines may have been high for the felon in 

19 possession offense, but, however, the judge -- in 

fashioning the remedy, you're not going to -- this Court 

21 would not take discretion away from the judge. So, in 

22 fashioning the remedy, in adopting the remedy of the 

23 Sixth Circuit if this Court were to do that, this case 

24 would go back before this same judge if he's still on

4 The problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take 

it, is what the order would say is that the prosecution 

6 has to, for a reasonable time, extend the same offer. 

7 And then if it's accepted, you go to the judge. The 

8 judge doesn't have to accept the plea. 

9  MS. NEWMAN: Right. You can't find --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can't make him do that. 

11 But I have a bigger problem with this case, which is --

12 which I may be the only one to have. But as I've looked 

13 at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel 

14 within the AEDPA meaning. That is, you have two courts 

in the State which have said this is not ineffective. 

16 And as I look at it, it's somewhat ambiguous at best. 

17 And we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is. Well, I 

18 know both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't 

19 make us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in 

fact it's not. 

21  I mean -- so, what am I supposed to do about 

22 that? I find this a tough case. I've read the record, 

23 and in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If Justice Breyer permits 

4 me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might 

agree with him or a way of viewing this, as I read the 

6 lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't 

7 ineffectiveness because he was just trying to get a 

8 better deal. 

9  And I think that, translating what he said, 

the very reasonable view by the court was the prosecutor 

11 may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really 

12 wanted to kill this woman, he would have hit her head or 

13 her chest, but he aimed low. So, he was really just 

14 angry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay, 

if she died, okay. But he really didn't have that 

16 heinous intent to execute, you know, a gunshot to the 

17 brain. And so, he was hoping to negotiate something 

18 better. If that's -- Justice Breyer is shaking his 

19 head. If that in fact -- if this is an AEDPA case, and 

we have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't 

21 that resolve this case?

1 to their finding. There's no question under AEDPA 

2 there's -- there's deference. And there's actually no 

3 question there's sort of a doubly deferential review, 

4 given the Strickland analysis. However, the State 

courts did not decide this case on Sixth Amendment 

6 grounds. So, there is nothing to give deference to. 

7 The State courts decided this, and the trial court said 

8 Mr. Cooper made his own choices. That's not an 

9 ineffective assistance of counsel analysis.

 The court of appeals in Michigan also did 

11 not engage in a Sixth Amendment analysis. They adopted 

12 the trial court and said that Mr. Cooper made his own 

13 choices. So, there is -- and this claim was raised 

14 specifically on Sixth Amendment grounds from the very 

beginning of the appeal until it reached this Court. 

16 So, there is no AEDPA deference to give to the State 

17 courts' decisions. There is no question as well that it 

18 was ineffective assistance, because the State court 

19 record does not bear out that Mr. McClain was trying to 

get a better deal. The State court --

22 perfect. Either he has another trial, although he's 

23 just been found guilty by a jury of 12 with an entirely 

24 fair proceeding, or else he doesn't have a new trial. 

Which is it?

4  MS. NEWMAN: Okay. The --

JUSTICE BREYER: You could do it. You don't 

6 have to -- you would -- he's right, you would have to, 

7 under my suggestion, have a new trial, even though there 

8 was a trial that took place 2 years ago or whatever it 

9 is, correct?

 MS. NEWMAN: Correct. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't the end of 

12 the argument. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you're the 

14 defense counsel, the best thing for you to do is not 

communicate any plea offer you get, and then if your 

16 client is found guilty, then you can go back and say, 

17 oh, by the way, I didn't tell you about this, and he 

18 gets a whole new trial. 

19  MS. NEWMAN: No. The -- the bar on habeas --

well, the bar on Strickland, even not on habeas, is a 

21 very high bar, as this Court said in Padilla. And it's 

22 not a bar that can often be met. And so, you have to 

23 show under a Strickland analysis deficient performance 

24 and prejudice. So --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A deficient
 

3 performance --

4  JUSTICE ALITO: I don't know that that's
 

going to be so hard to show. Do you think it's feasible 

6 to draw a distinction between this case, where there was 

7 arguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which 

8 the defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken 

9 calculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at 

trial? A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the 

11 guy's possible sentence at, let's say, 3 years. The 

12 defense attorney says: We've got a great shot at an 

13 acquittal. Let's go to trial. I'm going to rip the 

14 prosecution's witnesses apart.

 The trial turns out to be a disaster. 

16 Convicted on all counts, 25 years. Do you think that 

17 it's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt 

18 here to be applied in that situation as well? 

19  MS. NEWMAN: I think it would be much more 

difficult, because this Court on habeas review and State 

21 courts on non-habeas review are very deferential to 

22 strategic decisions. Almost anything that qualifies --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say that. But, 

24 as an administrative matter, I think we have to have 

some concern that these plea negotiations and 

40

Official 

1 discussions are in myriad circumstances. The defense 

2 attorney is by the water cooler; the prosecutor walks by 

3 and says I'm thinking of offering you a good bargain in 

4 the Jones case. He knows he's going to have that 

prosecutor in court the next day and really beat him. 

6 He thinks he's going to soften him up. So, he doesn't 

7 communicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later 

8 says withdrawn. 

9  We're going to have inquiries post hoc on 

all of these negotiations and discussions. And it seems 

11 to me that, absent some other rule, which I don't think 

12 we have the authority to impose, that all plea offers 

13 must be in writing and be stated with specificity, that 

14 if -- what you're proposing is simply unworkable.

 MS. NEWMAN: I disagree, Your Honor. We've 

16 had Hill -- we've had Strickland and Hill jurisprudence 

17 for three decades. There's -- there was a floodgates 

18 argument when Hill was decided, that we're going to have 

19 all these people that the -- and we've had, since 

McMann v. Richardson, this Court saying plea bargaining 

21 is a critical stage, and --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: And most of the circuits 

23 follow your rule; isn't that right? 

24  MS. NEWMAN: Right. We already have 

unanimity --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Go ahead.

 MS. NEWMAN: Yes, we have unanimity in the 

6 Federal circuits, and we have -- almost every State that 

7 has addressed this issue has addressed it in the same 

8 manner. And so --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the unanimity on 

the remedy? Here, the court said that the writ shall be 

11 granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer 

12 the 51-to-85-month plea. So, that doesn't bind the 

13 judge, but it does bind the prosecutor. 

14  MS. NEWMAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it removes the 

16 possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have 

17 withdrawn that initial offer. 

18  MS. NEWMAN: Correct. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the prosecutor -- the 

remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform? That 

21 the prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does? 

22  MS. NEWMAN: Well, the remedies vary. When I 

23 said "unanimity," I didn't mean every -- every court in 

24 every circuit does -- handles this exactly the same way. 

Unanimity in the sense that every Federal circuit and

1 almost every State that has addressed this issue, and
 

2 they've addressed this issue for over 30 years, has
 

3 found that there is an -- there is a cognizable Sixth
 

4 Amendment violation that can be remedied on appeal.


 JUSTICE KAGAN: And perhaps the lack of 

6 unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate. I 

7 mean, people have been trying to suggest different 

8 remedies. But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy 

9 question is to recognize that these cases present very 

different factual circumstances, that there are a lot of 

11 variation in them, and to give a substantial amount of 

12 discretion to the lower courts to work out what the best 

13 remedy is, consistent with that factual variation. 

14  MS. NEWMAN: Absolutely. And it's the same 

thing the courts have been doing, again, since 

16 Strickland and Hill were decided. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Like what? What factual 

18 variation do you think justifies a categorically 

19 different remedy? I mean, it seems to me some of the 

remedies are good and some are bad. 

21  MS. NEWMAN: Correct.

2 before the Court today -- I mean, in Mr. Frye's, case he 

3 accepted a plea, and the State court ordered a new trial 

4 as the remedy for the -- for the ineffective assistance 

of counsel violation. In my case and Mr. Cooper's

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And why was that 

8 okay there?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why was that okay there? 

11 What -- what factual circumstances made that okay there? 

12  MS. NEWMAN: Well, that just -- I don't know 

13 that the factual circumstances make it okay, but it was 

14 the remedy that the State -- I'm not sure I understand 

your question. It was a remedy that the State ordered, 

16 and, in this case, it's just the remedy that was ordered 

17 by the Federal court was the remedy --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: You have a situation where 

19 the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is 

turned down and the defendant goes to trial. Are there 

21 any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy 

22 other than specific performance the correct remedy in

3 possibility exists that a -- that the remedy would --

4  JUSTICE ALITO: You recommend -- you 

recommend specific performance as the remedy for your 

6 case, and I agree with you that is -- if there is to be 

7 a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any 

8 modicum of sense. The remedy of giving a new trial when 

9 the person has already had a fair trial makes zero 

sense. 

11  MS. NEWMAN: That's correct. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: So, what I'm looking for is 

13 any situation in which -- you said leave it to the 

14 discretion of the trial judge. But what is -- what 

discretion is there? What remedy in that situation 

16 other than specific performance would be an 

17 appropriate -- would remedy what you claim to have been 

18 the violation? 

19  MS. NEWMAN: Well, in Mr. Cooper's case, I 

think the -- the remedy in the Sixth Circuit is the only 

21 appropriate remedy that -- that puts every -- that is 

22 narrowly tailored to the Sixth Amendment violation, and 

23 that's what this Court has said.

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's wrong -- let me 

4 go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I'm trying 

out what Justice Scalia suggested. Maybe that does work 

6 better. What -- what you'd say is, first, throw the 

7 defendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is 

8 there ineffective assistance, but also it would have 

9 made a difference; he would have accepted the plea 

bargain. 

11  MS. NEWMAN: Correct. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: So, now they have to hold 

13 the plea bargain open. They then do it. They then go 

14 to the judge, like any plea bargain. Ninety percent of 

the time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of 

16 it. 

17  MS. NEWMAN: Correct. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: But should the judge decide 

19 that this is a case where he would reject a plea bargain 

for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption 

21 was wrong, and we reinstate the previous trial. Now, 

22 the -- just say it's over? You were tried, you were 

23 convicted, that's the end of it.

2 yes, Justice Breyer's first statement, you have to prove 

3 the guy was going to take the plea, because there's no 

4 sense in -- in giving him a remedy that he --

MS. NEWMAN: Right. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would have never 

7 sought. 

8  MS. NEWMAN: Absolutely. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? But it goes 

back to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the 

11 Chief Justice's question, on what basis can the judge 

12 reject the plea? You have said earlier that he has to 

13 put aside any information he learned during the trial. 

14 And that's really the nub of this case. What are the 

grounds that you're proposing the judge can use to 

16 reject the plea? 

17  MS. NEWMAN: That -- any grounds that would 

18 have existed in the original circumstances. So, if the 

19 judge -- in -- in Michigan, there's a variety of reasons 

why a judge can say I -- I'm not going to accept this 

21 sentencing recommendation. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how are you ever 

23 going to know that the defendant would have accepted the 

24 plea agreement? Because by not accepting it, he's got a 

chance of going scot-free. He's going to have a fair

1 trial, that's the assumption; and he may be acquitted. 

2  So, how is a judge supposed to say -- I 

3 mean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would 

4 have taken that deal, because it's better. Well, how is 

a judge supposed to go back and decide whether that's 

6 true or not? 

7  MS. NEWMAN: Well, always -- in large part, 

8 it's not going to depend on the defendant; it's going to 

9 -- in larger part it's going to defend on -- depend on 

defense counsel --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why? 

12  MS. NEWMAN: -- in making that determination, 

13 because Strickland always looks at strategy. I mean, 

14 that -- that's the underlying --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you can --

16  MS. NEWMAN: -- value of Strickland. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- answer the Chief 

18 Justice's question. The Chief Justice said how are you 

19 going to know -- you have to show prejudice.

 MS. NEWMAN: Correct. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no prejudice 

22 unless he would have accepted the deal.

answer the Chief Justice's question yes or no. 

6  MS. NEWMAN: I don't think I can --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the judge --

8  MS. NEWMAN: -- answer it yes or no. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the judge --

how is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide, 

11 whether the defendant would have accepted the deal or 

12 not? 

13  MS. NEWMAN: The same way that the trial 

14 courts decide any question of fact. In this case, we 

had testimony from the trial attorney. The trial 

16 attorney told the judge, I told him not to accept the 

17 plea because he legally could not be convicted of the 

18 charge. I mean, Mr. Cooper was --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the defendant's 

choice; it's not the lawyer's choice. It's the 

21 defendant's choice. 

22  MS. NEWMAN: But he -- but he has a right to 

23 the assistance -- to the effective assistance of counsel 

24 in making that critical choice, and he didn't have the 

effective assistance of counsel. He wrote -- Mr. Cooper

4 out of the case by the concessions on the other side. 

I'm talking about the prejudice question.
 

6  MS. NEWMAN: Correct.
 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is a judge
 

8 supposed to know?
 

9  MS. NEWMAN: The judge looks at the record
 

before him. So, in this case, we had Mr. Cooper's 

11 testimony --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: People have 

13 different -- some people are willing to take the chance. 

14 Okay? Let's assume there's a 20 percent chance the 

person will be found guilty. 

16  Some people will say, I'm willing to take 

17 that chance because I just don't want the chance of 

18 going to jail; I'm willing to roll the dice. Other 

19 people will say, no, that's too much.

 Now, whether you want to go to jail may cut 

21 one way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to 

22 decide? Ask him, are you -- do you take chances? 

23  MS. NEWMAN: No, by -- by looking at --

24 Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the evidence in the 

record before him. In this case, Mr. Cooper wrote --

51

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the judge should 

2 decide whether he would take the deal. 

3  MS. NEWMAN: No --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Look at the evidence 

before him and say, boy, I'd take that deal. 

6  (Laughter.) 

7  MS. NEWMAN: No, no, no, no. Mr. -- Mr. 

8 Cooper wrote two letters to the judge saying, I want to 

9 accept a plea. Mr. McClain, the trial attorney who 

provided the incompetent advice, told the judge in a 

11 postconviction hearing that Mr. Cooper wanted to take a 

12 plea. I mean, there -- there is no -- it is beyond 

13 question in this case. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the length and 

the complexity of the trial has any bearing on this? 

16 This was a relatively short and simple trial. But let's 

17 say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which 

18 the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to 

19 cost -- and it's going to cost a million dollars, and if 

they try that case, there are going to be other cases 

21 that they won't be able to try. The plea is rejected, 

22 the case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy 

23 is to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was 

24 predicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden 

of having to try that case.

Official 

1  MS. NEWMAN: Well, every plea bargain is 

2 predicated on relieving the prosecution of having the 

3 burden of -- of trying a case. I mean, the key here 

4 is -- let's get back to what Strickland stands for, and 

it's the unreliability or the unfairness of the
 

6 proceedings. It's not just an unreliability
 

7 determination.
 

8  So, in this case, Mr. Cooper had two
 

9 choices. He could take a certain plea with almost a
 

certain sentence or he could have really what was a 

11 charade of a trial because his attorney told him you --

12 you can't be convicted of this offense; you will not be 

13 convicted of this offense following a trial. You'll be 

14 convicted of a lesser --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You conceded -- you 

16 conceded he had a fair trial. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not in the case. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 MS. NEWMAN: I didn't --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It can't be a charade and 

22 still be fair. 

23  MS. NEWMAN: It's an unfairness of the entire 

24 proceedings that were presented. All right? So, 

there's no separate habeas claim with respect to the

1 trial, but the -- but reality is when you look at the 

2 criminal -- when you look at the Sixth Amendment, it 

3 talks about the criminal proceedings. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying it was unfair 

to have a fair trial? 

6  MS. NEWMAN: I'm saying it's unfair to go to 

7 trial when your attorney tells you, you can't be 

8 convicted. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying it's unfair 

to have a fair trial; isn't that correct? 

11  MS. NEWMAN: I'm --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That has to be your 

13 position. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it is.

 MS. NEWMAN: I'm saying it's unfair to say 

16 that the trial erases the unfairness when there was no 

17 possibility but for a conviction at the end of the road. 

18 So, this was a certain guilty plea or this was a long 

19 guilty plea under the math of a trial.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can never say 

21 that there's no possibility of acquittal. Juries can 

22 decide not to convict no matter what the evidence. 

23  MS. NEWMAN: There was no defense. I mean,

be convicted at the end of the trial; you're just going

have taken the plea? 

6  MS. NEWMAN: Sorry. I didn't hear the rest. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In most cases in which a 

8 trial is had, where the defendant is pleading 

9 misidentification or "I just didn't do this act," in 

those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or 

11 don't find that the defendant has met their burden of 

12 proving that he or she would have taken the plea? 

13  MS. NEWMAN: I don't know that the cases bear 

14 out that if you have a valid defense, it would be 

harder. But I -- I would agree with that -- if that's a 

16 hypothetical, that if you have a valid defense, it would 

17 be a lot harder to be in this position of showing that 

18 you would have taken the plea. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought in this case, 

and you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client 

21 told the attorney from the beginning: I did it; I want 

22 to plea.

He went to trial because he believed legally his client 

6 would be convicted of a lesser offense that would put 

7 him in a better position than if he had accepted the 

8 plea. That was the only reason. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said there's -- I 

want to make sure I understand your point. You said 

11 there was no defense. Does that mean you didn't -- he 

12 had a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put 

13 on a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove

 MS. NEWMAN: Well, he held the State to its 

16 burden, and that is a defense. I mean, I...

18  MS. NEWMAN: I'm not saying literally no --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.

 MS. NEWMAN: I'm not saying literally no 

21 defense, and I apologize if that's the way it came 

22 across, but no cognizable defense. It wasn't mistaken 

23 identification or we didn't intend to hit her. I mean, 

24 never contested the basic facts of that case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's something the

1 jury could have accepted, right? Even if it's not 

2 legally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the 

3 person below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can 

4 see a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend 

to kill her. He shot her, you know, below the waist. 

6 Maybe that is not such a bad strategy. 

7  MS. NEWMAN: Except the defense counsel on 

8 this record specifically said that he -- that he was not 

9 running a strategy and hoping for that, that he told the 

client legally that's the only thing that could happen 

11 to him, so he was in a better position by going to 

12 trial.

 Mr. Bursch, 4 minutes. 

16  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

17  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

18  MR. BURSCH: Thank you. I'd like to start at 

19 the one point where I think all of us, including counsel 

on both sides, agree, and that's that a second trial 

21 after an error-free first trial doesn't make sense. And 

22 that right there says a lot about Mr. Cooper's case, 

23 because a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial. 

24 And it's exceedingly strange that they're now saying 

that I don't want a new trial. That demonstrates that

1 what they are claiming is not a Strickland violation. 

2  I would like to address, Justice Breyer, 

3 your suggestion that maybe you could have specific 

4 performance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the 

trial result could simply be re-imposed. And the 

6 question is: Well, what's the problem with that? And I 

7 can tick off at least five. 

8  First, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it 

9 takes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the 

plea, which he or she undeniably would have had the 

11 right. 

12  Second, as Justice Alito said, it ignores 

13 that there's information that could be learned in the 

14 interim. Mr. Cooper shot three or four other people.

 Third, it ignores the fact that an 

16 error-free trial has taken place. The prosecutor has 

17 taken the risk of putting that 8-year-old sexual abuse 

18 victim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away. 

19  Fourth, as I already mentioned, we've got 

the separation of powers issue and prosecutorial 

21 discretion. 

22  Fifth, we're going to have intractable 

23 problems. Say the offer was plead to A, we'll dismiss 

24 B. He rejects it based on deficient advice. You go to 

trial. He is convicted on A and acquitted on B. And

1 now we're going to try to enforce the plea on A? I 

2 mean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem. So, 

3 there's intractable problems. 

4  The second point I want to make is about the 

death situation. And that's one we take very seriously. 

6 And, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty 

7 situation, there could be a due process right or some 

8 other constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of 

9 requiring something to be put on the record. But what's 

clear is that, under this Court's existing precedent, 

11 that is not a Strickland violation because the amount of 

12 the sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has 

13 nothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory 

14 proceeding and the sentence.

 Finally, the last point that I want to make 

16 is something else on which we can all agree. Mr. Cooper 

17 is guilty of shooting Kali Mundy. He also got exactly 

18 the sentence that the people prescribed for the crime 

19 that committed. There is very little unfair about 

holding him to that sentence. As Justice Kennedy said, 

21 it's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to 

22 have a fair trial. And from our perspective, that is 

23 really the beginning and the end of this inquiry. 

24  And unless you have any further questions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one, but it's more

1 appropriate, I think, for the Government of the United 

2 States. Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to 

3 be a colloquy before a plea is entered. Do you think 

4 the Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be 

amended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a 

6 sentence inquire: Have there been plea offers; have 

7 they all been communicated to the defendant? 

8  Is that good practice? 

9  MR. BURSCH: It could be good practice, but 

it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even 

11 if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the 

12 problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer 

13 gave to the client in private. And so, that doesn't 

14 solve the core problem. The core problem is that 

they're trying to claim that it was unfair to have a 

16 fair trial. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if they had -- if 

18 plea offer had come out -- well, I don't know how it 

19 would work. When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter 

a not guilty plea. 

21  MR. BURSCH: Right. You know, the judge, 

22 under your theory then, would have had to inquire: 

23 Well, what advice did your attorney give you with 

24 respect to that? And then evaluate whether that advice 

was good advice or bad advice. And I would respectfully
