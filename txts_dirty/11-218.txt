3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-218, Tibbals v. Carter.

 Ms. Schimmer. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA T. SCHIMMER 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MS. SCHIMMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 This case is here from the Sixth Circuit, 

11 which held that habeas claims can be stayed indefinitely 

12 because prisoners have a statutory right to competence 

13 to assist in their case, but even Mr. Carter now disowns 

14 the circuit's rationale, and the court's indefinite stay 

order was wrong for two other reasons. 

16  First, habeas claims cannot be stayed 

17 indefinitely. Doing so is fundamentally incompatible 

18 with the timeliness concerns underlying AEDPA. 

19  Second, while we readily acknowledge that 

limited stays will be appropriate in some situations, 

21 this is not one of them. All of Mr. Carter's claims are 

22 record based and, therefore, resolvable without his 

23 assistance. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: What situations would they 

be appropriate in?

Official 

1  MS. SCHIMMER: Limited stays, we think, Your 

2 Honor, would be stay -- appropriate in situations where 

3 the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with 

4 his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary 

to his claim. And we think that would be true in a 

6 case, potentially, where AEDPA does not restrict Federal 

7 review to the state court record. 

8  So here, for instance, we think that the 

9 prisoner's assistance would not be necessary, and 

therefore, even a limited stay would not be appropriate 

11 because all of Mr. Carter's claims were vetted before 

12 the state courts and decided on the merits. And 

13 therefore, under 2254(d), in this Court's decision in 

14 Pinholster, the Federal court is limited to reviewing 

the state court record. 

16  We don't think that the prisoner's 

17 assistance in that case is necessary. We don't think 

18 Mr. Carter has made a case for why his assistance would 

19 be necessary in this specific case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why -- why shouldn't 

21 the rule be that an indefinite stay is -- is never 

22 necessary? You just proceed based on the evidence you 

23 have? 

24  Sometimes, we have evidence where a witness 

is missing. We have to go on with the case. Then it

1 could be open to argue in a later case that there was
 

2 new evidence that was not available.
 

3  MS. SCHIMMER: Well, we absolutely agree,
 

4 Justice Kennedy, that indefinite stays are never
 

appropriate, regardless of the circumstances; that 

6 indefinite stays contravene AEDPA's timeliness concerns. 

7 And to the extent that all of the parties in this case 

8 agree now that, to the extent district courts have some 

9 power to issue stays -- we say only limited stays -- in 

these cases, that power is grounded in equitable 

11 discretion. 

12  And we do not think that it comports with 

13 equitable discretion to allow a prisoner essentially to 

14 win his case, to obtain a suspension of his capital 

sentence, the ultimate end relief that he seeks --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the second part 

17 of -- of the equation? So, suppose that there's no 

18 stay, that the habeas proceeding is adjudicated against 

19 the petitioner. He then becomes competent and claims 

there's new evidence. Would -- would that be grounds to 

21 reopen, you think? 

22  MS. SCHIMMER: Well, we think in those 

23 situations -- certainly, the State of Ohio wouldn't 

24 contest, for instance, under 2254(b), that if you were 

incompetent before, that that would be a legitimate 

5

Official 

1 basis, potentially, for not having been able to 

2 reasonably discover a new claim, if one had a new claim. 

3  So we do think that -- moving forward, that 

4 no indefinite stay should be permitted. And when the 

courts move forward, yes, if someone's competency is 

6 later restored, there are backstops. The person, 

7 certainly in Ohio, can always go back to state court 

8 and --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And would the backstop be 

newly discovered evidence? 

11  MS. SCHIMMER: The backstop would be a newly 

12 discovered claim, I would say. I think that would be 

13 what --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Schimmer, if you are 

right that no stay was appropriate in these 

16 circumstances, we would never reach the question of how 

17 much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances; 

18 isn't that right? 

19  MS. SCHIMMER: I think that's right because 

I think -- to the extent that, using this case as a 

21 springboard, the Court could draw the boundary line --

22 could -- could draw one bright boundary line and say 

23 indefinite stays are never permitted, but limited stays 

24 might be permitted in cases where the claims are not 

record based. I --

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm saying the exact 

2 opposite. 

3  MS. SCHIMMER: Oh. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, if there was 

one bright line, which says that stays are not 

6 appropriate in a record-based claim because there's 

7 really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd 

8 have no need or cause to reach the second question of 

9 what happens, in a case where a stay might be 

appropriate, how long that stay should be. 

11  MS. SCHIMMER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

12 I'm sorry, I agree -- I agree with you that the Court 

13 could rule on that ground. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Alternatively, we could --

we could rule that indefinite stays are never 

16 appropriate; in which case, it would be unnecessary to 

17 decide whether any stay is appropriate where -- for a 

18 record-based claim, right?

Official 

1  MS. SCHIMMER: I suppose, yes. I mean, we 

2 would -- we would -- we would urge the Court to, I 

3 think, do both, to say --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I -- am I 

understanding that your position, in response to the 

6 question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, is 

7 that, for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever? 

8  It sounds like what you are proposing -- or 

9 in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of 

determining competence, whether it's short or long, is 

11 permissible. Is that your argument? 

12  MS. SCHIMMER: That is not our argument, 

13 Justice Sotomayor. Our -- our definition of an 

14 indefinite stay is a stay that is imposed until the 

prisoner is restored to competence. That --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Like -- like the stay in 

17 Rees? 

18  MS. SCHIMMER: Like -- like the stay in 

19 Rees, or, really, like the stay the Sixth Circuit has 

issued. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would have to -- to 

22 maintain your position, the Court would have to qualify 

23 Rees, or at least the interpretation that says the stay 

24 should be indefinite once the petitioner is found 

incompetent because that's what has happened there. The 

8

Official 

1 court said, find out if he's competent. The answer was, 

2 he is incompetent. And then the court just let it sit 

3 until the man died. 

4  MS. SCHIMMER: Well, Your Honor, we don't 

think that Rees really has any force or provides any 

6 guidance in this case. That, of course, was a case 

7 where a prisoner was seeking to abandon his further 

8 appeals. 

9  There are multiple reasons why we -- why we 

think that Rees does not endorse the power of Federal 

11 courts to indefinitely stay habeas proceedings. 

12  One is the fact that the Court's stay order 

13 was completely unexplained and very terse. It didn't 

14 announce any rule of law.

 Second, the historical record shows that the 

16 Court's stay in Rees was, at most, a judicially 

17 negotiated settlement, meaning far from a demonstration 

18 of the Court's inherent power. It seemed to be a very 

19 carefully orchestrated exercise of consented-to power.

 The third point is that --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I could take objection 

22 to that characterization because the clerk of the court 

23 told the court that neither party was happy with what 

24 was happening, and the court still entered the order.

 But let me go back to my question a moment.

1 Amici say that most competency issues are resolved 

2 within months and that many individuals -- the vast 

3 majority, are restored to competency with proper 

4 medication within months. Are you opposing those kinds 

of stays? 

6  MS. SCHIMMER: For -- not in -- not where 

7 it's appropriate, no, Your Honor. And again, Your 

8 Honor, our definition of an indefinite stay is --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But under your 

definition, it's never appropriate, really. 

11  MS. SCHIMMER: No. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You argue -- you argue 

13 two things. You say, under Pinholster, they -- courts 

14 always have to rely on the record.

 MS. SCHIMMER: Correct. We would -- here's 

16 how we would taxonomize the appropriateness of stays: 

17 We would say indefinite stays are never permitted, 

18 meaning a court can never premise a stay exclusively on 

19 the restoration of the prisoner's competency, in saying 

however long it takes --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though a doctor 

22 says, it can be done, we have to try? 

23  MS. SCHIMMER: If -- if a doctor says, it 

24 can be done, we have to try, and it's a situation where 

it's appropriate --

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they can never
 

2 say, it can be done. They can say --

3  MS. SCHIMMER: Right.
 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- we have to try.


 MS. SCHIMMER: There is a reasonable 

6 probability that it can be done. We would say, 

7 Your Honor --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's also --

9 I'm not sure how they can do that until they try.

 MS. SCHIMMER: Right. So we would say, in 

11 certain situations, yes, that would be perfectly 

12 appropriate. 

13  The State of Ohio certainly agrees that 

14 having a competent prisoner is a desirable thing in a 

habeas case and that courts do have some discretion to 

16 try to vindicate that goal. 

17  Our point, though, is simply that it cannot 

18 come at all cost, meaning --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Rees -- Rees was not an 

indefinite stay in -- in the absolute sense, was it? 

21  MS. SCHIMMER: No. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the trial 

23 proceeded. There -- there was going to be an end, 

24 right?

 MS. SCHIMMER: Well, the court -- the court

1 in the end held up the cert petition for several decades 

2 without deciding the case. So -- and in the end, 

3 Mr. Rees died and then the cert petition was ultimately 

4 later dismissed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

6 how your approach works. We, the defendant, the habeas 

7 petitioner, the allegation is made, I'm incompetent, 

8 there is support for it. The district court says, okay, 

9 I can't enter an indefinite stay, but you are going to 

be treated; I want you to come back in 6 months, okay? 

11 And we will look at it then. 

12  He comes back in 6 months, and there's been 

13 no change. What happens then? Another 6 months? At 

14 what point does it become indefinite?

 MS. SCHIMMER: Right. Well, since we are 

16 playing on the field of equitable discretion, 

17 Your Honor, it's going to be difficult to put forward a 

18 hard and fast rule. 

19  But Justice Sotomayor rightly points --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, give me a 

21 loose and soft rule. I mean, is it --

22  (Laughter.) 

23  MS. SCHIMMER: Sure. A loose and soft rule. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it two years? Or 

is it ten years?

Official 

1  MS. SCHIMMER: We would say, presumptively, 

2 a year.  And we think there is support for that, even 

3 from Mr. Carter's own amici. The brief of the American 

4 Psychiatric Association, pages 19 to 21, and especially 

footnote 30, talks about how most prisoners who are 

6 ultimately successfully restored to competency, that 

7 does happen in a matter of months, 6 to 9 months at the 

8 longest end. About 90 percent of them are restored 

9 within 6 to 9 months.

 So we think, presumptively, a year would be 

11 an appropriate period of time for --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Schimmer, why 

13 would that be? I mean, assume a case where you say a 

14 stay would be appropriate. So it's not a closed record 

case. It's a case where the client might be expected to 

16 provide information that's -- let's -- let's assume it's 

17 necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas 

18 claim. 

19  Why would you cut it off at a year? Why 

wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and 

21 fair adjudication couldn't take place in those 

22 circumstances. 

23  MS. SCHIMMER: Well, we think, Your Honor, 

24 at the point at which you say that the test for a 

limited stay is however long it takes to restore 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 somebody's competency is the point at which we have 

2 returned to the definition of saying that indefinite 

3 stays are proper. 

4  And the bottom line is that we think that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's not an indefinite 

6 stay. I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice 

7 suggested, that -- you know, it's not for ever and ever. 

8 We're just going to come back to it periodically. But 

9 if the answer is the same, which is that the client's 

participation is necessary for a full and fair 

11 adjudication, then the court's answer should be the 

12 same, too. Why isn't that right? 

13  MS. SCHIMMER: Because we do think that 

14 there comes a point, given the finality concerns 

underlying AEDPA, that a limited stay, when that window 

16 expires -- the person has a reasonable period of time to 

17 be restored to competency; that when that window 

18 expires, at some point, the proceedings do have to 

19 continue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's really -- it's 

21 really not the same question when it comes back, is it? 

22 Because there are two questions: Is -- is reasonable 

23 competence useful for his defense? But, also, the 

24 second question, is there a reasonable probability that 

he can be restored to competence?

1  The first time, there obviously is that, and 

2 you give him a year. When you come back a second time, 

3 you say, well, it's been a year, they usually come back 

4 within 6 to 9 months, there is no longer a reasonable 

probability. 

6  MS. SCHIMMER: That's exactly right, 

7 Justice Scalia. And to the extent that we are balancing 

8 different parties' interests in these cases, after the 

9 preliminary limited stay expires, we believe at that 

point the prisoner's interest in a continued stay has 

11 diminished, and the state's interest in the proceedings 

12 continuing and moving forward has then increased, and 

13 that the court should then move on. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there'd be no stay at 

all, unless it's necessary for just adjudication of the 

16 claim, so that would be a threshold question. 

17  MS. SCHIMMER: That would be the threshold 

18 question, and there seems to be a good amount of 

19 consensus on that point. It's the test articulated by 

the Sixth and Ninth Circuits and by my colleague here 

21 today. And we're -- we're willing to accept that as the 

22 test for when limited stays can be imposed. 

23  And with that, if there aren't further 

24 questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT MICHELMAN 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

4  MR. MICHELMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

6  Ohio and the United States have agreed today 

7 that courts have the authority to stay habeas 

8 proceedings when the petitioner is mentally incompetent. 

9 So then the questions for this Court are when may such 

stays issue and how long may such stays be? 

11  The Court's answers should reflect the 

12 important principle that no individual should lose 

13 potentially meritorious claims because of mental 

14 illness.

 I'd like to begin by addressing --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Petitioner says they 

17 won't because they can come back with new evidence after 

18 habeas is closed. Why is that inadequate? 

19  MR. MICHELMAN: I -- I think that's --

that's a crucial question, Justice Sotomayor, that 

21 Justice Kennedy asked as well, and -- and it goes to the 

22 limits on second or successive petitions. They can't 

23 come back if they are later competent, if they first 

24 lose their claims, because they didn't have the evidence 

they needed and then try again later.

1  They are subject to the bar on second or 

2 successive petitions, which requires, not only that they 

3 have new facts, but also that they have new law. So 

4 that's a very restrictive standard that would not allow 

them to simply pick up where they left off. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I -- I 

7 didn't follow that exactly. What -- what prevents them 

8 from picking up where they left off? 

9  MR. MICHELMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, 

Section 2244(b), the bar on second or successive 

11 petitions. 

12  Imagine Mr. Carter has a potentially 

13 meritorious claim now that he can't speak to because of 

14 his incompetence, it's adjudicated without him, he loses 

it. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it's 

17 adjudicated. Okay. Sorry. 

18  MR. MICHELMAN: Imagine it's adjudicated 

19 without him, he loses it. And then he can't simply 

waltz back into court and say, I'm here, I'm competent, 

21 hear me out. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm presume -- I presume 

23 that the one claim among your many -- yours is the 

24 defendant who was excluded from trial, correct?

 MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

2 and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I 

3 wanted to come back earlier, and they never let me back 

4 in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of 

the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct? 

6  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But without his 

8 information? 

9  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes. And, in fact, the --

the record lends some support to this suggestion by 

11 showing that counsel frequently put their own safety and 

12 their own concerns ahead of my client's interests, for 

13 example, stating on the record -- and I'm quoting here 

14 from trial counsel -- "I am still worried about him 

behaving during this phase, so the bottom line is he 

16 wants to stay where he is." So there is a question of 

17 whether trial counsel was -- was really looking out for 

18 Mr. Carter's interests at that time. 

19  There's also the question of whether --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that, you could 

21 see from the record. The question in my mind would be 

22 whether he told counsel he would behave, and counsel 

23 ignored that information, correct? 

24  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 

There is strong support in the record to suggest that

Could he communicate with counsel?

7 with your discussion of 2244(b)? I have it in front of 

8 me. And the hypothetical was that he's incompetent, the 

9 claim is adjudicated, then he becomes competent, and he 

says now is there some new evidence, which could not 

11 have been discovered. 

12  I thought you told us that you not only have 

13 to have new evidence, but new law. That's not the way I

21 actual innocence. I misstated that. I apologize.

17  But one of his claims, his ineffective 

18 assistance of counsel in mitigation, goes to not his 

19 guilt, but his punishment. So that claim would be 

barred under 2254. Additionally, his competence doesn't 

21 go to his guilt either. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is it your position 

23 that any time a petitioner raises an ineffective 

24 assistance of counsel claim, the habeas proceeding can 

potentially be stayed indefinitely?

8  MR. MICHELMAN: It's -- where it's truly 

9 suggested on the record that the petitioner could help, 

if competent, so that we wouldn't be engaging in 

11 imaginative speculation or claims that were purely 

12 record based. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what -- it's a 

14 truly suggested by the record standard?

 MR. MICHELMAN: Well, I would say that --

16 that it would be suggested by the record. I'm not sure 

17 the adverb "truly" is necessary, but -- you know. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, how is 

19 it compared to a motion to dismiss standard?

1 Honor. Probably the plausibility standard would 

2 actually be somewhat analogous, although --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now we've gone 

4 from plausible to truly -- plausible -- well, truly 

suggested by the record. I mean, suggested by the
 

6 record might be plausible.
 

7  It seems to me that it's a pretty loose
 

8 standard that entitles the defendant to a stay.
 

9  MR. MICHELMAN: Well, that -- but that --

that's not the only criterion, Mr. Chief Justice. It 

11 would be not only that it was suggested by the record 

12 that it was a potentially meritorious claim, as the --

13 as the district court found and the standard this Court 

14 endorsed in Rhines, but also that the petitioner is 

genuinely incompetent. This doesn't happen very often. 

16  In fact, in the state's amicus brief 

17 discussing how, in -- in their characterization, this 

18 type of litigation has exploded in the Ninth Circuit, in 

19 their characterization, they pointed only to nine cases 

in the past nine years, so -- and not all of those 

21 resulted in --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't what you're 

23 proposing just a mechanism that will permit stays in 

24 virtually every capital case, if that's what the 

petitioner wants -- if that's what petitioner's counsel

1 wants? 

2  Let's say you have a case where there is a 

3 small amount of mitigating evidence about the 

4 petitioner's childhood, but not enough to -- to sway 

the -- the sentencing authority. It's alleged that if 

6 the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was 

7 competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more 

8 information about what went on during his childhood 

9 years; and, therefore, the -- the proceeding has to be 

stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to 

11 confidence or he dies, as happened in Rees. 

12  What do you do with that situation? 

13  MR. MICHELMAN: Justice Alito, I think 

14 district courts have a wide amount of discretion in that 

matter, and they could say, well, it looks like there is 

16 a little evidence here, but based on what I think you 

17 could tell me, I don't think there is enough. 

18  Here, by contrast, the district court did 

19 find that Mr. -- Mr. Carter's competent assistance was 

necessary. So I think we have to trust the district 

21 courts to be gatekeepers --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: So if the -- if the district 

23 court says, well, there's a little bit here, and I can't 

24 rule out the possibility that there might be a lot more 

that's locked in the petitioner's mind, but he is unable

1 to provide it because he is incompetent, then I'm going 

2 to grant a stay until he is restored to competence; and 

3 then that would be insulated from being overturned on 

4 appeal by abuse of discretion standard. That's what 

you're arguing? 

6  MR. MICHELMAN: That's -- that's correct, 

7 Justice Alito. That would be something --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that is 

9 consistent with AEDPA? That Congress, knowing, in 

particular, that a lot of district judges and a lot of 

11 court of appeals judges don't like the death penalty and 

12 will go to some length to prevent the imposition of that 

13 sentence, that we're just going to leave that all to the 

14 discretion of every individual district judge?

 MR. MICHELMAN: I think it is consistent 

16 with AEDPA, Your Honor, because of this Court's recent 

17 jurisprudence in Martinez, in Holland, in Rhines, which 

18 make clear that AEDPA did not pursue finality at all 

19 cost. It did not eliminate the discretion, the 

equitable discretion of the district courts that they 

21 traditionally enjoyed, as this Court stated in Holland. 

22  And as this Court stated in Martinez, the 

23 Court is concerned that there could be claims that no 

24 court will have heard, not the state court, not the 

Federal court.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Michelman, we -- we 

2 have established a different standard for the degree of 

3 competence that has to exist in order to prevent 

4 execution, right? The -- the prisoner has to be aware 

of what is being done and why it's being done. 

6  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a much lower 

8 standard than the standard of competence required for 

9 deciding whether he can assist counsel, right?

 MR. MICHELMAN: It's a different standard, 

11 Justice Scalia. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- no, it's a 

13 much -- it's a much easier standard for the state to 

14 establish.

 MR. MICHELMAN: Well, it could be easier in 

16 some cases, but harder than others. Mental -- mental 

17 health science is complex, so one might be competent 

18 to because --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. All he has to 

know to prevent -- to prevent execution is he has to 

21 know that he's being executed for a crime, right?

3 Justice Scalia. The test --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just make believe 

that I'm right about that, okay? 

6  (Laughter.) 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: That there are two 

8 standards, and one is really quite more difficult than 

9 the other. Why isn't the difference between the 

standards utterly eliminated? Because whenever there is 

11 a capital case, a habeas petition is filed, and counsel 

12 says, my -- my client cannot -- cannot -- cannot assist 

13 me. Oh, yes, he understands why he's being executed, 

14 but he may have a new claim, he may be able to tell me 

stuff, so we have to stay the execution indefinitely 

16 until he can assist -- assist me in -- in continuing his 

17 defense. 

18  You've just converted the standard for 

19 proceeding with the execution from an easier one to a 

much more difficult one. 

21  MR. MICHELMAN: I -- I don't think that's 

22 true, Justice Scalia, because the -- the two standards 

23 are different and for different purposes. So there 

24 could be individuals who meet one and not the other. 

It's not -- it's not an either/or choice.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then -- but then you 

2 are fighting the -- the arguendo assumption. 

3  Let's assume that the Ford standard -- the 

4 standard for competence should be executed, is more 

lenient, less -- less forgiving than competence to 

6 assist counsel. Let's assume that. Then Justice Scalia 

7 has to be right. You've -- you've simply eliminated the 

8 Ford standard altogether. 

9  MR. MICHELMAN: Not necessarily, Your Honor, 

because even if one is easier --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: At least only -- only in 

12 cases where the competence -- the claim of incompetence 

13 is genuine. I mean, if anyone says, oh, I want to 

14 make -- take advantage of the more defendant-friendly 

standard, all I have to do is allege I'm incompetent. 

16  But that's not the case. He has to be --

17 there has to be a hearing that determines he is, indeed, 

18 incompetent. So - and -- and most defendants I don't 

19 think would be able to establish that they are, indeed, 

incompetent. 

21  MR. MICHELMAN: That's right, 

22 Justice Ginsburg. We -- our standard builds in the 

23 assumption that there will be mental health experts that 

24 will testify to the condition of the petitioner.

 So the petitioner can't simply select a

1 standard and declare that he meets it. He would have to 

2 satisfy mental health professionals that he meets that 

3 standard, whether it's competency to be executed or 

4 competency for these purposes. And so that will --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mental health experts 

6 always agree, don't they? Those provided by the defense 

7 always agree with those provided by the prosecution. 

8 Yes. 

9  (Laughter.)

 MR. MICHELMAN: I understand sometimes 

11 that's not true, Justice Scalia, but that's -- that's 

12 why we rely on the district courts to do what they do 

13 every day in the trial competency context and adjudicate 

14 conflicting claims about a petitioner's mental 

competence --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Am I -- am I -- is it 

17 correct that the petitioners in both cases -- pardon me, 

18 that the criminal defendants in both cases here, the 

19 Respondents, have all but conceded that there is no 

Constitutional basis for the right to competency during 

21 habeas, or am I overstating that? 

22  MR. MICHELMAN: I don't think you are, 

23 Justice Kennedy, though I won't speak for Mr. Gonzales. 

24  Mr. Carter does not press a Constitutional 

argument here, only the argument that a district court's

1 discretion, which the State of Ohio recognizes, to stay 

2 habeas proceedings should cover --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you concede the 

4 Constitutional point, so that there's no fundamental 

unfairness, then it seems to me that -- that you have 

6 all but given away your case. 

7  MR. MICHELMAN: Well, I don't think there 

8 needs to be Constitutional unfairness for there to be 

9 unfairness. For instance, this Court's opinion in 

Martinez --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's fairness that's 

12 not fundamental -- or --

13  MR. MICHELMAN: Well --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's unfairness that's not 

fundamental. 

16  MR. MICHELMAN: I think Martinez v. Ryan is 

17 an excellent illustration of that point, 

18 Justice Kennedy, because, there, the Court held -- not 

19 that there was a Sixth Amendment right to effective 

assistance of counsel at the habeas stage, but that 

21 ineffective assistance on initial review collateral 

22 proceedings could provide cause and prejudice to 

23 overcome a procedural default, in order that the 

24 petitioner would not lose his claim, and that -- to 

prevent a situation where no court would hear the claim

1 before he was executed. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in that 

3 case, the -- the whole basis of the analysis was that, 

4 although it was collateral, it really was the first 

opportunity to raise a particular claim. 

6  You say that, earlier, that trial judges do 

7 this all the time in the trial context. It's an 

8 important distinction in our jurisprudence if there's a 

9 difference in terms of the rights to which you are 

entitled preconviction and post-conviction. 

11  MR. MICHELMAN: That's -- that's correct, 

12 Mr. Chief Justice. But if the facts haven't been 

13 presented -- and here what the district court found was 

14 there were facts missing, facts that were exclusively 

within Mr. Carter's knowledge. 

16  They weren't presented to the state court, 

17 they haven't been available to either the state court or 

18 the Federal court, so it's possible this man could be 

19 executed and no one could have fully heard these 

potentially meritorious claims. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your -- what 

22 is your limit? You think there is no limit on the 

23 inherent authority, that these things can go on and on? 

24 Or as -- I mean, your -- your friend on the other side 

suggested, 1 year as a presumption? Do you have any

1 limit? 

2  MR. MICHELMAN: Well, we -- we would leave 

3 it, in the first place, to the district court's 

4 discretion. We -- as far as the question of indefinite 

stays go, we agree with the State of Ohio that most 

6 competency issues are resolved within a matter of 

7 months. So we can expect --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not this one because 

9 the claim is he was never competent; isn't that so? He 

wasn't competent to stand trial, and he never --

11  MR. MICHELMAN: That's --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And his mental condition 

13 never improved. So this person, if -- if the -- the 

14 standard is he's got to be competent, the likelihood is 

he will never be competent because he wasn't even, 

16 according to him, competent at the time he was tried. 

17  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And 

18 this -- this would be a rare case in which a stay might 

19 need to be more than 6 months, 9 months, a year. But 

because most -- most situations, the competency issue 

21 will resolve in a short period of time, this Court 

22 shouldn't fear that it's opening the floodgates to long 

23 stays in many, many cases. 

24  There -- this is a rare case with a very 

severely ill man, with potentially meritorious claims

2 that --

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why can't the 

4 competency -- why can't the issue of competency at trial 

be resolved? 

6  MR. MICHELMAN: Well, because the issue --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: You have to be competent 

8 during the habeas proceeding in order to assist in 

9 proving that he was -- that he was incompetent at the 

time of trial? 

11  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Alito. And 

12 that's because the competency question at this point is 

13 retrospective. We're not talking -- it's not a matter 

14 of simply examining Mr. Carter today and saying, How do 

you feel? What do you experience? Are you hearing the 

16 voice of the devil? 

17  But it's a question of was he doing that 

18 during his trial 14 years ago? And that's why it's 

19 important that he be able to participate now.

 What the Sixth Circuit ordered in this case 

21 was a remand for a narrow stay with appropriate 

22 monitoring by the district court, to make sure that this 

23 didn't become -- just sit around on the docket for years 

24 with nobody looking at it.

4  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.


 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How in the world --

6 I mean --

7  MR. MICHELMAN: With respect to the 

8 underlying claim. That's the question. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. How is a --

do mental health professionals make those determinations 

11 on a regular basis? 

12  MR. MICHELMAN: I understand that they do, 

13 Your Honor. I understand it is possible for a person 

14 with a psychosis to recover and have memories of 

experiences during that psychosis. Now, I admit that's 

16 not a fact in -- in the record, but that's something 

17 that, if we're dispositive, could be established on 

18 remand in this case. 

19  So it's because of the -- the rarity of 

these claims, because they are not going to come up 

21 every day, and because district courts exist as strong 

22 checkpoints to prevent non-genuine claims of competence 

23 or not potentially meritorious claims for which the 

24 petitioner's assistance is necessary, a narrow stay

6 is there any issue that could be argued, despite the 

7 incompetence? 

8  MR. MICHELMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what -- what are 

those? 

11  MR. MICHELMAN: Well, in this case -- and I 

12 think it really illustrates the narrowness of -- of the 

13 Sixth Circuit's order. In this case, he had, for 

14 example, claims about the jury instructions. He had 

claims about prosecutorial misconduct. He has a claim 

16 about the method of execution that the State of Ohio 

17 uses. 

18  These claims may go forward because they 

19 don't require his assistance. And it's -- it's a 

measure of the Sixth Circuit's moderation and discretion 

21 that they held that only the claims that genuinely 

22 require his assistance should be stayed; the others may 

23 go forward with the help of the next friend.

the value is to wait for the Ford analysis or the Ford 

6 examination to the time of execution? 

7  MS. SCHIMMER: We think there are a few 

8 values, Justice Sotomayor. First of all is that the

17 you seem to be saying. 

18  MS. SCHIMMER: No. But even if the 

19 implementation of that sentence is ultimately 

forestalled by a Ford ruling, that's true in a dignitary 

21 sense, but it's also true in a practical sense, meaning 

22 the State should not -- if somebody regains competence

8 in the record, typical sort of situation -- but assuming 

9 that there is some basis to believe that the defendant

11 should that be -- that door be shut? 

12  MS. SCHIMMER: Well, again, Your Honor --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And how do you deal with 

14 his answer that, if the claim is not a new claim, but 

just new information about an old claim, that he will be 

16 barred from a successive petition? 

17  MS. SCHIMMER: Right. Well, we still don't 

18 see how that has any traction in a case like this where, 

19 whether competent or not competent, 2254(d) and 

Pinholster say this claim -- all of these claims were 

21 adjudicated on the merits in state court and, therefore, 

22 no new evidence can be considered by the Federal court.
