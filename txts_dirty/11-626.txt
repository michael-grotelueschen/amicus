3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 11-626, Lozman v. The City of Riviera 

Beach. 

6  Mr. Fisher. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  To be a vessel, a structure must be 

12 practically capable of maritime transportation, and this 

13 case turns on how to assess such practical capability. 

14  And that's a question this Court answered 

over a century ago in Cope and Perry, explaining that 

16 practical capability depends not on any physical 

17 attribute the structure might have, but rather, on "its 

18 purpose," that is, whether its function is to move 

19 people or things across water.

 And that test has been applied numerous 

21 times before and since, across decades, providing 

22 stability and overall coherence to general maritime law. 

23  And of course --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: You should have phrased the 

test that way then, because it really --

1  MR. FISHER: Pardon me? 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me a 

3 very felicitous description of what -- of what the test 

4 is -- is enunciated to be.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: The test is whether it's, 

7 what, practically able? 

8  MR. FISHER: Practically capable. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Practically capable. Well, 

you could be practically capable of doing something, 

11 even though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up 

12 has nothing to do with that. 

13  MR. FISHER: Well, that's not what this 

14 Court -- case is saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. I'm just 

16 saying we ought to get a different test, and let's --

17 let's get rid of this. If we agree with you, let's get 

18 rid of this practically capable test, because 

19 practically capable, frankly, would make us come out the 

other way in this case. 

21  MR. FISHER: With all due respect, I don't 

22 think that's correct. In Evansville in 1926, this Court 

23 used that exact phrase, practical capability. And it 

24 assessed that practical capability by looking at "the 

function of the structure."

1  Again and again, in Evansville and other
 

2 cases, this Court asked, was the function of the
 

3 structure to carry people or things across water.
 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just
 

has -- I understand that argument. It's got no 

6 connection whatever to the statutory language, right? 

7  MR. FISHER: Well, I think the word capable 

8 obviously is in the statute. And what this Court said 

9 as recently as Stewart is that capable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Capable is in the 

11 statute, purpose is not, right? 

12  MR. FISHER: Correct. 

13  And what this Court said in Stewart is that 

14 capable means practically capable, not theoretically 

capable. There's a range of how broad the word capable 

16 can be. 

17  And again, going back over a century, every 

18 single time this Court's been confronted with that 

19 question, it's used the term function to describe 

whether or not something is practically capable of 

21 carrying people or things over water. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you described 

23 cases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited 

24 the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that 

says floating homes like the one here that can be towed

1 and are not in the business of carrying people or goods, 

2 but can be towed miles across the water, that those 

3 constitute vessels. 

4  And this district court decision, 

Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases. And you say 

6 that that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were 

7 wrong? 

8  MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I think 

9 there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can --

that I hope I can straighten out at the outset. 

11  The term floating home is generally 

12 described to mean a residence that is designed to sit 

13 still and is not designed to carry people or things over 

14 water.

 The term houseboat is something that is 

16 self-propelled, generally moves people or things over 

17 water. 

18  What happened in the Sea Village Marina 

19 case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the 

wrong term. It cited a lot of cases that held that 

21 houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that 

22 is designed to move its owner and the owner's things 

23 from here to there, are vessels. And we don't dispute 

24 that.

 But on the other hand, you have something

1 called floating homes, which the brief filed by the 

2 Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a 

3 very thorough description of what a floating home is and 

4 how it's different.

 And a primary way that it's different is 

6 that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its 

7 function, it's doing its job when it's moving things 

8 from place to place, a floating home can't function when 

9 it's out in the water being towed. None of the 

utilities work, none of the power, no equipment is 

11 aboard to do anything --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in -- in your 

13 brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times 

14 on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely 

moored. 

16  Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not 

17 quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this 

18 magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully 

19 destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the 

dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and 

21 that it could leave within 30 minutes notice. Is that 

22 indefinitely moored? And if the answer is yes, is that 

23 because of subjective intent of the owner? 

24  MR. FISHER: Justice Kennedy, it would be 

indefinitely moored. That's the term this Court used in

1 Stewart to describe whether something was being used to 

2 transport people or goods. 

3  It had said -- I have to emphasize that some 

4 of the assumptions we do in fact dispute in your 

hypothetical. But the fact that it sat still for three 

6 years performing its function as a stationary residence 

7 shows that it was indefinitely moored. 

8  The importance of indefinite mooring, 

9 though, I want to emphasize, is actually less important 

in this case than it might be if this were a dead ship 

11 case, where you had something that was concededly a 

12 vessel --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose --

14  MR. FISHER: -- in the question --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you know the law school 

16 game, suppose it was moved every month. 

17  MR. FISHER: It would still not be a vessel. 

18 And you don't have to look any further than this Court's 

19 Evansville case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That would be indefinitely 

21 moored, in your view? 

22  MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure if you'd use 

23 the term indefinitely moored at that point, but it 

24 certainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because 

look at this Court's Evansville case. The structure --

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get to
 

2 Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one
 

3 thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square.
 

4 Then -- then it starts to look more like a boat. It
 

moves around more frequently. 

6  Its mooring -- I mean, if you have a 

7 sailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for 

8 water and plug in for power. It doesn't seem to me to 

9 be terribly significant.

 MR. FISHER: I think that's right if you 

11 start with something that is a vessel; the fact that you 

12 simply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take 

13 away vessel status. That's what this Court held in 

14 Stewart.

 But if you start with something that isn't a 

16 vessel -- and I give you the Roper case, which did have 

17 a raked bow; it was an old Liberty ship that everybody 

18 agreed had been decommissioned and turned into a 

19 non-vessel. Then, they brought it in, they towed 

it -- Justice Ginsburg, they towed it -- they loaded it 

21 up with grain. Towed it again, let it sit still for a 

22 couple years, towed it back, unloaded the grain. And 

23 this Court said, it's not a vessel. 

24  And why did this Court say it's not a 

vessel? And I will quote from the opinion. It said:

1 "Because unlike a barge, the Harry Lane was not moved in 

2 order to transport commodities from one place to 

3 another; it served as a mobile warehouse performing its 

4 function of storing grain." In the Evansville's case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I -- can 

6 I -- I have been lost even as I have read the briefs, 

7 because there's a lot of terminology that I'm not sure 

8 -- and standards that have been proposed that -- what 

9 concepts they're tied to, okay?

 As I see our cases, I'm -- I'm not quite 

11 sure where indefinitely moored came from. I've seen the 

12 word permanently moored. 

13  You seem to be suggesting a difference 

14 between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get 

the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties 

16 to the concept of purpose. 

17  Does it -- does the permanent status or 

18 indefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a 

19 structure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get 

layered on top of mooring? 

21  MR. FISHER: No. Purpose is the overall 

22 question. The way where --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it applies to 

24 whether something is permanently moored or floating on 

the sea?

1  MR. FISHER: That helps you determine its 

2 purpose. So the word -- where the word indefinite comes 

3 from, Justice Sotomayor, is from the Stewart case, where 

4 this Court cited the Fifth Circuit's Pavone case with 

approval, which had held that an indefinitely moored 

6 floating casino was not a vessel. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: I just don't see how you can 

8 get purpose into this statutory language. It says 

9 nothing about purpose. It says, capable of being used 

as a means of transportation on water. How does purpose 

11 get in there? Whose purpose are we talking about? 

12  MR. FISHER: We're talking about an 

13 objective purpose, Justice Alito --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then you're not 

talking about purpose; you're talking about function, 

16 right? You're just using purpose as a kind of strange 

17 synonym for function. 

18  But you're not talking about purpose of 

19 either the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat. 

You're just saying what does this -- or what does this 

21 thing, this floating home, do. 

22  MR. FISHER: Exactly. And I'm doing -- if I 

23 can just say this directly, I'm trying to do exactly 

24 what this Court did in Cope and Evansville and Roper. 

The exact analysis this Court applied in those cases is

1 precisely what we want this Court to apply here. But I 

2 think what we're --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about that 

4 definition? That definition comes from the Rules of 

Construction Act, right --

6  MR. FISHER: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which provides the 

8 meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the 

9 United States Code. Okay?

 MR. FISHER: Correct. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what meaning of 

12 vessel in the United States Code is at issue here? 

13  MR. FISHER: The word vessel in the Maritime 

14 Lien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum, 

assertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this 

16 case. So the word vessel is -- is its jurisdictional 

17 and substantive hook. 

18  Justice Sotomayor, if I can return to your 

19 question about indefinite mooring, the importance of 

indefinite mooring in this case, where you have 

21 something that was not a vessel to begin with, is simply 

22 to ask whether it's been transformed into a vessel, 

23 exactly as this Court asked in Roper. So is it being 

24 used for its function for which it was created and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Aren't you just

1 begging the question? You keep saying it was not a 

2 vessel to begin with. Why -- doesn't it just restate 

3 the question? 

4  MR. FISHER: I'm not trying to beg the 

question; I'm just trying to describe our argument to 

6 you. There are some cases where --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't your 

8 argument beg the question? 

9  MR. FISHER: I hope not. I'm trying to 

distinguish between two lines of cases, one being where 

11 you have things that were -- like the Roper case, that 

12 were made as boats, as vessels undisputedly, and now the 

13 question is whether they've been pulled out of 

14 navigation; as opposed to another set of cases, which we 

believe this falls into, where the question itself is 

16 whether this was ever a vessel. In those kinds of 

17 cases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used 

18 for its function. 

19  It hasn't -- for example, if I could give a 

hypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of 

21 floating dock. Now, under their test, that would be a 

22 vessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with 

23 stuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that 

24 as a makeshift barge.

 But no maritime case has ever held that a

1 floating dock is a vessel. But if somebody did that, 

2 then it would no longer be indefinitely moored and would 

3 be using a different function and might be transformed 

4 into a --

JUSTICE ALITO: I think you may -- you may 

6 very well have a good argument, but if you're relying 

7 either on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've 

8 lost me. I don't see how they get -- how you get those 

9 into the words of the statute.

 Suppose you have a boat, and it's tied up at 

11 the harbor here in Washington. It hasn't been moved for 

12 five years. It's indefinitely moved -- or 10 years or 

13 20 years. But if it's capable, if you could untie it 

14 and sail it out into the river, doesn't it fall within 

the definition? 

16  MR. FISHER: It absolutely does because the 

17 function of a boat is to move people or things over 

18 water. So when it's sitting still, Justice Alito, it's 

19 not performing its function.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. So you are really 

21 talking about a function test. And you are using 

22 strange words, because they come out of our opinions --

23 kind of not your fault. But you're really saying that 

24 what should apply here is a function test.

 We are looking at this floating home. What

1 does it do? Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a 

2 thing that transports things over water. 

3  Isn't that your test? 

4  MR. FISHER: Yes, it is. In addition --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it changes -- one 

6 -- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a 

7 boat. You've got a casino that's tied up for a month. 

8 During that time, it's not a boat. And then they move 

9 it around to go to the other side of the river, and 

during that time it is a boat? 

11  MR. FISHER: No, this Court in Stewart 

12 rejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just 

13 described. 

14  The question is whether what -- whether it 

has the function of moving people and things over water 

16 or not. Now, some casinos go up and down the river --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I'm just 

18 -- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was 

19 meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do 

both, and how do we tell which it is --

21  MR. FISHER: If it actually does the latter 

22 and is performing its function while moving, then it is 

23 a vessel. And that's what this Court held in Stewart. 

24 There's not a primary purpose test.

 If one of its purposes is to move people or 

15

1 things over water, then it's a vessel. But that's not 

2 the purpose of a floating home. That's not the purpose 

3 of a floating restaurant or something else that might 

4 be float --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we know that. 

6  MR. FISHER: But you could tie it up and 

7 move it. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: How do we know that, Mr. 

9 Fisher? I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a 

poor man's houseboat, right? That the point of getting 

11 a floating home is actually to have a home that you can 

12 hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so 

13 you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all 

14 the time or have the capacity to move it all the time, 

but when you want to move it on water and when you want 

16 to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity 

17 to do so. 

18  MR. FISHER: Well, with all due respect, 

19 Justice Kagan, that's not why people have floating 

homes. The amicus brief explains that. Don't look 

21 at -- but you don't have to look any further than the 

22 history of this. The only two times it moved any 

23 significant distance were: One, when it changed 

24 ownership; and two, when a hurricane struck, so it had 

to be moved.

1  And look at your own cases. In Pavone, 

2 which this Court cited with approval in Stewart, that 

3 structure moved hundreds of miles over several years. 

4 This Court said not a vessel. The structure in 

Evansville moved three different ways. It moved up and 

6 down the Mississippi-Ohio River as it changed ownership 

7 several times over the course of 14 years. It also 

8 moved every winter to avoid the ice that would come in. 

9 And thirdly it was repositioned on literally almost a 

daily basis to accord with the stages of the river. And 

11 again, applying this Court's well settled function test, 

12 this Court said that's not a vessel. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it was still -- it was 

14 still tied to the land with roads and ramps and so 

forth. Here you've got the hose and the extension cord 

16 and the rope. 

17  MR. FISHER: Well, the important --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems -- and it 

19 seems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some 

universal definition of we know what a floating home is. 

21 Suppose this -- suppose there were -- another owner of a 

22 structure like this, and it moved to a different slip 

23 every week to get more shade or more wind or something.

3 say one more thing before I reserve my time. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose it moved --

suppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or 

6 worse weather during different seasons. 

7  MR. FISHER: If it's simply being 

8 repositioned and not being used for a transportation 

9 purpose, that is to move people or things, then it's not 

a vessel. And that's exactly what this Court --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I have the same 

12 problem Justice Kagan says. The whole point is that it 

13 can move. That's the whole -- that's the reason you 

14 have it.

 MR. FISHER: That is not the point, 

16 Justice Kennedy, with all due respect. There's a 

17 difference between a floating home and a houseboat, and 

18 I urge you to look at the briefs on this point. 

19  And this comes right back to your 

question --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, outside of your 

22 floating home, what other structures would be kept out 

23 of your definition of purpose or function and the city's 

24 definition of practically capable? Can you imagine any 

other function that's out there floating around?

9 establishments, floating pieces, floating docks,
 

floating trampolines and play structures. 

11  And, Justice Kennedy, if I could just answer 

12 your question and reserve the rest of my time. The 

13 importance of the connecting of the utilities and the 

14 water hose, which was actually a specialized water hose, 

not a garden hose, but the importance of those 

16 connections is found in State codes across the country 

17 that distinguish between floating homes and houseboats, 

18 asking whether they're dependent on those connections to 

19 operate.

 A floating home cannot function if it's not 

21 tied to land. It doesn't matter how many amps we want 

22 to fight about, it's whether it needs that power from 

23 land, whether it needs those connections to land. A 

24 houseboat, like any other vessel, can fully function 

away from port.

7  MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

8 please the Court: 

9  I think if I could start with Justice 

Kagan's questions, the government's position is that 

11 this is an objective function test and in evaluating 

12 when a structure is practically capable of being used as 

13 a means of transportation this Court has repeatedly 

14 recognized that function is important to that inquiry.

 It did so as recently as Stewart, when it 

16 recognized that the function of the dredge there was to 

17 carry crew and equipment across Boston Harbor in the 

18 course of dredging a trench. 

19  It also did so in the cases that 

Petitioner's counsel has already talked about, 

21 Evansville, Roper --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I 

23 interrupt you just there on the dredging? You say the 

24 function of the dredge was to carry people and 

equipment. I would have said the function of the -- the

2  MR. GANNON: Well, the Court --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right? And so --

4 and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems 

to me that that function test is a very difficult one to 

6 apply. 

7  MR. GANNON: Well, the Court in Stewart said 

8 that "dredges" -- and I'm quoting from page 492 --

9 "serve a waterborne transportation function, because 

they carry crew and equipment across" --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know what it 

12 said. I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a 

13 waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I 

14 would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle 

of the river is its purpose is to move people and 

16 equipment. I would say its purpose is to dredge. 

17  MR. GANNON: Well, but in general, it needs 

18 to dredge not just in one place, because it's not just 

19 dredging a hole, it's dredging a trench. It usually 

needs to move in order to do that. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know but 

22 that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I 

23 agree with that. But its purpose is still to dredge, 

24 not to move.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the Court --

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could use it if 

2 you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right? 

3 Any equipment you need to move, you put it on another 

4 boat and drop it off. The people who work, you bring 

them over and drop it off. 

6  MR. GANNON: Yeah, I think that you could do 

7 that. I think that's typically not the way the dredges 

8 that -- not the way the superscoop works in Stewart and 

9 it's not the way historic dredges worked in the case 

of --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure it is, isn't 

12 it? I mean, the superscoop doesn't go to the -- maybe 

13 it does -- go to the shore every morning, then come 

14 right out again? They move people back and forth with 

other boats, don't they? 

16  MR. GANNON: Oh, but I -- what I meant is 

17 that there are people and equipment on the superscoop 

18 when it is moving across Boston Harbor. They didn't 

19 sort of take it out there all empty every morning and 

then load other things on to it that they -- that they 

21 brought out there. 

22  And in Evansville, the Court recognized that 

23 the wharf boat there, which is a large structure -- it 

24 was 240 feet long, 48 feet wide -- it served as an 

office, a warehouse, and a wharf on the side of the

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose someone builds a 

replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the 

6 kind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used 

7 throughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is 

8 to display it in a museum, no one has any intention 

9 whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's 

built so that if they did, it would -- it would function 

11 just like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel? 

12  MR. GANNON: I think that that would be a 

13 vessel, because it really -- its objective function, if 

14 you look at its design and its natural function --

that's just the phrase that the -- even Respondent's law 

16 professor amici used. They acknowledged that the 

17 function and purpose test is appropriate if it takes 

18 account of the craft's own design and natural function. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- I thought 

there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases, 

21 maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just 

22 like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently --

23 they use the word "indefinite." I think they mean 

24 "permanently."

 MR. GANNON: Well, the Court --

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: But if it is permanently 

2 moored to the shore and is never going to sea again, 

3 then it isn't a vessel. 

4  MR. GANNON: That's true. That's because 

it's no --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Then if the Polynesian boat 

7 is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective 

8 evidence of that, it would not be a vessel. But if it's 

9 something they really could well take out on the sea, 

then it is, is that right? 

11  MR. GANNON: It is true that the Court 

12 recognized in Stewart and the Coast Guard's craft 

13 routinely operated dockside policy is based upon the 

14 presumption that something that used to be a vessel can 

cease to be a vessel if it is semi-permanently or 

16 indefinitely moored. That's the phrase that the Court 

17 quoted in Stewart. And the Court recognized that even 

18 something that's anchored to the seabed could --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't come up here. 

That concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach 

21 and used as a hotel. 

22  MR. GANNON: And the Queen Mary is behind 

23 a -- is essentially behind a cofferdam. It doesn't have 

24 ready access to open water. It's connected to shore in 

all sorts of permanent ways. We don't think that that's

1 the type of case that we have here, because nobody is 

2 saying that this once was a vessel and it is now no 

3 longer one just because it's tied up to the dock in the 

4 way that it was tied up here.

 And so, Justice Kennedy, we think that this 

6 isn't really a case about indefinite mooring as making 

7 the difference. This is a case where you need to start 

8 with the question of was it ever a vessel. And 

9 if the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I was right. So that 

11 permanent mooring is a different inquiry in your mind? 

12  MR. GANNON: Well, permanent mooring is 

13 usually going to be relevant to the question of whether 

14 something ceases to be a vessel, as it's no longer 

practically capable of being used as a means of 

16 transportation. That's the way the Court discussed the 

17 point in Stewart. And -- and that's true even for a 

18 case like Roper, which was a former Liberty ship that 

19 was towed up and down the James River.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a -- that's 

21 a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was 

22 removed or something was removed that made it --

23  MR. GANNON: Well, there were things that 

24 had been removed when it had been decommissioned 

originally. But if the court of appeals test were used

25

Official 

1 here and the court were to conclude that something is a 

2 vessel, if it is merely capable of being towed across 

3 water even to its detriment, then you can't explain the 

4 answer in cases like Evansville or in Roper where --

because the Evansville wharf boat was towed at least ten 

6 times, as described in pages 21 and 22 of the Court's 

7 opinion, and nobody was asking whether it had all 

8 the office furniture and light fixtures and things like 

9 that removed when it was towed at least twice a year for 

the seven years before that suit began. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Gannon, you think 

12 that even at the moment that the thing is being 

13 transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know, 

14 various furniture and things on it, you think even at 

that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not 

16 be a vessel? 

17  MR. GANNON: That's generally going to be 

18 true, yes. If the purpose of the structure, the 

19 function, the objective function of the structure is to 

operate, just to be stationary beside the dock, then 

21 it's not going to be a vessel even when it's being towed 

22 behind another vessel. There may still be rules about 

23 how it needs to be lit at night and things like that, 

24 but --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if it was more

Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without 

2 suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small 

3 waves, let's say? 

4  And the reason why it was built that way was 

so that when the person moves the person wouldn't have 

6 to hire a moving company to come with a van and take out 

7 all the person's personal belongings and ship those 

8 by -- by land. This -- this is capable of moving and 

9 moving all the stuff that's in it without having 

anything damaged. Would it be the same? What would be 

11 the result there? 

12  MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I understand the 

13 point. I think that, under a case like Evansville, that 

14 there does seem to be a difference between relocating 

the structure and using the structure to transport 

16 people and things. 

17  But under an objective function test, if it 

18 really is designed to be mobile, and we look at it and 

19 we say it really looks like a boat and it's designed to 

move through water efficiently, it would probably look 

21 different from this particular craft. 

22  But if ultimate mobility is part of the 

23 function of it, then -- then the answer could well be 

24 different.

 But, for the most part, I think my answer is

Official 

1 the same as I was trying to give to Justice Kagan, which 

2 is that this is either going to be a vessel all the time 

3 until it becomes so permanently moored that it should no 

4 longer be deemed a vessel.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I really just don't 

6 understand your answer. Mobility surely was a -- was a 

7 purpose of this because it was moved. 

8  MR. GANNON: Well, I --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: It can be moved.

 MR. GANNON: There is a question about 

11 practical capability of being used and --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Well, that's 

13 something different. 

14  MR. GANNON: And before, you were asking 

about the hook in the statute here. We do think that 

16 the word contrivance does indicate that it's something 

17 that has a function that's determinable. 

18  And there are lots of other areas in 

19 maritime law where the function of a vessel is a 

relevant question, and this is not an unanswerable 

21 inquiry. The court uses purpose and function when it's 

22 deciding whether somebody is a Jones Act seaman --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, would you 

24 have said sounds like this structure is not a vessel, 

period. But your bottom line in your brief is that, if

 MR. GANNON: We think that the record here 

6 was not really compiled with an object of answering 

7 these questions, the things that we think are relevant, 

8 because the district court and the Court of Appeals 

9 flatly rejected any inquiry into the purpose or function 

of the vessel. And --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what would we tell 

12 them they should look into? 

13  MR. GANNON: That they should look into the 

14 purpose and function of the vessel. They should also 

consider whether it would be damaged when it was towed. 

16 That was something that petitioner tried to get. He was 

17 proceeding pro se in the district court, offered to 

18 present evidence about --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: On the first question, 

purpose or function, what did they know that we can't 

21 know by looking at this picture and listening to these

2 let's -- let's assume. 

3  MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that 

4 somebody -- if somebody -- I can't tell everything about 

the structure. We have these pictures, and we know that 

6 it has a ten-inch draft, but we don't really know how --

7 how well it is that --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to be fair to the 

9 Court of Appeals, well, now, you tell us what the 

purpose and function is. 

11  MR. GANNON: And I -- if --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't we know that? 

13  MR. GANNON: Well, I think that you -- in --

14 this is going to be a somewhat idiosyncratic case. I 

think that this is an unusual structure. That's why the 

16 surveyor on page J-43 of the Joint Appendix found that 

17 there were no comparables for sale in the state of 

18 Florida. And so I think that most cases aren't really 

19 going to -- to be like this.

 But if I wanted to put on evidence about 

21 that, I would probably compare -- decide whether this is 

22 more like the floating homes that are described in the 

23 Seattle floating homes brief, that are really designed 

24 just to function in place near the shore. I think that 

there would be more evidence about its capabilities

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

7  MR. FREDERICK: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, 

8 and may it please the Court: 

9  The City brought this In Rem action against 

Mr. Lozman's uninsured houseboat to enforce maritime 

11 liens. The houseboat was in violation of the wet slip 

12 agreement, and it posed a hazard to other vessels in the 

13 marina if, because of its flimsy moorings, it came 

14 unmoored during a storm.

 The houseboat was located very close to the 

16 navigable channel of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway 

17 and next to a yacht-building facility next to the 

18 marina. So the city faced a very real specter of being 

19 sued if the uninsured houseboat came unmoored and caused 

damage. 

21  Our position is that the houseboat is a 

22 vessel under section 3 because it floats, moves, and 

23 carries people or things on water, as the statutory --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just like an inner 

tube, right?

6 most of the body parts of a person would be underwater 

7 and would be through the water, Mr. Chief Justice. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of those 

9 inflatable rafts where most of the parts of the 

people --

11  MR. FREDERICK: The test would be what's the 

12 practical capability, and a raft that has a bottom 

13 actually could very well be a vessel under the 

14 appropriate standard of practical capability.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This cup. What about the 

16 cup? 

17  MR. FREDERICK: Cup is not because a cup 

18 doesn't float. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, this is lighter 

than you think. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. How about a garage 

22 door? 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Take the inner tube and, you 

24 know, paste a couple of pennies on the inner tube. Now 

it carries things. There are things on the inner tube,

1 and it floats. 

2  MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kagan, I -- I think 

3 we could imagine all kinds of de minimis types of 

4 hypotheticals that would satisfy the basic criteria. 

But what the Court in Stewart said was practical 

6 capability as viewed in a real world sense. And I'm not 

7 aware of any case -- and they've certainly not pointed 

8 to anything -- that identifies anything with those kind 

9 of practical attributes that would be subject to 

litigation. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, practical 

12 capability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're 

13 about transportation -- you're talking about things that 

14 were built for transportation, right?

 MR. FREDERICK: You're -- yes. You're --

16 that is true in the sense that one of the purposes, as 

17 manifested through its physical characteristics, is the 

18 ability to be moved across water. 

19  And just as Mr. Lozman's houseboat here was 

moved 200 miles in the first towage after the hurricane 

21 wiped out every other vessel in the docks in the north 

22 bay marina, and he had it towed with a speed boat 

23 70 miles to the city of Riviera Beach, those physical 

24 characteristics and attributes were recognized by the 

Court of Appeals when it applied the practical

1 capability test. 

2  And it said on page 15(a) of the petition 

3 appendix that certainly living, a domicile, is a purpose 

4 of a floating home, but mobility is also a purpose, and 

then demonstrated that mobility here. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your definition, 

7 how do you deal with Evansville? 

8  MR. FREDERICK: Evansville is a case with 

9 many layers, but let me just start first start with the 

fact that the Court announced a practical capability 

11 test in Evansville itself. That's what it applied. It 

12 reviewed a district court record that had found no 

13 practical capability on the basis of the driveways and 

14 the more permanent connections to the utility system of 

the city, and it reviewed that factual record for clear 

16 error, which, of course, it didn't find, by --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you are basically 

18 saying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the 

19 wharf boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and 

there was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry 

21 people or things. It happened not to because they would 

22 empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it 

23 could have. 

24  So if it was practically capable of 

floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it

Official 

1 was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis. 

2 So are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the 

3 Evansville rule? 

4  MR. FREDERICK: No. In Stewart you said 

what the holding of the case was, which was that it was 

6 not practically capable of movement at the time that it 

7 sank. 

8  Now, I would like to just step back for a 

9 second because I think Evansville needs to be understood 

in the time in which it was decided. At that time, many 

11 courts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot 

12 test, what is happening to this particular watercraft at 

13 the moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where 

14 the contract ensues, and the like.

 This Court subsequently disavowed the 

16 snapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was 

17 to describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not 

18 practically capable of movement or carriage because of 

19 their connections to the land.

 In Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat 

21 also owned the adjoining land and had control over the 

22 dock and built driveways so that trucks could come on 

23 and off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the 

24 houseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf 

boat, which are not typically attributes one would think

1 of as ordinarily for vessels. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I got stopped here, 

3 back at Stewart. "Practically capable of maritime 

4 transport." Now, those are words I thought you have to 

interpret with some degree of common sense, and the 

6 reason for that is because each of us can of course 

7 imagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to --

8 to just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do 

9 with ships or vessels and really could be used 

theoretically to carry something on the water. 

11  So what we think of is that practical 

12 capability means that there must -- this must really 

13 have as a function, as one of its functions -- I'd like 

14 to say purpose, but some people apparently don't like 

that --

16  (Laughter.) 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: -- because it - it has some 

18 other implication that I don't understand. Okay. 

19  So call it the function or the capacity, and 

it really does as a significant matter of carrying 

21 things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its 

22 walls, but -- but things from place to place to some 

23 significant degree, okay? So I've just taken the words 

24 of the test and through voice -- and trying to focus 

your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a --

4 it's a way of getting you to respond to that.

 MR. FREDERICK: I think it certainly did 

6 have that. It had that capability, Justice Breyer, 

7 because it was actually moved on multiple occasions. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: But it wasn't carrying 

9 things.

 MR. FREDERICK: It was carrying his personal 

11 effects. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true. And of 

13 course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or 

14 it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or 

something that is on top. But when you have a thing 

16 that carries itself, that isn't good enough. 

17  MR. FREDERICK: I --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: It has to be something to 

19 do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.

 MR. FREDERICK: It transported his 

21 computers; it transported his clothes. Except for the 

22 fact that his guns were confiscated before the marshals 

23 took it --

house.

4 in his or her dwelling. And when the marshal towed it, 

it carried two people as part of the crew for the 

6 transit between --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Think of what 

8 it's doing and compare that with the dredge that every 

9 day the workmen get on, they go into the middle of 

Boston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they 

11 dredge. 

12 And so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of 

13 this boat is to carry those people out there. 

14  Now think of this one. This one is carrying 

things, but that which it carries is just what is part 

16 of a normal house which has nothing to do with 

17 transporting things on water. 

18  MR. FREDERICK: Well, actually, I think Mr. 

19 Fisher conceded that if this had a motor and it was 

carrying exactly the same personal effects, it would be 

21 a vessel.

21 was a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent 

22 of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once. 

23 They purchase the floating home and then they move it to 

24 the place where they want the home to be, and then it 

sits there. And this was just a clear evidence that,

1 you know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado, 

2 people do not move floating homes. They buy it, they 

3 move it to where they want to live, and then it sits. 

4  In that case, do you think the thing is a 

vessel? 

6  MR. FREDERICK: Yes, if it has the practical 

7 capability. That's what the statute says, Justice 

8 Kagan. It depends on if you want to rewrite the statute 

9 to have subjective intent --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's a statute --

11  MR. FREDERICK: -- of lots of vessel owners. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: You're reading the statute 

13 -- you're reading the statute as if it says something 

14 can be transported over water. But the statute doesn't 

say that. It says something can be used or capable of 

16 being used as a means of transportation on water. So 

17 that -- that the question is whether this thing is 

18 transporting other things over water, and whether that's 

19 its function; and in my hypothetical it's not its 

function. Its function is to serve as a house. That 

21 house happens to be on water, but it's just a house. 

22  MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kagan, the fact that 

23 a vessel only moves once doesn't mean that it's not a 

24 vessel if it has -- if it meets the attributes of the 

statute, as explained by this Court in Stewart, of

1 practical capability. The Titanic, of course, is a 

2 perfect example of that. 

3  The fact that a person may choose mobility 

4 as a -- as one of the attributes and not exercise that 

attribute of course goes to subjective intent, and as 

6 the Maritime Law Association's brief points out here, 

7 you do not want to apply an intent standard that goes to 

8 what the owner intends to -- which function the owner 

9 intends to exercise, because that leads to manipulation. 

And the casino --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, the city's 

12 position, it is whatever we want it to be. That is the 

13 first time Lozman was sued by the city. It was not 

14 under admiralty jurisdiction, it was a plain old 

landlord/tenant suit in State court, right? 

16  MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but there are some 

17 exceptions and if -- I will let you finish your 

18 question. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, well, my question 

is, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and 

21 just an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want 

22 it to be that way? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: No. I would answer that 

24 question as no.

1 very incident, that is he failed to comply with the 

2 revised rules and he was behind in his payment of 

3 dockage fees. Could the city have brought that case in 

4 an ordinary State court for the arrears?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? 

7  MR. FREDERICK: Because it's a vessel and 

8 the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United 

9 States courts means that it has to be litigated in the 

United States courts. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --

12  MR. FREDERICK: That's why in the first one, 

13 if I could just explain about the State court, because I 

14 think that there is some misapprehension about what 

happened. 

16  His dog was not complying with the 

17 ordinances, and he was not complying with the city 

18 ordinances; that's why -- that's why the city brought 

19 the in personam action against him in State court. 

There was no admiralty basis there. He was still paying 

21 all of his dockage services and fees. It became an in 

22 rem action when the lien was not being discharged 

23 through his payment on the dockage fees, and the city 

24 had a basis under the wet slip agreement to assert a 

maritime lien, which is a classic admiralty action under

2  So they are very different actions. Under 

3 the State court action he could still stay at the 

4 marina, but he had to be on a houseboat that complied 

with the marina's rules. He had two house boats at the 

6 marina, and this one was not in compliance, and that is 

7 why the city brought action against it. It was the only 

8 one of the 500-plus vessels and boats in this marina 

9 that wasn't in compliance with the rules.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- we want I suppose to 

11 give the courts of appeals a test that works. I -- see 

12 if this is, sums up your argument, or your position. 

13  You look to see the objective 

14 characteristic, the physical capacity of the -- of the 

structure, and then you look not to purpose but to its 

16 objective function: Does it carry goods under the 

17 statute. And then I suppose you could under that say 

18 that this is a vessel, but that this presumption is 

19 overcome if it's permanently moored in a way the 

Evansville dredge was. Is -- is that your argument? 

21  MR. FREDERICK: I think that sums up in a 

22 nutshell what we would regard as a proper statement of 

23 the law, of what this Court has already said, and that 

24 is that if it's got practical capability, those 

practical characteristics, Justice Kennedy, will

2 buy a domicile on land, one buys a house or a condo. If 

3 you buy a floating home, that has the attribute, the 

4 physical characteristics of floating, movage -- and 

moving and carriage --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: That's where - that's 

7 exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and 

8 you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with 

9 you at the moment hypothetically. So something's wrong 

somewhere. And what I'm thinking is that you could have 

11 very odd things, you know, like an advertising sign, 

12 floating advertising sign and tow it around. Is that 

13 floating advertising sign a vessel? No, it doesn't 

14 carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the 

figure which might move around; and then it does -- and 

16 Justice Kennedy said carrying goods. All right. Does 

17 this structure, this houseboat have a function of 

18 carrying goods? You're tempted to say yes, because his 

19 personal effects are in it. I'm attempted to say no, 

because there is nothing special about those personal 

21 effects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a 

22 similar structure on land. 

23  That's where I am wondering if there is a

1  MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, there is no 

2 basis, I mean, with all due respect, there is no basis 

3 in your cases to -- to hold that there is something 

4 about transportation that makes it somehow uniquely 

nautical or maritime as opposed to --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No, it's nothing --

7  MR. FREDERICK: -- household effects or 

8 other goods or services or people that are transported 

9 over land. And that's why when the normal definition of 

transportation is to convey a person or a thing from one 

11 place to another, that's perfectly satisfied under the 

12 facts of this case. And it is an undisputed record as 

13 Petitioner says, on page 27 of the cert petition, they 

14 ask for cert here for you to decide whether Mr. Lozman's 

state of mind about his indefinite mooring is somehow 

16 relevant to the definition of a vessel. It clearly 

17 isn't. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess the problem is 

19 the list of absurdities that they point to, not the 

least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about 

21 whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry 

22 docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but 

23 you can cut them and you can stick something on them and 

24 they can float away. Under -- so how do you --

stay in one place and they don't carry anything, so they 

6 don't meet the part of the test that requires carriage. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with 

8 the --

9  MR. FREDERICK: They are simply physical 

structures --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- trampoline and the 

12 other examples your adversary gave? Is a trampoline 

13 that floats on water capable of moving -- it's moving 

14 the trampoline.

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think it's 

16 practically capable of carrying anything. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's carrying the 

18 Trampoline. 

19  MR. FREDERICK: And again --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the difference 

21 whether I attach something permanently or temporarily to 

22 the top of the floating thing, the floating board, the 

23 floating whatever? 

24  MR. FREDERICK: Well, it would not be 

subject to towage. Here the houseboat had -- this is

1 important because the houseboat under the testimony Mr. 

2 Lozman elicited at trial had four towing cleats that 

3 were welded into the structure of his houseboat so that 

4 it could be towed without torquing and twisting the 

houseboat and causing it to sink. The hypotheticals 

6 that the other side has suggested don't have that 

7 additive feature of towing cleats that are used for the 

8 purpose of being able to convey the houseboat --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your 

example of the towing cleats highlights one of the 

11 difficulties I have; one, because obviously the question 

12 of, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats, 

13 and then what if they had the towing cleats and then 

14 took them off, what if they were temporary towing 

cleats. One of the things, this is a jurisdictional 

16 statute and we like jurisdictional statutes to be clear 

17 and easy of application. Why do you think your test is 

18 easier than your friend's test? 

19  MR. FREDERICK: Because the physical 

characteristics of this houseboat all point to the 

21 attributes of being a vessel. It floats, it moves, it 

22 carries. It's got nothing to do --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got -- it 

24 doesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most 

like a boat in my view is a raked bow. That tells you

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have a --

what are the things called on the side, the elevated 

6 sides that you'd look for in a boat. 

7  MR. FREDERICK: We would submit that 

8 Congress did not intend a you-know-it-when-you-see-it 

9 test. House barges, barges have been vessels since the 

time of Cleopatra. The fact that it is flat-bottomed 

11 and it floats and it moves and it carries things does 

12 not make it not a vessel. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, this is 

14 kind of an idiosyncratic case. There are many cases I 

think in the courts now about floating casinos. I take 

16 it on your definition the floating casino would be a 

17 vessel subject to maritime jurisdiction. 

18  MR. FREDERICK: Yes, unless it has a 

19 physical impediment that takes it out of one of the 

three attributes that doesn't make it a vessel. If --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: As long as the vessel 

22 stays in one place and the gambling goes on in one 

23 place, then it may be towed to a different location, and 

24 it stays there. You -- you say because it is able to be 

moved from one place to another it qualifies as a

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: With about -- aircraft 

8 carrier. But it's really fixed in there with regular 

9 walkways and so forth. Very -- it would cause a lot of 

work in order to move it. 

11  MR. FREDERICK: We suggest that the way the 

12 court should think about that problem is as a physical 

13 impediment. Are physical impediments preclude its moat 

14 movement or carriage or floating capacity --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Frederick, if that is 

16 the case, then your test really comes down to how 

17 securely is something fastened. I mean, you have to 

18 deal with Evansville's wharf boat and you have to deal 

19 with Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all 

these floating casinos and restaurants. And you're 

21 saying that in all these cases we are supposed to look 

22 to is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how 

23 quickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to 

24 end up being the test that you would have us adopt which 

is how easy it is to get out of the port.

3 one. The Belle of Orleans case --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: That really does become a 

jury question -- a question of fact for everything, 

6 right? You know, are there six cables, are there nine 

7 cables, what are they made of, you know, how long is it 

8 going to take to rip up the -- the I-beams, whatever? 

9  MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that as a 

practical matter, this arises in only a couple of 

11 instances and those are the casino boats, many of which 

12 were vessels and they traversed the rivers allowing 

13 people to gamble because that's how state laws required 

14 them to perform. And they have since stopped trying to 

be vessels because of state law changes that they were 

16 able to make. And so the question as a practical matter 

17 is are there physical impediments to the ability of that 

18 boat to -- to use the capability to move? The Star of 

19 India, which was referenced in the Belle of Orleans 

case, was not -- was a vessel, a sailing vessel from the 

21 19th century. In 1926 they took it out of commission as 

22 a sailing vessel and they towed it to San Diego, where 

23 it sat for 50 years tied to the dock, and for the 

24 bicentennial, they decided let's get the boat out and 

sail it and they sailed it for the bicentennial. The

1 Ninth Circuit held that's a vessel because it has the 

2 capability of being used as a vessel. And the fact that 

3 something is moored for a long time, if it has the 

4 physical attributes to be a vessel, it is a vessel. The 

United States -- the USS Constitution, the famous USS 

6 Constitution would be shocked to have heard Mr. Gannon's 

7 statement about vessel because there are 200 Navy 

8 service members who service the USS Constitution and 

9 take it out periodically for sail.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any problem here, 

11 which I think maybe the Coast Guard and the other people 

12 who are responsible for vessels, say once we start 

13 thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I 

14 overstate -- we're going to have an impossible time 

doing our job. I mean, you know, you are going to see 

16 some kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and 

17 somebody's going to start calling it a vessel. We've 

18 got to limit this somehow to things that really are used 

19 as vessels.

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a problem, and if 

22 so, how would you deal with it? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: If it were a problem the 

24 Coast Guard would have signed the Solicitor General's 

brief in this case which they have done in other cases

2 relevant like in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, United
 

3 States v. Locke, in which the Coast Guard --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is not very
 

compelling in this case because they have regulations 

6 that pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is 

7 saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a 

8 different position. The Solicitor General is basically 

9 saying follow the Coast Guard regulations.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the statute underlying 

11 those regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC 

12 4302, and it provides the secretary very broad 

13 discretion on what to include within the regulations and 

14 what not to. After this court decided the Stewart case, 

the secretary suspended many regulations for dockside 

16 vessels until the Coast Guard could issue new 

17 regulations. There is a hint, there is a suggestion 

18 that there might be a problem, but there is not anything 

19 that is really given in practical terms.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean, 

21 there is some easy things to visualize as a problem. If 

22 this is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a 

23 week is a seaman under the Jones Act, right? 

24  MR. FREDERICK: No. And the reason why is 

because as this court recognized in Stewart, the in 

52

Official 

1 navigation requirement is something that has been used 

2 for limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those 

3 circumstances in which a vessel is taken out of 

4 navigation. So I think that it would be appropriate in 

a case like this where this is a classic instance of a 

6 maritime lien, dockage --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, taken out 

8 of navigation, but not every time it's docked, right? 

9  MR. FREDERICK: No. But no -- and in fact, 

I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a 

11 different test that this Court last discussed in the 

12 Chandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to 

13 the mission of the vessel. And that -- I think that the 

14 Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside, 

because they bring in an entirely different regime that 

16 focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as 

17 opposed to the definition of vessel itself. 

18  The definition of vessel itself here is, as 

19 Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act, 

and it is something that does apply more broadly. But 

21 as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions 

22 that take that definition and then they add an intent 

23 requirement as specific language in different parts. So 

24 that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is 

something that is germane to that particular statutory 

53

1 function, than that is a question that becomes a 

2 question for jurisdiction. 

3  But I'd also like to point out that both, I 

4 think, the district court and the court of appeals here 

assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there 

6 had not been evidence that contested the basic 

7 principles that the City brought when it profiled this 

8 in rem action. 

9  And because the case then moved into the 

merits phase, the district judge here initially denied 

11 the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without 

12 prejudice. And then as the evidence came in, revisited 

13 the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at 

14 that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in 

record evidence that affected the practical capability 

16 of the test. 

17  The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the 

18 court of appeals as a reason for error was that because 

19 he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he 

had no contractual or property right to do so, and he 

21 had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina 

22 complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of 

23 the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3 

24 days' notice, the question of whether or not there was 

any record of evidence on practical capability got to

1 the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in

 So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think 

6 that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did 

7 do its job here is an important facet of the case as it 

8 comes. 

9  They initially asked you in the cert 

petition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the 

11 Seventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test. 

12 They've not defended that test. And it is abjectly 

13 erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so 

14 easily manipulated by an individual's intent. And now 

by trying to morph it into some kind of function or 

16 objective purpose standard, they've essentially done 

17 exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered 

18 no evidence in the district court to try to prove. 

19  If there are no further questions.

25

Official 

1 I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is 

2 that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it 

3 carried his personal effects. The difficulty is that 

4 argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and 

Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases. And I 

6 would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this 

7 Court reading and applying those cases. 

8  In Evansville, this Court dealt with 

9 something that carried around the effects of a business 

office. In Roper, this Court dealt with something that 

11 carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the 

12 structure in this case. 

13  Both instances, the Court said they're not 

14 vessels because the function was not to carry those 

things around, it was merely -- they were merely 

16 incidental relocations. 

17  Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh 

18 Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that 

19 function is irrelevant. And the City can't be right on 

its test either. The only way the City has proposed to 

21 deal with those cases is to look at how securely the 

22 structure is fashioned. 

23  And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. If 

24 you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional 

questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes.

1 And not only that, if you want something that's utterly 

2 manipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht 

3 down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up 

4 to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's 

out of maritime jurisdiction. 

6  So this Court's cases for almost a century 

7 have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to 

8 apply. And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded 

9 that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that 

is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how 

11 maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on 

12 those understandings. 

13  And it's not just the questions we've been 

14 talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the 

rest are built on this test. And we're asking this 

16 Court simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past. 

17  So I think that leaves the question of, when 

18 you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and 

19 you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate 

or do you send -- or do you simply reverse? And we 

21 think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply 

22 reverse. You have everything in the record you need, 

23 most notably in the surveyor's report. 

24  And you can look at four things. Look at 

the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the

1 structure, its equipment and the utilities. The 

2 materials used were plywood and ordinary land-based 

3 structures. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is -- what was 

used in the Higgins boats in World War II. 

6  MR. FISHER: I'm -- I'm not saying any of 

7 these are determinative, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's a 

8 totality that tells you what it is. 

9  And the next thing is the shape. Exactly as 

you referred. This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches 

11 under the water, is not meant to be moved around. Look 

12 at the -- look at its features. It has French doors on 

13 three sides a few feet above the water line. That's not 

14 what a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed.

 And finally, its utilities. Again, at Joint 

16 Appendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no 

17 batteries. It is utterly dependent on being hooked up 

18 to land. That's the only way it can function. 

19  So if this Court does nothing else between 

now and casting its vote and writing its opinion, 

21 revisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule 

22 that this Court has always applied. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

24 Counsel.

 The case is submitted.
