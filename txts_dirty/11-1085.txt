3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 11-1085, Amgen, Incorporated, v. The 

Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds. 

6  Mr. Waxman. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Our case is about whether the claim of 

12 liability is, in a fundamental sense, class-wide or 

13 individual. The heart of a 10b-5 claim is I bought or 

14 sold in reliance on a misleading statement. The 

question at the class cert stage is whether each 

16 individual will have to prove his own reliance directly 

17 on the statement, or whether every -- he can prove 

18 indirectly reliance on the statement by showing that 

19 everybody relied on a distorted market price. 

A market price will reflect a statement if 

21 and only if the statement is material and is made 

22 publicly on an efficient market. So, absent 

23 materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to 

24 reflect the statement in question. And the 

plaintiffs --

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why is 

2 that -- why is that the case? I would suppose, if 

3 there's no materiality, that means that the effect on 

4 the market price just happens to be zero. 

MR. WAXMAN: That's exactly correct. And 

6 the point here is --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't that 

8 common to all parties? 

9  MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, every one of 

the four predicates to the fraud-on-the-market theory, 

11 which is a shortcut that -- that excuses plaintiffs from 

12 proving that I heard the statement and relied on it --

13 every one of those predicates is common. 

14  Whether the market is efficient is common. 

Whether the statement is public is common. Whether the 

16 stocks were bought and sold during the period of market 

17 distortion is common. And materiality is common. 

18  The question is not whether --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the falsity of the 

statement common as well? 

21  MR. WAXMAN: The falsity of the statement is 

22 common, but it is not a predicate to whether or not you 

23 can prove reliance on a statement indirectly by relying 

24 on the integrity of the market price because, in an 

efficient market, material public statements, whether

1 they are true or false, will presumably move the market 

2 price. And if you're trying to prove reliance on a 

3 false --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can an individual 

who has -- it has been deemed in -- in a cert 


6 certification, that an issue is immaterial, could an 


7 individual claimant ever prove it's material? 


8  MR. WAXMAN: Sure. I'm not arguing --


9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the 


truth-on-the-market -- the truth-in-the-market defense, 

11 which is the type of defense that you're raising here. 

12  MR. WAXMAN: Yes. Either way. Let me 

13 explain why. 

14  There's no doubt that this Court's standard 

for materiality, announced in TSC v. Northway and since 

16 reiterated, is an objective standard. It doesn't depend 

17 on who the relier was. 

18  But the inability to prove to a certifying 

19 judge that class-wide reliance can be -- that class-wide 

reliance exists because the statement was material 

21 doesn't preclude a plaintiff like Connecticut 

22 Retirement, which has said it's going to proceed whether 

23 there's a class or not, or any other member of the 

24 class, from coming to court and saying, either, I 

directly relied on this statement, and here's my proof 

5

1 that it's material to the trier-of-fact, because the 

2 decision that the judge makes at certification is not 

3 binding on the trier-of-fact; or even to say, I relied 

4 on the integrity of the market price, and I have proof 


that the market price was affected because here are 


6 three investors, they're all reasonable people, and they 

7 say that it was relevant -- important to them in the 

8 total mix of information involved. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry --


JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, that's just to 

11 say that you -- a plaintiff can always relitigate the question 
12 of materiality. But at the class certification stage, 
13 isn't it correct that, if the Court holds that a 
14 statement is immaterial, it's immaterial for all members 

of the class, and the suit has to be dismissed? Isn't 

16 that right? 
17  MR. WAXMAN: The suit cannot -- that is, the 
18 suit cannot proceed as a class action. Connecticut 
19 Retirement or any --

JUSTICE KAGAN: It can't proceed as an 

21 anything action, can it? I mean, the -- the remedy, if 
22 you had thought that the -- the statement was 
23 immaterial, is not to say, I won't approve a class. It 
24 would be to say, the suit has no merit. 

MR. WAXMAN: I -- I think that's wrong. I

1 think that's conceptually wrong, Justice Kagan, in the 

2 sense that all that the class certification decision 

3 says is that the putative class representative can sue 

4 on his own behalf, but he can't drag everybody else into 

the --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you mean to say 

7 that a judge, who has just ruled that a statement is 

8 immaterial, is going to keep the case in his court, 

9 litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's 

just ruled that the statement is immaterial? 

11  MR. WAXMAN: Well, I want to -- I'd like to 

12 come back to the question of why whether, even if 

13 your -- the premise of your question is correct, it 

14 doesn't matter for this case. But let me take one more 

run at -- at your premise. 

16  The next thing that would happen if I'm 

17 right, presumably, and the case isn't over, the class 

18 just isn't certified, is the defendant -- you know, 

19 emboldened by the judge's rule, will file a motion for 

summary judgment on the grounds that materiality -- the 

21 element of the substantive offense, not materiality, the 

22 predicate to class certification -- has just been 

23 determined in favor of me. That is a very different 

24 question for the Court. 

Materiality, as this Court has said, is 

7

1 fact-sensitive, and it involves a balancing of 

2 credibility of witnesses or of expert opinions, and the 

3 judge at the -- at the class cert stage, has to find 

4 facts and has to make a ruling. 

When it comes up on summary judgment, what 

6 the -- if there is a dispute of material facts, what the 

7 judge should do under the law is to say, look, I just 

8 held that I didn't think it was material, but I resolved 

9 disputed material facts, and that's for the jury, and 

this case will go to the jury. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're saying that a 

12 judge on a class certification stage can say, this is 

13 immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this 

14 can't proceed as a class action. But when a summary 

judgment motion comes in, arguing the exact same thing, 

16 the judge will say, oh, it's not immaterial after all, 

17 or it's disputed enough, that the case can -- can 

18 continue? 

19  MR. WAXMAN: Well, in some cases if -- if 

the alleged fact is -- you know, that Amgen's president 

21 got a haircut at 10:30, the judge presumably can say 

22 there are -- you know, this is immaterial as a matter of 

23 law. But the vast majority of cases -- this is a 

24 perfect example -- where they have statements that, in 

the abstract, extracted from the total mix of

1 information, look pretty material. These are flagship 

2 drugs. 

3  On the other hand, the evidence we wanted to 

4 introduce and the judge wouldn't hear because, in the 

Ninth Circuit, the test is not proving facts, but simply 

6 alleging them --

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess the question, 

8 Mr. Waxman, is if it is not immaterial as a matter of 

9 law, at the summary judgment stage, how could a judge 

possibly say it is material at the class certification 

11 stage? 

12  MR. WAXMAN: The judge at the class 

13 certification stage is required to weigh competing 

14 evidence and -- and render his or her best judgment. At 

the summary judgment stage, a judge is precluded from 

16 doing that. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: So the class certification 

18 stage becomes kind of a super merits inquiry? 

19  MR. WAXMAN: No, not at all. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- where the plaintiff has 

21 to -- has to surmount a higher burden on the merits? 

22  MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. The -- the class 

23 certification stage requires the moving party -- the 

24 putative -- the -- the class representative who is 

proposing to arrogate to himself and his method of proof

1 the fortunes of all the absent class members, whether 

2 they are direct reliers or indirect reliers, tie their 

3 fortunes to his fortune at trial. And the judge simply 

4 has to say, is this a case in which reliance is a common 

issue? That is the key through the certification gate 

6 in 10b-5 cases. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought we were talking 

8 about, Mr. Waxman, the materiality of the alleged 

9 misstatement, and I am really nonplussed by your answer 

that, if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't 

11 end it for everybody. Certainly, it should -- it ends 

12 it for the class; you said that. Should it also end it 

13 for the representative of the class to say, okay, now 

14 I'm going to come back, and this statement, -this 

finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me. 

16  Of course, it's going to bind the class 

17 representative. So if it's immaterial, the case ends. 

18 And if it is material, then it is material to everybody 

19 in the class. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, let's 

21 take an easier case. Let's say I'm somebody who bought 

22 Amgen during the relevant period, and they -- the judge 

23 says -- you know, I've heard your -- I've considered 

24 your event studies, and I think that this is --

information isn't material.

1  There is nothing whatsoever that precludes

3 evidence of material -- I directly relied; here's my 

4 evidence of materiality. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could that be --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that 

7 there -- are you saying that there is a difference 

8 between materiality for the fraud-on-the-market theory 

9 and for direct reliance or that there can be a 

difference? 

11  MR. WAXMAN: The -- the standard of --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that if there was 

13 fraud on the market, that is a materiality question 

14 addressed at the certification stage, but if the class 

isn't certified, the investor can still show that he had 

16 had direct reliance that was reasonable? 

17  MR. WAXMAN: Yes.

1  (Laughter.) 

2  MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Materiality -- the quirk 

3 of this case is that materiality is both -- as all my 

4 friends on the other side agree, an essential predicate 

of the fraud-on-the-market theory, that is the essential 

6 predicate of the ability to prove indirect reliance on 

7 the statement through an assertion that the market 

8 price -- that the statement distorted the market price. 

9  Everyone agrees that, if the statement isn't 

material, it didn't distort the market price, and 

11 therefore, reliance is an individualized issue for those 

12 who actually heard and detrimentally relied on the 

13 statement. 

14  One of the elements that has to be proven in 

a 10b-5 case is reliance, which is what we were talking 

16 about on the class cert stage, and there, materiality is 

17 a predicate for reliance. But even if reliance is 

18 proven, materiality is also an element of a 10b-5(b) 

19 cause of action, and the standard for materiality is the 

same. 

21  The real question in this case is what is 

22 the purpose of Rule 23? If you think that the purpose 

23 of Rule 23 is to postpone to the merits everything that 

24 can be postponed without a risk of foreclosing valid 

individual claims, we lose. But that's not the purpose. 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



Official 

1 The purpose is for a court to determine whether all of 

2 the preconditions for forcing everyone into a class 

3 action are present before you certify. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Or you can take exactly 

5 what you said and phrase it the opposite way. 

6  MR. WAXMAN: But I wouldn't. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: You can say – No I know is 

8 it the purpose of the certification stage to try out every 

9 element of liability at that stage, rather than waiting 

10 for the trial? 

11  MR. WAXMAN: No. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: No, it's not. Good. 

13  Now, once you say that, what you have said 

14 is, you know, it could still be material for some 

15 individual, even though there is no market reliance. 

16 And similarly, a silence going (indicating), some odd 

17 set of words or whatever it is, although it's not false 

18 for almost anybody, for some particular person, it could 

19 seem -- convey something false in some particular set of 

20 circumstances. 

21  So let's try out falsity at the 

22 certification stage, too. In fact, let's try out 

23 everything because we could always think of a few 

24 examples where, despite the fact that -- you know, that

1 it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can 

2 dream up a situation where it's not a common issue. 

3  MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, the point of 

4 class certification is not to pre-try the merits of the 

case. What --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but you are saying with 

7 a cert -- class certification here, if there is no 

8 materiality, there is no class; and you are repeatedly 

9 faced with the question, you are absolutely right; in 

fact, there is no case. And so then what you say is, 

11 and indeed, I have a few instances here in which there 

12 could be a case, and I’d say, I bet if we are -- you 

13 know, professorial enough, we could dream up a 

14 hypothetical for anything, where there still is a case. 

MR. WAXMAN: The point of the class 

16 certification, as this Court explained in Amchem and 

17 other cases, and as the Rules Advisory Committee notes, 

18 is the question of whether there is class coherence in 

19 the first place. It's not the merits issue. It's 

whether it's fair for the class representative to impose 

21 on the defendant the juggernaut of class action and on 

22 the absent class members their fortunes in his or her 

23 hands. And what --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, that is exactly 

right, and that's what we said in Wal-Mart recently, that 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 the question is a question of coherence; it's a question of 

2 whether the class wins or loses together. And here, for 

3 materiality, the class wins or loses together. If it's 

4 material, it's material as to everybody. If it's not 

material, it's not material as to everybody. 


6  And that's just a function of the fact that 


7 materiality, as we've repeatedly said, is an objective 


8 test. It doesn't have anything to do with whether a 


9 particular person finds it material. And where that's 


the case, it seems to me that the Wal-Mart test, which 

11 is -- is an issue central to the -- you know, when you 

12 rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in 

13 one stroke? The answer to that is yes. 

14  MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kagan, this Court has 

explained more than once, and I am now quoting from 

16 Amchem, that "class" -- "It is class cohesion and only 

17 class cohesion that legitimizes representative action in 

18 the first place." And that question, quote, "preexists 

19 any settlement and therefore a fortiori any litigation." 

Now --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, I was saying 

22 that's right. 

23  MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: There is class cohesion as 

to materiality. People win or lose on materiality

1 together. 


2  MR. WAXMAN: The -- there is class -- with 


3 respect, there is class cohesion, investors cohere into 


4 a class, only when the alleged misinformation was 


significant enough to affect the price, thus enabling 


6 the common claim of relying on the misinformation in the 


7 same way. Letting a putative representative through the 


8 certification gate, without showing that key, is like, 


9 on a theory of no harm, no foul because we’ll all lose 


together --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --

12  MR. WAXMAN: -- is like letting --

13 Justice --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, there is no 

question about 23(a), right? The 23(a) prerequisites 

16 have been satisfied. 

17  MR. WAXMAN: Not challenged in this case. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the only thing is 

19 (b)(3), that is that a question of law or fact common to 

the class members predominates over questions affecting 

21 only individual members. The question that predominates 

22 is the question of, were these representations material; if 

23 they were material, then the certification is proper. 

24 If they were immaterial, it's not. It's just -- I don't 

understand why this isn't just a clear case of a 

16

Official 

1 question common to the class; that is, the question of 

2 materiality. 

3  MR. WAXMAN: The answer, Justice Ginsburg, 

4 is that the question at the class certification stage --

the predominance question is the reliance element, not 

6 the materiality element. 

7  Everyone agrees that materiality, like 

8 falsity, like scienter, like loss causation, are all 

9 common questions. As this Court explained in Basic and 

reiterated last term in Halliburton, in 10b-5 actions, 

11 the question at class certification is whether reliance 

12 needs to be proven directly; that is, individually by 

13 people who heard and acted in response; or whether the 

14 shortcut that this Court authorized in Basic of allowing 

indirect proof by proving that the statement caused a 

16 distortion of the market, is the way to go. 

17  There are two tracks, and it happens in this 

18 case that materiality is both an element, which is 

19 common, and a predicate to class-wide reliance. 

Everyone agrees that there -- you can't rely as a class 

21 on the -- the challenged misstatement, unless the 

22 statement moved or had the capability of moving the 

23 market price. And that's why the materiality is the 

24 glue that holds --

13 of the other elements necessary for the 

14 fraud-on-the-market theory would also be decided 

conclusively -- for future individual litigants, 

16 namely, the efficiency of the market? A future litigant 

17 will ordinarily claim, I either sold it at a depressed 

18 price or bought it at an inflated price because of the 

19 market's reaction to this particular fraudulent 

statement. 

21  MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so you can say the 

23 same thing about the efficiency of the -- of the market 

24 being determined in this preliminary question, as you

1  MR. WAXMAN: That's absolutely right. And

3 government in responding --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: What is that statement, 

Mr. Waxman? 

6  MR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Because the difference is if 

8 there is an unefficient market, the case goes forward, 

9 and people have to prove individual reliance, and that 

means that the class splits apart, and you don't get a 

11 coherent class. So the function of -- of your winning 

12 an argument either on publicity or on the efficient 

13 market is that the class becomes incoherent, that 

14 everybody then has to prove individual reliance. 

But that's not what happens when you prove 

16 immateriality. When you prove immateriality, the whole 

17 class falls together because it's immaterial for 

18 everybody. 

19  MR. WAXMAN: That's not correct, and in any 

event, that analysis -- that approach is, as I was 

21 trying to say, is like letting the fruits justify the 

22 search. 

23  The question is -- at the time that class 

24 certification is sought, the question is do common 

issues predominate? And the question, in a securities

1 case, is, is reliance in fact -- to quote this Court's 

2 opinion, "in fact, a common issue?" 

3  You also have to prove -- to show that, in fact, 

4 it's a common issue, you have to show that the market 

reacted to the statement, whether it was true or false, 

6 whether it was made with scienter or not, whether there 

7 was loss causation or not, the market had to react, and 

8 to do that, you need all three legs of a stool. 

9  The statement has to be material because 

immaterial statements don't move markets. If that --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, the -- the 

12 Basic opinion that started all this off, on page 242, 

13 lists materiality as a common question. The materiality 

14 of the misrepresentation, if any, is listed as a common 

question, and that made perfect sense to me. 

16  MR. WAXMAN: It makes perfect sense to me as 

17 well, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm not being sarcastic. 

18 Materiality is a common question. Just as are many of 

19 the other elements of a 10b-5 action --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So at certification, 

21 you just assume that materiality -- you don't have to 

22 show it. If it's always a common question, you assume 

23 it, in trying to weigh out the number of -- whether or 

24 not common issues predominate or not. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, the question, Justice --

1 I mean, for -- if it worked for class certification, 

2 that would be fine. The question is what the purported 

3 class representative has to show to get through the 

4 certification gate to transform an ordinary bilateral 

dispute about, you made a false statement, I relied on 

6 it, it caused me to lose money, into something entirely 

7 different, a class of tens or hundreds of thousands of 

8 people, all of whom are proceeding together, all of 

9 their fortunes are married, and the defendant is faced 

with the full class, what you have to show. 

11  And you have to show that reliance is a 

12 common issue, regardless of what you have to show down 

13 the road. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you seem to 

be setting up two determinations of materiality. You 

16 say, in order to certify the class, you have to show 

17 that the misrepresentation was material. And in order 

18 to win on the merits, you certainly have to show that 

19 the misrepresentation was material. 

How do those two findings of materiality 

21 differ? How does the finding that you say must be made 

22 at the certification stage differ from the finding that 

23 must be made at the trial? 

24  MR. WAXMAN: They differ temporally, they 

differ functionally, and they differ in terms of who

1 decides it and with what level of finality. They differ 

2 temporally because the first question is, is this 

3 case going to -- which of two tracks is this case going 

4 to proceed? 

Is it going to proceed as a -- as a direct 

6 reliance case -- I heard the statement, and I relied on 

7 it -- or is it going to proceed on a theory on behalf of 

8 everybody that whether -- the people who relied on it, 

9 the people who heard it or who didn't hear it, on a 

theory that the -- we rely on the integrity of the 

11 market, and the integrity of the market was impaired if 

12 the statement was false. 

13  In any event, there was a price effect. And 

14 there isn't a price effect if the statement wasn't 

material and made publicly into an efficient market. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I’m still -- what --

17 what does "material" mean at the trial level, what does 

18 "material" mean at the certification? 

19  MR. WAXMAN: Material means, at both, as 

this Court said, that there is a substantial likelihood 

21 that the information would have been viewed by a 

22 reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 

23 total mix of information available. That is the test. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's the same 

question. It has to be -- if it's established at the

3  MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. Just like the

market timing. Every one of those predicates has to be 

6 proven to the jury's satisfaction at trial. All of them

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

13  MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, 

14 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The class certification process determines 

16 whether the case can generate common answers for all 

17 class members. So for three reasons --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why don't you answer the 

19 question that was asked earlier, if Basic set forth a 

presumption, and are you disputing that, at the class 

21 certification stage, a defendant can prove that the 

22 market is inefficient? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why shouldn't we hold 

Basic to its position that all of its presumptions can

25

Official 

1 be rebutted as well, not just efficiency? Why do we set 

2 out efficiency as the one issue that can be rebutted? 

3  MR. FREDERICK: There is a lot to said about 

4 Basic, and let me just start the ball rolling by making 

these observations. First, Basic did not try to 

6 distinguish between the requisites of Rule 23 and the 

7 substantive component of the fraud-on-the-market theory. 

8 And that's important because, in that case, the court 

9 remanded for a redetermination of materiality, but it 

upheld the class certification order. 

11  So in the context of Basic, the court seemed 

12 to be thinking there was a difference between what 

13 needed to be proved for class certification and what 

14 would need to be proved on the merits of the case. 

Now, the second thing to be said is that 

16 Basic needs to be read against the backdrop of Rule 23 

17 and especially this Court's recent decision in 

18 Wal-Mart v. Dukes. Because materiality always generates 

19 a common answer for all class members, it is the 

quintessential common issue that does not splinter the 

21 class or cause it to be noncohesive for purposes of 

22 understanding predominance. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Doesn't -- doesn't that 

24 assume that the efficient market theory is always 

relevant to materiality? And there might be instances

Official 

1 in which there is subjective reliance, which we inquire 

2 into, that is objectively reasonable, but that does not 

3 involve a fraud on the market? 

4  MR. FREDERICK: Only in a hypothetical case, 

Justice Kennedy. And this is the absolute most 

6 important point that I can try to make today. In a 

7 fraud-on-the-market case, the idea of reliance -- the 

8 only theory of reliance that is being advanced is 

9 indirect reliance on the integrity of the market. There 

is no other theory of reliance. 

11  Why do we know that in this case? For two 

12 reasons: First, the Connecticut Retirement System could 

13 not be the class representative, if it did not meet the 

14 typicality requirement of Rule 23(a), which the district 

court found -- this is on page 25A of the petition 

16 appendix -- and has not been challenged subsequently. 

17  But why doesn't Connecticut have a direct 

18 reliance theory? We know they don't because they have a 

19 fiduciary duty to their investors to apply whatever 

theory they have of securities fraud. So we know in 

21 this case -- and this is, by far, clear in the 

22 run-of-the-mine fraud-on-the-market case, that the class 

23 representative will only establish reliance indirectly, 

24 by showing that the integrity of the market was 

impaired.

1  And so their construct is an entirely 

2 hypothetical and theoretical one. It simply does not 

3 arise in the real world of fraud-on-the-market cases. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, you -- you 

say that -- you know, it's a flukey hypothetical 

6 where -- where the -- the issue here would -- would come 

7 up again in a different context in an individual suit. 

8 Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's -- that's not 

9 flukey and hypothetical. That is, it is usually the 

case that -- that people who are allegedly defrauded in 

11 stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an --

12 at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price. 

13 Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of 

14 the market. 

If the market is not efficient, a question 

16 that has to be decided for the class certification case, 

17 the individual investor is not going to be able to say, 

18 you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because 

19 the market reflected this false statement, and I paid 

more money for the stock than I should have. That --

21 that is not a flukey hypothetical. That is what will 

22 happen in most individual cases. And yet, that question 

23 of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the 

24 class certification stage. 

MR. FREDERICK: Right, precisely because we 

26
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 have to know are all the investors standing in the same 

2 position. If the market is efficient and it is 

3 absorbing information into the price, all investors will 

4 have the same question with respect to materiality. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same 

6 about materiality. If it's immaterial, it isn't 

7 reflected in -- in the market. 

8  MR. FREDERICK: They all lose on the merits, 

9 if there is no materiality. The question about 

efficiency, Justice Scalia, and the reason why it is 

11 advanced at class certification is because it serves a 

12 gatekeeping role in determining whether all the 

13 investors can show indirect reliance on the market. If 

14 the -- if the stock is thinly traded, there are no 

public analysts, there are no stock reports given about 

16 it, and no one knows exactly why is the price being 

17 determined, that creates exactly the kind of individual 

18 issues that would predominate in a securities fraud 

19 case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the difference you 

21 assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will 

22 be an issue in all individual cases; whereas with regard 

23 to the efficiency of the market, it will only be an 

24 issue in -- what, 95 percent of -- of the individual 

cases?

Official 

1  MR. FREDERICK: No, the question is: Does 

2 efficiency serve as a means of determining are all the 

3 investors similarly situated? Are they a cohesive 

4 class? If the market is not efficient -- and mind you, 

they -- they conceded this question in their answer and 

6 they did not challenge the expert that was put in the 

7 district court on the question of efficiency, so that 

8 question's really not in this case. 

9  But in the case that you're hypothesizing, 

Justice Scalia, efficiency serves the gatekeeping 

11 function of determining are all the investors similarly 

12 situated, so that indirect reliance can be a -- a method 

13 of showing that predicate for a common answer to be 

14 determined at trial. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we --

16  MR. FREDERICK: Publicity serves the same 

17 function. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we get a 

19 hypothetical that I actually think could occur, which is 

not a truth-on-the-market defense, but a known truth to 

21 the individual person seeking certification. So that is 

22 it's immaterial to that person because they were told 

23 this information by someone and still trading. Would 

24 that defense be available at certification? 

MR. FREDERICK: I think it -- where it gets

25

Official 

1 appropriately done is the adequacy and typicality prongs 

2 of Rule 23(a) because that person has a different 

3 factual basis for attempting to assert a securities 

4 fraud, and that person is not typical of the class and 

so therefore would not meet the typicality requirement 

6 of 23(a). 

7  Now, it is possible, certainly, that in 

8 other cases, there might be investors out there who do 

9 have a direct reliance theory, but they are protected by 

Rule 23 in a couple of ways. One is they can bring 

11 their own case, and they can say, I directly relied on 

12 Amgen's misstatements and the false things that they 

13 said about their flagship products, and I, therefore, 

14 have my own 10b-5 case. Or if the class is certified 

and they think they have a direct reliance theory, they 

16 can opt out of the class. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: This is true, but I'm --

18 I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it 

19 now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this: 

That -- that why do we use an efficient market theory? 

21 We use it because if the market is efficient and the 

22 statement is public, then someone who bought over the 

23 market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the 

24 false statement. I mean, that's -- so he -- there was 

sufficient reliance indirectly.

Official 

1  All right. So I think his point is, yes, I 

2 can see materiality is something that's relevant to 

3 everybody. Of course, it is, a common issue in the 

4 case. But also, it is a feature of materiality that, if 

it wasn't material, then our theory of market 

6 reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the 

7 window because you can have all the efficiency in the 

8 world, all the publicity in the world, but still, where 

9 something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his 

reaction is "who cares?" And therefore, although there 

11 could be special cases, the efficient market theory 

12 plays no role. 

13  Now, I think that's what his theory is, if I 

14 understand it. And -- and I don't hope it is, if I've 

got it -- I mean, I hope I got it right. But -- but if 

16 that -- so what's your direct answer to that? 

17  MR. FREDERICK: My direct answer to that is 

18 that materiality still serves as a common answer. All 

19 the investors are going to lose if it is not a material 

misstatement that has any effect, and they will win or 

21 they will have the potential to win if it is a 

22 material --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: The issue -- the issue is 

not whether -- whether it's a common question or not.

4 market reflects reality. 

MR. FREDERICK: Right. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the issue. 

7  MR. FREDERICK: But, Justice Scalia, I think 

8 that the issue that you want to decide or you think that 

9 you want to decide is what constitutes the efficiency of 

the market, and that is a hotly litigated issue in many 

11 securities cases. It just happens not to be at issue in 

12 this one. 

13  And so the question of -- you know, you've 

14 got a Fortune 200 company, with 1.1 billion shares 

outstanding, 9 million traded a day during the class 

16 period, I mean, this is a hugely efficient market for 

17 the stock that is at issue before you. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're 

19 saying, in this kind of case, the -- the materiality or 

not is not likely to be specially sufficient --

21 specially significant. In fact, you are going to decide 

22 if it is a common issue, and there is no reason to 

23 import that common issue into the preliminary finding, 

24 even if what I just parroted, we hope, is true.

statements about clinical trials for their drug. What 

6 was --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you are saying 

8 that, if everyone loses, if it's not material, that's a 

9 common issue, and therefore, the trial court at the 

certification stage does not have to determine it. 

11  MR. FREDERICK: No, what I'm saying is that 

12 it is -- because it is a common question, it is not one 

13 to be decided at class certification. Just like 

14 falsity --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure how that's 

16 different from what I said. But in other -- in other 

17 words, you are saying that market efficiency is just 

18 presumed, and everybody wins or everybody loses, and so 

19 you can have a class action, even though the trial judge 

is convinced that there is no adequate common market 

21 theory to support the common -- the common injury. 

22  MR. FREDERICK: That's not our position.

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, you say --

3 you say, you point out, quite rightly, that the 

4 efficiency of the market was conceded -- was conceded 

below. 

6  MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was not challenged. 

8 Except that now, in -- in Amgen's brief, there is a 

9 suggestion that the efficiency of the market is a more 

sophisticated question. And it's not my note -- binary, 

11 I think is what they said -- it isn't that it's either 

12 efficient or it's not efficient; it depends on other 

13 factors. 

14  MR. FREDERICK: It's a new concoction they 

had not argued before this stage of the briefing in 

16 this case, and it's wrong because all investors will 

17 rise or fall, based on whether or not those statements 

18 that may have some subsidiary materiality effect are 

19 going to be able to show that there was some consequence 

to the market. And it is that why -- that is why it 

21 is still a common question, even if there are these

6  MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: The publicity of the 

8 matter, that is not traditionally a common element of 

9 the tort. That is something special to get into this 

theory. 

11  MR. FREDERICK: Correct. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: With materiality, it is a 

13 common element of the tort always; it is traditionally 

14 there; it will be litigated, so there is no special 

reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at 

16 the outset. 

17  MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And 

18 Congress recognized that there were issues concerning 

19 these various elements. And that's why, in 1995, when 

it enacted the PSLRA, it addressed scienter by imposing 

21 a heightened pleading requirement and loss causation, 

22 but it was asked to address materiality and reliance and 

23 it chose not to. 

24  The first bill that was proposed would have 

dealt with Basic, and the -- and the Congress voted that

1 down, and instead --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: But there is -- there is a 

3 reason for deciding it earlier, and the reason is the --

4 the enormous pressure to settle once the class is 

certified. In most cases, that's the end of the 

6 lawsuit. There's -- there's automatically a settlement. 

7  Now, one way of -- of certifying the class 

8 is to show, well, you know, it's an efficient market, 

9 and you can presume that everybody in the class relied 

on the market. But that's only true if -- if the -- the 

11 statement was material to the market. If it was 

12 immaterial to the market, that isn't true. And you 

13 should not proceed any further, and you should not begin 

14 this -- this class action which, in -- in most cases, is 

simply the preliminary to a settlement. There is a good 

16 reason for deciding it sooner. 

17  MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, you 

18 would consign district court judges to having many 

19 trials on the merits because the fact that materiality 

is such a highly contextual inquiry --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you have the -- you 

22 have the burden of justifying class certification --

2 there is some real question of whether or not the causal 

3 chain hasn't been broken, the causal chain between the 

4 misstatement and the movement in price. Don't you have 

to prove the integrity of the causal chain? 

6  MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: At the certification 

8 stage? 

9  MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but that's where 

efficiency comes in, Justice Kennedy, and that's why, 

11 when efficiency is contested at the class certification 

12 stage, what comes in are proofs of does information end 

13 up having an effect? And economists do event studies that 

14 try to show the general level at which information will 

be absorbed into the market price. That's where that 

16 issue gets contested. It does not get contested on the 

17 question of materiality because materiality looks at the 

18 total mix of information that would be relevant to an 

19 investor, not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say it's material even 

21 though there is no cause in fact? I don't understand 

22 that. 

23  MR. FREDERICK: What I'm saying is that the 

24 efficiency question goes into the individual stock's 

ability to absorb information, both material and

1 nonmaterial information. 

2  Now, the question on the merits, for which 

3 all investors will either rise or fall together, is was 

4 this company's misrepresentation a material one to the 

reasonable investor? And that's why all investors are 

6 going to have the same answer because it's the same 

7 objective inquiry. 

8  The question that you -- you and 

9 Justice Scalia are positing about the efficiency of the 

market is one on which there are disagreements among the 

11 lower courts as to how to challenge and how to deal with 

12 that question, but they do not do it on the basis of 

13 materiality. 

14  Judge Easterbrook had a very sound opinion 

in the Schleicher case, in which he goes through and he 

16 explains that, when there is a fraud-on-the-market case, 

17 the notion of indirect reliance, where efficiency is 

18 established, really evolves -- devolves down to the core 

19 merits question of materiality. And that is a common 

question that -- in which all of the investors are going 

21 to rise together. 

22  But I do want to end by saying that, when 

23 Congress looked at this question, it decided not to deal 

24 with this question of efficiency or materiality. It was

2 predominate over individual issues. 

3  As several of the justices have recognized, 

4 materiality is an objective inquiry, it leads to a 

common answer, and that common answer unites the class, 

6 rather than divides it. If materiality is shown, the 

7 class members can proceed together on the 

8 fraud-on-the-market theory. But --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But as Justice Scalia 

pointed out earlier, so is efficiency or nonefficiency. 

11  MS. SHERRY: And the difference --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that -- that 

13 differentiation, articulating it that way, doesn't move 

14 the ball. 

MS. SHERRY: I would disagree with that 

16 because the difference is with efficiency and with 

17 publicity. If the -- depending on the common answer, 

18 the class may divide. It may fragment because, even if 

19 the market is inefficient, individual class members can 

make out claims of direct reliance. You can rely on an 

21 inefficient market and prevail. You can rely on 

22 nonpublic statements --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the difference 

24 between 100 percent and 95 percent? I mean, most of the 

other claims in -- in stock cases are going to be based

1 on what -- what the market price was when the person 

2 bought or sold. So -- you know, 95 percent instead of 

3 100 percent, that's -- that's the basic difference? 

4  MS. SHERRY: The -- the purpose of the class 

certification stage with respect to predominance is to 

6 weigh the common issues against individual issues. And 

7 with respect to market efficiency -- excuse me -- market 

8 efficiency and publicity, those are two matters that --

9 that either bind the class together or divide them. To 

the extent the market is inefficient or to the extent 

11 the statements are not public, they are not all getting 

12 the information from the same source. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: They are preconditions --

14 they are preconditions, not related to the merits, that 

do, in fact, justify the use of a special reliance 

16 theory. Now, I've said that; of course, so is 

17 materiality. 

18  MS. SHERRY: But --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: But materiality, unlike the 

other two, is part of the element of the basic case, 

21 where it is a common issue in this case -- and in 

22 most -- to everybody. 

23  MS. SHERRY: And that is exactly right. And 

24 the difference is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that exactly right?

1 Because I am getting the -- facing the problem a few 

2 minutes from now, somebody is going to say, well, why is 

3 that exactly right? I mean, it is a precondition. 

4  MS. SHERRY: I am going to say it's exactly 

right because the confusion here is that materiality in 

6 a fraud-on-the-market case serves two purposes.  It is a 

7 predicate to the fraud-on-the-market theory, but it is 

8 also an independent, separate element. And what 

9 Petitioners would have this Court do is isolate the two 

inquiries when they're really the same question. 

11  It is asking the same question that leads to 

12 the same answer, and it's one that unites the class. 

13 There's -- Petitioners phrase the question as whether 

14 reliance --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you have the same 

16 question, then maybe we shouldn't have this 

17 fraud-on-the-market theory because the whole purpose of 

18 it is -- is to -- to assume that -- that the whole class 

19 was -- was damaged and relied -- because you can rely on 

an efficient market. But you can only rely on an 

21 efficient market where there has been a material 

22 misrepresentation. 

23  So maybe we should overrule Basic because it 

24 was certainly based upon a theory that -- that simply 

collapses once you remove the materiality element.

1  MS. SHERRY: The fraud-on-the-market theory, 

2 however, is a substantive theory. It's not a procedural 

3 doctrine. To be sure, one of the practical consequences 

4 is it allows classes to be certified, but it's a means 

of proving reliance in an impersonal market in which 

6 investors trade today. 

7  What the Court did in Basic was adapt the 

8 direct reliance concept which envisioned face-to-face 

9 transactions to the impersonal market. And so with 

respect to actually proving a fraud on the market, 

11 you're absolutely right, but what we're talking about 

12 here is not whether a fraud on the market can be proven; 

13 we're talking about whether common issues predominate 

14 over individual issues. 

And Petitioners still fail to point to any 

16 individual issue that would come into play in a case 

17 where materiality is not able to be shown. None would 

18 because materiality would kill the case for all. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Materiality is a common 

issue. Reliance is only a common issue if you accept 

21 the fraud-on-the-market theory. That's the problem. 

22 And you are using the one, which is a common issue, to 

23 leapfrog into the second, to make the -- the efficiency 

24 of the market reasoning something that it isn't. 

MS. SHERRY: With all due respect, the two

1 really do collapse into one. Once you've proven that 

2 the market is efficient and once you've proven that the 

3 statements are public, you're asking the same question. 

4 You can call it reliance, or you can call it 

materiality. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that then -- that 

7 imparts the question of 24 years of economic 

8 scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since 

9 Basic was decided -- has shown that the -- the efficient 

market theory is -- is really -- really an 

11 overgeneralization. It could be much more subtle than 

12 that and so you have an advanced theory. But you want 

13 us to ignore that. 

14  MS. SHERRY: No, I -- a couple responses to 

that. The first one is the one that my colleague made, 

16 which is that market efficiency isn't disputed here. It 

17 was conceded in the answer at paragraph 199. And not 

18 only is it not -- is it not contested here, Petitioners 

19 actually embrace an efficient market, in 

order to pursue their truth-on-the-market defense. 

21  And so my first response would be that's not 

22 something to be addressed in this case. And my second 

23 response is Basic didn't adopt any particular economic 

24 model of market efficiency. If you look at footnote 24 

of Basic, if you look at footnote 28 of Basic, the Court 

43
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 makes very clear that it's not adopting an economic 


2 theory, as far as how quickly or completely the 


3 information is incorporated into the market price. 


4  Instead, it was looking at congressional 


intent, it was looking at difficulties in direct proof, 

6 and it was looking at common sense to reach a result and 

7 again to adapt a reliance theory that was premised on 

8 face-to-face transactions to the impersonal market that 

9 exists today. 

And so, again, I wouldn't consider market 

11 efficiency in this case. It's not presented. To the 

12 extent there's questions about how the determinations 

13 should be made in terms of levels of generality, that's 

14 something that the lower courts can decide. 

Today, all we're talking about is the 

16 materiality component and, again, focusing on whether or 

17 not common issues predominate over individual issues. 

18 It's a comparative inquiry. It requires comparing 

19 common issues on the one hand and individual issues on 

the other. And Petitioners have not identified any 

21 individual issues that will actually come into play as 

22 the case is litigated. 

23  The -- going to the -- some of the policy 

24 concerns that were raised, I'd make a couple points. 

One is the one that my colleague made. Congress 

44
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 addressed those policy concerns in the PSLRA, in SLUSA, 

2 and it chose to address them through different means. 

3  The second point I would make is the same 

4 argument could be made with respect to the other 

elements of the securities fraud cause of action. If 

6 the argument is you should have to prove it at class 

7 certification because, otherwise, the case is going to 

8 settle, you could say the same thing with respect to 

9 scienter, with respect to falsity, with respect to loss 

causation, which this Court in Erica John, of course, 

11 said did not have to be proven at the class 

12 certification stage. So in short, it proves too much. 

13  The third response is that there are 

14 countervailing policy concerns, and there are 

countervailing concerns that are actually tethered to 

16 Rule 23 in terms of efficiency. 

17  Excuse me. Petitioners --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you 

19 agree that you have to show materiality to rely on the 

fraud-on-the-market theory to establish reliance? 

21  MS. SHERRY: As a substantive matter on the 

22 merits, yes. It is a predicate. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I don't 

24 understand why that is. If you're trying to show 

reliance, and you show that it's an efficient market, 

45
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 and that the information was -- was public, doesn't that 

2 show reliance without regard to whether the statement's 

3 material or not? 

4  MS. SHERRY: I think, in terms of 

transaction causation, what you're -- and reliance is 

6 referred to as transaction causation -- what you're 

7 trying to show is whether or not the information 

8 affected or distorted the market price. And in order to 

9 show price distortion, it does require that the 

information be material. And so we accept that in terms 

11 of the fraud-on-the-market theory --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or, to put it differently, 

13 an efficient market is a market that takes account of 

14 material factors, right? 

MS. SHERRY: I -- I would say it's --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not an efficient 

17 market if it's -- you know -- it's -- who knows, random? 

18 It takes account of material factors. 

19  MS. SHERRY: I would make a minor quibble on 

that. I would say that the market takes account of all 

21 public information, but it only -- it only moves based 

22 on material information, so that's exactly right. And 

23 so our issue is not with the predicates for the 

24 fraud-on-the-market theory. 

Our issue is with Petitioners equating the 

46
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

20

25

Official 

1 predicates from the fraud-on-the-market theory with the 

2 actual prerequisites of Rule 23. And this Court made it 

3 very clear, in Shady Grove, that the only question at 

4 the Rule 23 stage is whether the prerequisites have been 

met. The only one that we're talking about here is 

6 predominance. It's a comparative inquiry between common 

7 issues and individual issues. 

8  And if I can quickly go back to my point 

9 about countervailing policy concerns, as Petitioners 

acknowledge, a determination at the class certification 

11 stage is not binding on anybody -- in that case on the 

12 ultimate fact-finder, or in any other case. 

13  And so the problem with Petitioners' 

14 position is that it would require relitigation of the 

materiality question at the merits stage to the extent 

16 the class is certified or, if it's not, in every other 

17 case that is brought on the same issue. That doesn't 

18 serve the efficiency purposes that underlie Rule 23. 

19  The -- in terms of absent class members, he 

suggests that absent class members would somehow be 

21 prejudiced, but as Your Honor, Justice Kagan, pointed 

22 out, the only prejudice is that they wouldn't be able to 

23 relitigate the very same issue. That is protected by 

24 allowing opt out. That is protected by Rule 23's 

adequacy of representation requirement.

1  And so that's already sufficiently 

2 protected. The most efficient course is to actually 

3 focus on common issues. Materiality is a common issue. 

4 It will result in the same answer for all. The class 

rises or falls together. And class certification is not 

6 about only certifying meritorious cases. 

7  In 1966, when the current version of Rule 

8 23(b)(3) was adopted, it was an innovation. It was a 

9 change from the spurious class actions, where it was a 

one-way ratchet, where only the defendant was bound. In 

11 the current version of Rule 23(b)(3), you want to 

12 certify class actions that are both meritorious and 

13 those that are not, so that it reaches a binding 

14 judgment.

The advisory committee notes to the very

24 kinds or degrees of reliance by the persons to whom they 

were addressed."

1  That is this case. The anomaly of our -- my 

2 friend's position is they concede that materiality is a 

3 predicate for class reliance. They agree that, unless 

4 the statement is material, however efficient the market, 

however loudly the statement was published, there is no 

6 detrimental reliance on the integrity of the market 

7 price. 

8  Reliance can only be approved -- and, 

9 Justice Breyer, this goes to your traditional paradigm 

case -- in the paradigm case, reliance was proven by the 

11 fact that you heard the statement and you did something 

12 in reliance on it, to your detriment. 

13  The innovation of Basic, and the notion that 

14 Basic didn't say anything about class certification 

under Rule 23 is astonishing, given the fact that the 

16 whole reason that the question of the 

17 fraud-on-the-market theory was presented, was the 

18 inquiry about whether there could be -- whether the 

19 traditional bilateral method of proving detrimental 

reliance on a statement could be aggregated into a 

21 ginormous class by allowing everyone to say, well, we 

22 relied on the integrity of the market price and a 

23 material misstatement -- a material statement affected 

24 that price. 

They said, "could have" --

3 Joe -- Farmer Jones comes in, you have to show it's 

4 false? You have to show it's material. And then you 

show the reliance that he did something on that basis. 

6  MR. WAXMAN: Right. Those --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: So the materiality was not 

8 part of reliance. Materiality was an element that was 

9 always proved, and then you went on to show reliance. 

MR. WAXMAN: Exactly right. And what the 

11 Court in Basic could have said, Justice Breyer, was, 

12 forget the fraud-on-the-market theory; we are going to 

13 absolve -- we are going to say that, for 10b-5 actions, 

14 you don't have to prove reliance directly on the 

statement. 

16  We are going to allow you to -- we -- we 

17 posit that investors rely in common on the integrity of 

18 the market price; and if you can demonstrate to us that 

19 a challenged statement moved the market -- if there was 

market effect, we will allow you to proceed as a class; 

21 because then the common answer to the common question, 

22 how are you going to prove reliance, is we are going to 

23 prove it all the same way because investors rely on the 

24 integrity of the market price.

1 that the market misstatement affected the market price. 

2 But the Court in Basic went further in the direction of 

3 class plaintiffs and said, you don't have to prove that 

4 directly. 

All you have to prove -- we will allow that 

6 to be presumed, if you can demonstrate, without 

7 effective rebuttal, four things: the statement was of a 

8 type that the market would care about; the statement was 

9 made publicly in an efficient market; and the trading 

occurred during the period between the misstatement and 

11 the correction --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that we want 

13 to prove it upfront in the 23, rather than wait till the 

14 merits, where it will be argued anyway in exactly the 

same way -- the reason that we want to do it first is, 

16 since it's going to be there anyway and going to be 

17 litigated anyway, unlike publicity, unlike efficiency, 

18 but the reason we take this one and run it upfront is? 

19 And it can't be the answer we should litigate everything 

before we litigate anything. 

21  MR. WAXMAN: Of course not. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So -- so what's the
