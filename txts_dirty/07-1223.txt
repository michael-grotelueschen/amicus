 (11:15 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-1223, Bell versus Kelly.

 Mr. Bress.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BRESS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The problem at the heart of this case is 

construing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254 

together in a way that makes sense. The last time that 

this Court construed those two provisions together was 

in Michael Williams. Michael Williams presented a 

different issue.

 But we believe that looking at how Michael 

Williams would play out with a small change in the facts 

will help frame the issue that's before the court today.

 Now, as the Court recalls, in Michael 

Williams the Virginia Supreme Court denied Williams the 

investigative assistance he needed in order to help 

develop a claim based on his suspicions of jury 

misconduct. He, therefore, didn't make the claim in 

State court.

 On -- in Federal court he got investigative

assistance; and, in speaking with the investigator, two 

of the jurors referred to the foreperson, Bonnie 

Stinette, as Bonnie Minehart.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Bress, before we get 

into that, could I just ask you a threshold question? 

We took this case to decide a question, and one of the 

factual predicates of the question is that the State 

court refused to consider certain evidence. And I'm 

puzzled about that.

 What was the evidence that the State court 

-- do you say that the State court refused to consider 

evidence that was proffered to it?

 MR. BRESS: No, Your Honor. The State court 

did not refuse to consider evidence proffered to it. 

The State court refused to permit the full development 

of the evidence. And it -- I mean it misled the court 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't hear the -- the 

last part.

 MR. BRESS: The State court refused to 

permit the evidence to be fully developed, Your Honor. 

They didn't refuse to consider evidence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you mean by that? 

What specifically did they --

MR. BRESS: Specifically, Your Honor, the

State provided 120 days to develop the State habeas 

petition. The Petitioners during that time developed 14 

different claims, including the claim that's at issue 

here today.

 In the course of that they interviewed, I 

think, 11 different witnesses. For the ineffective-

assistance-of-counsel claim they got affidavits. They 

also interviewed all 12 jurors for five different claims 

of juror misconduct. They interviewed five different 

witnesses for Brady claims, et cetera.

 They ran out of time, Your Honor, and they 

asked the court for more time on repeated occasions. 

They asked the court to investigate --

JUSTICE ALITO: But that really does not 

present the question that you asked the Court to decide.

 MR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor, if you read it 

that way, it would not, but I don't read the question 

presented that way. I read the question presented to 

present the question of when the district court properly 

hears evidence after a finding of diligence by the 

prisoner and holds that the State court didn't provide a 

full and fair opportunity to that prisoner to develop 

the facts in State court, that where the evidence is 

important the -- the district court may consider that 

evidence, rather than giving deference to the State

court.

 And giving deference to the State court is 

not even on the table any longer in this case. It was 

-- what the Fourth Circuit did, the Fourth Circuit took 

the new evidence into account and deferred to the State 

court nonetheless.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he have 

brought that new evidence to the attention of the State 

court first? Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the 

attention of the State court?

 MR. BRESS: He didn't have the new evidence, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he could have a 

post-conviction proceeding in the State court.

 MR. BRESS: Actually, no, he couldn't, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A State habeas.

 MR. BRESS: I'm sorry. The -- as the 

Virginia Commonwealth attorneys point out in their 

amicus brief, there is a rule in the Virginia State 

court that any facts not set out in the habeas petition 

at the State level can't be brought in later. He wasn't 

able to bring the facts in afterwards.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, weren't the 

facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was

before the State court?

 MR. BRESS: No, they weren't, Your Honor. 

There were three categories of new facts or new evidence 

that came in on Federal habeas.

 And if I may, the first -- the first of them 

had to do with facts that undermined the State's claim 

of aggravation. The State relied on only one 

aggravating factor. That was future dangerousness. And 

in the course of that, in developing it, their number 

one emphasis was on one adjudicated -- unadjudicated bad 

act, and this was a story told by Billy Jo Swartz about 

an alleged horrific assault on her and of Tracy 

Nicholson, who was a girlfriend of the Petitioner.

 What the jury didn't know at the time was 

that both Tracy and her mother, who were there, said 

that the incident did not occur, that there was no 

assault there, and Billy Jo Swartz was a liar.

 Now, on State habeas, Joanne did submit an 

affidavit and, in that affidavit, said that Billy Jo 

Swartz had lied. That created a dispute of fact at the 

State level, but unfortunately rather than hear the 

witnesses to determine the credibility and -- the 

Virginia Supreme Court instead decided against 

Petitioner.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that

supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was 

cumulative. There was a dispute on that issue. There 

was evidence on both sides. And now you say, hey, we've 

got more evidence.

 MR. BRESS: Well, it's not more evidence, 

Your Honor; it's just that a dispute over the facts 

where credibility is at issue shouldn't be decided on 

the papers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Virginia Supreme 

Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true 

all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them. They said 

specifically "all facts alleged in the petition will be 

taken as true."

 MR. BRESS: And if they had done that, Your 

Honor, I think that we'd be in a different position.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said they did.

 MR. BRESS: They said, on the one hand, they 

did, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking, 

for example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said 

she could have been effectively impeached by other 

statements that she had made, that in their household, 

she had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her 

daughter. Now, Joanne Nicholson and Tracy Nicholson 

have said throughout that he was never physically 

abusive to Tracy. The supposed impeachment would have

come from police court records that have never been 

introduced in this case. So the Virginia Supreme Court, 

without a hearing, just said, on the one hand, we accept 

these facts as true and, on the other hand, even though 

Joanne Nicholson would testify that this event never 

occurred that way, she would have been impeached so the 

jury wouldn't have believed it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, your argument is 

dependent on the proposition that the claim that was 

advanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different 

claim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in 

the State court?

 MR. BRESS: That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And if that's the case, I 

don't understand why your adversary is not correct that 

it will always be possible in capital cases for an 

ineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been 

adjudicated on the merits in the State court to be 

advanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where 

every aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially 

favorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation. 

You know, when your firm with all of its expertise and 

resources comes into the case at the Federal habeas 

level, will it not always be the case that you will be 

able to find some additional mitigation evidence and

then, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it 

well get de novo review?

 MR. BRESS: I'd like to answer that 

question, Justice Alito, in two ways: One very 

practical, which is that the Ninth and Tenth Circuits 

have adopted the rule that we advocated for years. The 

Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have adopted that 

rule for Brady claims, and we haven't seen the flood 

that supposedly is going to come through the gates.

 Secondly, on a more theoretical level, for 

someone to be able to introduce this new evidence on 

Federal habeas, they have to first be able to 

demonstrate that they were diligent in attempting 

formulate it in the State court. Second, they've got to 

be able to demonstrate that it's important and 

importantly changes the overall factual mix. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't get the diligence 

part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel 

is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's 

counsel that's been ineffective.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, I'm referring to 

Michael Williams, which talks about diligence by the 

State habeas counsel.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it doesn't translate 

into ineffective assistance of counsel because the

client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not 

been diligent, but there is nothing that the client 

could do. I just don't see how --

MR. BRESS: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how you could talk 

about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up 

the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, we understand and 

appreciate the diligence of habeas counsel is not any 

kind of excuse and can't be -- statutorily it can't be, 

actually under 2554, but what we are talking about is 

whether the prisoner and his counsel were diligent in 

seeking to develop the facts for their claim when they 

were on State habeas. That's what Michael Williams had 

to do with it. Michael Williams equated diligence with 

reasonable efforts and said that the contrary would be 

negligence.

 In this case we've got a finding by the 

district court that Bell and his lawyers were diligent 

in seeking to develop their ineffective assistance of 

counsel claim at State habeas. And that's what allows 

them under (e), that's what says that they didn't fail 

to develop the evidence under (e)(2) and allows them to 

go through the gate of (e).

 Now, in order to get here, you have to

demonstrate that diligence. You also have to 

demonstrate that you're able to develop new facts that 

matter, that are important, that are significant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you use the -- to say 

that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be, 

right, but it's such an extraordinary use of "claim." I 

mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a 

tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional 

evidence in support of the basic claim. The basic claim 

is ineffective assistance of counsel.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, I appreciate that 

it's not "claim" as it's used ordinarily in the Rules of 

Civil Procedure or when you're talking about making 

claims in that sort of a complaint. However, this 

Court, including an opinion -- Banks v. Dretke, for 

example, talked about the two different Brady claims in 

that case as separate claims, even though they were 

withholdings by the same prosecutor. More closely even, 

in Michael Williams, there were two separate 

withholdings of evidence to impeach the same witness.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I'm trying 

to figure out how the statute works.

 MR. BRESS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it seems to me that the 

way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way,

the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen? 

No? Okay. Forget that. I was going to shorthand that 

because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking 

of.

 What happens is that the -- the State court 

now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and 

you don't prevail. All right. Now, he goes into 

Federal court and he has some new facts. Now, either 

they are such that they transform the claim and it's a 

new claim. I mean, in that case there is an argument 

for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't. Now, if 

they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge, 

is go look and decide on the basis of what they 

presented to the State. That's the end of it.

 Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust. 

You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other 

new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see 

if there was cause and prejudice. And that's how it's 

supposed to work. And if there was cause and prejudice, 

then you have the hearing. Okay? That's how it's 

supposed to work factually.

 I have no idea if that's what went on here, 

but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some 

confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in 

the State. Then there is some other thing that this

might be the same claim. I mean, I don't see how we get 

to the question we took this case to decide, frankly, 

without knowing what the basis was and whether it was 

correct for the district court to give him any hearing 

at all.

 MR. BRESS: Okay, Your Honor. I'd like to 

address that. I think that that's essentially how this 

works in this case. What the district -- what the 

district court did here is it first made a finding of 

was there diligence? Because it has to do that under 

Michael Williams to even take the next step. Did the 

Petitioner --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the first step. The 

first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go 

ahead.

 MR. BRESS: Right. But it had to take that 

step. And it had to take that step, by the way, of 

course, with (d) in mind as well, because this Court in 

Schriro said there is no reason to have hearing if it is 

separately precluded by another predicate. In Schriro, 

obviously, it was the refusal to -- to allow mitigating 

evidence. So it does that. Then it determines 

separately under Townsend, was there a problem in State 

court that -- did you have a full and fair hearing, and 

if you can prove the facts that you state, would you

win, and so those allowed the court the discretion to 

hold a hearing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why wouldn't you say 

right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State 

court, and exhausts it?

 MR. BRESS: Well this couldn't have been 

presented in the State court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?

 MR. BRESS: Well as the State argued below, 

it would have been procedurally deficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Suppose we 

have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want 

the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered 

this, because the first time that the district attorney 

opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after. 

So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have 

gotten; no one disputes it. Where, that kind of 

thing -- I think he would have to present it to the 

State court, wouldn't he?

 MR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor, according to 

the warden at least, in this case if you took let's say 

the facts of Banks v Dretke, which this Court decided, 

where when you were in front of the State court, what 

you knew was that the girlfriend of the prisoner had 

said that one of the witnesses was particularly close to

law enforcement, and on that basis they made a claim, a 

Brady claim in State court. It was denied because it 

wasn't factually developed enough, all right?

 So they went to Federal court and in Federal 

court they got a lot more evidence that supported that 

claim. They actually found out that in fact this person 

was a Government informant, and on that basis this Court 

found cause and prejudice and addressed that that 

claim --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you must have been 

assuming then that the State would not give that person 

a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.

 MR. BRESS: Well, that's absolutely true --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it were really new.

 MR. BRESS: The State statute is 

unequivocal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but so is it in 

Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where 

you could bring the thing up because you couldn't 

possibly have gotten over it.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, there is no 

exception here in Virginia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So in Virginia a person 

discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at 

the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the

whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something 

unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under 

Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?

 MR. BRESS: Not in this sort of a claim. 

No, Your Honor, there isn't.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bress, your --

you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes 

that it is a new claim rather than the same claim, 

right? Because if it were just the same claim then the 

question would be it is simply cumulative rather than 

new?

 MR. BRESS: If it's the same claim for 

2254(d) purposes, yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I guess 

it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question. We usually 

don't consider claims different if there is just new 

evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily 

determine that this was the same claim in deciding to 

defer to the State court findings?

 MR. BRESS: Yes, it did, Your Honor. The 

Fourth Circuit viewed this as the same claim and that's 

the root of some of our disagreement with them.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if fact you got 

more than you were entitled to, because it did look at 

the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference,

but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor. We would agree that 

that -- that interim solution is not a plausible 

solution, so we would agree with that, on the new 

evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we think that 

they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting 

away from the question presented -- if we agree that 

they are right, that this is the same claim and it's 

just additional evidence, then you lose.

 MR. BRESS: No, not necessarily, Your Honor. 

We also argued on separate grounds where the State's 

procedure is inadequate, then the -- the State's 

application of -- of Federal law would have been 

unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bress, may I ask you a 

question --

MR. BRESS: And if that's true --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question 

which sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue 

here, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question. 

But --

MR. BRESS: Sure.

-- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based 

on the evidence before it, no deference to the State 

court, that in fact your client did not demonstrate 

prejudice. And my understanding is that that --

although the Fourth Circuit did not rely upon that, my 

understanding is that that -- that finding remains 

undisturbed. Is that correct?

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, what the district 

court found, as the Fourth Circuit saw it and as we see 

it, was that the State court's finding of prejudice was 

not unreasonable. Now, I acknowledge that when you read 

the district court's oral ruling you won't see a 

reference to 2254(d).

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No.

 MR. BRESS: However, when you look at what 

the State court wrote in its written ruling, what it 

says is there is a colorable claim that the State court 

was unreasonable, on -- in application of law to the 

facts and development of the facts, and then it said 

that they will -- that the court would not decide this 

issue yet, until it has a hearing; and so the Fourth 

Circuit looked at what the district court wrote and 

presumed that consistent with what it had written, it 

then confronted this issue, the issue of reasonability, 

orally; and it didn't require that when a judge is

saying something orally, as opposed to putting it in a 

written opinion, that it dot every i and cross every t. 

It assumed that it meant what it had said earlier. If 

this Court has any doubt about that, however, it could 

certainly remand with instructions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I that what it was saying 

is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question. 

Strickland has two parts. Part A is were counsel 

inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference? 

It seemed to me the district court was just making a 

straight out Strickland determination and not deferring 

to anything else. It was just saying no, I've looked at 

all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they 

were not effective. On the other hand, there is no 

prejudice because using the strict Strickland test, 

there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would 

have come out differently.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, consistent with the 

Fourth Circuit, we don't read him to say that. But even 

if he meant that, the Fourth Circuit certainly on --

looked at this from a reasonableness standpoint, and not 

from a de novo standpoint. So even had the district 

court meant a de novo review and engaged in it, we still 

didn't get the correct standard or review on appeal.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, that may be. I didn't

mean to imply you didn't have a Fourth Circuit question. 

I -- I guess I was raising a question to whether it is 

wise to make this the case to decide the Fourth Circuit 

issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bress, this case 

involves Section 2254(d), right? Does that appear 

somewhere in the briefs? It would be nice to have it in 

front of me.

 MR. BRESS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's a central 

thing the case is about. I cannot find it in any of the 

briefs. Appendix to the petition for cert; I got -- I 

got to go back to that. Don't you think it's important 

enough to be in your brief?

 MR. BRESS: If I may return to the Chief 

Judge's -- Chief Justice's question from earlier, there 

are other new claims, new facts here that are equally 

important in deciding whether this is a new claim. For 

example, physical child abuse first came into this case, 

and really was first discovered --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but they're 

-- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of 

new evidence, that somehow changes the claim. And 

again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble 

getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's

problematic in this area where there is always new 

evidence.

 You're looking at someone's childhood. You 

can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going 

either way, that you know, this was unusual because he 

was a good child, or this is excused because he had such 

a bad upbringing.

 MR. BRESS: Mr. Chief Justice, two responses 

to this. Number one -- and you know, as I've said 

before, this Court has used claim I think in similar 

ways. It may have been colloquial but it at least 

demonstrates that it can use it.

 I'm not saying it's the most normal, or the 

ordinary course definition, but I am saying that it's 

the definition that's necessary to read (d) and (e) 

together in a way that makes sense; and if I can just 

explain why I think that's true.

 If you look at (e), (e) says that you can 

get a hearing even if you weren't diligent in State 

court, if the facts that you need to develop were not 

reasonably available in State court and if they would 

prove by clear and convincing evidence that you are 

innocent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, well

fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present 

the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you 

get the evidence you have a new claim. It just means 

that they are going to let you raise a claim you could 

have raised before.

 MR. BRESS: Well, if what they are talking 

about is -- if that includes the ability when you are in 

State court -- assume, for instance, House versus Bell, 

just if can take that as an example.

 I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I've gotten over it.

 MR. BRESS: I don't know, but if we can --

if we can just look at the facts of that case briefly: 

Assume that in State court, despite diligent a effort, 

they were able to come up with some of the evidence but 

not all of the evidence that they later came up with in 

terms of the blood spattering, the DNA, and such.

 Their claim is denied on the -- on the 

merits because they weren't able to get much of the 

evidence in and denied in State courts. They couldn't 

go to Federal courts where they were able to bring in 

all of that evidence, and let's say even more, enough to 

prove by clear and convincing evidence that they were 

innocent.

to the State court opinion and decide whether it was 

intrinsically reasonable. And so long as it is, you 

wouldn't -- the State court gets affirmed, and none of 

that new evidence of innocence comes in.

 Now, I guess it's a possible solution, but 

the question is: Is that what Congress really intended 

here?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I might say the new claim 

-- okay, so it's a new claim. I don't know if yours is, 

by the way, but suppose it's a new claim. Then what you 

ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust. 

So now what you show is that that's futile.

 Now we get to your question before us. 

Okay. So it's an imaginary case. It's less imaginary 

in December than here. But, anyway, the -- the -- you 

get back to the State court. Now, what is supposed to 

happen?

 At that point I guess the statute leaves the 

judge free to develop the facts. It doesn't say you 

can't. Okay. So then you do it.

 Now we have the question, which when we took 

this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we 

can -- now we have the question: When the judge makes 

the decision on the basis of those facts, if they have 

never developed any of this in State court, fine. Then

have -- then just do it. If it is a regular case, don't 

defer it.

 But suppose some of the things have been in 

State court related to this but not others. Now what do 

we do?

 MR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean that's not an 

obvious answer to that one.

 MR. BRESS: I -- I think that in -- in that 

case, by the way, you still have to defer to the State 

factfinding. I think you always have to when the State 

determines particular facts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What it's going to do is 

it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain 

evidence. And what you will have gotten your new claim 

granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence 

that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have 

found it before.

 Now what do we do? Do we defer in part; do 

we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?

 MR. BRESS: Well, I think that, again, you 

have to defer under (e)(1) presumably to particular fact 

findings and find that by clear and convincing evidence 

you've disproved those facts. But, otherwise, I don't 

think you could find the application of law to fact. I

don't think you can under Holland, et cetera.

 Now, you know, just to make this a little 

bit clearer, hopefully, in -- in Keeney, upon which this 

Court drew in Michael Williams, the Court looked -- the 

Court did -- looked at a potential distinction between 

the failure properly to make a claim in State court and 

the failure properly to develop the facts for that 

claim.

 Now, the Court looked at that distinction in 

the context of seeing whether cause and prejudice, which 

applied to certainly the major claim in the State court, 

should apply to the failure to fully develop it. And 

what it said is that distinguishing between those two 

circumstances is irrational.

 Now, I would submit that it's similarly 

irrational to attribute to Congress the intent to 

distinguish between the circumstances, or because of 

these limitations you have in State court, despite your 

effort, you weren't able to fully develop the record.

 And the State decided the case on an 

inadequate record. It comes to Federal court. Do you 

simply defer? I mean do you simply stop when you say 

the State court reasonably decided this case based on an 

inadequate State court record, or do you allow that 

record to be fully developed and decide it on its

merits?

 That's, I think, the issue that we are 

presenting today. I'd like to reserve --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just ask one quick 

question? The -- the answer, I take it, on -- based on 

what you just said, the answer to the -- the need-

to-exhaust point is you don't have to exhaust because 

you already tried to exhaust in the State court, and 

they didn't give you enough time to get your evidence 

in. That is --

MR. BRESS: That's precisely it, Your Honor. 

Thank you.

Mr. Bress.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE BURNETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. BURNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The claim in Bell's case is the textbook 

example of a claim that the effective death penalty 

intended for 2254(d) to apply to. In the Virginia 

Supreme Court, Bell presented his claim with his 

allegations of what he says counsel didn't present and 

didn't find at trial. And the Virginia Supreme Court

assumed the truth of all of those allegations and did 

not contest any of them. There were never any facts in 

dispute. The State never contested any facts.

 The State court assumed them all true, and 

then applied -- faithfully applied this Court's 

established precedent under Strickland and Wiggins, in 

particular, and weighed that evidence that he had 

claimed had not been found by his counsel against the 

aggravating evidence in this case of a drug dealer who 

killed premeditatedly a police officer in a small town 

and upon weighing that found as a -- as a matter -- as a 

de novo matter on the merits that he could not show 

prejudice. Because there was no reasonable probability 

that a jury would have found a life sentence giving --

assuming the truth of everything he alleged.

 Now, when he went to Federal court, the 

Fourth Circuit faithfully applied 2254(d) to that after 

addressing all of the same evidence and also agreeing 

that there was no prejudice, and then said that the 

State court decision was not unreasonable under 2254(d).

 Now, Bell comes to this Court and says for 

the first time that I have a new claim, and that was not 

made below, and this is not a new claim. Everything 

that he presented in Federal court was presented to the 

State court. There is absolutely no difference. In

fact, to the effect that there was some difference in 

the district court and the State alleged -- we pleaded 

default because he presented a few new affidavits.

 The district court resolved that and said: 

I'm not even going to look at those because they aren't 

critical to my decision. I am only going to look at --

and he described in particular the exact same record 

that the Virginia Supreme Court had found. And then the 

district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the 

point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time 

in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop 

everything that was later put before the district court; 

that there was a very short time to get the petition in, 

and there were many issues other than ineffective 

assistance of counsel?

 MS. BURNETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, there 

were approximately 12 issues in this case that the 

district court disposed of in a very lengthy opinion. 

It was only this one issue that the district court found 

-- believed that he needed to have a hearing on, we 

believe erroneously. But, nevertheless, he had the 

hearing and -- and listened to all the same evidence.

 Nothing, Justice Ginsburg -- in our opinion 

nothing prevented Bell from presenting the allegations

that were presented to the Federal court and all the 

allegations that he presented to the State court. There 

was no State court procedure or denial of anything.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did he make any request 

from the State court for more time?

 MS. BURNETT: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Your brother is nodding 

yes.

 MS. BURNETT: He may very well have, but the 

point is that there was nothing that he presented to the 

Federal court that he didn't also present to the State 

court. So he was not prevented from -- that -- that's a 

red herring in this case.

 Now, he had some very strong arguments that 

he made in both the State court and in the district 

court on other claims; not on this claim but on other 

claims, that he believed that he should have been able 

to develop certain evidence. And the district court 

actually on those other claims -- some of them, it found 

faulted and some not. But not on this claim. On this 

claim --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If we had -- if we had --

and I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is 

your case. But if we had a case in which with respect

to the disputed issue he had asked for more time -- I'll 

make it easy. He had asked for more time and -- and had 

-- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be 

followed that couldn't be followed unless he got more 

time and so on, and the State court refused. Could he 

then come into the Federal court and say: My claim here 

is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective 

assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State 

courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my 

-- my ineffective assistance claim? And if he made a 

colorable showing on those two issues, would he then 

have an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and 

would the findings that eventuated from that be subject 

to -- in effect, to -- to being short- circuited by 

deference to the State court findings?

 MS. BURNETT: I think my answer to that has 

to be that it depends because the statute before the 

effective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what 

we would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which 

would you look at the adequacy of a State court process. 

Those were removed after 1996, so the statute does not 

provide authority for a Federal court to go in and 

determine was the process adequate if the decision, 

itself, was reasonable. Now if we are talking -- this 

is why this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you don't -- I guess 

what I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance 

recognize that there is a legitimately different claim 

which is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress, 

not subject to further exhaustion requirements because 

they tried and the State court wouldn't let them do 

it -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a 

claim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which 

will not be subject to deference to State court 

findings, then there is a very clear hole in the law, 

and I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it. I 

understand you're saying that is not this case. But 

isn't that a legitimate problem to-- to face at some 

point.

 MS. BURNETT: Justice Souter, we don't 

believe so and here's why: Because it is true, Congress 

did not change the procedural default doctrine. In the 

Effective Death Penalty Act Congress left that alone. 

In fact, this Court recognized that in House v. Bell. 

So when we are talking about new facts or new claims, 

either one, you're talking about unexhausted or 

defaulted matters, which the district courts are very 

familiar how to handle that. Has he shown cause and 

prejudice? Has he shown diligence?

main. I think that's generally correct. The case that 

I'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady 

claim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I 

understand the cause and prejudice can only be 

established in the case we are talking about if there 

can be shown a probability of a different verdict.

 The Brady standard, however, does not 

require the probability of a different verdict. Brady 

uses the term "reasonable probability that there would 

have been a different result," but that has been clearly 

defined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility. So 

that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e) 

is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a 

higher requirement than would have been applied before 

Brady. And that is the case, it seems to me, that we --

it may not be this case, but that's the case that we've 

got to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine 

here. Isn't that a legitimate concern?

 MS. BURNETT: Justice Souter -- and I agree 

that's not this case. But this Court's already crossed 

that bridge. That was Michael Williams. Michael 

Williams was where the individual comes to Federal court 

with brand new evidence and he has no remedy left in 

State court. It is defaulted, and what do we do with 

that? And this Court very clearly -- now, as the issue

was presented to this Court in that case it was whether 

he gets a hearing or not, so that's what was addressed. 

But this Court also addressed the fact that it most 

likely was and was a defaulted claim and that it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I don't, I don't think 

this Court understood the implication of it when you get 

into the Brady issue. And my only concern is we've got 

to leave that door open because I don't think Williams 

confronted that.

 MS. BURNETT: And I -- I agree with Your 

Honor that it's not this case. I think Michael Williams 

addresses it and I think that the current existing in 

place cause and prejudice and actual innocence 

exceptions to default answer all of that. And I believe 

that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand your position.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm still trying to 

understand the statute. I think their point is we get 

around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district 

court here, the Federal district court, found that it 

was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not 

unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because 

of the procedure. In other words, the State that barred 

this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and 

therefore the determination of the facts is

unreasonable. So you're saying that isn't what those 

words "unreasonable determination of the facts" mean.

 MS. BURNETT: Well, what I'm saying --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean you're saying that 

(d)(2), "unreasonable determination of the facts," means 

the factual outcome. In other words, if the factual 

outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the 

procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.

 MS. BURNETT: Well, no. I believe that --

JUSTICE BREYER: No? I thought you just 

said that in answer to Justice Souter.

 MS. BURNETT: I believe that (d)(2) very 

clearly -- yes, I think I'm agreeing with you that 

(d)(2) addresses the actual facts which underlay the 

State court decision.

procedures are correct?

They say we are rid of (e) because of that. Now, how 

they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't 

in the case.

 MS. BURNETT: Justice Breyer, I'm not sure 

they they've argued those exceptions (a)(2) at (i) and 

(ii). I believe they're simply arguing --

JUSTICE BREYER: They're arguing due 

diligence.

 MS. BURNETT: My reading of their brief is 

they are saying: We are Michael Williams and all 

Michael Williams dealt with was the opening sentence of 

(e)(2).

 JUSTICE BREYER: (I). You mean of (e)(2) --

MS. BURNETT: Of (e)(2).

 JUSTICE BREYER: (E)(2).

 MS. BURNETT: "If the applicant has failed 

to develop," and Michael Williams interpreted that as 

someone who has not been diligent in developing the 

record.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we also get --

they get around that because they say the due diligence. 

You also have an argument about how (2) applies. And if 

you're wrong about both of those then we get to the 

question, which would be: If the -- if the hearing's

properly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also 

saying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to 

be exhausted. So under Virginia law, under Virginia 

law, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case, 

but suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA 

says, makes some remark. He couldn't have known about 

it. He goes to a special file. He couldn't have found 

out about. And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you 

can imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones 

but this is even worse. Now under Virginia law are 

you -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say 

you're out of luck, good-bye?

 MS. BURNETT: Yes, Your Honor, and this 

Court has recognized that --

JUSTICE BREYER: No matter what, it's 

goodbye?

 MS. BURNETT: Yes, and here's why: Because 

Virginia has twin statutes that would bar any further 

applications to State court. One is the statute of 

limitations that is strictly applied and the other is a 

statute which says in essence --

JUSTICE BREYER: No excuse? Even if --

MS. BURNETT: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER: So they are right about, 

they are right about the exhaustion being futile.

 MS. BURNETT: It is defaulted, yes, Your 

Honor. In Virginia those are defaulted claims, and now 

we are in Federal court with those claims. The Federal 

court judges are very familiar with how to do with them. 

Has he shown cause and prejudice?

 JUSTICE BREYER: The first time he discovers 

DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't 

have done it, there is no way to get relief under 

Virginia law?

 MS. BURNETT: Not in State court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Not in State court.

 MS. BURNETT: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then they're right 

about that.

 MS. BURNETT: That's correct. So now he is 

in Federal court and he has -- he has the thresholds of 

cause and prejudice or actual innocence. And that's a 

very familiar thing, is what I'm saying, is that the 

district courts are familiar with.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then let me ask you 

on the merits. If he's right there and it's exhaustion 

and it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a 

decision that does not defer to the State court, because

after all the State court never heard this issue?

 MS. BURNETT: That's not this case. But in 

a hypothetical case where there are new facts, 

unexhausted defaulted claims or facts that are presented 

to a Federal court --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. There is no real 

argument between the two of you as to the -- as to the 

issue that we thought was presented.

 MS. BURNETT: Well, I think not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But there's certainly an 

argument --

MS. BURNETT: The argument is --

JUSTICE BREYER: If it's really a new claim, 

you're going to say they applied --

MS. BURNETT: Well, our argument is that, 

Court, don't use this case to say that, because if the 

Court uses this case to say that it will be putting its 

imprimatur on what the district court did in holding a 

hearing when we don't think it was appropriate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Fourth Circuit 

-- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the Fourth Circuit 

didn't decide that question either.

 MS. BURNETT: They did not. It was not 

presented to them, Your Honor.

What do you want us to do?

 MS. BURNETT: I think the Court could 

dismiss this as improvidently granted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's it?

 MS. BURNETT: I think the Court could do 

that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, so I 

understand your position on the underlying question if 

we don't dismiss. Am I correct that the granting of an 

evidentiary hearing was based on a showing by the 

Petitioner that he failed to develop facts which might 

change the result?

 MS. BURNETT: Justice Stevens, there was 

never any showing, there was never any showing of 

diligence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why did the -- why did the 

Federal court grant a hearing?

 MS. BURNETT: The Federal court simply 

announced that he was going to hold a hearing on this 

claim and decide later --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't he only entitled to 

do that on the basis of a showing that there was more 

evidence that the State court did not consider?

MS. BURNETT: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 

first he had --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So maybe the district 

court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made 

when we took the case was that there was a body of 

evidence that had not been available in the State 

proceeding that might be available in the Federal 

proceeding.

 MS. BURNETT: I think that was the 

misunderstanding.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if that were true -- I 

know you disagree with that and I understand your 

argument. Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case. But 

if that were true and the Federal court then had to 

decide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the 

statute to say at that time he may only rely on the 

evidence presented to the State court?

 MS. BURNETT: The way I read the statute is 

that that is the first thing that the judge was required 

to do. He had to first determine whether the State 

court's decision was reasonable.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: All right. Suppose he 

looked at the State court evidence and he says, that was 

not enough. The State court's decision on the merits 

was reasonable based on that record. I have a different

record before me. May he look at the different record?

 MS. BURNETT: He can -- I think -- I think 

then we are talking about what I was just saying, new 

facts, new claims.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's what we're talking 

about. May he look at it?

 MS. BURNETT: And then the judge has to go 

through the determination, before he can decide whether 

he can look at it, of whether these new facts or new 

claims meet cause and prejudice or actual innocence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: All right. Forget the 

cause and prejudice for just a moment. But if he looks 

at that new evidence and he decides that any neutral 

judge would have reached a different result from the 

State judge on that evidence, may he reach that result?

 MS. BURNETT: I don't think just -- I do not 

believe the judge can do that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then what's the point --

MS. BURNETT: -- just simply to say I'm 

going to look at just the correctness of the decision 

first, and then decide whether it's correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What you're saying is the 

correctness of decision based on the State court record. 

And if he decides there was a sound decision on that 

record, that's the end of the ball game; is that your

position?

 MS. BURNETT: Well, I think it is, unless --

unless there are actually new matters that are presented 

to the Federal court that the Federal court now is going 

to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's the same claim. It's 

the same claim.

 MS. BURNETT: Yes. Even on the same claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me the 

statute has constructed a pointless procedure.

that at all. It seems to me it's a very orderly 

progression, that the -- that the -- the Effective Death 

Penalty Act is now telling district court judges, and 

has made clear that it's doing this for judicial -- for 

purposes of judicial economy, for finality, for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't the district 

judge in light of the new evidence decide whether the 

judgment of the State court was -- would have been 

reasonable if it came out the same way, including this 

new evidence in the -- in the consideration? Why 

shouldn't he do it that way.

Scalia.

asking whether it should.

 MS. BURNETT: I think -- I think that 

doesn't really fit with the statute -- with the 

statutory language.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me the 

statute certainly contemplates that the States have the 

first --

MS. BURNETT: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the first cut at this 

thing, right? How else do you give them the first cut?

 MS. BURNETT: Yes. Absolutely. And that's 

what I'm saying, and I think that -- to -- if the claim 

is going to in any way differ, it's going to change from 

what was presented to the State court. On one level, 

that is all new matters that are defaulted, and in a 

very literal sense how can -- and I don't believe 

Congress intended for Federal courts to look at new 

matters, however they got to them, that were not 

presented to the State court, and on that basis 

determine whether the State court's decision was 

reached.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the Federal court is 

supposed to do what?

to first look at the claim that was presented to the

State court, under 2254(d), and the claimants before it. 

If it's the same claim, if it's the same matters that 

were adjudicated on the merits in the State court, it 

has to make the decision up front, was it reasonable or 

not?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MS. BURNETT: Okay. Now it makes that 

decision, and then after that, if the Petitioner says 

well, I have new matters, that I never presented to the 

State court, the Federal court has a -- a road map.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now -- but the road map 

that you are now saying could be followed is the same 

road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice 

Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a 

defaulted claim.

 MS. BURNETT: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we are concerned -- I 

think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in 

which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at 

fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal 

court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now 

into the State court then. So that it is not a 

defaulted claim in the classic sense. It is not a claim 

in which he is at fault by having failed to present it 

in the State court.

And in that case, if it cannot go back, if 

the State court will not take it back, don't we have to 

find at least implicit in the totality of subsections 

(d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the 

fully developed claim in the Federal court without a 

need to defer to the State court findings?

 MS. BURNETT: If implicit in your question 

is -- yes, implicit in your question is that the 

Petitioner has demonstrated cause; and he may or may not 

have depending on the facts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he -- I agree with 

you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this 

point. He has got to demonstrate cause and prejudice or 

at least he has got to develop cause. Let me put it --

ask you this question. If he simply says look, I tried 

to get this in to the State court, and he shows that, 

but the State court for whatever reason just would not 

take the evidence that he wanted to put in, is that 

enough for him to have --

MS. BURNETT: It may be. It may be. And 

once again, that's certainly not this case.

you stipulate --

But it's the case we are worried about around the 

corner.

 MS. BURNETT: It may be.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is -- this Court --

that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to 

what cause is, and external impediments. I mean, this 

Court has many cases that describe that. The lower 

courts are very familiar with determining that, and so 

they can -- they are capable to making that 

determination as to whether the Federal court can now 

look at a new matter whether it's a new claim or --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But all we are -- I think 

all we are really getting at is that there are different 

kinds of new matters. There are some new matters of 

which he absolutely knew nothing at the State court 

stage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me: 

i.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice. This 

is new matter that he did or potentially know about and 

tried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State 

court says no, I'm not going to hear it, or I won't give 

you the time, whatever the case may be.

 In that case, isn't it -- don't we have to 

say under the statute all he has got to show is cause in 

the sense that he tried and the State court wouldn't let 

him? In order to --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Having established cause, 

he would then in your view not have the Federal court 

decide the matter de novo. But the only question before 

the Federal court was whether there was in addition 

prejudice.

 MS. BURNETT: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is to say, whether --

but for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find 

by clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent --

MS. BURNETT: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?

 MS. BURNETT: Correct. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In that instance is there 

room for the district court to hold an evidentiary 

hearing?

 MS. BURNETT: Well, I think then you get --

that's -- I think it's actually a separate matter. We 

first have to get to whether the Federal court can look 

at a new matter de novo. If it can look at it de novo 

then I think we go to the pre-Effective Death Penalty

Act law about when you have a hearing. Are there 

disputed facts? Are they -- that make a difference? 

Is it something that actually, you know, needs to have 

resolution in a hearing?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you envisage 

circumstances in which an ineffective counsel 

assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 

was presented in the State court and then there is a 

second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a 

further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel 

claim based on new evidence that the district court 

might hear? Does that ever happen?

 MS. BURNETT: I think it can happen, 

certainly. I don't think it's restricted just to Brady. 

I mean, I think that it -- it is -- it is the same 

analysis, no matter what the claim is, it's the same 

analysis that the Federal court needs to go through to 

look -- to see whether it can consider new matter.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think there could 

be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be 

two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second 

of which could be heard in the district court with 

evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?

possible. I think that the statutory setup and this

Court's established habeas procedures that it had in 

place for decades permits that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess the State court can 

say, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is 

doomsday. No more new evidence. We are not going to 

consider anything new after that, even if you find Brady 

stuff or anything else. Suppose that's 

unconstitutional -- but it isn't. I mean, is that 

unconstitutional?

 MS. BURNETT: Well, no, Your Honor, I don't 

believe it is. In fact, the State court -- we don't 

have to provide for direct appeals.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So if it's not 

unconstitutional, then you just provide what you say, 

that the district court sees whether by clear and 

convincing evidence the case would have come out the 

other way.

 If it were unconstitutional, and I guess 

this is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw, 

anyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me 

there ought to be a way to make the State take the first 

cut at it. Make the State say oh, yes, even with this 

new evidence we would still find this person guilty; and 

then in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the 

deference that 2254(d) requires. You'd ask whether that

was a reasonable determination.

 MS. BURNETT: Right. And all I can say to 

that, Justice Scalia, is this Court has never held that 

the Constitution applies anywhere after the direct 

appeal, and that's only the right to cancel.

in my reasoning. Or you're saying I shouldn't be 

troubled by what has been troubling me, namely that he 

had no way to get this before the State court. They are 

entitled to close -- close the gates?

gate, not on direct review.

General left off. In McNeal and Claudy, this Court did 

hold that, in certain instances, a State habeas court 

must hold a hearing if there are facts in dispute and 

they are not willing to assume them. I agree that a 

State doesn't have to have a proceeding at all, but if 

it has one, it has to be fair.

 I know that my time is short. I'd like to 

go through some of the questions you've asked.

 The State did deny us additional time, 

expert assistance discovery, and a hearing in this case. 

The Federal court specifically found that we were 

diligent. That's at 84a. And in Michael Williams, this 

court said that the finding of diligence also 

constituted a finding of cause for purposes of cause and 

prejudice, which makes sense because you've got a 

prisoner who has done the most they can and yet hasn't 

been able to fully develop the record. There was no 

external impediment. As you'll recall, in Michael 

Williams, the information was there; it was just very 

hard to find.

 Finally, we presented very substantial new 

evidence on the Federal level here. It's simply not 

true that there is no new evidence. The new evidence 

included evidence undermining the sole aggravating 

factor, both the live testimony of Joanne Nicholson,

which allowed the court actually to determine whether 

she would have been a credible person to undermine the 

testimony. The State had held on the papers she wasn't 

credible, which the State can't do on the papers.

 Secondly, the evidence said he was 

physically abused as a child. He was beaten with 

electrical cords, with planks, with a belt, leaving the 

scars on his body that he bears today. He saw his 

father knock his mother's teeth out for trying to 

protect him.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the test for 

determining whether the addition of new evidence is 

sufficient to make it a new claim?

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, I think the test 

really ought to be whether an objectively reasonable 

jurist could find it important in the overall mix of 

information. And it just strikes me that, if you're the 

judge in that kind of a case, what you're going to go 

through is -- if I accept that the State court was right 

with the evidence that it had and I sort of put myself 

in that frame, would I, nonetheless, if I were that 

State court, have found this evidence important when I'm 

making this decision?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's a materiality 

standard, really.

MR. BRESS: Exactly, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's a new claim 

if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's 

the same claim if the result would be the same.

 MR. BRESS: I don't -- I don't think it 

necessarily has to be that way, Your Honor. I think you 

can have a case where the evidence that was before them 

was absolutely nil; now they're offering a good bit of 

evidence that you would at least want to weigh as an 

objective jurist, even though you decide against them. 

I think that's possible.

 I think the reason you've got to adopt this 

position, however, is that there is no DNA -- I mean, no 

innocence exception that the General has put forward. 

If the General is right, it isn't a new claim just 

because you now have DNA evidence that proves you're 

innocent. You made that claim of innocence earlier in 

the proceeding, in your earlier ineffective assistance 

of counsel claim. What you have new now is you've got 

the DNA evidence. In her view, it's the same claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, it does 

read -- 2254(e) -- it does read, "a factual predicate 

that could not have been previously discovered through 

the exercise of due diligence." That sounds like 

exactly what you're describing, the discovery of DNA

evidence you didn't know about.

 MR. BRESS: And I agree completely, Your 

Honor, that (e) says you can hear it, but the Attorney 

General says you can't because under (d), she'd say, 

you'd already be foreclose because the State court has 

already adjudicated your claim on the merits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think she said --

MR. BRESS: -- and these new facts don't 

count.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- she answered -- the 

answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could 

have on the Brady claim you could also have for 

ineffective assistance of counsel. It's a wholly new 

matter. I thought that's what she said.

 MR. BRESS: Your Honor, I think she said 

that what you would have to look for, I think, is 

whether "wholly new matter" means "new evidence." If 

she says it's new evidence, such as new DNA evidence, we 

agree completely. That's not what she said previously 

in this case. Previously, she had said that new 

evidence in that sense, like DNA evidence, can't make 

that claim a new claim and, therefore, you're foreclosed 

under 2254(d), so long as the State court's opinion is 

intrinsically reasonable based on its inadequate record.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bress, I want to

apologize to you for accusing you of not printing 

2254(d) and (e) in your brief. You indeed did.

 MR. BRESS: Well, thank you, Your Honor. I 

thought --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm grateful for your not 

throwing it in my teeth.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
