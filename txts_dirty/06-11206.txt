 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-11206, Chambers v. United 

States.

 Mr. Hochman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HOCHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Failure to report is not a violent felony 

under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents 

neither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor 

involves violent and aggressive conduct.

 The Government argues that failure to report 

satisfies both the risk of injury and violent, 

-aggressive conduct standards for the same reason: The 

prospect that a offender will violently resist an arrest 

-- resist arrest upon completion of the offense or upon 

-- for having done the offense. That potential and that 

potential risk alone is neither as a matter of fact nor 

law sufficient to satisfy either the risk of injury or 

the violent, aggressive conduct standard.

 Beginning with the risk of injury: The 

statute refers to a serious potential risk of injury,

and by using the word "serious" Congress indicated not 

just any felony, not just any felony which carries 

necessarily some risk of injury would be included. The 

risk that must be generated must be one that's somehow 

greater than, something that warrants singly out this 

sort of offender as the sort of person who's deserving 

of greater punishment for his recidivism.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it you 

concede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to 

report would be covered by the statute?

 MR. HOCHMAN: Yes, Your Honor, I think it 

would. I think that in fact one of the critical errors 

that the courts of appeals have made and that the 

Government made here is equating breakout, prison 

escape, with failure to report. They are entirely 

different. They are importantly different, both again 

as a matter of analytically the categorical rule and 

what would you look at to determine whether this sort of 

person satisfied the violent and aggressive standard. 

And we now know, in light of the Sentencing Commission's 

report that was filed just last -- that was filed with 

the Court just last week, that the risk of injury 

associated with a prison breakout escape and failure to 

report is dramatically different. And that mistake --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose it were shown

-- this is hypothetical. Suppose it were shown that 90 

percent of all escapes under the escape statute were 

breakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to 

report. Would that affect how we decide the case?

 MR. HOCHMAN: This case?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. HOCHMAN: Well, since -- I think since 

this is not a prison breakout case, I don't know whether 

data about breakouts --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we look to the crime to 

see generally whether or not it involves violence and 

serious risk of harm?

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think you -- I think the 

categorical rule does require you to look at --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that, in my 

hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the 

case we have here or would it be the same?

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think in your hypothetical, 

where a prison breakout-- where a prison breakout is 

involved --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. My hypothetical is, 

under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of 

prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of 

them are for breakouts involving weapons.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that you look to

the universe under the escape statute. You can under 

Shepard --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what we looked 

to in Begay.

 MR. HOCHMAN: But the issue under Shepard 

and the approach under the categorical rule requires you 

-- allows you to look at a narrower subsection of the 

statute if the charging document and other reliable 

indicia indicate that. And in this case, it's 

undisputed that Mr. Chambers was convicted only of 

failing to report. He was not convicted of the more 

serious offense of prison breakout. And in fact in 

Illinois they are punished at different levels, and the 

evidence is absolutely clear --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- I don't 

want to put words in his mouth, but I thought what 

Justice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute 

that is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it 

down like that? At that point would we look to see what 

the crime of escape was typically like, most of them 

were breakout or most of them were the other thing? You 

have, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you 

don't?

 MR. HOCHMAN: Yes. And that -- that is a 

difficult question under the categorical rule. I think

that the first step would be to determine whether there 

is anything in the record. Under Shepard, you can look 

to other indications of whether the conduct at issue 

that was found by the jury or that was pled to, either 

from an indictment or from plea colloquy, whether there 

is some more specific indication. If not, I think then 

what you would look at -- and I think here you would 

look at, to the extent you're looking at the risk -- on 

the risk of injury side, you would look at the best 

available information. If that -- if that gives you a 

run of cases where you say typically --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. If 

that's the case, I'm looking at 720 Illinois Statutes 

5/31-6. It's reproduced a page 2a of the Government's 

brief. And they don't -- it doesn't seem to be a 

separate provision, whether it's a breakout or a failure 

to report.

 MR. HOCHMAN: But here the charging document 

was clear, and under Shepard the charging document is 

something you're also allowed to take into 

consideration. And there is no doubt, under the 

charging document, that he was convicted of merely 

failing to report.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the sentence for 

that?

MR. HOCHMAN: It -- the sentence appears 

that they extended his probation. He had to serve the 

four weekends that he had failed -- for which he had 

failed to report, and his probation was extended.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't get any 

extra jail time?

 MR. HOCHMAN: He did not get any additional 

jail time as far as I can tell from the record, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is really a problem 

about -- about what you suggest. It may destroy the 

whole benefit of the categorical approach. I mean, you 

can always shave something down to become a narrower 

crime. An escape statute, for example, I suppose you 

could look to see whether the particular escape in 

question from the charging document was an escape that 

used firearms or was an escape that, you know, that 

injured or killed guards. And, you know, that gets us 

into the case-by-case examination that it is the whole 

purpose of the categorical approach to avoid. Now, how 

do we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that 

slippery slope?

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think this -- I think this 

Court took that step in Shepard, and it did it in a very 

narrow and circumscribed way. It did it by saying the

only things you're allowed to consider are things that 

are as reliable as the charge itself and the elements 

essential to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I mean, the charge 

mentions -- mentions a firearm. Anything that's in the 

charge can be used to narrow the crime that we are 

looking at.

 MR. HOCHMAN: If the jury instructions were 

clear, if it's clear that the jury had to find that the 

presence of a firearm -- and I think it complicates --

that is, I think some courts refer to it as the modified 

categorical rule.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be an element of 

the crime. If using a firearm is not an element of 

escape, then I don't have to worry about it.

 MR. HOCHMAN: If -- if -- correct. If it's 

not an element in the sense that he either pled to it or 

the jury necessarily found it as a necessary matter. 

And that's really what Shepard says. It has to be 

something that we necessarily know occurred from the 

fact of conviction, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it doesn't have 

to be an element. So, if all the evidence in the case 

was that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and 

made his way out of the prison that way, if the jury

found him guilty, that was the only basis on which it 

could have found him guilty, that would be enough.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that Shepard 

permits you to look into trial transcripts of evidence 

that was presented. It just says: What did the jury 

necessarily find? And what I mean by "jury 

instructions," how was the jury instructed? What did it 

have to find? What did the jury have to find in order 

to convict?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that sounds like an 

element. That sounds like an element.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think it is elements, but if 

you look --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well --

MR. HOCHMAN: Please, continue.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If you look at the cases 

that we've had to decide under this statute in the last 

couple of years, do you think they illustrate that the 

categorical approach just doesn't work in this 

situation? Because it puts us in a position for every 

single crime that comes up here of making -- of trying 

to ascertain what is the serious risk when we don't have 

any empirical -- we don't have a number quantifying what 

a serious risk is, nor can we generally find what the 

risk is that's associated with a particular class of

cases.

 Maybe when Congress enacted this they never 

anticipated that it would be done on a categorical 

basis. Why not just have a determination as to whether 

there was a serious potential risk in this particular 

case? So, if you have a -- a nonviolent person who 

walks away, that's one thing. If you have somebody who 

has a long list of convictions for violent -- violent 

crimes and escapes, that's another situation.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think there are two problems 

with that approach, Your Honor: First, as the Court 

said in Shepard, the categorical rule, which was adopted 

way back when the Court first confronted the statute and 

has been consistently applied ever since, more or less 

anticipated the Sixth Amendment Apprendi concerns that 

might come from digging in and trying to attribute 

conduct which has not been found by a jury, which 

doesn't have that level of reliability, whether it's an 

element or was on a special verdict form or some -- or 

some other -- or was admitted to in a plea colloquy.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a separate 

question? If it had -- if it has to be found by a jury, 

it can be submitted to the jury?

 MR. HOCHMAN: Well, if it was submitted to 

the jury, then I think under Shepard it's something that

could be considered, and that would be part of what's 

referred to as the modified categorical approach. I 

think the problems with the categorical approach that 

you're identifying, courts have tried and Shepard itself 

in effect amended enough to provide some kind of 

flexibility.

 The other reason to hold back on such a sea 

change is this is, after all, a statutory case and the 

categorical rule has been this Court's approach from the 

beginning. Congress could easily revise the statute. 

If after 20 years it hasn't --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it could, and if it 

had read these cases and it was paying attention to this 

problem, you would think it would go through a list of 

crimes and say, these fall within it and these don't 

fall within it. But obviously it hasn't done that.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think that would make 

everybody's job, the bar and this Court, much easier.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might not, if it 

just said "escape," and then you'd have this same 

problem.

 MR. HOCHMAN: That might be the case, 

although if it just said "escape," I think I'd actually 

have a substantially harder case than what we have here, 

because what we have here doesn't resemble the kind of

violent, aggressive conduct that this Court in Begay 

said is going to be the standard and exemplar of the 

sort of conduct that Congress was thinking about. It 

added -- this Court in Begay said that the serious 

potential risk of injury is just one part of the 

inquiry, that Congress was also singling out crimes 

commit ted in a certain way, and if that, if that 

requirement is going to have any bite, if it's going to 

do the job of singling out and separating out cases, it 

has to be something beyond the mere routine, 

ever-present prospect that an offender might resist 

arrest for having committed the offense after police 

discover that he has done so.

 And in fact if you step back for a moment 

and just visualize --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it depends upon how, 

how, what should I say, how often that prospect is 

realized.

 MR. HOCHMAN: There is no doubt. There is 

no doubt that the prospect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the statute itself 

lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any 

threat of injury, but all and all we think it does. 

Obviously, Congress thought it did, right?

25

think robbery would satisfy under the first clause 

because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or 

threatened use of physical force against another. But I 

think the concern that escape is much more easily 

detected than other crimes is obviously true. And so 

the prospect that the offender will be arrested is 

obviously greater than in other, in other crimes.

 But the point is the standards, the standard 

imposed by Begay and the notion that the conduct must be 

violent and aggressive, if you step back and visualize 

what it is about burglary, arson, extortion or the use 

of explosives that can properly be characterized as 

violent and aggressive, surely it is not the prospect 

that an offender will have been found out for having 

committed those offenses, police will be dispatched to 

arrest them, and then the offender upon that 

confrontation will violently resist arrest. It's 

just -- it's not, it's not what those enumerated 

offenses are doing in the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to say 

robbery. I meant to say burglary. Why is burglary 

violent or aggressive?

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think the reason is because 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, burglary by its

nature is-- you do it at night. You don't want to be 

detected. It's not violent or aggressive at all. It's 

sneaky, is what it is.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I assume that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Robbery is violent or 

aggressive. You're quite right about that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: When you say burglary, if 

you're at home, if you're at home it's going to get 

violent and aggressive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- that may be, 

but it does not in its nature indicate violence or 

aggressiveness.

 MR. HOCHMAN: I think, Justice Souter, has 

it exactly right. I think the reason why the Court in 

Begay and Taylor, by the way, singled out burglary as 

having some kind of inherent danger and potential for 

violent and aggressive conduct associated with it is 

because it involves an act of invading the space of 

another, and cultural expectations and even common law 

expectations about how others might respond suggest that 

that scenario that you have willingly created, knowing 

full well that another might respond violently to what 

you've done in the event you've been detected --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It gets you right back into 

the soup. What you're saying is all it requires is that

there be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness, 

right? And that's what the Government says here: There 

is a potential for violence and aggressiveness.

 MR. HOCHMAN: What it -- what it requires is 

the conscious creation of circumstances that you have 

good reason to believe is going to ignite in violence. 

And if we learned anything from the data that's been 

submitted to the Court both by the Sentencing Commission 

and by the Government, it's that there is very little 

reason to believe that even the distant arrest scenario 

for those who fail to report doesn't carry with it very 

much of a risk of injury at all. In fact, in all the 

materials that have been submitted to this Court, there 

is not a single cited instance or case of an innocent 

bystander or a police officer who has been injured in 

connection with a confrontation from arrest for failure 

to report. There are none.

 Now to be sure, there are some instances of 

violent confrontation and I'm not here saying it's 

impossible that there would be injury associated with an 

arrest scenario. The point is it's nothing different. 

There is nothing in the record that would give us any 

reason to believe this is the kind of special violent 

conduct that Congress was singling out for special 

treatment. I should also add that excluding failure to

report from the statute isn't going to create any kind 

of crack through which the sort of people the Government 

appears to be concerned about might fall through. And 

the reason it this. The several anecdotal cases they 

cite in their brief and a couple of the cases that 

Massachusetts reported back to them which had involved 

some kind of violent resisting arrest, those individuals 

were charged, separately charged for assault and battery 

and similar crimes on a police officer. It's 

unsurprising that when that happens, those individuals 

will be separately charged and convicted for their 

violent conduct.

 So the only work that is done by sweeping 

away the categorical rule, doing serious damage to the 

categorical rule, undermining Begay, the only work 

that's done is to encompass people who we have reason to 

believe didn't engage in violent conduct. That seems to 

me a strange way to interpret the statute, certainly not 

the sort of things this Court would want to close its 

eyes to.

 The last thing, Your Honors. It's important 

to preserve the distinction in Begay between the violent 

and aggressive standard on the one hand and the risk of 

injury on the other hand, and Government's approach 

collapses it. The Government says, why is this violent

and aggressive? Because in their view we can --

falsely, as we've discussed, but because in their view 

there is a sufficient risk of injury on arrest. If 

that's going to be the case, if you're going to be able 

to show conduct is violent and aggressive simply because 

there is a sufficient risk of injury associated with it, 

the violent and aggressive conduct standard does 

nothing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't square with 

the answer you gave me with regard to burglary. If what 

you just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the 

listed crimes.

 MR. HOCHMAN: No. The distinction I'm 

drawing here is the act that you take of invading 

somebody else's space and the prospect -- what you're 

doing is you're consciously taking an act fully aware 

that violence might ensue, which suggests that you are 

the sort of person who is comfortable in a violent 

situation or at least dangerously comfortable in such a 

violent situation, regardless of how frequently that --

that circumstance actually is realized. You're the sort 

of person who has taken an action that expresses comfort 

with that sort of situation.

someone's space, so trespass would be covered by this 

statute? You're invading someone's space.

 MR. HOCHMAN: If it's -- if it's felonious, 

trespass might be. You're invading someone's space in 

the circumstance where the response is -- I think there 

is a decent argument for trespass if for no other reason 

than the act itself, on the violence and aggressive 

standard side, the act itself is more or less the same 

as burglary. It's not as if you can immediately tell 

from observing the burglar enter the structure that he 

has the intent, the requisite intent to commit another 

crime.

 But the other reason why I doubt that 

trespass might be -- might satisfy the standard is 

because there may not -- there doesn't appear to be a 

serious potential risk of injury. The second -- the 

other requirement may not be satisfied. I just don't 

have any information about that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the 

failing to report is not violent and aggressive and 

therefore, no matter what degree of risk the statistics 

might show, it would not qualify?

 MR. HOCHMAN: I'm making both arguments, 

Your Honor. But yes, that is one, that is one of them.

 If there are no further questions, I'll

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Roberts.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Failure-to-report escape qualifies as a 

violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because 

it creates a serious potential risk of physical injury 

that's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk 

that's created by the enumerated offense of burglary. 

Failure-to-report escape is similar in kind to burglary 

because it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive in the 

same way as burglary.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, wouldn't 

that be so of any crime? This is failure to report. 

Any crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain 

risk that the arrestee is going to resist. Is there 

anything different, is anything greater, about this 

arrest for this kind of crime?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Two points 

on that. First, escape and failure-to-report escape, 

other types of escape and recapture, are linked ed in a 

way that arrest and the typical crime aren't, because

escape inherently avoids -- inherently involves the 

avoidance of custody and custody is the very obligation 

that recapture is trying to impose. But avoiding arrest 

isn't an element of the typical crime, so the connection 

between arrest and the ordinary crime isn't close enough 

to justify considering the violence in arrest -- in the 

arrest in whether the crime is violent. Also the risk 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't 

understand it.

 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. What I'm saying is it's 

an element of escape that you're avoiding custody, and 

escape is a continuing offense and so it doesn't end 

until the avoidance of custody is over.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's that got to do with 

increasing the risk of violence? I mean, I see -- I see 

your kind of elements argument, but it seems to be 

beside the point that --

MR. ROBERTS: It shows the close connection 

between the two. And so when you're -- when the 

offender is committing the crime, it's appropriate to 

hold him accountable for what he can see is so highly, 

closely connected to the crime and which, in fact, has 

to happen in order to end the crime; whereas --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the crime is still

-- the crime that we are concerned with here is still 

essentially a passive crime. He just doesn't show up.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And given, you know, the 

close logical connections, I don't see that the close 

logical connections convert the passive crime into a 

higher degree of resisting arrest from any other. In 

fact, it suggests just the opposite.

 MR. ROBERTS: To address the -- the passive 

point, deliberately failing to comply with your legal 

duty to report to prison is not -- it is not doing 

nothing, as Petitioner says. It's not purely passive. 

It is a criminal act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, you may 

precisely be doing nothing. If I say, you know, it's 

Monday morning at 9 o'clock, I'm supposed to -- to 

report to prison, and I'm going to stay home, my purpose 

is to stay put in my armchair. That's purposeful 

conduct and it's about as passive as you can get.

 MR. ROBERTS: It's purposefully inviting the 

violent confrontation when the law enforcement officers 

come to terminate --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can say the same thing 

about failure to respond to a traffic ticket.

 MR. ROBERTS: No. Because in -- in failure

to respond to the traffic ticket the -- first of all, 

it's not clear that somebody is going to come after you 

and try to physically bring you in.

 Second of all, the offender isn't expecting 

them and on edge and prone to react violently.

 Third, he hasn't demonstrated already that 

he is unwilling to submit to custody. And the fact that 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The offender is 

prone to react violently if he doesn't respond to a 

traffic ticket?

 MR. ROBERTS: No. I'm saying just the 

opposite of that. I'm saying that it's different 

because here you've got somebody who is expecting the 

police to come. He is looking over his shoulder all the 

time. He knows they know he didn't come to prison. He 

knows they know who he is. They probably know where he 

is. If he is sitting at home, they know where he is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your 

understanding of the Illinois statute? It is, I take 

it, only triggered by failure to report for confinement?

 MR. ROBERTS: This --

know, you've got to see your probation officer every --

convicted of is failure to report to a penal 

institution, failure to report to prison.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you concede the 

probation or parole situation?

 MR. ROBERTS: I think a probation violation 

is different -- different circumstances. It doesn't 

involve the same refusal to submit to custody that this 

offense involves, which --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need not so 

many -- not so much statistics about how many times 

violence results, but statistics about how serious the 

police are about picking somebody up?

 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think you really need 

the statistics, Your Honor. I think it's a common --

it's common sense that the police are going to make 

vigorous efforts to recapture people who fail to show up 

to prison the way they are supposed to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not common sense 

that the person who has been guilty of a crime so 

gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on 

the weekends would confront the policeman with violence 

when he comes. This is not normally what you think of 

as a violent type who has -- who has been told to report 

weekends to the prison.

time, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him 

back?

 MR. ROBERTS: When he was sentenced -- when 

he was convicted of escape, he was sentenced to six 

months in prison -- in jail, that was stayed; probation 

for 30 months, and he violated his probation and he 

ended up in jail for 5 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So he just -- he just had 

to make up the weekends that he had lost?

 MR. ROBERTS: No. He didn't just have to 

make up the weekends that he had lost.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what Mr. Hochman 

told us --

MR. ROBERTS: I know that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- when I asked that 

question.

 MR. ROBERTS: But I don't think that's 

accurate for the sentence for escape. On page 113 to 

114 of this JA, Your Honor, which is the -- the PSR 

describing what happened for this offense, it says that 

he has 30 months probation. It's in the second volume, 

the volume under seal.

sound to me like Jack the Ripper. He really doesn't.

MR. ROBERTS: You know, we are not supposed 

to be looking at the individual offender here. It's the 

categorical approach. But he had been convicted of 

robbery and aggravated battery, Your Honor. So he -- he 

is not somebody who has not done any violent crimes, 

either. And what's -- what's different is that he has 

now deliberately failed to comply with his legal duty to 

report. He has now deliberately resisted custody, so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would the statute 

apply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends. 

Instead, he goes out on a binge, and then he voluntarily 

comes in on a Monday morning saying, yes, I failed to 

report, and so here I am.

 MR. ROBERTS: First of all, while he is out 

on the binge, people could be coming and looking for him 

and the violent confrontation could occur. 

Second of all, even if in the unusual case of somebody 

who comes in voluntarily hours late, a few days late, 

there wasn't a -- a risk of -- of violence, which we 

think there can be, but even if there was none, it 

wouldn't matter because you're applying the categorical 

approach here. And what you don't look at -- you don't 

look at the unusual case. You look at the elements of 

the offense in the ordinary case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they ever look at the

been giving us a hard time, and we ought to show him 

that we really mean business? Do they look at the 

nature of the -- the identity of the counsel of the 

defendant? Do they ever look at that?

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not aware of that. 

I can't -- can't speak to the -- the fact that they 

would do that, Your Honor. But here you've got in the 

ACCA, you're got not one previous violation for escape; 

you've got three violent felonies that you have to have. 

And this was his third one with -- in addition to 

robbery and aggravated battery and in addition to 

distributing cocaine within a thousand feet of public 

housing. And so we are not talking about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your 

friend -- excuse me. I understood your friend to say 

that you don't have a single example of failure to 

report leading to a violent confrontation.

 MR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's also 

incorrect, Your Honor. Two of the four cases that we 

cited in our -- in our brief, in our anecdotes, involved 

injury to innocent bystanders. It's true we didn't

it's on page 19, the -- we cite various cases, and we 

also then go on to cite some articles just as an 

example.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have -- so 

you have two examples.

 MR. ROBERTS: We have those two examples. I 

mean, I haven't gone out and looked for other cases. 

Those are just two out of the four that we cited.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't gone out 

and looked for other -- I'm sorry. You haven't gone out 

and looked for other cases? I thought you --

MR. ROBERTS: In -- in addition to those, 

no. I -- I went to get some sample cases. I haven't 

gone to see if I could find more cases of those. In 

addition, in the Massachusetts data there are -- there 

are two of the 18. Admittedly, the sample is small in 

Massachusetts --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts --

MR. ROBERTS: But it's 11 percent of the 

people violently resisted, and they were charged with 

assault and battery on a police officer. I think that 

that's indicative of possible injury. And in any case 

the question is --

occasion to look at the -- the recent figures compiled 

by the Sentencing Commission?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. And I think 

that the Sentencing Commission data also supports --

although, again, the -- the sample size is small. But 

the question here is: Is there a potential risk? And 

what the sentencing data shows for the failure-to-report 

escapees is that 7.1 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the magnitude of the 

risk relevant? Suppose it happens one out of 10,000 

times or 99 out of 100 times. Are they different cases?

 MR. ROBERTS: We don't think that you should 

be looking at the statistics at -- at all, Your Honor. 

But -- and so -- I mean, you know, that's our -- our 

fundamental point is that -- that the ACCA requires a 

potential risk. The James case illustrates that you 

decide these cases without statistics.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the potential risk is 

based on an empirical assessment. What's -- how can we 

make an empirical assessment without statistics?

 MR. ROBERTS: What James says is that you 

try to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable 

to the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated 

offenses. And, as you did in James --

our experience because we have these cases; we've been 

lawyers; we know what they usually involve. We have 

some sort of a --

MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an instinct or a basis 

for making a judgment.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If statistics can inform 

that, why ignore the statistics?

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not saying that you should 

ignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither 

necessary nor dispositive. And I don't think the 

statistics cast any doubt on the commonsense conclusion 

based on some of the factors I was talking about before, 

about why there's a potential for violence during --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But your argument goes 

simply to whether there is potential and the statute 

says "serious potential." Which gets us, it seems to 

me, to the point that Justice Kennedy is making, and 

that is, we've got to have something more than an 

instinctive belief that something bad might happen.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think James addresses 

that, Your Honor. And James says that in deciding 

whether you have a serious potential, you look to the 

enumerated offenses and you determine if they can be

comparable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They were taking as 

examples cases in which there was serious potential. 

But in any event, you can't lose sight of the modifier. 

It has got to be more than a so-called "potential risk."

 MR. ROBERTS: It has -- it has to be more 

than a potential. It has to be serious in the sense 

that it's similar in degree, comparable in degree, to 

one of the enumerated offenses.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What one are we to do 

with -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address 

the statistics in the sentencing report.

 MR. ROBERTS: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: As I read them, they put 

together -- if you put together failing to report and 

failing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample. 

And the number of those cases, whether you looked at the 

time when he had left or whether you looked at the time 

he was apprehended, in which force was involved is zero. 

The number of cases in which injury was involved is 

zero. The number of cases where he had a dangerous 

weapon is five.

 MR. ROBERTS: That's right. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now there we 

are.

MR. ROBERTS: It's a 3.1 percent -- 3.1 

percent rate of having this dangerous weapon when he is 

being -- being taken into custody for -- for this 

offense. And, you know, looking at the -- at the 

failure-to-report people, which is what this person is 

charged of, of those 42 people, that was 7.1 percent of 

those people that had a weapon. And if one of those 

people had used that weapon, that would have been a 2.4 

percent chance of injury.

 Now, I'm saying the sample size is small, 

and this shows why it's dangerous to put too much weight 

on it. But that would have been a 2.4 percent rate of 

injury. And in Tennessee v. Garner, this Court cited a 

statistic in the 1970s about the risk of violence during 

burglary. And this was household burglary, which you 

think might be likely --

JUSTICE BREYER: You had every opportunity, 

when we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I 

don't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds 

through a small amount of cases. And you could, of 

course, criticize the Sentencing Commission effort if 

you have the statistician or someone who will tell us 

that that sampling was not an appropriate method to 

proceed. Is there any such person?

not criticizing it. I'm saying that you have to take 

into account the sample size and you have to take into 

account that there are --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. Why -- that was my 

question. Why take into account the sample size in the 

absence of a statistician who would tell us that the 

sample size is too small to reach the conclusion that 

the commission reaches?

 MR. ROBERTS: Because my point is that --

take the 42 failure-to-report people, which is the 

offense here, okay. Three of them -- three of those 42, 

had guns. If one of those three had used the gun, that 

would have been a use of force, an instance of actual 

violence.

 That percentage -- I'm not -- I'm not 

questioning the statistical validity of anything. I'm 

taking it on its terms. That's a 2.4 percent statistic 

there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they didn't use a gun.

 MR. ROBERTS: 3.8 percent in -- in household 

burglary. So I just think that -- that the statistics 

are -- are very low, the risk of actual violence in 

burglary as well.

JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is you say if 

he had used a gun. And he didn't use a gun. I mean, to 

come up with your statistics on the basis of something 

that didn't happen is not using statistics; it's using 

imagination.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, the statute 

again talks about the potential risk. It doesn't talk 

about the actual use of force or the actual injury. The 

actual use of force is covered by clause one --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think those 

statistics show a greater danger than the dangers from 

drunk driving that were involved in Begay?

 MR. ROBERTS: No. But I think the drunk 

driving -- that what concerned the Court about drunk 

driving was that the crime is a strict liability crime. 

It didn't involve deliberate conduct. This conduct is 

purposeful. Petitioner doesn't -- doesn't contest that. 

And the situation here is a different kind of risk. 

It's like the risk in burglary. It's the deliberate 

commission of the crime despite the clear risk of an 

ensuing violent confrontation.

 And so, the parallel, there really isn't a 

parallel to the strict liability crime there, where the 

injury -- the Court said in Begay there is a serious 

risk of injury. The problem is that the crime is just

not purposeful, so it doesn't show this willingness to 

harm others.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's 

the point. Begay talked about purposeful violent 

conduct, not just purposeful conduct.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. But you have 

to -- you have to talk about the violent conduct in 

context. And what it said is that all these enumerated 

crimes are violent crimes. But burglary is violent not 

because the violence is some element of the offense. 

There is nothing about the elements of the offense 

that's violent. What makes burglary violent is the fact 

that the offender deliberately commits it, even though 

he knows it could trigger this violent confrontation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The distinction between 

this crime and crimes in general is that this person has 

shown that he or she doesn't want to go back into 

custody, is that --

MR. ROBERTS: I think it's -- it's numerous 

things, but the avoidance of custody is sort of a 

categorical difference between this and all the other 

crimes, Your Honor. It's an element of this crime that 

he is doing that.

 That also factors into the fact that the 

risk of violence during recapture is going to be greater

than the risk of violence in apprehending an ordinary 

criminal for several different related reasons. One --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there was, 

this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And am I correct in 

understanding that since this case was decided, the 

Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone 

the other way?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. The Seventh Circuit 

thought that applying the purposeful, violent and 

aggressive requirement of Begay required a different 

result because it -- it thought that it meant that the 

crime had to involve violent conduct itself; and it 

didn't appreciate the point I was making before, that 

burglary doesn't involve that violent conduct itself, 

and that burglary is violent because of the prospect of 

the violent confrontation.

 And so, that's the -- that's what led the 

Seventh Circuit astray the second time around. But it 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The first time around, 

didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be 

a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes 

from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to

report, and isn't that what we now have from the 

Sentencing Commission?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. They did ask for -- for 

statistics. But I would stress again why we think 

that -- that looking to statistics as some kind of a 

requirement is, you know, both perilous and not required 

by the statute: One, because the statute requires just 

potential risk, not actual injury.

 Two, because these data are just generally 

not going to be available. And you don't have even the 

baseline for the other crimes, the enumerated crimes, 

really to compare it to. And so the result, if you 

start looking around for statistics and saying we need 

these statistics to do it, is that virtually no crimes 

are going to qualify under the residual clause.

 And obviously, that isn't what Congress 

intended when it adopted this broad residual clause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I -- may I ask 

you just to get some sense about what will qualify? I 

mean, I think we -- we all agree that the risk of 

violence in arrest is probably going to vary depending 

on -- categorically depending on the crimes.

 I think I would probably agree that 

white-collar crimes are not likely to -- to carry a very 

high risk of violence on arrest. So I -- there's one

category. Can you think of others, other categories 

outside of white-collar crime, that are going to have a 

lower risk of arrest than, say, the failure-to-report 

category?

 MR. ROBERTS: What -- we wouldn't sweep in 

any crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't 

themselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of 

custody, because that shows the close link between the 

crime that I was explaining before. That's sort of the 

categorical difference, although I would agree with you, 

certainly, that in white-collar crimes in many cases the 

offender is going to submit voluntarily to custody; they 

are not even going to come after him. And he hasn't 

done anything to show his likelihood to resist in any 

way, and so there is going to be a significantly less 

connection there.

 Violent crimes where you might think that 

there is going to be a higher incidence are going to be 

covered based on the violence of the crime, anyway.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They are going to be in 

category one.

 MR. ROBERTS: Right. They are going to be 

covered already.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. ROBERTS: So you know, one, we think

there is a categorical difference between this kind of 

crime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all 

of the ordinary crimes that you're talking about. But 

even if you go and set that aside and don't draw that 

categorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk 

of violence, here what you've got is you've got you know 

that they are going to come after him; he knows they are 

coming; he is already deliberately, he has already 

indicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they 

know that; so they come prepared for resistance. And in 

Illinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he 

has committed this crime, and those are characteristics 

that are particularly indicative of dangerousness. So 

we think this sets it quite apart from other crimes in 

terms of the risk of violence that -- that we are 

talking about.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how 

many additional crimes are likely to raise issues like 

this under the residual clause?

 MR. ROBERTS: Not -- you know, how many 

could be covered altogether? Or --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well after we decide this 

case, how many more cases like this do you anticipate 

that we're -- we may get under ACCA?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well I'm hopeful that the

Court won't have to decide too many other cases with the 

guidance that will be given by Begay and James and 

now -- and now this case.

 So, you know, it has been -- this case, the 

Court took; it had been holding the case for Begay and 

it took it rather than vacating and remanding. So it's 

not as if this is a case where some conflict has 

developed after the Court was taken to resolve. We 

think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do 

you think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime?

 MR. ROBERTS: I think a soldier that goes 

AWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably 

invite somebody to come after them. It's a little bit 

harder case here because he is not somebody who is a 

recidivist felon.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has to be a 

recidivist. This is one of three offenses for an 

aggravated sentence. You never have the isolated 

question.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, when he did it first --

he could have done it in his first crime. So you don't 

know when did this that he had the other two counting 

under the ACCA.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would only be a crime

if it's his third crime and not if it's his first.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, you don't look to the 

individual person; we're looking to the ordinary case 

and we know from the elements here that you have a 

recidivist -- you have a recidivist felon. I do think 

that there is a risk of -- you know, there is a risk of 

violent confrontation when a soldier goes AWOL, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Sure.

 MR. ROBERTS: I just don't think it's quite 

as -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you 

know, I would have to say that there is some risk. Yes.

 The -- if I could just address something 

that Justice Kennedy had raised before about statutes 

unlike Illinois's statute that has a -- that generally 

prohibit escape. One -- one possible problem that could 

arise from a holding that offenses like failure to 

report are not violent felonies is that a statute that 

broadly covered escape, the result would be that jail 

break escapes would not be violent felonies under that 

statute, because the statistics that are out there 

suggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either 

walkaways or failure to report.

 And so unless the charging document 

specifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the

general -- something that was charged under the general 

escape statute would not qualify for coverage under the 

ACCA.

 And aside from that, if the Court has no 

further questions, we could ask that the judgment of the 

Court of Appeals be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Hochman, you have 11 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HOCHMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Just to begin with where Mr. Roberts left 

off, most states in fact do distinguish in their 

statutes between failure to report and prison break 

escapes. These are cited by both parties in the briefs 

and you can review them, but there are clear 

distinctions in the law. So the risk that prison break 

escape is somehow going to escape -- escape, if you 

will, from the scope of the statute as a result of a 

reversal is -- is unfounded.

 Just to make a couple of things clear. 

First of all with respect to the sentence, Justice 

Ginsburg, the -- he was sentenced to six additional 

months but it was stayed as -- as was mentioned; and so 

when I was answering that question he did not serve

additional time as a result of that, and that's what I 

was referring to.

 If you look at the sentencing transcript, 

that's where the indication is that he did in fact serve 

out four additional weekends. It's not noted in the --

it's not noted as an additional sentence, punishment for 

it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was he serving those 

weekends for? What was the crime?

 MR. HOCHMAN: That was the armed robbery --

the robbery crime, not armed robbery, the robbery crime. 

That's the first predicate offense here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He just gets weekends for 

that? How many weekends?

 MR. HOCHMAN: 11.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Pretty good deal.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HOCHMAN: Second, with respect to the 

anecdotal cases, you know, we looked at them; you could 

look at them. If there are two instances where there 

are injury -- there are two instances where there are 

injury, I didn't catch that, and I apologize if I 

misspoke.

 But it doesn't change the core of the 

problem, which is that the anecdotal evidence

produced -- and that dates back all the way to 1977, 

they looked back at cases -- they are covering on 

extraordinary broad period of time in looking for this 

stuff, and there is just not -- there is not a lot 

there, if there is anything there at all, with respect 

to injury associated with failure to report.

 On the core substance of their argument, 

Mr. Roberts emphasized that failing to report has as an 

element avoiding arrest, avoiding confinement. I don't 

actually think that's right. There is nothing about 

concealment. There is nothing about hiding. There is 

nothing about seeking to escape from a police officer 

who comes to bring you back. He just didn't go; and in 

fact we don't -- the record doesn't explain why; but you 

know, it was the November to December period. It's the 

holiday period of time for people when they, obviously, 

for a variety of reasons might prefer to spend time with 

their families. Whatever the reason was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Statistics show that 

the number of robberies increases during the holiday 

season. He just needed to get --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he did this 

four times. I thought there were four.

 MR. HOCHMAN: There were four periods from

the end of November, four consecutive weekends from the 

end of November into December. There is no indication, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that any further robberies were 

committed during that period. But the point is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no 

indication he meant to spend time with his family over 

the holidays.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HOCHMAN: Not in the record. It's 

absolutely not in the record, Your Honor. No doubt. 

But the point is that while Mr. Roberts stood up and 

said it's about avoiding arrest; it's about concealing 

yourself; it's the sort of person that's prone to react 

violently; the fact is, that's speculation; and 

everything we know from the sentencing commission and 

from their own efforts suggests the contrary. And 

indeed even the dangerous weapon findings of the 

sentencing commission, I think, should be excluded, 

because under the guidelines, the mere possession of a 

weapon is not a violent felony.

 A felon in possession is not -- cannot be a 

predicate offense under the guidelines. And so the mere 

possession of a weapon, which is all you have on those 

five instances -- by the way, the fact that they did not 

double-count them as also including four suggests they

there to support the Government's speculation. If there 

is no further questions, thank you, Your Honors.
