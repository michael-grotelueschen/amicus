 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 06-1463, Preston v. Ferrer.

 Mr. Schleimer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 It's been a little less than two years since 

this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check 

Cashing Service v. Cardegna. Within nine months after 

Buckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal 

issued its decision in this case excising the issue of 

validity or legality of a contract from an entire 

category of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to 

arbitration.

 The contract in this case couldn't be more 

clear. It states quite specifically that the validity 

or legality of the contract shall be arbitrated. So 

there was no consideration given to the intent of the 

parties.

 The Federal Arbitration Act, of course, 

applies in this case. There was never really a dispute 

about that, because it'S a contract between the citizens

of two States and it was never disputed that the Federal 

Arbitration Act would apply.

 If left standing, the decision in this case 

could result in a multiplicity of State law decisions 

and statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes 

of cases through the mere expediency of having it go to 

an administrative agency.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, It wouldn't 

eliminate it. Your friend on the other side says it the 

simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo 

after the commissioner's decision.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, the assertion that we 

get to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court. In the 

courts below the parties agreed, and both sides briefed, 

the fact that the de novo would be heard by the superior 

court, not by the arbitrator. I don't know what -- by 

what magical process the Respondent would think that we 

would get to arbitrate the de novo, because the statute 

on which the court of appeal based its jurisdictional 

holding, Labor Code Section 1700.44, that's where the 

labor commissioner gets jurisdiction from the same 

statute and says the superior court hears the de novo.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I 

could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go 

to that court, and you get a motion to compel

arbitration.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, we have brought a 

motion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on 

1700.44.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I couldn't find the order 

that the court -- in the record it says that the order 

would be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction, 

the superior court, and then it said, according to an 

order to be entered by the clerk. How long was the 

arbitration stayed for? There was an enjoined -- there 

was an injunction. What was the term of the injunction? 

Just until further order of the court?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: The injunction states -- and 

I'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how 

long it lasts -- the injunction was requested and it was 

granted with just the word "grant." So I interpret it 

as meaning that what was granted was what was requested, 

and what was requested was an injunction that would last 

until the Labor Commissioner determined that she doesn't 

have jurisdiction. Now, since the Labor Commissioner 

had already determined that she does have jurisdiction, 

it's effectively permanent or, as you say, 

Justice Kennedy, until the court vacates it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Respondent at any 

point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor

Commissioner, made a determination that they would not 

go to superior court for de novo review?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, they actually had in a 

sense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not 

to. The motion for reconsideration was brought before 

the Labor -- before the arbitrator one day before the 

injunction hearing. The arbitrator said: Well, it's 

inefficient to have parallel proceedings and maybe I can 

benefit from the Labor Commissioner's advice in this. 

So while retaining his jurisdiction, he said: I'm going 

to stay the arbitration until the Labor Commissioner 

rules.

 Now, at that point the Respondent could have 

simply withdrawn the injunction and said, fine, we'll do 

it the way the arbitrator says; what the arbitrator 

wants, the arbitrator shall get. Instead, the next day 

the arbitrator's decision became moot. Now, I think the 

arbitrator, acting with an injunction looming the next 

day, was proposing in a sense a kind of compromise: You 

can both have a little bit of what you want. It's not 

unusual in arbitrations for that to happen.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you may have a 

right to go to arbitration under this context, to 

proceed at once to arbitration. But could you stop a 

parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor

Commission? In other words, your adversary says under 

the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate 

at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's 

nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't 

do that.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Justice Ginsburg, I think 

that if the motion to compel arbitration had been 

granted -- remember there were two motions pending, my 

motion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion 

for an injunction to stop the arbitration.

 If the motion to compel arbitration had been 

granted, I think that would have been in effect a 

mandamus to Judge Ferrer that he had to arbitrate and 

not proceed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought you 

would -- you would say that when you have a contract 

which says that any disputes under this shall be 

arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, 

that that does automatically exclude a parallel 

proceeding. Otherwise, provisions like that make no 

sense at all; they achieve nothing.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Justice Scalia, I would 

certainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to 

file a parallel proceeding. The question, of course, is 

specific performance.

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you 

make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do 

you make of the fact that this contract included, I 

guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that 

California law applies, and if California law comes in 

so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner? So 

that in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the 

Labor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and 

the argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, Justice Souter, I have 

two responses to that. My first is that, since there's 

an express agreement to arbitrate validity or legality, 

that there is certainly no basis for saying that there's 

some implied intent to contradict the express agreement.

 The second is that, assuming for a moment 

that we have incorporated California law wholesale, and 

California has a lot of law, one of the laws that 

California has, as set forth in the case I cited, 

Qualcomm v. Nokia, a Federal Circuit decision in 2006 

under California law, California law has a rule that if 

you incorporate the AAA rules into your agreement, you 

meet the First Option standard that you have agreed to 

arbitrate arbitrability.

 Now, if we have incorporated California law, 

we have incorporated the law that says the arbitrator's

decision, his initial decision saying I've got 

jurisdiction, let's hear some evidence, then that's 

incorporated in California law --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you agree that the 

question of implicit option of California law is at 

issue in the case as it gets to us?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I don't believe that Volt is 

properly in the case. If you look at the court of 

appeals decision, the decision is based on jurisdiction, 

it's not based on intent of the parties. Volt is all 

about the intent of the parties that you imply from a 

choice of law clause. And if the intent of the parties 

is so clearly expressed that we're going to arbitrate a 

particular issue, I don't think you even get to an 

implied intention.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that an issue in 

the case, unless you're waiving the issue? Wouldn't it 

be a question of contract interpretation as to the 

meaning of the choice of law provision that should be 

decided by the arbitrator? Unless you want to waive 

that argument.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I that that Volt should be 

rejected. But in the alternative, I think under First 

Options it should be remanded to the arbitrator. If 

they want to make an argument that we didn't intend to

arbitrate arbitrability, even though California law is 

per se on that point in our favor, then you have the 

option of remanding that question to the arbitrator.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I have to 

confess I've never understood these choice of alaw 

provisions. You incorporate California law. I assume 

California law is interpreted consistent with Federal 

law. If Federal law preempts California law, that's 

what you're incorporating. It always struck me as kind 

of circular.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, I think lawyers do it 

reflexively because out of fear that somehow the law in 

some other State that they don't know is going to wind 

up being the conflict of law --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say 

California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion 

of Federal law?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Of course not. I mean, if 

one incorporates California law, one doesn't incorporate 

pre-empted California law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nor do you mean that 

California applies even when it contradicts the express 

provisions of your agreement? I mean, the specific 

governs of the general?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Absolutely. The Federal

Arbitration Act is all about effectuating the intent of 

the parties to expeditiously and privately decide the 

issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I must say that the Volt 

case is written in rather sweeping language that's not 

particularly helpful to you. On its facts, I think it's 

different because there were other parties, independent 

parties in the litigation. Don't you think that's the 

best way to distinguish Volt in your case?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Certainly. To that I would 

add the observation that under Volt, since there were 

parties that were not bound by arbitration, you are 

going to have all the expense of the other lawsuits, 

anyway. So, you have in terms of the efficiency of the 

proceeding, in Volt you were going to have a 

multiplication of litigation no matter what you did. 

Here that's not true. The only reason we had a 

multiplication of litigation is because Judge Ferrer 

filed a Labor Commissioner petition and then a Superior 

Court lawsuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, would you 

have any problem with a California law that said you can 

arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor 

Commissioner to file an amicus brief?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I don't know the Labor

Commissioner has ever attempted that. I wouldn't be 

concerned about it. I know --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it goes on 

and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to 

appear at the arbitration?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, that is what 1700.45 

says for talent agents. In 20 years I've never heard of 

the Labor Commissioner doing that. But I can't imagine 

anyone is going to be awfully concerned about it. I 

certainly wouldn't be. If the Labor Commissioner wanted 

to attend, they would be welcome. I don't think that's 

based on a legal right because my client's a personal 

manager and isn't regulated by the talent agency --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if it says 

you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor 

Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I'm not sure -- I 

certainly -- personally, in this case no problem with 

that. I don't think that's how it works. The statute 

simply requires notice and an opportunity to attend; and 

there's no issue in this case as to whether the Labor 

Commissioner was deprived of that, because we never got 

to that point.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Labor 

Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on

his own motion or her own motion?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: It's a little bit 

complicated.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm sorry that I 

asked already.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I have an answer for you. 

The Labor Commissioner is considered a peace officer 

under California law. They actually have the power to 

arrest. At one point many years ago, there was an 

arrest of a manager for soliciting and procuring. He 

got Jane Wyman a job on a TV show called "Falcon Crest," 

and there was an arrest and there was a criminal statute 

at that time. And the legislature responded to this 

incident by repealing the criminal statute.

 So the only action the legislature has had 

since deregulating the managers and taking them out of 

the statute entirely was removing the criminal 

enforcement power. In terms of the Labor Commissioner's 

civil enforcement powers, there are statutes. The first 

hundred sections in the labor code do give the Labor 

Commissioner certain intervention powers. But, reading 

those statutes, they would seem to apply in wage cases 

and confiscation of tools, that sort of thing. They 

don't really mention -- now would the Labor 

Commissioner -- if the Labor Commissioner wanted to

intervene, I think that if you take the penumbra of all 

these statutes probably the Labor Commissioner could.

 I think, even though there's not in my 20 

years handling these cases been a situation where the 

Labor Commissioner filed any kind of a civil proceeding, 

everybody assumes the Labor Commissioner could seek an 

injunction if they wanted to. It just doesn't occur 

because they're busy doing things like collecting wages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the arbitrator 

decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor 

Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the 

Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the 

arbitration?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, in a sense, under the 

gun of the injunction hearing the next day, that's what 

the arbitrator did.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Take out the exception. 

The arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have 

the advice of the Labor Commissioner because the 

arbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency 

arrangements.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I would certainly protest, 

but the arbitrator undoubtedly has the power to wait for 

the Labor Commissioner to render an advisory decision. 

In a sense that's what the arbitrator did. In a moment

of I think irrational exuberance he talked about the 

expertise of the Labor Commissioner.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How was the 

arbitrator chosen? Does he or she have any particular 

expertise in this area?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Yes. Mr. Bosch has 32 years 

as an entertainment lawyer. He knows the Talent Agency 

Act considerable better than any of the civil service 

lawyers at the Labor Commissioner. That's why I 

referred to it as irrational exuberance, because the 

Labor Commissioner -- some of them get pretty good and 

then they move on to other jobs, and you wind up with 

people who hear wage claims.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you go to the superior 

court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court 

for an order enforcing its decision?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Enforcing the Labor 

Commissioner's decision?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you get de novo 

review. So do you ask the court for an order -- a 

declaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent 

agent or is not a talent agent?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, that is what Judge 

Ferrer asked the superior court to do, was first send 

this to the Labor Commissioner. Then specifically the

complaint by Judge Ferrer sought declaratory relief, 

that the arbitration is void, the guy is an illegal 

talent agent, so he should never be allowed to 

arbitrate. That was the declaratory relief that was 

sought.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you think it would 

be within the authority of the superior court to say 

this is a judgment binding on the parties and the 

arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed 

consistently with my order?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, absent -- our position 

is that that's preemptive, of course. Absent the 

arbitration agreement, it would be the superior court 

that would decide it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Well, but if the 

Respondent prevails, don't you think that the superior 

court has that authority?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: If the Respondent prevails 

in the Labor Commissioner?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If Respondent prevails in 

this case, don't you think that the superior court can 

then say that its declaration is final and the 

arbitration shall not proceed?

the beginning, including in my briefs to the court of

appeals was yes, that if the decision is correct, if 

this Court affirms the court of appeals, that the 

de novo would go to the superior court. Now, it is a 

true de novo; in other words, it's not deferential to 

the Labor Commissioner. It's simply a complete 

rehearing from scratch of the whole case.

 But it has always been my position and it 

was until we got to this Court the Respondent's position 

that the de novo would go to the superior court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is it -- I should know 

this, but I don't. Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil 

engineers, builders, enter into a contract. They have 

an arbitration provision suspiciously like this one. It 

says we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute, 

including a dispute about whether this agreement is 

legal or not itself. They have that. They go to the 

arbitrator.

 Jones says: You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you 

don't know that much about civil engineering, but 

there's a judge here who does. So I think what I'm 

going to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior 

court in California making the same claims I'm making 

here and maybe that judge will decide it first and then 

you'll be really helped. Now what stops him from doing 

that in the law?

JUSTICE BREYER: The Federal -- the Federal 

Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't 

do that?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I grant you if he 

can do it you might as well tear up the Federal 

Arbitration Act and throw it out the window. But I just 

want to know what is it in the law specifically that 

stops him from doing that.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Well, I think in Section 3 

would -- there should be a stay of the judicial 

proceedings so that the arbitration can proceed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not positive 

Federal law. What stops him from doing it is the 

contractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties? 

The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that 

contractual agreement.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Yes, Justice Scalia. The 

obligation comes from the contract.

all disputes under this contract, it means we'll

of us will go to court.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think that's doubly so if 

you incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration 

Association, which provides you with the maximum 

breadth.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that -- that's 

what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting, 

that there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it 

explicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to 

undermine this contract by running off to court.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think it's a covenant of 

good faith and fair dealing. If you agree to do it you 

should do it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And so you 

can't -- no case comes to your mind where anybody has 

tried that little end run? And --

MR. SCHLEIMER: I think there are a couple 

--

JUSTICE BREYER: I agree, I don't see how 

they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think this entire area of 

jurisprudence involves pre-dispute arbitration 

agreements and then some party decides it's not to my 

advantage and they run to court. That's almost every 

case.

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contract 

law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate, 

it means you won't litigate. And even if I didn't ever 

teach contract law, it would still be the law.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Buckeye was --

was such a case, going to court despite the arbitration 

agreement.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: At -- at the time we were in 

the superior court, Buckeye had not yet been decided. 

We were -- in December of 2005 was the injunction 

hearing, and Buckeye I believe was published in February 

of 2006.

 I relied on the California case, the 

Erickson case, which made Prima Paint the law of 

California, and it wasn't persuasive. Then Buckeye was 

handed down while we were on appeal. But I certainly, 

when I read Buckeye, I said that's my price, because 

Prima Paint was about fraud in the inducement. We were 

in a situation where we were dealing with an attack on 

the legality of the entire contract and I read Buckeye 

and said, that's my case.

 Mr. Chief Justice, if there's no further 

questions, I'd like to reserve my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The California Talent Agencies Act does not 

invalidate the arbitration agreement between Mr. Preston 

and Judge Ferrer. At most, it merely postpones 

arbitration --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the question is 

obvious. The question just follows from what I said. 

You were there nodding your head when everybody seems 

seemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't 

go run off to court. So you're just about to address 

this, and I hope you'll include the answer to the 

question, which is if they can't run off to the 

Federal -- to the State court judge, the superior court 

judge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they 

run off to this man, namely the talent agency expert --

MR. BRUNSTAD: The Labor Commissioner --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- who happens to be an 

administrative agency? Why does it matter?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think to answer your 

question, Justice Breyer, it's helpful just to delineate

the procedure of how it's supposed to work. You're 

supposed to go to the California Labor Commissioner 

first if there's any controversy arising under the 

California Talent Agencies Act. That is an exhaustion 

of administrative remedies concept that the California 

Supreme Court articulated in Styne v Stevens. After the 

California Talent Agencies Act has been administered by 

the Labor Commissioner, either party has as of right the 

ability to take an appeal to the California Superior 

Court, at which point all of the California arbitration 

rules apply, and a motion to compel arbitration could be 

made at that point and arbitration could happen. And 

now it's a de novo hearing from the Labor Commissioner's 

proceeding, which means under California law, the 

Waisbren case and the Buchwald case, that it's as though 

the Labor Commissioner proceeding had not happened at 

all. The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you take a position 

below? Your friend says that this is brand new up here.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's not brand new, 

Justice Scalia. We never got that far.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you take that position 

below, was the question.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: We never took that position 

below because we never got that far, Justice Kennedy.

We only got to the point whether we should have a 

preliminary injunction so that the Labor Commissioner 

could go first. Once the Labor Commissioner --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The arbitrator already 

agreed to do that. You didn't need the injunction for 

that purpose.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the motion for the 

injunction was filed because the arbitrator initially 

denied a stay of arbitration. The arbitrator himself 

then reconsidered his ruling a day before the hearing on 

the injunction, and the arbitrator said I'd like to hear 

from the Labor Commissioner because the Labor 

Commissioner is expert.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but if your 

position is that we have to preserve the integrity of 

the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the 

State builds in to that procedure, de novo review 

Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you 

to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't 

make any difference.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

think that it is important -- this goes back to 

Justice Breyer's question. Why is it a de novo 

proceeding? Well, in the Sinnamon case, which we cite 

in our brief, there are constitutional reasons under the

California's constitution. The Labor Commissioner 

doesn't exercise any judicial authority and does not 

have the power to finally decide this controversy. The 

Labor Commissioner is merely exercising her 

administrative power over this dispute because this is 

part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you want this to 

happen? Why -- who would imagine such a system in which 

you bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent 

the matter from being resolved immediately with an 

arbitrator. I don't know how long does it take for the 

Labor Commissioner? I don't know.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: On average 8 months, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Eight months. But then 

when he's done --

MR. BRUNSTAD: She, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: She. No matter what 

happens, you go back to the arbitrator. Who in his 

right mind would set up such a system?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, there are valid 

reasons. There are very compelling reasons why 

California set up this system. California law says if 

you're going to act like a talent agent, you're going to 

procure employment -- that's the touchstone -- you're

acting as a talent agency, you're supposed to submit 

your contracts in advance for pre-approval from the 

Labor Commissioner. You're supposed to bring your 

disputes there. That's how the Labor Commissioner 

learns of disputes. The Labor Commissioner is supposed 

to develop this body of law by interpreting it. All --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This person is not a talent 

agent.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The is person is a talent 

agent, Justice Scalia. He was operating to procure 

employment. And the statute says anyone who even 

attempts to procure employment is a talent agent, and 

that is all that Mr. Preston did.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Normally we say that 

those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to 

decide. The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the 

existing law as well as a court, and if that's the 

theory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law 

as well as an agency?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, there 

are other things that the Labor Commissioner is invested 

with jurisdiction to do. The Labor Commissioner has to 

find out about these disputes. How does she find out? 

Because parties bring these petitions. This is a great 

deterrent for people from violating the California

Talent Agencies Act. It works because the dispute has 

to come before her. She knows who the bad apples are. 

She knows she can go to get injunctive relief if she 

needs to. Her expertise is advanced. She gets to 

decide the controversy initially. And it merely 

postpones arbitration. And critically, this is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be great as 

a means of informing the Labor Commissioner, but it 

virtually destroys the value of arbitration --

MR. BRUNSTAD: No, but the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because the 

expeditiousness of arbitration is gone once you start 

down the California procedural road. They don't want to 

go to arbitration 8 to 12 months later. They want it 

now.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, it's 

actually enhanced. It's enhanced for all the reasons 

that, when exert brings his or her expertise to bear, 

you can get a settlement; you get expedited resolution 

the issues get refind. Most parties don't go to 

arbitration after this because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then they probably 

shouldn't have agreed to arbitrate, but they did agree 

to arbitrate, and they want to arbitrate now. And one 

of the points of arbitration is to get the ball rolling

application of California law under the --

the Volt case before the California court of appeal. 

Now, the other side did not raise --

the argument -- well, you say we cited a case.

not raise the pre-emption argument at all.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Volt involves a third 

party who is not party to the arbitration agreement. 

You have a party who is bound nonetheless invoking the 

Labor Commission to avoid going immediately to 

arbitration. Volt is very clear. It involves a third 

party, litigation involving a third party who is not 

bound by the arbitration agreement. Here you have only 

two parties. They are both bound by the arbitration 

agreement. I don't see how you can invoke Volt.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because Volt simply was about 

-- a case about postponing arbitration in favor of 

litigation going forward, which has actually had a 

greater impact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Litigation involving a 

person who couldn't be brought into the arbitration.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: True, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It makes sense to say 

that piece of it involving a party who can't be before 

the arbitrator should be -- should be -- go first. But 

here you don't have anybody who isn't bound to go before 

the arbitrator. You have no third party.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Except the Labor Commissioner 

herself who is supposed to do these administrative 

procedures for all kinds of validate and compelling 

State court -- State law reasons.

You don't -- and you assert that the judgment here 

wouldn't be binding at all. It's just because the Labor 

Commissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this --

your opponent says she's not at all --

MR. BRUNSTAD: She is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I imagine that's 

highly debatable.

 It's a different case where you say you have 

to wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as 

to many of the people in the case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Scalia, in Volt, 

the State court litigation went forward, the related 

litigation. It could have res judicata/collateral 

estoppel effects on the arbitration. It has even more 

of an impact on arbitration --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said something about 

that in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong. 

You said something about -- that the outcome of the 

litigation can have preclusive effect in the 

arbitration. But that would be so only if the result 

favored the non-party to the litigation, because the

non-party to the litigation cannot be bound by a 

judgment that would adversely affect that party's 

interest. That party wasn't in the proceeding. It 

isn't bound by it. The parties to the litigation are 

bound by it, not the non-parties to the litigation.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: True, Justice Ginsburg, but 

at least it can bind one of the parties and therefore 

tie the hands of the arbitrator in the subsequent 

proceeding. Here this is not possible. The parties 

bargained for this in their agreement when they 

bargained for the application of California law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could California law do 

this? I mean could they say, you know, we have a 

problem. By the way, this is just a hypothetical. We 

think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know 

very much about building disputes.

 Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in 

fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent 

judges. But California thinks, no, they don't know 

enough about it. So here's what we do. We say when 

Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if 

it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to 

go to Federal -- they can go to the Superior Court. In 

fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the 

other one doesn't. And everything is delayed while the

Superior Court judge decides all the issues in the case. 

And then after they can go back to arbitration, if of 

course they still want to. Could California do that?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, if that's what parties 

bargained for, that was their agreement. It would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: I've read the agreement, 

and I don't quite find their -- here --

MR. BRUNSTAD: But I understand your 

hypothetical --

JUSTICE BREYER: In my mind is what they do 

is they have the same standard arbitration clause. So 

I'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about 

California.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The answer is no. I 

thought so. And so now you explain to me how this is 

any different than what I just said, other than 

substituting the words "Labor Commissioner" for 

"California Superior Court" and substituting the words 

"talent dispute" for the words "building dispute."

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because here what the Labor 

Commissioner does is not what a court does. "Labor 

Commissioner" is not synonymous with "the court" and 

cannot be under California's constitution. Here you 

have a complete, again, arbitration postponing rule and

in fact you had court litigation that was conclusive

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. His hypothetical was 

that the court decision would just be advisory and the

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Scalia, that 

would be inconsistent with the arbitration clause 

itself. Here, however, it is not. Here the parties 

bargained for the application of California law.

thing. This contract will be governed by California 

law.

because California law requires you to go to the Labor 

Commissioner first, not to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I guess that would be 

a question for the arbitrator.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to understand 

your position. In this case, does the California 

provision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply 

to stay the arbitration while that aspect of the 

proceeding is completed?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Under California law -- it is 

California law -- you must go to the labor commissioner 

first before you go either to court or the arbitrator. 

You must go to the arbitrator second.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question was: You go 

to the labor commissioner. You also have a de novo 

right to go to the superior court.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That is correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the labor 

commissioner said something absolutely silly. Wouldn't 

you think you would have the right to go to the Superior 

Court?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Either side -- either side 

can go to the superior court.

to do that and -- and not to also stay the arbitration.

case. We have an arbitration clause.

You go to the labor commissioner, you go to the superior 

court to say enjoin the arbitration while I go to the

does something silly. Can you not then go to superior

superior court should stay the arbitration because you 

have to exhaust the administrative remedies first; and, 

consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, Section 2, 

there might be grounds for invalidating this Arbitration 

Act.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any California case 

that says that this works this way? That after the 

proceeding is finished before the labor commissioner, 

the parties have a right to go to arbitration before 

there's de novo review in the superior court?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Specifically, Justice Alito, 

no. What the California courts have decided is that 

there is a de novo right, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: A de novo right in 

Superior Court?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes. But the California 

Supreme Court has also said, in construing its own 

arbitration act, which is Section 1281, which is 

basically the same as Section 2 of the FAA -- said, 

look, when we have a right to go to court if you have an 

arbitration proceeding, the -- a motion to compel 

arbitration must be granted unless, for example, the 

arbitration clause is invalid for some reason.

you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor 

commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to 

appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to 

compel.

 You can't even wait to see if your opponent 

goes to superior court and -- well, if he has won, he 

wouldn't go into court. But you have to go to the court 

to get a motion to compel? You can't just go ahead and 

proceed with arbitration.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the parties could 

voluntarily do that. But, yes, if you don't do the de 

novo proceeding, then the labor commissioner's decision 

becomes binding.

 So you must take the step of doing the 

notice of appeal and then do a motion to compel.

thought you said it doesn't become binding. That it is 

just advice to the arbitrator. Once you -- once you get 

the remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding.

California Superior Court, then, under Section 1281, you 

have a right to move to compel for arbitration, just as 

under the Federal Arbitration Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

MR. BRUNSTAD: If do you not do those 

things, if you do not take the appeal, then the labor 

commissioner's -- by default, her ruling becomes 

binding. So you have to do the appellate process, and 

you must file a motion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you -- and if 

you are successful and get from the superior court an 

order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then 

appeal it, I assume.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Your opponent can appeal the 

decision compelling the arbitration if it were 

improperly granted, yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you telling us that 

under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case, 

would you go to the superior court for de novo review 

and -- and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, if the 

arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go 

to arbitration. That validity and applicability has not 

been tested by any court below. For example, are there 

grounds --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Let's assume 

the arbitration clause is valid.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, we will go to 

arbitration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though in this case 

you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed 

for the labor commissioner. So the case does not have 

to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed, 

in the superior court?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Labor commissioner goes 

first. Then, we go to arbitration. If this Court rules 

that the labor commissioner's jurisdiction is preempted, 

then we go back to the -- to the lower court. If the 

arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go 

to arbitration. That is correct. Chief Justice 

Roberts, you asked a question about the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking 

at the point in which you said this in your brief. You 

said you go to the labor commission, and then you go to 

the Superior Court. This is page 13 of your brief.

 The court is required to grant a motion 

compelling arbitration if the parties have executed a 

valid and applicable arbitration agreement.

 Well, who determines if the parties have 

executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?

MR. BRUNSTAD: Under First Options here, 

were it not unmistakably clear that the parties said 

that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability, that 

would be for the court to decide.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we know -- this is 

not a mystery in this contract. It says it in the 

contract, and it says it under the AAA rules. But you 

phrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if 

the parties have executed a valid and applicable 

arbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is 

going to decide. So it won't grant a motion to compel 

unless it determines that the parties have executed the 

valid and applicable arbitration agreement.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: And what I meant in that 

language, Justice Ginsburg, is simply this: For 

example, if the arbitration clause were invalid because 

the arbitration clause, itself, were, say, fraudulent 

or -- for something, then it would not be validate and 

applicable; or if the scope of the arbitration clause 

were limited in some way, then the scope issue, the 

arbitrability issue, is for the court to decide as this 

Court decided in First Options.

 Here we do not have the unmistakably clear 

language that the parties intended that the question of 

arbitrability, itself, to be to the arbitrator. So the

JUSTICE BREYER: Right, this is -- this is 

-- actually now we are getting to the bottom of 

something here, I think.

 Now, I am beginning to understand where you 

are coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable 

support, as I -- as I agreed.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, Volt, 

however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that 

was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending 

the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not 

subject to arbitrability.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Therefore, it seems to me 

that the question here concerns the meaning of this 

contract, and that's where we started.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does this contract mean 

that the parties who entered have promised, one, not 

themselves to go to court? Answer: Yes.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Two, not themselves to 

bring a proceeding before this administrative agency? 

And that's where he says yes, and you say no.

too, before the arbitrator?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: And this goes to the Chief 

Justice's initial question which I have been trying to 

get to. And that is when the parties incorporated 

California law, what did they incorporate?

 Well, in Volt this Court answered: When 

they incorporated California law, it was California law; 

not California law with a gloss of Federal law, but 

California law. And the California Supreme Court in the 

Chronus case that we cite says exactly the same thing.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a question of 

contract interpretation --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- for the arbitrator?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why not?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because that goes -- because 

I think that this Court held that it to be no in Volt. 

It said, look, where the -- because that goes to the 

applicability, the validity, of the arbitration clause,

itself.

 Here we don't have arbitrability, itself. 

The First Options standard is not satisfied under this 

case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand --

so you incorporate California law. I interpret that to 

mean substantive law of California.

 You say also incorporates -- and this is 

what I find peculiar. California law gives you a 

procedural right to go to the labor commission. But it 

also gives you a procedural right to go to superior 

court. And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration 

agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses 

your using the superior court.

 Why doesn't it foreclose your using the 

labor commissioner? I don't understand how you slice 

the bologna that thin. To me, if it excludes California 

procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and 

the superior court.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Two reasons, Justice Scalia:

 First, in the Buckeye case, for example, the 

parties specifically selected as their choice of law the 

Federal Arbitration Act. Here the parties selected 

California law. This is no different than in Volt.

 The second reason, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- I want to 

understand that answer. California law includes the 

Superior Court as much as it includes the labor 

commissioner.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: In Volt, Your Honor, the 

specific law that was -- the Court said was selected was 

Section 1281 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, 

which applies in a California court favoring a court 

proceeding because California has this rule that says if 

you have arbitration and related litigation, you can 

stay --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Related litigation with 

someone other than the parties that you bound yourself 

to arbitrate with. That involved Stanford and two 

companies, Stanford suing two companies or -- in 

litigation with two companies with whom it had no 

arbitration agreement.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But 

here I think the Court has drawn the proper distinction 

between, on the one hand, Volt and, on the other hand, 

Doctor's Associates, Mastrobuono, Perry, Allied-Bruce, 

all of those cases where the Court has said if it is an 

arbitration negating rule, you don't incorporate it, 

because that's fundamentally at war with the decision to 

arbitrate.

But where it's merely an arbitration 

postponing rule, which was the procedural issue in Volt 

and the procedural issue here, then we respect that and 

say that's not pre-empted, because it's not necessary to 

pre-empt.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How can we decide this case 

on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration 

postponing rule when there's no California case that 

says that, do you acknowledge?

 And a party resisting arbitration could well 

argue that the California Code means that you go first 

to the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says 

explicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review 

before the Superior Court without making any provision 

for arbitration. Do you think it is inconceivable the 

California courts could interpret the statute to mean 

that, that there's no room for arbitration in the -- in 

this scheme?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It is inconceivable, 

Justice Alito, that the California court would say that 

arbitration is not permissible in this case. The 

California Supreme Court has reconciled previously in 

the Aguilar case, which is 32 Cal. 4th 974. You had two 

different provisions of law. One said you had 

nonbinding arbitration for fee disputes between

attorneys, and the second was the California Arbitration 

Act.

 And the California Supreme Court said, as 

this Court said, that it will indulge every intent to 

give effect to such proceedings, the arbitration 

proceedings, in Section 1281. It will harmonize the 

statutes and say if you if you have a right to 

arbitrate, we will respect that and we will harmonize 

the laws so we respect that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the California Supreme 

Court would construct a system in which you get the 

advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner. One of 

the parties thinks that this expert's advice is 

ridiculous, just absolutely wrong.

 Now, California law generally considers the 

Superior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner, 

which is why you get de novo review before the Superior 

Court.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is stupider than the 

Labor Commissioner.

the California constitutional provision. Under 

California's constitution, for better or worse, you 

cannot have the Labor Commissioner --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. I will amend 

it. The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter 

than the Labor Commissioner, okay? And yet, one of the 

parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong 

doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the 

way the California constitution envisions, by the ex 

officio smarter Superior Court.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is the scheme that 

the California Supreme Court is going to embed in 

California law?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, bankruptcy 

courts cannot enter final decisions, yet we know that 

they're expert in bankruptcy law, even though they're 

subject to de novo review in the district court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, the Court of 

Appeals, the majority said the fact that the losing 

party will have a right to de novo hearing, involving 

additional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant 

from the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy. And I 

think you're preserving the option to go to the Superior 

Court, at least the contestability of the arbitration

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that, it seems to me,

little additional time involved because of the de novo 

hearing.

statement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in 

that respect?

the Superior Court -- the Labor Commissioner does her 

work, and if the parties are not satisfied with it, 

either of them has the right to go to the Superior Court 

for a de novo hearing and file a motion to compel 

arbitration. This would be no different than any other 

Arbitration Act case where, when you get to the --

right to challenge what -- the accuracy of the Labor 

Department's finding. That's what both -- all the

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Yes. 

That is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That does require some 

qualification there.

accurate addition to what we said in our brief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Does it also 

require some qualification in you brief where, at page 

12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to 

procure employment for Ferrer in the television 

industry? Our rules say that you cannot raise matters 

for the first time in this Court. And you have no 

evidence on that point.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, we never got 

to an evidentiary hearing in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know you didn't, and 

that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief. 

Doesn't that require some qualification?

hearing. This case is still at the preliminary stages.

briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, that 

would mean we could make no factual statements to give 

the Court any background at all. I think it is 

undisputed; it isn't challenged by the other side.

it is disputed. They do dispute that he clearly and

Preston went and arranged the meeting with Judge Ferrer 

initially with the folks at ABC.

they dispute that it is to procure employment.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In that light, on page 

43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston 

was an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he 

drafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700.

 I thought it is very much disputed whether 

he was a talent agent at all. I thought the position 

was -- that your opponent is taking is that he was not a 

talent agent, that he didn't come under the statute.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It is undisputed, 

Justice Ginsburg, that Mr. Preston never had a license.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what you 

said here. You say it is undisputed that Preston was an 

unlicensed talent agent. That's your statement.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Our argument, 

Justice Ginsburg, is that he was unlicensed but he was 

operating as a talent agent under section -- under the 

California Talent Agencies Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The latter is disputed. 

The latter is vigorously disputed.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That is disputed, Justice 

Scalia. And they have disputed that. But it is -- let

have filed an appeal to the --

then there would have been a motion to compel for 

arbitration. That --

that all of our citations to the record and all of our 

statements about the facts are, in fact, true.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 I would disagree that there wasn't an 

evidentiary hearing. I don't think the evidence is 

considered, but in addition to Mr. Preston's 

declaration, I made an offer of proof which is in the 

appellant's appendix at page 219. I offered to prove 

that the Judge Alex television program is solicited and 

procured by an agent of the William Morris Agency. I 

had made two attempts to depose Judge Ferrer to prove 

that, and I never got the chance. He didn't want to be 

deposed.

 So, there was a full evidentiary hearing. 

The evidence just wasn't considered because the legal

standard that was applied was there's a colorable claim 

under the Talent Agencies Act, so you can't arbitrate 

until it's resolved.

 Now I saw this as being a long trek through 

the courts. I don't know when the arbitrator gets to 

make his decision. If -- if the Labor Commissioner 

rules that the contract is void and then we have a de 

novo and the Superior Court does that, and the court of 

appeal does it, and then the California Supreme Court 

rules the contract is void, does the arbitrator get to 

overrule that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Regardless of the -- I now 

understand better than I did what I take as a pretty 

strong argument. I'm not saying convincing, but strong.

 And that would be this: If you go look at 

Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California 

Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the 

arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior 

court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated --

some unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the 

same parties -- litigation took place.

 The Court didn't in Volt say that that 

question of interpreting this contract is for the 

arbitrator. I don't know why it didn't. But it didn't.

 Now here he's making a parallel argument.

He's saying that the California Code says that people 

should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you 

can stay arbitration while that goes on.

 Now -- and I say well, why don't you go to 

the arbitrator? He says I don't want to go to the 

arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt.

 And so the puzzle is this: if the Court in 

Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, 

whether the contract really means that you promise not 

to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is 

it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly 

promised not to go into court and asked him to stay 

pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding?

 What do you think about that?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I certainly think that the 

arbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability.

 And the reason for that is the Qualcomm case 

and the Dream Theater case is a California case cited in 

Qualcomm, and that the arbitrator should have decided 

all these issues.

 I would make this observation. If we -- if 

we had gone to the arbitrator and Judge Ferrer had said 

look, this contract is illegal, said you don't have 

jurisdiction, and I want you to rule you don't have 

jurisdiction, the same illegality issue would be a

I see a lot of common sense on your side of it.  But 

imagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I 

come to the following paragraph which I have to write: 

"Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is 

wrong because" -- and now fill in the blank for me.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Assuming Volt --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm just saying I have 

to write. I see all the common sense of your position. 

I -- absolutely. But to get -- you only need one really 

good argument. And he's saying whatever the other ones 

are, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write 

the words, and Volt is different because -- so I would 

like some help on that one.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Because in Volt the contract 

was silent, and the Federal Arbitration Act was silent 

on the issue that was presented, and State law supplied 

the answer. The California Arbitration Act has a number 

of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's always the 

case. It's always the case that the arbitration is 

quiet on this. It is -- the Respondent's position is 

that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely 

clear that it is State law.

MR. SCHLEIMER: The contract here, I would 

submit, Justice Kennedy, is not quiet because it says 

that validity or legality shall be arbitrated. And 

that's what we are talking about. So you don't have a 

silent contract. You have a contract that speaks to 

that question.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that Volt 

would have been different. Volt is -- Volt is written 

very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the 

Respondent's position.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Volt was written under the 

California Arbitration Act, and speaking as a California 

practitioner that had had a lot of cases, you might 

notice that the same section in Volt was the basis for 

my motion to compel arbitration. See codicil procedure 

CC P 1281.2. CC P 1281 is almost identical to Section 2 

of the Federal Arbitration Act, but the California 

Arbitration Act has a number of provisions where the 

Federal Arbitration Act is silent. One of those is 

dealing with multi-party litigation where parties are 

not bound.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think Volt would have 

come out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the 

parties in this other litigation had agreed to 

arbitration? You have any doubt --

MR. SCHLEIMER: I think it would have come 

out the other way, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. I do, too.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: That's what Volt was all 

about, was the fact that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Writing broadly is known as 

dictum, isn't it?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if we write the 

case your way, we have to talk about what happens if 

this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that 

they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they 

did?

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think the Labor 

Commissioner probably does. I think it has to do with 

the adjudicatory versus prosecutorial function of an 

administrative agency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not a 

proceeding brought by the administrative agency.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: No.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: An agency like the EEOC 

Waffle House.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: This is -- this is an --

this is an administrative agency providing an 

adjudicatory forum.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is somebody who's 

bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the 

Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor 

Commissioner commencing a proceeding.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: Waffle House was all about 

the prosecutorial or administrative power. This 

is about the adjudicatory --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend 

says that this agency has exactly that power, and the 

reason you required these things to go before her, is 

that she knows what's going on in the area and, if 

appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or 

whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is.

 MR. SCHLEIMER: I think I pointed out in my 

papers that nothing stops Judge Ferrer from putting a 

dime in the phone, calling the Labor Commissioner and 

complaining, saying there's been illegality here. They 

may request some evidence at that point. But the point 

is that the prosecutorial discretion will be exercised 

by the Labor Commissioner acting in an essentially 

executive branch function.

 Here in our case, all they did was supply a 

hearing room and a hearing officer, an adjudicatory 

function. That's what the arbitrator is supposed to do, 

is adjudicate the case. That's the distinction. And I

see Gilmer as being a situation where there's an attempt 

to avoid adjudicating in the agreed forum. And I see 

Waffle House as saying that we're not going to hogtie 

administrative agencies when they perform the 

prosecutorial function, the administrative function.

 I guess if there are no further questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
