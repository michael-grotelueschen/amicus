3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 


4 argument next in Case 12-25, Maracich v. Spears. 


Mr. Guerra? 


6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA 


7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 


8  MR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


9 please the Court: 


The DPPA requires express consent when personal 

11 information in the DMV databases is used for bulk 

12 solicitation. The express consent requirement is 

13 Congress's considered response to one of the core 

14 problems that the DPPA targets, and the litigation 

exception creates no exception for lawyers. 

16  In fact, when Congress intended to create an 

17 explicit exception --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it create an 

19 exception for research? Let's assume that a university 

wanted to do a research project, and it needs subjects. 

21 I get solicited for it all the time. 

22  Does this exception apply to them, too? 

23  MR. GUERRA: Our view, Your Honor, as we 

24 indicated in our reply brief, is it would not because we 

believe (b)(12)'s consent requirement governs commercial

1 bulk use of DMV information, which is clear from the 

2 fact that it's focusing on marketing and solicitation 

3 and also from the history behind the statute, which is 

4 very much aimed at use of DMV information --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It says, "surveys," not 

6 just marketing or solicitations. 

7  MR. GUERRA: Yes, it does, Justice 

8 Sotomayor. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, there is a 

commercial component, but there appears to be a 

11 noncommercial component as well. 

12  MR. GUERRA: We -- we think, Justice 

13 Sotomayor, that this statute is sensibly construed to --

14 under the noscitur a sociis principle that we are 

relying on elsewhere in our argument with respect to 

16 (b)(4). That that same principle applies to the three 

17 things that -- that the bulk solicitation -- the bulk 

18 use provision governs and, particularly, when you look 

19 at the history underlying the statute which was very 

much aimed at use of the information for direct 

21 marketing. 

22  And so -- as I was saying, Congress made 

23 clear --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that apply to the 

States, too, when they want to market against drunk

1 driving, they want to market against -- for their health 

2 insurance processes versus private processes for State 

3 drug provided --

4  MR. GUERRA: Justice Sotomayor, I believe 

what your first question sounded -- your first example 

6 sounded like it was a noncommercial use. I think that 

7 in the -- in the case where the State is acting as a 

8 commercial entity, the same rules we would -- we would 

9 apply with respect to lawyer solicitation would apply 

there. 

11  And the reason I say that -- and the reason 

12 I think it's so clear that Congress intended that really 

13 lies in the language of Subsection (b)(2) because, 

14 there, Congress made clear that it understood that these 

provisions are not wholly independent permissions and, 

16 in fact, that the consent requirement governs all 

17 commercial bulk use, absent an explicit exception. 

18  And, if you take a look, it's in the second 

19 page of the addendum to our opening brief. And it says 

that, "Personal information may be used in connection 

21 with matters of motor vehicle market research activity, 

22 including survey research." 

23  Congress included the survey research clause 

24 because a commercial bulk survey using personal 

information would otherwise be governed by (b)(12)'s 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

Official 

1 consent requirement, and so Congress had to make clear 

2 that it was creating an exception for one industry to 

3 engage in this one particular type of bulk use. 

4  And the reason we know that the survey 

research clause means that is because, under 

6 Respondent's interpretation, it has no affect 

7 whatsoever. If -- if, as they say, each of these 

8 clauses is wholly independent and sufficient to 

9 authorize whatever it covers, a phrase covering "in 

connection with matters of motor vehicle market research 

11 activities" would, in and of itself, cover the subset of 

12 motor vehicle market research survey research. 

13  So to give that clause any effect, you must 

14 understand that it's overriding the express consent 

requirement of (b)(12) and -- such that you now have to, 

16 when you look at the other provisions that might 

17 authorize bulk commercial use, find a comparably 

18 explicit authorization, and you can't find that in 

19 (b)(4). (B)(4) says nothing about solicitation, much 

less bulk solicitation. And --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It says, "anticipation of 

22 litigation in connection" --

23  MR. GUERRA: Yes. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not only ongoing 

litigation, but it can be used in connection with

1 anticipation of litigation. 

2  MR. GUERRA: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But my 

3 point is that, in (b)(2), you find an explicit 

4 authorization for survey research, which is one of the 

very three topics covered in (b)(12) itself. When you 

6 look at (b)(4), you don't see anything about 

7 solicitation, which is the kind of explicit override 

8 that (b)(2) indicates Congress wanted or -- or is 

9 necessary in order to conclude that another subsection 

overrides (b)(12)'s express consent requirement. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- Mr. Guerra, I have to 

12 admit that, given what a mess this statute is, those 

13 three words don't quite do it for me. So, I mean, 

14 the -- the argument against you, right, is -- as to 

using (b)(12) to define (b)(4), is that, look, this is 

16 just a list of exceptions to a general prohibition, and 

17 no one is more general or specific than any other, and 

18 all you have to do is fit within one of them. And it 

19 doesn't matter whether you don't fit within two of them, 

if you don't fit within one of them. 

21  So then the question would be: Are you 

22 covered by (b)(4) or not? If not, are you covered by 

23 (b)(12) or not? 

24  MR. GUERRA: Well, Justice Kagan, with 

respect, number one, I don't think you can so readily

dismiss the -- the interpretive import of those three 
words because they don't have any function other than to 
override the express consent requirement in (b)(12). 
And, if there is no need -- if (b)(12) doesn't apply to 
any other subsection, there is no need to be overriding 
it in (b)(2). 

But we don't rely solely on that -- the 
force of those three words. It's also the case that 
(b)(2) -- excuse me, (b)(12) is one of the core 
provisions of the statute, in the sense that it's aimed 
at one of the fundamental problems that prompted passage 
of the Act in the first place, which was DMVs collecting 
information, then making it available to direct 
marketers. 

And so you are in a situation where you've 
got a core restriction aimed at a core problem this 

Statute 
is designed to -- to resolve, but -- whereas (b)(4) is 
one of the few subsections that authorize access to the 
most sensitive information that Congress -- excuse me, 
that DMVs were -- were collecting. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of hard to 
argue, when you have (b)s (1) through (14), that (b)(12) 
is the core provision. Usually, it's -- it's 1 of 14 
items in a list. 

MR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, what I mean

1  by that is that we know it's -- it's core in the sense 

2  that it's aimed at one of the core problems that 

3  Congress was addressing. And (b)(4), by contrast, is 

4  one of the few provisions in which Congress authorized 

access to the most sensitive information DMVs collect, 

6  such as medical and disability status and Social 

7  Security numbers. 

8  And we submit it's simply implausible to 

9  think that a Congress concerned with undue 

public/private access to DMV information would, in the 

11  same statute, grant lawyers the right -- a unique right, 

12  to use that highly sensitive information in order to 

13  engage in bulk solicitation. 

14  And, in fact, the legislative record here is 

devoid of any evidence that Congress was aware that 

16  lawyers ever made use of DMV information for 

17  solicitation, much less that -- or that they 

18  contemplated it, much less that Congress made a 

19  conscious decision to allow them to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you recognize that you 

21  could use (b)(4) to identify class members? 

22  MR. GUERRA: We do, Your Honor. And -- and 

23  that's -- that is because that is not a solicitation. 

24  That class notice is advising people who are not aware 

that there is pending litigation that could affect their

1  rights. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so if it's -- if 

3  it's a solicitation, suppose this information was a -- the 

4  recent automobile purchaser was asked: Did you buy a 

car recently? Were you charged this additional fee? 

6  Period. That would be okay? 

7  MR. GUERRA: Your Honor, yes. It would be 

8  okay -- well, let me just say if -- if the person --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would come under 

(b)(4)? 

11  MR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, if I may just 

12  qualify my answer, yes, if you were investigating claims 

13  on behalf of a potential client. I don't think -- I 

14  don't think people can just go down to the DMV and 

answer questions of personal interests to themselves --

16  or lawyers, for that matter. But that is an instance in 

17  which you are simply engaging in investigation, assuming 

18  that you are investigating a possible lawsuit, and not a 

19  circumstance in which you are engaging in solicitation. 

And that is a fundamental difference. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, aren't we going to 

22  be told the whole essence of the class action is you 

23  have to see if there is an injury that goes beyond some 

24  particular clients that you know. And isn't this --

isn't this investigation in anticipation?

1  MR. GUERRA: Your Honor -- Justice Kennedy, 

2  if they had limited their activities to conducting an 

3  investigation, to determine the scope of a potential 

4  claim, we would have no quarrel with that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the anticipation is, 

6  are -- are you willing to join the class? 

7  MR. GUERRA: But that --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that critical? 

9  MR. GUERRA: No -- no, Justice Kennedy, I 

don't think so. And I think the point of (b)(4) is it's 

11  focused on proceedings, not on lawyers. And it's 

12  asking -- its basic goal is to ensure that tribunals can 

13  do their job. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I do think you are 

helped somewhat by the -- the chronological progression 

16  here, is it including the service of process, which 

17  means the case has already started, and then 

18  investigation in anticipation of the litigation that 

19  follows the service of process. 

So it -- it is true that there is a 

21  chronological aspect. In order, it seems to me, for the 

22  Respondents to prevail, they have to say that 

23  investigation in anticipation of litigation also 

24  precedes service of process. 

MR. GUERRA: They would, and I think they do

1  make that argument, Justice Kennedy. My point is that 

2  the focus of (b)(4) is on the tribunals, in ensuring 

3  that they have -- they can have the information, that 

4  they can do their job, which is to make and enforce 

judgments. Lawyers get information under (b)(4) when 

6  they act as officers of these tribunals, not for their 

7  own commercial benefit. When --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Guerra, where do you get 

9  that from, in (b)(4), this focus on tribunals, rather 

than lawyers? Because -- you know, the -- the 

11  investigation is done by lawyers, right? And that's a 

12  critical part of (b)(4), so where -- where does that 

13  come from in the statute? 

14  MR. GUERRA: It comes from the phrase "for 

use in connection with any civil, criminal, 

16  administrative or arbitral proceeding in any Federal, 

17  State, or local court or agency." And --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: But then it includes things 

19  that are clearly done by lawyers. 

MR. GUERRA: Right. My point is that 

21  lawyers get access when they act as officers of those 

22  tribunals, not for their own commercial self-interests. 

23  And an investigation in anticipation of litigation is an 

24  obligation that all lawyers have, to ensure that they 

have a well-founded factual basis for bringing a lawsuit

1  in the first instance. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are -- are you 

3  saying that the study must be either a solicitation or 

4  an investigation? It can't be both? Why can't it be 

both? 

6  MR. GUERRA: Because, Justice Kennedy, the 

7  DM -- the DPPA is designed to -- it was aiming at a 

8  fundamental problem of private individuals obtaining DMV 

9  information for commercial solicitation purposes. And 

Congress, we know, wanted to stop that in the absence 

11  of consent. So -- by the same token, they wanted to 

12  make sure that they weren't intruding on the information 

13  that courts and other tribunals need to do their jobs. 

14  And so the -- the distinction is you can 

engage in an investigation because that's acting as an 

16  officer of the court, in order to help the court 

17  ultimately render its judgment. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why -- would 

19  you -- I want to make sure I understood your prior 

answer. You said, I thought, that it would have been 

21  okay to get the information from the bureau and then 

22  ask, did you buy a car recently? Did you have this 

23  additional charge? Now, suppose -- you said that was 

24  all right? 

MR. GUERRA: That -- Justice Ginsburg, I

1  apologize if I am not making myself clear enough. The 

2  vital distinction is between investigative activity to 

3  ensure that you have a well-founded basis to file a 

4  lawsuit, versus solicitation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't that --

6  wasn't that crystal-clear here? Because the dealers 

7  were saying, you can't go forward unless you have a 

8  plaintiff to match every dealer. You're trying to bring 

9  a representative action, but your list of plaintiffs, 

none of them bought from Dealer Z. So we are 

11  investigating to see if we can have a representative 

12  action with a line-up of plaintiffs, each of whom has 

13  purchased from a list of defendants. 

14  MR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, determining 

that there are -- there are enough plaintiffs to justify 

16  a class or group action is the -- the investigative 

17  activity, but, when you go on to invite them -- and the 

18  Fourth Circuit ruled that these letters were 

19  solicitations, and that ruling is not before this Court 

at this point --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose we had --

22  what -- it was limited to did you buy the car, did you 

23  pay the fee? And then somebody who --

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: We -- we have just those 

3  questions, no -- are you interested in joining a 

4  lawsuit, please call us. But somebody who receives this 

notice, it just asks, did you buy a car, did you pay the 

6  charge, then calls the lawyer's office and says, tell me 

7  something about this letter that you told me -- that 

8  you -- you sent to me. 

9  And how does the lawyer answer? 

MR. GUERRA: If the lawyer answers by asking 

11  investigative questions, when did you buy the car, were 

12  you charged these fees, were -- were you advised, were 

13  they prominently displayed, all of which is in gathering 

14  information for the lawsuit, then the lawyer is engaging 

in permissible investigative prefiling activity --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the lawyer had said 

17  more -- did you buy a car, did you get charged the fee, 

18  we're investigating this to determine whether this is --

19  violates the law -- is that okay? 

MR. GUERRA: It still is, Your -- Your 

21  Honor. The critical line --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the only -- the only 

23  thing that's bad is to say, come call us for a

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the difference 

3  between that and how you answered Justice Ginsburg, when 

4  she said class notice would be okay? 

MR. GUERRA: Because class notice is not a 

6  proposal of a -- of a relation -- a commercial 

7  transaction. It is noticed --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. It's 

9  joining the class or opting out. 

MR. GUERRA: Correct. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, when you join the 

12  class, you have a commercial relationship with the 

13  lawyer no different than being a named plaintiff. 

14  MR. GUERRA: But the function of class 

notice is not to enable class lawyers to solicit 

16  clients. It is to enable courts to render binding 

17  judgments and to satisfy due process requirements, so 

18  that people unaware of a litigation do not have their 

19  rights forfeited. That is fundamentally different 

than -- than soliciting clients. 

21  And I realize that --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Guerra, that 

23  distinction -- I understand that you are deriving some 

24  of it from (b)(12), but if I -- just -- just assume with 

me that (b)(12) has nothing to do with anything, and you

1  were just limited to (b)(4), can you find that 

2  distinction in (b)(4)? 

3  MR. GUERRA: Your Honor, I think the point 

4  here is that, if you look at the conduct that is 

specified in the three examples, it is all activity that 

6  lawyers would be engaging in as officers of a court. 

7  And this Court has repeatedly recognized that there is a 

8  fundamental difference between lawyers acting in their 

9  own commercial capacities, as opposed to officers of a 

court. 

11  And --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how is 

13  somebody conducting an investigation in anticipation of 

14  litigation -- it hasn't started yet -- acting as an 

officer of the court? 

16  MR. GUERRA: Because they're discharging 

17  their responsibility to ensure that they bring 

18  well-founded claims and don't file suits without -- I 

19  mean, under Rule 11, you have to have a well-founded 

factual basis for the allegations in the complaint. 

21  So you need to do --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just 

23  seems to me to be saying a lawyer is always acting 

24  as an officer of the court.

4  anything -- anything that the officer functions --

MR. GUERRA: I think most times, when you 

6  are in -- engaging in litigation or pre-filing an 

7  investigation, that would be true, and that's -- that 

8  would be all protected under (b)(4). The difference 

9  is -- there is a -- there is a distinction. This Court 

has recognized that lawyers have multiple capacities. 

11  They wear three hats. They are -- they represent 

12  clients, they're officers of courts, and they're 

13  commercial actors --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Guerra, don't you 

think -- I mean, I understand the distinction. The 

16  lawyer as commercial actor versus lawyer as officer of 

17  the court. But, boy, it's hard to get that from the 

18  words here. I mean, that -- that seems like the kind of 

19  old-time legislative interpretation, where we just 

figured out the statute that we hoped Congress would 

21  have written, as opposed to the statute that it did. 

22  I mean, tell me where that distinction is in 

23  this -- in this provision. 

24  MR. GUERRA: Well, Justice Kagan, for one 

thing, I think that, even if you decide that (b)(12) is

Official 

1  not governing (b) -- (b)(4), it's still part of the 

2  statute. And it still demonstrates that Congress was 

3  concerned about people using DMV information in order to 

4  engage in commercial activity. 

And so the question then is, here's (b)(4), 

6  which says, we're authorizing use of information for use 

7  in tribunals. There's no mention of lawyers here. And 

8  so the question is -- and this provision authorizes use 

9  of the most sensitive information that -- that DMVs 

collect. 

11  So the question you have to ask yourself is: 

12  In light of (b)(12) and the fact that we know Congress 

13  was trying to stop use of DMV information for 

14  non-consensual solicitations, is it reasonable to think 

that this clause authorizes lawyers to use disability 

16  status and medical information in order to go find and 

17  solicit clients? 

18  And I submit it is not, particularly if you 

19  take the same broad reading that the Respondents argue 

for, the "in connection with" language, and you apply 

21  that to (b)(6) and (b)(10), then you have these truly 

22  incongruous results, where this Court in Condon 

23  recognized that insurers were one of the purchasers of

2  activity in connection with the business of insurance. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I understand 

4  your argument about (12), but I -- I do think that you 

ought to assume we might interpret this statute, so that 

6  each of these is independent, and you have to 

7  concentrate on (4). You keep going back to (12), when 

8  we're talking about (4). 

9  If you talk about (4) for a minute, it seems 

to me that you might give away too much because the 

11  statute says, "including service of process," which 

12  means the suit has to begin and then investigation in 

13  anticipation of the litigation that will follow after 

14  that suit has come in. 

But you seem to give that away. You seem to 

16  think that investigation in anticipation of litigation 

17  can be before the suit is filed. You -- you seem to 

18  concede that. 

19  MR. GUERRA: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you 

21  concede that. 

22  MR. GUERRA: I guess I -- I've never 

23  understood that -- after service of process, it's still 

24  in anticipation of litigation. It's been my 

understanding that service of process --

3  MR. GUERRA: It initiates --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they -- they are 

describing only what goes on in the court. If you just 

6  took the phrase "investigation in anticipation of 

7  litigation," "in anticipation of" sounds like before 

8  litigation begins. 

9  MR. GUERRA: I am not disputing that, 

Justice Ginsburg. My point is, though, even the -- the 

11  (b)(6) and (b)(10) examples I just gave, 

12  Justice Kennedy, don't -- it's not a reliance on (b)(12) 

13  anymore. It's just demonstrating why it's implausible 

14  to think that the phrase "in connection with" should be 

read so literally that it authorizes anything that can 

16  be shown to have a connection with the subject matter. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You -- you said earlier, 

18  and it set me to thinking, that why would in 

19  anticipation of litigation permit access to all of this 

very personal information? And I don't know that, yes, 

21  it does permit access, but only in anticipation of 

22  litigation. So you have to prove, before you get things 

23  like Social Security number, driver -- anything else --

24  all they asked for was name and addresses, I understand. 

MR. GUERRA: Justice Sotomayor, that's true

1  in this case, but if you -- if you read before, the way 

2  Respondents are asking you to read it, there's no 

3  limitation in the statute that says you can specify --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, yes, there is. 

There is a limitation that you're actually going to use 

6  it in relationship to the litigation, number one. And 

7  the States are obligated to ensure that what they 

8  release is actually covered by one of these exceptions. 

9  MR. GUERRA: If you interpret (b)(4) to 

authorize access by lawyers in connection -- based on 

11  the theory that they are -- it's in connection with some 

12  litigation, they will have access --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they have to explain 

14  why. 

MR. GUERRA: You -- the -- the request in 

16  this case simply said, "pursuant to (b)(4) of the 

17  statute." 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. As I read, 

19  the first one is: We want to see if there is a pattern 

of overcharging; give us the names and addresses of 

21  people who have recently bought a car. That seems, to 

22  me, pretty specific as to what they want and why they 

23  need it. And I think it's pretty easy for the State to 

24  say this fits. 

MR. GUERRA: Justice Sotomayor, two points:

1  The four requests that followed after the first two said 

2  nothing of the sort, and the State gave me information. 

3  It just said pursuant to the subsection that we're 

4  talking about right now. 

In addition, there is no reason why lawyers 

6  couldn't go in and say, I would like to identify -- I am 

7  investigating whether people have claims for a 

8  disability claims or -- or based on their medical 

9  status, and I would like information of that ilk from --

from the DMV. (B)(4) authorizes those -- that -- the 

11  provision of that information. And it doesn't say that 

12  there has to be some heightened showing by -- by the 

13  lawyers in order to obtain it. So --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Guerra, suppose I am a 

lawyer, and I want to bring a toxic tort case, and I am 

16  really -- I am looking for witnesses who have the same 

17  kind of symptoms as my client had. And so I put out a 

18  letter saying -- you know, have you have been exposed 

19  and -- and tell me about it, so that I can find out if 

you are a good witness, and -- you know, if you have, I 

21  would also like to represent you. Would -- would that 

22  count? 

23  MR. GUERRA: Two points, Justice Kagan. The 

24  first is that you have highlighted why this is such a 

unique loophole for one very discrete class of lawyers.

1  Most -- toxic tort lawyers cannot go to a DMV and say, I

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess what I was 

4  suggesting was that, if I was just asking for witnesses, 

you would have to say that that was included by (b)(4); 

6  is that right? 

7  MR. GUERRA: I do. I do acknowledge that. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, now, the court -- the 

9  lawyer is saying, in addition to your help as a witness, 

if you have the same symptoms -- you know, you can join 

11  the suit. 

12  MR. GUERRA: And I think that that's an 

13  improper use. The Congress did not create this 

14  authorization to go down to get the most sensitive 

information in order to enable lawyers to find clients 

16  more easily than they might otherwise find them. And so 

17  investigation in anticipation of litigation is one use 

18  that Congress authorized, and, as I have suggested, it's 

19  a use that helps a lawyer discharge his or her 

responsibility to a court. 

21  Asking somebody --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know why this 

23  case doesn't fit that description because the -- the 

24  position that the dealers were taking was you can't --

you ought to maintain a representative action. The

3  numerous. 

4  So how am I going to find out if it's 

numerous, without asking these questions? 

6  MR. GUERRA: You -- you can ask every 

7  question up to, "Would you like to be a plaintiff in the 

8  lawsuit," and that would be fine. That's the dividing 

9  line. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Might that get the lawyer 

11  into some difficulty with the Bar Association? They'll 

12  look at this and say, look, we told you, if you are --

13  if you are seeking clients, then you have to put 

14  advertising material. And a letter like that would tip 

the recipient off to something is going on, I should 

16  find out about it, and maybe I should join it. 

17  MR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, I think that 

18  the -- the fact that that might trigger an obligation to 

19  make a disclosure is not dispositive of whether it's a 

solicitation. It would still be an objective factual 

21  inquiry. And, if there were no indications in the 

22  letter that someone is being invited to join a lawsuit, 

23  then it would be permissible investigation. 

24  I would like to point out, though, in terms 

of why they needed this information, these lawyers filed

1  suits initially against dozens and, later, against

sent out what the Fourth Circuit determined were 

6  solicitations, in order to get clients in the claims 

7  they had already improperly asserted. 

8  They did not need that information to 

9  indicate the interest of the named plaintiffs they 

already had. Those people had standing to sue --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then there is a whole 

12  string of defendants who were doing the same thing --

13  the same allegedly unlawful practice, they couldn't 

14  reach without getting additional plaintiffs. 

MR. GUERRA: But their -- their clients have 

16  no interest or need to reach those other dealerships. 

17  They have a claim against the dealers with whom they 

18  dealt --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But their client is a --

is a group. This -- this is not an individual action --

21  MR. GUERRA: That's true, Justice Ginsburg. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute says sue for 

23  the benefit of the whole.

Mr. Clement? 

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

13  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

14  please the Court: 

The DPPA is an unusual statute. It directly 

16  regulates the State's use of their own databases and 

17  imposes massive civil liability and criminal penalties 

18  for violations. It regulates it in a relatively 

19  distinct way, which is it makes disclosures 

presumptively unlawful, but then has 14 permissible use 

21  provisions for which the State may, but does not must, 

22  may disclose the information. 

23  The scope of those 14 permissible use 

24  provisions then becomes quite important for determining 

whether or not a statute that was originally designed 

27

Official 

1  primarily to regulate the commercial sale of DMV 

2  information becomes intrusive into matters of 

3  traditional State regulation or imposes massive 

4  liability without the requisite clarity. 

Now, I would have thought that it was fairly 

6  clear that, but for a resort to the specific controls to 

7  the general canon, that all of the activity at issue 

8  here comes comfortably within the language of (b)(4) 

9  because, if you look at that language, it is remarkably 

broad. Congress uses the word "any" three times. It 

11  uses "in connection with," which I think we all know is 

12  a term of breadth. And then it uses "including" and 

13  uses illustrative examples. 

14  And I think the only thing that really 

brings these examples together is Congress seems to be 

16  covering the litigation process from cradle to grave. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing we also 

18  know about the "in connection with" language is that we 

19  have said, it can't really mean "in connection with," as 

broadly as that -- the Morales case, I guess, it has to 

21  have a more narrow meaning. Otherwise, everything would 

22  be covered. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

24  exactly right. But the whole reason it has to have 

some limit is because it's presumptively quite broad.

1  And if -- I mean, for those who look at legislative 

2  history, the evolution of this provision, as it -- it 

3  was changed twice in the legislative process. 

4  And it started out that Congress was going 

to have a permissible use just for use in litigation 

6  involving motor vehicles. Then they dropped "motor 

7  vehicles" and just said, "use in litigation." And then, 

8  in the final iteration, they said, "use in connection 

9  with litigation." So, clearly, they were trying to 

broaden it. 

11  Now, I -- I would be the first to admit that 

12  there has to be some limit, and we certainly wouldn't 

13  say, for example, that if lawyers -- you know, decide in 

14  this case, well -- you know, we got this DMV information 

for perfectly legitimate purposes involved in a 

16  litigation, but, now, we are sitting on a gold mine, so 

17  we should try to sell -- sell these same people floor 

18  mats or wiper blades or something. I mean, of course, 

19  they can't do that. So there are limits, but I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can they do this: Can --

21  can Lawyer Smith say -- you know, there are some 

22  products in this State that I really suspect are not 

23  being properly made, and I have probably a tort suit; 

24  and the damages are awfully small; I would like to get 

10 or 20,000 plaintiffs. I wonder if there is anybody

6  the names of everybody who -- I'd like all your names 

7  and addresses, and I intend to write them all and send 

8  them a letter and say, I suspect there is some fishy 

9  business going on here in the dress manufacturers; would 

you like to tell me about what happened? Is that 

11  possible? Can they do that? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: It may or may not, depending 

13  on where you draw the line. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you --

MR. CLEMENT: But can I say something before 

16  we talk about that? You know, if they are really trying 

17  to go after the dress manufacturers --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: -- they can go to the phone 

book, they can go to the title records office, there is 

21  lots of places they can go, if what they want is just 

22  general information about people. And the only State 

23  database that Congress has seen fit to regulate is DMV 

24  databases.

4  MR. CLEMENT: But, Justice Breyer, that's 

part of the reason I'm pointing --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: So maybe what they want is 

7  they want the names of all the people who've ever had a 

8  car -- you know, because they think there's something 

9  special about a car, and they think that's going to be 

connected. But you see what I'm driving at. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: I --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: You have no lawsuit, but 

13  you are going to get one if you can, and you have 

14  grounds for thinking that there is some suspicious 

defendants, and what you are looking for is plaintiffs. 

16  That's all. 

17  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. And --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: All you are looking for is 

19  plaintiffs. Now, can you, under this statute, go and 

get the information, where all you are looking for is 

21  plaintiffs for your lawsuit? So far, you know how many 

22  plaintiffs you have? None. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: I think, actually, the best 

24  answer, at the end of the day, is it depends on whether 

you are focused on a specific transaction, occurrence,

2  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is your answer 

3  what I have in my mind -- I'm just repeating the same 

4  question. I will do that -- I have some reason for 

thinking there are a whole bunch of defendants here who 

6  have done something wrong. All I am lacking is a 

7  plaintiff, and what I want to do is get the names of 

8  potential plaintiffs. It's the same question. I have 

9  asked that three times. Either you can, in your view, 

get it under this lawsuit, or you cannot. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: I would say the best answer is 

12  that you can. If you don't like that answer and you 

13  want to draw the line in a different place --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm not liking or 

disliking. All I want to know is --

16  MR. CLEMENT: Well, here -- here's the 

17  thing -- is I think there is a couple of places you 

18  could draw the line, and I think there is a line drawing 

19  question any time you have language like "in connection 

with." The first would be, okay, I'm lawyers, and I 

21  want to get clients for litigation. 

22  You could say, well, that's enough of an "in 

23  connection" requirement, so you can use that. I would 

24  say that that's probably on the other side of the line, 

but you could just say that's close enough.

1  The other place you could draw the line is

4  if I get this information and send people letters and 

say, I see you bought a new car in the last two years --

6  you know, there is a lemon law in this State --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. Now, that's 

8  your -- now, that's the line. As to some of these 

9  defendants, what he's saying is, these lawyers had no 

client that my defendant hurt, none. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Well --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: And as to some of these, 

13  but not all the requests, all they were doing was they 

14  were looking for somebody who bought a car from me. And 

the reason they want that is to ask them what the 

16  practice was, so they can get a plaintiff to do what the 

17  complaint is about. So it's at least two -- or one or 

18  two of the requests are like that. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: No, they are not in the 

following sense, Justice Breyer -- okay. Just to 

21  understand kind of the chronology here, no request --

22  FOIA request is made at all here until my clients have 

23  been approached by individuals who are complaining,

actually filed. Now, they want to say --

prove it to me. All -- what I'm trying to get at is the 

6  statement that I could write in an opinion that will 

7  draw the boundary of this provision south of -- well, 

8  the lawyer can go out when he has reason to believe that 

9  a defendant has done something wrong and, to use a 

pejorative, troll for clients. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Right. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: I want it south of that, 

13  and, now, you will tell me the words I can use that will 

14  both help your client because they will cover this case, 

but will also be south of that. What are --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what is south? 

17  I don't have a compass here. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: South means -- south means 

it does not -- you can't just go and troll for clients, 

21  simply because you think a defendant has done something 

22  wrong, and you have no client. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: If you want to draw the line 

24  south of the trolling line, then I think what you would 

say is this is an easy case because no communication

they had a conspiracy claim against those other dealers.

7  they had a beef with those dealers.

9  interrupt just -- just one moment. I may have misheard,

12  request was -- the first FOIA request was June 23rd,

that you had a few people came and complained to the

7  widespread this was. Suppose the lawyer herself bought 

8  a car recently, and she got this administrative fee. 

9  And, now, she has -- no clients have approached her, but 

she would like to find out how many similarly situated 

11  people there are, so she can get one of these 

12  representative actions going.

litigation exception? 

16  MR. CLEMENT: I think it would, 

17  Justice Ginsburg, because I think that, when you are 

18  trying to figure out where to draw the line, you look to 

19  the words in the statute, which you know that 

"investigation in anticipation of litigation" is 

21  covered, and I would think that would fit comfortably

Mr. Chief Justice, which is why the line can't really be

4  but allows the sort of thing that you want to do? 

MR. CLEMENT: I think the way you do is you 

6  would basically say that, when they are saying, "in 

7  anticipation of litigation," they mean in anticipation 

8  of a particular litigation, particular problem, and so 

9  it's different --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't have to 

11  be filed in court, that may just be --

12  MR. CLEMENT: Oh, absolutely not. I mean, 

13  it seems to me --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- residing in the 

brain of any lawyer who's looking for work. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: No. They are -- they are 

17  concerned about a particular thing, and I think the "in 

18  anticipation of litigation" language, I mean, that's not 

19  the only time you have ever seen it before --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just that 

21  language. It's "investigation in anticipation of 

22  litigation." If I understand you correctly, you are 

23  saying investigation includes solicitation. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that your position?

1  MR. CLEMENT: I think it is, though I guess 

2  my point would be, even if you can identify some 

3  solicitation that is not investigation, as long as it's 

4  in connection with litigation, it's in (b)(4), and then 

I think --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you are saying 

7  that really this is a -- the way the statute works is it 

8  says nobody can solicit, but for lawyers. And that's 

9  not -- that makes more sense than you might think 

because this was not a statute that was meant to 

11  interfere with solicitation rules; it was meant to 

12  interfere with commercial selling. 

13  And -- and that's what this is about, and 

14  there is a requirement, the requirement as to the 

lawyer, in good faith, has to believe that, if he finds 

16  a client, there's a case. 

17  MR. CLEMENT: I agree with everything, 

18  except the first thing you said --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. CLEMENT: -- which is that this is a 

21  prohibition on solicitation. If you look at the 

22  structure of the statute, it says, presumptively, you 

23  can't use this for anything. And then there are 14 

24  permissions. And some of the permissions, like (b)(4), 

are unconditional. If you come within (b)(4), you get 

39

1  to use it. 

2  Now, when you get to the end of the statute, 

3  which is -- I respectfully suggest is not where you put 

4  the core provisions, it's where you put the less favored 

provisions -- then you have, in (b)(12), a conditional 

6  permission that you can use it, but only if you get 

7  consent. 

8  Now, the thrust of their position is, if you 

9  are in one of the unconditional permissions, but you 

also are, presumptively, in one of the conditional 

11  permissions, somehow, that condition from (b)(12) hops 

12  over to (b)(12) -- (b)(4) and says --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't think 

14  that is fair. I think their position is, to harmonize 

(b)(4) and (b)(12), you have to interpret investigation, 

16  not to include solicitation, because, otherwise, you 

17  have a conflict, that (b)(12) prohibits solicitation, 

18  unless you have the consent; whereas, (b)(4), which 

19  says, "investigation," does not require consent. 

Now, the two exist in perfect harmony if 

21  investigation does not include solicitation, but 

22  there -- there is a discrepancy between the two if it 

23  does include solicitation. And you have to say, well, 

24  this is an exception from (b)(12). 

MR. CLEMENT: No, you don't. There is no

1  discrepancy. A conditional -- like you get a green 

2  light for use in litigation. You get a yellow light for 

3  solicitation. If you have solicitation in connection 

4  with litigation, you're covered by both, you take the 

green light, there is no conflict. 

6  And the premise for your discussion was we 

7  have to harmonize. I would take issue with that. If 

8  you look at these 14 exemptions, there is tons of 

9  overlap in them. Congress is not telling you that each 

of these 14 exceptions has an exclusive area, and you 

11  have to find out which field is preempted by (1), (2), 

12  (3), (4), (5), (6), (7). If you look at (b)(1) and 

13  (b)(4), there is complete overlap. 

14  One of the things I would take issue with is 

my brother said that, well, (b)(4) is about the 

16  tribunal. No, it's not. (B)(1) is principally about 

17  the tribunal. (B)(1) is the provision that talks about 

18  government actors and their functions, and it 

19  specifically talks about torts. 

JUSTICE ALITO: (B)(4) is about -- (b)(4) is 

21  about very sensitive information. You're talking about 

22  people's Social Security numbers. You're talking about 

23  whether the person has a disability that they may not 

24  want to disclose to the general public -- a person has 

Parkinson's or -- or epilepsy or is diabetic.

1  And so you're just -- you're saying lawyers, 

2  they -- they get all that stuff. Nobody else can, but 

3  lawyers are a privileged class, and they get it. 

4  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Alito, it is important 

to recognize lawyers presumptively get it under Federal 

6  law, but Federal law is only a floor. And so let's take 

7  Social Security numbers, please, because, sure, as to 

8  (b)(4) and (b)(1) and two other provisions, Congress 

9  says, presumptively, you can get Social Security 

numbers. 

11  You know what -- you know what State -- the 

12  State of South Carolina says? You never get Social 

13  Security numbers, unless you have a court order. They 

14  put that right in their State FOIA law. And so that is 

just another example of how -- this is a Federal floor. 

16  States can release this information. They don't have 

17  to. 

18  And, to Justice Breyer's point, it makes 

19  sense that you would distinguish between an attorney who 

is subject to the Bar discipline, is subject to 

21  oversight and solicitation process, and treat that 

22  solicitation differently from a solicitation by a direct 

23  marketer, which is what (b)(12) is clearly aimed at, not 

24  the practice of law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The difficulty that

Official 

1  Justice Alito brings out is -- I see your 

2  interpretation, and I hope the other side will give me 

3  some line because they have the same problem -- you 

4  know, but in reverse. What is the line? 

But your way, it doesn't become that much of 

6  a privacy statute. It's sort of a misnomer. It's a --

7  it's a statute that is designed to prevent the 

8  commercial use of your -- of this personal information. 

9  It's not really a privacy statute. 

MR. CLEMENT: It's certainly not an 

11  all-purpose privacy statute. I do think that's fair. 

12  And the principal thing that they were concerned about, 

13  of course, is that you could look at somebody's license 

14  plate and indiscriminately go down, pay a fee, and get 

their home address. 

16  Now, the one thing we know from (b)(4) is, 

17  if a lawyer wants to do that exact thing, to serve 

18  process, the lawyer gets to do it. You can get 

19  somebody's license plate, go to the DMV, get an address, 

and serve process. And they specifically preserve that. 

21  So we know, as to the core of the statute, they treated 

22  lawyers differently. 

23  They were also concerned with direct 

24  marketers taking this information and using it to market 

people, but I don't think you'd lump lawyer solicitation

1  in anticipation of litigation, which may put some limit 

2  on it, together with that. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in anticipation of 

4  litigation does come after service of process, and an 

additional way to harmonize this statute with (12) is to 

6  say that, after the suit has been filed, then -- in 

7  anticipation of the litigation that that suit will 

8  engender, then you may get the information. But you 

9  didn't do that. 

MR. CLEMENT: There's two problems with that 

11  way of looking at the statute, I think I would 

12  respectfully suggest, Justice Kennedy. One is we are 

13  talking about items on an inclusive list, so even if you 

14  took your premise that -- that the anticipation of 

litigation in that list somehow is anticipation post 

16  service of process -- which I want to come back to --

17  even if you took that position, they are just things on 

18  an inclusive list. And so it wouldn't stop you from 

19  saying that the ultimate test here is whether it's in 

connection with litigation. 

21  But I guess I would go back to that and say 

22  I've never once thought that investigation in 

23  anticipation of litigation was something that would take 

24  place after service of process. I thought -- I mean --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way the

1  statute's written. 

2  MR. CLEMENT: Yeah, but I don't think that 

3  that was an intentional thing on the Court's part, that 

4  we're going to name these and we're going to name them 

in chronological order. If they tried to do it, I think 

6  they got it wrong. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, I'm not 

8  sure I'm satisfied with the answer you gave to 

9  Justice Scalia. He said, look, we've got to harmonize; 

instead of general-specific, solicitation of clients is 

11  different than investigation, and we just say they're 

12  mutually exclusive. It is a little bit of a general and 

13  specific. And that's proven by (b)(2) because, when 

14  (b)(2) wants to permit solicitation, it expressly says 

it, and they didn't expressly say, "solicitation," in 

16  (4). 

17  That's, I think, your adversary's main 

18  argument. And I'm -- I'm still not sure I'm comfortable 

19  with the answer you're giving. You're saying they're 

independent, but why are they necessarily conflicting? 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Last word "conflicting"? 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: "Conflicting," exactly, 

23  or -- or conflicting or overlapping. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: I think --

1  they necessarily overlapping? 

2  MR. CLEMENT: I think they are necessarily 

3  overlapping, and I guess I would point to several 

4  things. First of all, the language in (b)(2), I don't 

think helps them nearly as much as they do. I think 

6  that language in there about survey research, like much 

7  language in many statutes, maybe avoids the marketers --

8  or the -- the motor vehicle marketers from having to be 

9  here in a lawsuit because it removes all doubt about it. 

But I think they would be covered, even without those 

11  words. 

12  But the point is -- you may say, well, 

13  that's horrible, that's superfluous. But, no, if you 

14  look at the way the statute operates generally, there's 

lots of overlap. So this isn't a context where you want 

16  to make sure that there is no overlap and everyone 

17  operates independently. 

18  I pointed to (b)(1) and (b)(4). They both 

19  cover courts and litigation. If this Court uses DMV 

information in its opinion, it's covered by (b)(1), it's 

21  covered by (b)(4). 

22  Or look at (b)(3). (B)(3) is a provision 

23  that says, generally, companies can use DMV information 

24  to verify somebody's identity. And then it specifically 

says, and if somebody lies to you about their identity,

1  you can pursue legal remedies. 

2  Okay. When you're pursuing that legal 

3  remedy pursuant to (b)(3), you're also doing things in 

4  connection with litigation pursuant to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

6  well, that's right. I understand your point, that this 

7  is -- they're not separate categories, and there's no 

8  overlap. But the word is "harmonizing," and the problem 

9  is we have to give some limiting construction to "in 

connection with." 

11  And it seems to me that, if you are involved 

12  in that endeavor, it does make sense to see how what 

13  you're going to cover under the "in connection with" 

14  relates to what's exempt under the other provisions. 

MR. CLEMENT: But, as we've discussed, 

16  Mr. Chief Justice, if you -- if you are saying you are 

17  not going to apply the specific controls the general, 

18  but you may be using a junior varsity version of it to 

19  harmonize the statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: -- as -- as we suggested in 

22  our colloquy, I think the line between solicitation in 

23  anticipation of litigation and investigation in 

24  anticipation is far too thin a line to 

make a $200 million difference.

1  And if I could direct the Court to page 93 

2  of the Joint Appendix because that will show you just an 

3  example of the postcard that is attached to these 

4  letters. And the postcard does ask specifically, as 

Justice Ginsburg was suggesting -- again, this is at 93 

6  of the Joint Appendix -- it asks people to fill out 

7  their name, address, the dealership they bought the car 

8  from, the type of car, and then the administrative fee 

9  or processing fee that was charged. 

Now, I think it's common ground between the 

11  parties that we get to ask about that administrative or 

12  processing fee because that is investigation in 

13  anticipation of the -- of the litigation. As I 

14  understand where my clients arguably made a $200 million 

mistake is by adding the line "I'm interested" -- "I am 

16  interested in participating" signature, that crosses the 

17  line into solicitation. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the reason -- the 

19  reason that would be so -- I agree with you, that it's 

very hard to figure out what the line is here between 

21  the investigation and solicitation. 

22  But that's where the solicitation thing 

23  comes into play because what it -- the words that go the 

24  other way, in my mind, that cut against you, is that 

this card could have asked for Social Security numbers,

law. All right. But then, under another State, under 

6  this statute, they could. Now, that's helpful, that 

7  answer. 

8  But if -- when I think of asking for Social 

9  Security numbers, I -- the words -- exaggerated, but 

they go through my mind -- are "identity theft run 

11  wild." 

12  MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: And, if that is a 

14  concern -- if that is a concern, then, by reading this 

as a solicitation -- you know, the pure case -- and 

16  throwing the other exception to cover it, you force the 

17  State to focus on it. 

18  And the State then has to decide whether 

19  they are going to permit or not permit the solicitor, 

who -- you see, might -- might include the lawyer here, 

21  to ask for the Social Security number, and better to 

22  have them focus on that decision. That's the connection 

23  that I see between the two.

putting the Social Security numbers on the forms and we 

6  are --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So are we -- do we 

8  know -- by the way, that is helpful because do we know 

9  under how many States' law the DMV would be forbidden to 

give Social Security numbers? 

11  MR. CLEMENT: I don't know that offhand. I 

12  can get that to you in a supplemental letter. I just 

13  know South Carolina, it says, right in their FOIA 

14  statute, you can't get that information. And, like I 

said, the only situation -- it's kind of --

17  to that effect?

information is if they were bringing an ADA suit. If 

6  they were bringing an ADA suit against a dealer, you 

7  might actually want them --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if they are --

9  if they were thinking they might bring an ADA suit --

MR. CLEMENT: Fair point --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position does 

12  create a special -- the point your friend makes -- it 

13  does create a special exemption from a solicitation bar 

14  for lawyers. Lawyers can solicitate -- you know, Acme 

Products can't. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Well, sure, but they can --

17  they can solicit for their legal services in connection 

18  with litigation. And that, I think, is different --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In connection with 

something they hope might someday become litigation, 

21  depending upon the answers they get. 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, if you're going 

23  to draw a line -- there's two things here -- you know,

with State law, to get access to the fact that you've 

21  bought one of these cars; do you want to join the suit?

solicitation, but I don't think, if you look at these 

6  provisions, that you would interpret them that way when 

7  they're all permissive uses. And --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if Congress wanted to 

9  draw the line between possible -- you know, some unknown 

lawsuit and an actual lawsuit that's in the mind of the 

11  lawyer, why did it use the term "litigation," when it 

12  had already used earlier, in the same subsection, 

13  "proceeding," civil, criminal, administrative, or 

14  arbitral proceeding? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, I think 

16  when it uses "in anticipation of litigation," it 

17  actually wants to cover activity that takes place before 

18  there's an actual proceeding. And what I was going to 

19  say is -- you know, that language doesn't come out of 

the ether. I mean, that's the language you use in 

21  attorney work product. 

22  And, as I understand it -- I've looked into 

23  this a little bit, the basic rule there is you 

24  distinguish between litigation in the abstract and the 

point at which you've identified a particular

1  transaction, occurrence, defect. And, at that point, if

4  The one other point I haven't yet made, 

which is, to the extent you're going to resort to the 

6  specific controls of the general, I think it is worth 

7  noting that this would be the first time, that I'm aware 

8  of, that the Court would ever have applied that canon to 

9  impose this kind of massive civil liability and even 

potentially criminal liability.

12  specific and which is general. I mean, that's the 

13  problem I have with that. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: I agree, and I think that's 

the best reason why the canon doesn't work. These are 

16  equally specific. And, in the case of an overlap

4  MR. CLEMENT: Yeah. And the reason I think 

that --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a conflict, we 

7  don't have to -- you know, it's not inconsistent, it's 

8  just this is an expression of what Congress was thinking 

9  about, we're going to use it as a clue. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. But the line-drawing 

11  problem is really drawing the line about "in connection 

12  with." The line-drawing problem -- drawing the line 

13  between solicitation in anticipation of litigation and 

14  investigation in -- in anticipation of litigation just 

doesn't work. They're two sides of the same coin. 

16  As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, if my 

17  clients had sent a letter that nobody objects to, that 

18  says, we're bringing a lawsuit, we think you may have 

19  been charged the same kind of fee, I think what the 

State Bar would have said -- the natural next question 

21  for anybody getting that letter is, will you represent 

22  me? And precisely because of that, we want you -- we 

23  want to treat this like it's solicitation, and we want 

24  to add these additional bells and whistles. 

And part of the irony here is, I think, the

1  things that make our letter look most like it's 

2  advertisement or solicitation are the things that are 

3  required by the State Bar. 

4  And, keep in mind, that's another reason why 

treating attorney solicitation differently from general 

6  solicitation makes perfect sense because they're subject 

7  to --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what 

9  you're saying. You're saying the State Bar requirements 

would have required you to say, are you interested in 

11  joining the lawsuit? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: Well, and -- they would --

13  it's so natural that somebody will say, can I join your 

14  lawsuit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: -- that they would require all 

17  the language that says, you have alternatives, other 

18  people can -- can -- can hire you. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because --

that's because the State is allowing solicitation, and 

21  it puts certain conditions on what your solicitation --

22  MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You point to page 94, you 

24  say, oh, it's just the last line, the whole thrust of 

the letter was solicitation. You have to be fair about

1  that. 

2  MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have to be fair about 

4  that. 

MR. CLEMENT: And, Justice Scalia, the last 

6  thing you can infer from the statute is that Congress 

7  wanted, for the first time ever, get in the business of 

8  managing attorney solicitation, a subject they'd always 

9  left to the States. And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I just want to, 

11  before you leave, because -- in response to 

12  Justice Kagan, I think you've changed positions a little 

13  bit. You started by saying there were three ways to 

14  draw a line. Getting clients is okay; getting clients 

is okay if you get a specific treatment, occurrence, or 

16  defect. And you didn't mention what the third was. 

17  So what's your preferred reading? 

18  MR. CLEMENT: My -- my preferred reading is 

19  that transaction, occurrence, defect -- which I took her 

red light camera to be an example of a particular 

21  identified defect. But I do want to emphasize, before I 

22  sit down -- it's the last thing I'll emphasize, that my 

23  case is a little bit better because we had a client and 

24  a specific defect before anything happened.

2  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

4  MR. GUERRA: Thank you. 

First of all, I'd just like to point out 

6  that the consequence of Respondent's argument is that --

7  is they gave the example of going to get the license 

8  plate and then getting the name and address to serve 

9  process. 

But, on their theory, you can also go down 

11  and -- you can witness an accident on the side of the 

12  road, you can go down to DMV, get the name and 

13  license -- use the license plate to get the name and 

14  address and send a solicitation letter. And that is 

trolling. 

16  And I think everybody -- as I understand it, 

17  the line seems to be everybody wants it somewhere south 

18  of trolling. And yet --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why don't you give us 

the line that's north? 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  MR. GUERRA: My line -- my line --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: North of trolling? 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: No, not north of trolling, 

but you understand the point. What's your line?

1  MR. GUERRA: Our line is solicitation, 

2  Justice Breyer, and there are two ways to get that. 

3  There is the -- we -- I submit, is the strong textual 

4  evidence in (b)(2), that Congress did, in fact, 

understand that the consent requirement governs all bulk 

6  solicitation or surveys or marketing, and it had to give 

7  an explicit override in (b)(2) because, otherwise, 

8  (b)(12) would have restricted the ability to do 

9  nonconsent --

JUSTICE BREYER: In the middle of the -- in 

11  the middle of the class action, several of the clients, 

12  the only ones who brought -- who bought the cars --

13  which there is loads of evidence they're defective, from 

14  Dealer Smith, died, and they want to see if they can 

find three others, so they don't have to dismiss them 

16  from the class, they're almost certain -- and has loads 

17  of evidence there is the -- you know, the harm caused by 

18  the defendant. They are missing a client. They died. 

19  And so can they get it then? 

MR. GUERRA: I'm not sure I understand the 

21  question. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Can they go to the board 

23  and say, look, Dealer Smith here -- we're in the middle 

24  of the case, we're finished with discovery. We're 

just -- he just died and --

1  MR. GUERRA: Are you talking about --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: -- we want to find three 

3  others, and I'm sure there's loads of evidence here that 

4  there were a hundred thousand others, who bought this 

defective thing from this defendant, we want to find out 

6  the names and addresses. Can they get it or not? 

7  MR. GUERRA: For purposes of soliciting new 

8  class representatives, I think not. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Not. 

MR. GUERRA: And I think -- and there are 

11  loads of ways to find class representatives without 

12  going to DMVs. And, in fact, that's what most class 

13  action lawyers have to do, is advertise in one fashion 

14  or another. So that's not, to my mind, in Congress's 

conclusion. 

16  But I would just point out that, according 

17  to Respondents, the phrase "survey research" is 

18  surplusage, and this Court says that's -- you're not 

19  supposed to reach that conclusion, if you can avoid it, 

and you can avoid it by understanding it to be the 

21  meaning -- the meaning -- its effect is to override the 

22  consent requirement, so that -- that you can do 

23  commercial bulk surveys in (b)(2), which would otherwise 

24  require consent as a -- as a consequence of (b)(12). 

And then there is the so-called "junior

1  varsity" harmonization basis for reaching solicitation. 

2  And I would point out that Respondents are saying, it 

3  can't be that you -- that some -- certain statements in 

4  a letter means you crossed the line into solicitation 

and that that has all kinds of massive civil liability 

6  consequences. 

7  Congress used the word "solicitation" in 

8  this statute. Congress meant to draw some kind of line 

9  around solicitation. Now, admittedly, we're saying that 

the harmonization means that that's the same line you 

11  would draw in (b)(4). But it's not inconceivable to 

12  think that Congress was -- was drawing a line at 

13  solicitation and that liability would flow, depending 

14  upon whether somebody crossed it or not. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Guerra, it didn't 

16  draw the line at solicitation in (b)(4), and the 

17  advantage of Mr. Clement's argument is that the line 

18  that he sets up actually has a textual basis in (b)(4) 

19  because it focuses on words like "what is a litigation," 

and "what is a proceeding," and "are we there yet." And 

21  that seems to be what the language of (b)(4) indicates. 

22  MR. GUERRA: Your Honor, our point is --

23  sort of, if you step back, and you -- and this is the 

24  question for the harmonization purpose: (b)(4) covers 

solicitation only because of the indeterminacy of the

1  phrase "in connection with." Without that language, 

2  there's no basis for saying (b)(4) is authorizing 

3  lawyers' solicitations. So it is, I would submit, at 

4  the periphery of the authorization that (b)(4) provides. 

(B)(12) solicitation is at the core of what 

6  that provision is about and that -- the -- the mass 

7  marketing of using DMV information is one of the 

8  fundamental problems Congress was addressing. 

9  And I just think it's implausible to 

conclude that the -- at the periphery concept in 

11  (b)(4) should take precedence over the core function of 

12  (b)(12).
