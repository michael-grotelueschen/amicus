 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community 

Schools versus Seattle School District Number 1.

 Mr. Korrell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J.F. KORRELL 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. KORRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 In an effort to achieve its desired racial 

balance in its popular high schools, the Seattle school 

district denied over 300 children, both white and 

minority children, admission to their chosen schools 

solely because of their race and without any 

individualized consideration. This strikes at the heart 

of the Equal Protection Clause which commands that 

Government treat people as individuals, not simply as 

members of a racial class.

 This fundamental equal protection principle 

was reiterated in Grutter and in Gratz. The central 

question in this case is not, as the school district and 

many of its allies suggest, whether integration is 

important or whether desegregation is compelling. The 

central question in this case is whether outside of the

remedial context, diversity defined as the school 

district does, as a white/non-white racial balance, can 

be a compelling interest that justifies the use of race 

discrimination in high school admissions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Korrell --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you disagree in general 

with the Solicitor General's brief? Do you agree in 

general with the brief submitted by the Government or do 

you have differences with it in its approach?

 MR. KORRELL: Justice Kennedy, we -- we 

agree mostly with the Solicitor General's brief. I 

believe the Solicitor General might take a different 

position on whether race neutral mechanisms can be used 

to accomplish race specific purposes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I can --

MR. KORRELL: But that's not an issue the 

court needs to reach in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it, it is a point 

that I, I'd like both him and you to discuss at some 

point during your argument. If -- can you use race for 

site selection? When you have, you need to build a new 

school. There are three sites. One of them would be 

all one race. Site two would be all the other race. 

Site three would be a diversity of races. Can the 

school board with, with the intent to have diversity

pick site number 3?

 MR. KORRELL: Justice Kennedy, I think the 

answer turns on the reason that the schools have the 

racial compositions that they do.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- there's -- well, we 

can have all kinds of different hypotheticals, but 

there's residential housing segregation, and it wants, 

it wants, the board wants to have diversity.

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, our position is 

that if, if the resulting -- if the racial composition 

of those schools is not the result of past de jure 

segregation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It is a new school. 

It's a new school.

 MR. KORRELL: In that case, Your Honor, 

Parents' position is that the Government can't be in the 

position of deciding what right racial mix is.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it'd have to take the 

three sites, all of them in the hypothetical, all of 

them equal, and just flip a coin, because otherwise it 

would be using a --

MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, obviously it is 

not the facts of the Seattle case. In the hypothetical 

Your Honor posits, perhaps the right analogy is 

something similar to the, a redistricting cases. Where

a court could look at see whether the racial motive was 

a predominant factor as opposed to -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, no. The school board says we want, right up front, 

we want racial diversity in our new schools. Illicit 

under the Fourteenth Amendment in your case?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, school districts 

can do many, many things through race neutral means that 

they could not do with race discrimination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But can they have a race 

conscious objective? I think that that's the question 

that Justice Kennedy is asking you, and I don't get a 

clear answer. You say you can't use a racial means. 

But can you have a racial objective? That is, you want 

to achieve balance in the schools.

 MR. KORRELL: Justice Ginsburg, our position 

is that that is prohibited by the Constitution 

absent past discrimination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would object, then, to 

magnet schools? You would object to any system that is 

designed to try to cause people voluntarily to go into a 

system that is more racially mixed?

 MR. KORRELL: Justice Scalia, our objection 

to the Seattle program is that it is not a race neutral 

means.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand. But I'm

trying to find what, you know, the outer limits of your 

contentions are. It doesn't seem to me that your briefs 

indicated that you would object to something like magnet 

schools. The -- even if one of the purposes of those 

schools is to try to cause more white students to go to 

schools that are predominantly non-white. It's just 

voluntary, I mean, but the object is to achieve a 

greater racial mix.

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, we object to 

the -- if that's the sole goal of a school district 

absent past discrimination, we object. But that kind of 

hypothetical situation isn't even necessary for the 

Court to reach.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it may not be 

necessary for you but it might be necessary for us when 

we write the case. We're not writing just on a very 

fact-specific issue. Of course, the follow-up question, 

and the Solicitor General can address it too, is this: 

Assuming some race-conscious measures are permissible to 

have diversity, isn't it odd to say you can't use race 

as a means? I mean, that's the next question. That 

may, in fact, be why you give the -- seem to give the 

answer that you do. You just don't want to embrace that 

contradiction.

MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, it is certainly 

difficult if race -- if racial balance can be a goal of 

government, then it is more difficult to defend a racial 

balancing plan as unconstitutional, or to attack one as 

constitutional.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is true.

 MR. KORRELL: And this Court has said 

repeatedly that racial balancing is unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we have said it 

repeatedly in contexts different from this. I mean, the 

paradigm context in which we made remarks to that 

effect, stated that, are affirmative action cases. The 

point of the affirmative action case is that some 

criterion which otherwise would be the appropriate 

criterion of selection is being displaced by a racial 

mix criterion. That is not what is happening here. 

This is not an affirmative action case.

 So why should the statements that have been 

made in these entirely different contexts necessarily 

decide this case?

 MR. KORRELL: Justice Souter, we disagree 

that the analysis in the Grutter and Gratz cases is 

entirely different from the analysis in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But don't you agree that 

those cases left someone out of the picture entirely

because we were talking about a selection of one person 

or another? The word "sorting" has been used in this 

context because everybody gets to go to school. Indeed, 

they are required to go to school. So no one gets left 

out of the system, and I think there have been Court of 

Appeals judges who have noted. We have never had that 

case before, not like the affirmative action cases.

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I agree that this 

Court has not had a case like this before. I disagree, 

however, that it's not like the Grutter or Gratz 

decision. The plaintiff in Gratz, as the Court is 

aware, attended the University of Michigan at Dearborn. 

He got into a school. He didn't get into the school 

that he wanted to go to. Similarly, in our case, with 

the plaintiffs, they wanted to go to their preferred 

schools, schools that the school district acknowledges 

provided different educational opportunities, produced 

different educational outcomes, and they were preferable 

to the parents and children who wanted to go.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you agree that this 

is not an affirmative action case? Is it not? Wherein 

does it differ? I thought that the school district was 

selecting some people because they wanted a certain 

racial mix in the schools, and were taking the 

affirmative action of giving a preference to students of

a certain race.  Why isn't -- why doesn't that qualify 

as affirmative action?

 MR. KORRELL: If that's what affirmative 

action is, Your Honor, then --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know what 

else it is. What do you think it is that causes you to 

seemingly accept the characterization that this is not 

it?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, perhaps I 

misspoke. I didn't mean to accept the characterization 

that this case is not at all --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me help you out by 

taking you back to my question. One of the 

characteristics of the affirmative action cases was the 

displacement of some other otherwise generally 

acknowledged relevant criterion such as ability as shown 

in test scores, grade point averages, things like that; 

and that was a characteristic of those cases.

 It is not a characteristic of this case, as 

I understand it.

 MR. KORRELL: I'm not sure that's exactly 

right, Your Honor. In this case, the school district 

admitted in the response to request for admissions that 

had the identified children been of a different race, 

they would have been admitted into the schools.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a 

criterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever 

school you want. You are allowed to go to a certain 

choice of school. The criterion was your choice.

 MR. KORRELL: Justice Scalia, you're right. 

And there's another criterion which I think is getting 

to Justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when you state 

Justice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as 

your brief assumed, that the definition of the benefit 

to be received here is the active choice, not the 

provision of an education.

 Now the active choice may be of value. I do 

not suggest that it is not. Clearly the school district 

thinks it does or it wouldn't provide choice. But it is 

not the entire benefit that is being provided, and the 

principal benefit is the education, not the choice of 

schools. Isn't that correct?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, they are both 

benefits. I would point Your Honor back to this Court's 

decision in Gratz, where the same analysis would apply. 

And if Your Honor's analysis is correct, that would 

mean, I think, that the Gratz case would have been 

decided differently.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I think that the point

that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand 

it, is of course there are similarities to Gratz, they 

can choose, but there's a big difference. The 

similarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and 

Gratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed 

to be better than others, that the members of that 

school, the faculty and the administration tried to make 

it better than others. It was an elite merit selection 

academy. And if you put the black person in, the white 

person can't get the benefit of that.

 Here we have no merit selection system. 

Merit is not an issue. The object of the people who run 

this place is not to create a school better than others, 

it is to equalize the schools. That's in principle and 

in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that 

the six schools that were at the top, their position 

would shift radically from year to year, preferences was 

about equal among them. They have the same curriculum, 

they have similar faculties, and I don't think anyone 

can say either in theory or in practice, that one of 

these schools happened to be like that prize of 

University of Michigan, a merit selection system. That, 

I think, was a major difference that he was getting at, 

why is this not the same kind of thing? That was at 

issue in Grutter and Gratz. Now what is your response

to that?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, we have several 

responses. The first is that the premise of Your 

Honor's question is that the schools are in essence 

fungible for purposes of providing a high school 

education. And I would direct Your Honor to the 

District Court judge's decision, a footnote in the 

decision in which she acknowledged that the schools were 

not of equal quality, that they provided different 

levels of education.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course they're not. 

That's why some of them were oversubscribed. That's why 

others were undersubscribed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say that they 

were. What I said was that the object of the school 

board and the administering authority was to make them 

roughly equal. I said that in terms of curriculum and 

faculty, they're about roughly equal. And in terms of 

choice, what you see is a wide variation in choice by 

those who want to go as to which is their preference 

among six schools over a period of five years.

 And that suggests a rough effort to create 

the equality, not an effort as in Michigan, to run a 

merit selection system.

 MR. KORRELL: I agree with Your Honor that

there's not a merit selection system in --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now the question is, 

why doesn't that fact that this is not a merit selection 

system put a different kind of thing, a sorting system 

or a system designed to maintain a degree of 

integration, why doesn't that difference make a 

difference?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I think that the 

fundamental command of the Equal Protection Clause is 

that government treats as individuals, not as members of 

a racial group. And that command I don't think is 

suspended because of the nature of a school's admissions 

process. That right is still possessed by the 

individual students, and if a student is entitled to be 

treated as an individual as opposed to a member of a 

racial group at a university level, it's Parents' 

position they are entitled to that same protection at 

the high school level.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Korrell, before your 

time runs out, I did want to clarify something about the 

standing of the plaintiffs here.

 Do I understand correctly that none of the 

parents who originally brought this lawsuit have 

children who are now pre-ninth grade, but that 

newcomers, people who recently joined, do have children

of pre-ninth grade age?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, that is mostly 

correct. There is also a family that joined the parents 

association back in 2000 that has a child in seventh 

grade, that will be approaching high school by the time 

this Court decides the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the lawsuit was 

originally brought by a corporate entity, correct?

 MR. KORRELL: That's correct, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not by individual 

parents.

 MR. KORRELL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't dispute 

that membership, for standing purposes, the membership 

is what counts, not the association but the members?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, my understanding 

of the Court's jurisprudence on associational standing 

is as long as a member of the association has standing, 

then the association has it. We submit that that has 

been established by the complaint, the interrogatory 

responses, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it is a member, 

jurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what 

the membership was when the complaint was filed and not 

what it has become in the course of the litigation?

MR. KORRELL: I don't think that's right, 

Your Honor. We cited to the Court the Pannell case, the 

Associated General Contractors case, and Roe versus 

Wade, all of which look at post-filing factors to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the transaction 

case situation is different.

 MR. KORRELL: You're right, Your Honor, none 

of those were class action cases. Pannell and 

Associated General Contractors were association cases 

much like this one. Roe, of course, was individual 

plaintiffs.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I have a question. Does 

the record tell us, the 300 people who have failed to 

get into the schools they wanted, the racial composition 

of that group?

 MR. KORRELL: It does, Justice Stevens. The 

record shows that 100, roughly 100 students who were 

denied admission to their preferred schools were 

non-white and roughly 200 who were denied admission were 

white students.

 If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I will reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Respondents assert an interest in addressing 

the most racially isolated schools in the district, yet 

their plan does not address the two most racially 

concentrated high schools in their district. They 

likewise have certain interests in diversity, yet their 

plan does not directly address diversity other than pure 

racial diversity, and they do nothing to assemble the 

kind of critical mass that was at issue in the Grutter 

case.

 In fact, if you look at the program and how 

it operates in practice, the triggering critical mass 

for the use of the racial tie breaker is when a 

student -- when a school has less than 25 percent white 

students or when it has less than 45 percent non-white 

students. There is nothing in the record or in social 

science that suggests that there's a radical difference 

in the critical mass based on the race of the students.

 Of course what explains that difference in 

the triggering critical mass of white students versus 

non-white students, the answer to that does not lie in 

educational theory, the answer lies in the demographics

of the district. The district happens to have 25 

percent more non-white students than white students, so 

they trigger the race tie breaker at a different point 

under those circumstances.

 With all respect to respondents, the answer 

to how this program works lies not in diversity but in 

demographics. They are clearly working backwards from 

the overall demographics of the school district rather 

than working forward to any clearly articulated 

pedagogical role.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could 

get back to Justice Kennedy's question earlier, how do 

you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools, 

clustering, from the consideration of race in this case?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think that those decisions are different primarily 

because the resulting decision is not a racial 

classification. And if you think about it, when you had 

an overt racial classification, like you clearly do in 

these cases, then you naturally ask the strict scrutiny 

questions and look for a compelling interest. If 

instead you start with a race-neutral government action 

that doesn't classify people directly based on race, 

then I suppose you could try to do some kind of 

Arlington Heights-Washington Davis type analysis.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what would you do 

with strategic site selection in order to create racial 

diversity?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's expressed 

and principal purpose. You know the hypothetical.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Okay. And Justice 

Kennedy, I will answer the hypo, but let me say it's 

easy for purposes of the hypo to say the sole reason was 

for race. In the real world, in fact I can't imagine 

that a site decision won't be based at least in part on 

concerns about the overall educational benefits. And I 

think that's important. The reason I start with that 

preface is because when you have mixed motives and a 

variety of factors I think you'd be unlikely to strike 

down that kind of motive.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you suggesting there 

was no consideration of overall educational benefits in 

this plan?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Stevens. I'm 

saying you start at a different departure point when you 

have an express racial classification. I think I'm 

trying to answer Justice Kennedy's question about what 

if you have a sort of a race-conscious goal at some

level and that's why you select a particular site or you 

decide that you're going to invest in magnet schools and 

want to put a magnet school in a particular school 

district. My humble point is simply that in the real 

world I think you're unlikely to have the pure racial 

motive type objective. I would say that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it was faculty, 

and the school district makes a deliberate effort to 

have members of the white race and members of other 

races represented in -- on the faculty of every school, 

so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so 

that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit. 

That's their objective and they're using a racial 

criterion criterion to get there.

 Would that be impermissible, to have a mix 

of teachers in all the schools?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of 

teachers that might be okay. If they're going to start 

assigning teachers to particular schools and have sort 

of racial quotas for the faculty at various schools, I 

think that crosses a line.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would be okay? 

How would you get there other than having -- the point 

I'm trying to make has been made by others. Let me read

from Judge Boudin's decision. He says: "The choice is 

between openly using race as a criterion or concealing 

it through some clumsy or proxy device."

 If you want to have an integrated school and 

you site the schools deliberately to achieve that 

objective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have 

a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, 

Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a fundamental 

difference between how the same intent with two 

programs, there's a fundamental difference if one of 

them necessarily classifies people on the basis of their 

skin color and the other does not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: General Clement, is there 

anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of 

the races and establishing policies which achieve that 

result but which do not single out individuals and 

disqualify them for certain things because of their 

race? Is there anything wrong with a policy of wanting 

to have racial mix?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, we would 

take the position that there's not and that there's a 

fundamental difference between whether or not the policy 

manages to avoid classifying people on the basis of 

their race.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: At page 7 of your brief 

you say: "School districts have an unquestioned 

interest in reducing minority isolation." If I put a 

period in there, then I would get to my strategic site 

selection, and I still haven't got your answer on that. 

You don't put a period there. You say: ". .have an 

unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation 

through race-neutral means." And this brings up this 

same question Justice Ginsburg had. Isn't it odd 

jurisprudence where we have an objective that we state 

in one set of terms but a means for achieving it in 

another set of terms, unless your answer is that 

individual classification by race is, is impermissible, 

but other, more broad measures based on, with a racial 

purpose are all right?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's ultimately 

the answer, Justice Kennedy, which is there's a 

fundamental difference between classifying people and 

having the real world effect. I mean, in this case 

don't forget that there were 89 minority students that 

wanted to attend Franklin High School. They could not 

solely because of their race. At the same time, every 

white student who applied to Franklin High School was 

allowed in solely base would on their race.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is the answer to

my strategic site selection hypothetical?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: We would say that's fine. 

We would say that that is permissible, for the school to 

pursue that.

 Just to get back, though, again, we say that 

that avoiding racial isolation is -- I just want to make 

the point, we say that racial isolation is an important 

government interest. I think if you put this plan up 

against that objective, it solely fails, because there 

are two high schools that I think you would look at as 

being racially isolated. They're Cleveland n Rainier 

Beach, and this plan does nothing to directly address 

those high schools.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is really Judge 

Boudin's question. You are in effect saying that by 

siting the school they can achieve exactly the objective 

they are seeking here. It's a question of do the -- the 

question comes down to whether they can do it candidly 

or do it by clumsier. That is, it seems to me, an 

unacceptable basis to draw a constitutional line.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, 

Justice Souter, first of all I think the kind of 

interests we're talking about, avoiding racial isolation 

and the like, do not lend themselves to absolutely 

targeted, it has to be 15 percent, it has to be 50, it

has to be 25, it has to be 45. I would actually suggest 

that the danger is in the opposite direction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That isn't what they said 

here. I mean, they were dealing with a zone within 

which they operated, and it was only when the numbers 

got to the outer limits that they said, okay, we're 

going to use a racial criterion to prevent anything 

more, any more extreme disparity.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, in the 

second stage --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what they do when 

they site the school. They said, you know, we'll get a 

rough whatever it is, 40-60 mix.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think in the 

second case you'll see that, you know, the same logic 

that leads to this leads itself to stricter bands. But 

let me say, I would have thought the analysis would run 

the exact opposite way, and I would think that if you 

got to the point, which the Ninth Circuit did on page 

58-A of its opinion, where it says, you know, with this 

objective that we've allowed, the most narrowly tailored 

way to get there is to expressly use race. I would have 

thought that might have suggested there was something 

wrong with the compelling interest, if that's the way --

the way, let me ask a practical question. 35 years ago 

in Swann, this Court said that a school board, 

particularly an elected one -- it didn't say that 

-- "could well conclude that to prepare students to live 

in a pluralistic society each school should have a 

prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting 

the proportion of the district as a whole." Far more 

radical than anything that's at issue here.

 Then it adds: "To do this as an educational 

policy is within the broad discretionary powers of 

school authorities." That's what this Court said 35 

years ago. Thousands of school districts across the 

country, we're told, have relied on that statement in an 

opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration. 

You can answer this in the next case if you want. So 

think about it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer in 

this case, General.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: My question, of course, is 

simply this. When you have thousands of school 

districts relying on this to get a degree of integration 

in the United States of America, what are you telling 

this Court is going to happen when we start suddenly 

making -- departing from the case? Do you want us to

overrule it? Why? Why practically?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: If I could answer the 

question, I think that the fact that you point to the 

specific language of Swann is helpful, because the Court 

there in dictum -- I think everybody would agrees that 

was dictum -- said that you could achieve a prescribed 

ratio. And that's exactly where the logic of the other 

side, of the Ninth Circuit, of Judge Boudin, with all 

respect, that's where it takes you.

 And I think anybody that relied on that 

language in the wake of cases like Crosson, in the wake 

of Freeman against Pitts, that said achieving a racial 

balance for its own sake is not constitutional, and 

Bakke and Grutter against Gratz, that all said that 

racial balancing is verboten, I think those school 

districts would have been misguided in relying on that 

language. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

struck down a State law that prevented bussing for 

integration purposes because that law prevented the 

school board from seeking to provide the educational 

benefits of integrated schools. At that time you said 

it was clear enough that all children benefit from 

exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom 

by preparing them for citizenship in our pluralistic 

society and teaching them to live in harmony and mutual 

respect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Madden, that's 

certainly an admirable goal. Could a local unit, a 

municipality, or even a State have another goal? Let's 

say what used to be great about the United States was 

the presence of various ethnic groups. I mean, there 

were the Pennsylvania Dutch, there were the Amish, there 

were Little Italy's, there were Chinatowns, and these 

things are beginning to disappear. And we think that we 

should encourage the continuation of that diversity, as 

the Federal Government has done with respect to American 

Indian tribes.

 And therefore, we're going to use public 

funds for such things as street festivals, a Chinatown 

street festival, an Italian street festival. We're 

going to encourage those organizations that maintain 

that separateness.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: About the objective? I 

mean, think we should foster separateness? Is there 

anything wrong --

MR. MADDEN: I think that in the context 

that you've described it that would be constitutionally 

very problematic.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fine -- it would be 

problematic?

 MR. MADDEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

 MR. MADDEN: Because I can conceive that 

it's not -- unlike education, where the goal is to 

educate the entire community and to help to prepare the 

community, the students to live in that community, it's 

not a traditional role of government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, let me change 

Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Please let me finish the 

line of questioning.

 Assume with me that it is not an 

unconstitutional objective, which I am sure it's not.

Could the -- could the government achieve that objective 

by barring people from moving into Little Italy or 

giving a preference to some people to buy real estate in 

Little Italy if they are of Italian ancestry? Could it 

do that? Absolutely not, right?

 MR. MADDEN: I would agree with you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it would appear that 

even if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by 

any means whatever. And the mere fact that the 

objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is 

perfectly all right, although certainly not the only 

objective in the world. The mere fact that it's okay 

doesn't mean you can achieve it by any means whatever?

 MR. MADDEN: I would submit that there's a 

fundamental difference between the circumstances you've 

described and a school system which takes all comers and 

is tasked to educate them by preparing them to live in a 

pluralistic society.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my slight 

modification of Justice Scalia's hypothetical -- and it 

proceeds on the same theory -- is suppose there's a huge 

demand for housing. A developer has a plan to build 500 

units. Can the city say, we'll grant you the permit on 

the ground, on the condition that 30 percent of all the 

houses go to minorities? That means people will live

together. Then we can have a school, a school that can 

be diverse.

 MR. MADDEN: I would say not, because 

housing decisions are inherently private, unlike public 

education. And there's no way to know how those 

benefits are being distributed, if they're going to be 

comparable. I would say no, it is not comparable to the 

schools.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your system is the 

one that gives a choice to the individuals.

 MR. MADDEN: It does, and when there are 

more choices than there are seats available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that make a 

difference? What if you adopted a plan that insisted on 

a more or less rigid 60-40 ratio at every school and 

assignments were made on that basis. It was not a 

follow-on to a choice system.

 MR. MADDEN: Well, I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that be 

unconstitutional?

 MR. MADDEN: Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I'm sorry to interrupt.

 I think in each circumstance it depends on 

the status of the school system.

facts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that 

private choice contributes to further division rather 

than integration and so the assignments are made on a 

60-40 basis.

 MR. MADDEN: I think that is roughly the 

circumstance that existed in the first Seattle case, 

Mr. Chief Justice. And additionally, I think that you 

then have to move into the realm of what's 

constitutionally permissible and can in a 

constitutionally permissible use of race a school system 

accommodate other values like choice and neighborhood 

ties and family connections to the school system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still don't have 

your answer.

 Is strict assignment 60-40 without regard to 

choice constitutional or not?

 MR. MADDEN: I -- I would want to know more 

about the system because I think strictly if there's 

nothing else and there's no flexibility, I think it 

presents narrow tailoring problems.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how does this 

not present narrow tailoring problems if -- if the --

when you get to the fact of choice, the sole criteria at 

that level is the same as would be the case in a 60-40 

assignment.

MR. MADDEN: Well, we have accommodated 

choice to the extent there are seats available. And 

then we go to family connections. And then we -- in 

operation, admit everyone who lives close to the school. 

And then as to those that live further away, we look to 

see what's the school's racial demographic. Is it 

significantly different than the community's? These 

schools we have talked about have been the objects of 

significantly more aggressive segregation efforts, and 

the board wanted to preserve those.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the, one of 

the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the 

plan has a logical end point. What is the logical end 

point in this plan?

 MR. MADDEN: Well, the board actually at 

every turn reflected in the record discussed whether it 

was necessary to continue the use of race, whether to 

narrow it, and eventually to end it. And I think it is 

in the joint appendix at 408, the superintendent's 

testimony of the, simultaneously the measures that the 

board was implementing in terms of resource allocation, 

implementation of new programs, because they realized 

that by diversifying choice, they could hopefully 

achieve some of these same ends, not as quickly, not as 

efficiently, but that they could achieve them. That's

been indeed the entire trajectory of Seattle's 

integration efforts since the first Seattle plan.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in Grutter we said, to 

shorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the 

U.S. Reports, 539, "the law school's interest is not 

simply to assure within its student body some specified 

percentage of a particular group because of race ... 

that would amount to outright racial balancing which is 

patently unconstitutional." And that seems to be what 

you have here.

 MR. MADDEN: I think that the term racial 

balancing has two significant meanings. One is a plan 

that does not foster a compelling interest. And second, 

a plan that is too rigid, a quota, for instance, that 

might not pass narrow tailoring given the context.

 In this case we're not after a rigid set of 

numbers, and certainly not after a rigid set of numbers 

for their own sake. The purpose was to have schools 

that had become diverse through integration efforts not 

stray too far from the community's demographic because 

we're trying to prepare students to live in those 

communities.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is that unlike 

strategic siting, magnet schools, special resources, 

special programs in some schools, you're characterizing

each student by reason of the color of his or her skin.

 That is quite a different means. And it 

seems to me that that should only be, if ever allowed, 

allowed as a last resort.

 MR. MADDEN: The board here was trying to 

distribute, sort out seats that were available at these 

popular schools; and so it devised a system whereby 

every student had the opportunity to be assigned to at 

least one of those popular schools; and as far as the 

record shows in plaintiffs' briefing, there's no 

material differences between those -- those popular 

schools.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have quotas for, for 

racial hiring of your faculty in these schools?

 MR. MADDEN: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?

 MR. MADDEN: I don't think the board has 

ever found that necessary to, to achieve diversity in 

the faculty.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Justice Kennedy's question, 

I think, was is this basically a kind of last report? 

Or how close to a has resort is it? What's the history 

of this? I thought the history involved a lawsuit to 

desegregate the schools, a much more rigid system of 

racial -- abuse of race. Ultimately you come to this.

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the history 

basically? Am I right?

 MR. MADDEN: The history is that the board 

had both narrowed the use of the integration tie breaker 

in '99 and 2000 and then continued it for the 2001 

school year. We were -- in 2000-2001 school year, we 

were enjoined in 2001 to use it in that year, which was 

considerably disruptive. But the board was also, the 

measures that it had implemented, implementing magnet 

schools at Rainier Beach and Chief South high schools in 

the South End, implementing it in --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's not what I'm 

thinking.

 MR. MADDEN: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean I'm thinking that, I 

thought as I read this, and you have to correct me 

because you have a better knowledge, originally the 

schools were highly segregated in fact. People brought 

a lawsuit. Then to stop that Seattle engaged in a plan 

that really bused people around on the basis of race. 

That led to white flight. That was bad for the schools.

They then tried a voluntary choice plan. This is part 

of that plan. Then when they abandon this plan, they 

discover more segregation. Is that basically right or 

not?

 MR. MADDEN: When, when this plan has --

this -- the description is yes, basically right.

 When this plan was suspended in, after the 

Court of Appeals enjoined it, the board had, as I said, 

experienced some considerable disruption in the 

assignments because of the timing of the injunction. 

But the board was also looking at the effect of the 

race-neutral, if you will, program measures that it had 

implemented.

 Such that now, Ingram high school in the 

north end of Seattle is much more popular. Nathan Hale 

is no longer over-subscribed. There's less demand for 

Ballard, but there have been --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think your, do you

segregated -- you refer to some of the schools as 

segregated. And I, that's not what I understand by 

segregated.

 MR. MADDEN: Not, not in the sense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, if you 

belong to a country club that, that -- that has 15 

percent black members, I would not consider that a 

segregated country club. So what you are complaining 

about is, is not segregation in any, in any reasonable 

sense of the word. You're complaining about a lack of 

racial balance.

 MR. MADDEN: We are not complaining about 

segregation resulting from purposeful discrimination. 

That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only meaning of 

segregation.

 MR. MADDEN: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about racial 

balance.

 MR. MADDEN: Talking about schools that are 

on the one end racially isolated. The Solicitor General 

mentioned two of those. And talking on the other end 

about preserving the diversity that we had achieved 

through these years of effort in these north end 

schools.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think you're also 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Alito and Justice 

Breyer and I myself am interested: Can you tell us what 

has happened since the plan's been enjoined?

 MR. MADDEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, have you gone back 

to square one? And it's just, there's no diversity at 

all? Or is there substantially more diversity? Can you 

tell us about that? Because it's important. It may 

mean that you don't need to identify students by the 

color of their skin in assignment.

 MR. MADDEN: It, it may mean the board 

confronted with the circumstances might well make that 

decision independent of this litigation. But let me 

answer the specific.

 Let's take Franklin High School to begin 

with. In, in 2000, that school was -- had 25 percent 

white enrollment. In 2005, it had 10 percent white 

enrollment. In the ninth grade, which is really the, 

the level at which we see the effect of the segregation 

tie breaker, in 2000, the white enrollment was 21 

percent; it was 8 percent in 2005.

 Go to Ballard High School on the other end. 

Ballard was 56 percent white students in 2000; it's 62

percent in 2005. The ninth grade class has moved from 

46 percent white students to 58 percent white students. 

Keeping in mind that that school is now significantly 

less popular than it was, I think those effects would 

probably be, be more extreme.

 But the plan -- I want to emphasize, the 

plan was to try to disperse demand and to foster choices 

that would result in diversity, not to compel it. We do 

not --

JUSTICE ALITO: How do, how do you square 

your objective of achieving racial balance with your 

disinterest in the situation at Cleveland and Rainier 

Beach? Those are the most unbalanced schools under your 

definition, and yet those are not affected at all by 

this plan. Why, why are you not concerned about that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, they are affected by 

the plan in this in this way, that in the past the 

district had used mandatory measures, busing students 

across town, to try to integrate those schools. And the 

board decided after many years of effort that it would 

no longer do that, but it was also of the firm 

conviction that it would allow students who wanted the 

opportunity to opt out of those schools to do so.

 At the same time, it implemented magnet 

schools at Rainier Beach, there's a new building under

construction at Cleveland. And so --

JUSTICE ALITO: Are the students who are 

attending those schools getting the benefits of 

attending a school that's racially balanced? And if 

they're not, why are you not concerned about that, if 

that's an important objective of your program?

 MR. MADDEN: We, we are concerned about 

improving the quality of education in all the schools. 

We do not mandate that a student attend a school for 

integration purposes as we once did.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?

 MR. MADDEN: Because it, it's important to 

the credibility and functionality of the school system 

to have a system that is accepted by the public, by our 

constituents. And so people like choice; they also like 

neighborhood schools; they also like diverse schools. 

And the board recognized when it set about to develop 

this plan that accommodating all of those values would 

require some trade-offs. And the board, familiar with 

the local conditions, familiar with the history, did 

just that in what I submit was a narrowly tailored and 

appropriate way.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to the 

Cleveland school that Justice Alito mentioned? An I 

correct that there were 16 percent whites under the

plan? And I'm just wondering what happened to it during 

the last couple of years?

 MR. MADDEN: Cleveland is now about 8 

percent.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it was -- about half 

as many whites as there were under the plan.

 MR. MADDEN: I don't remember the precise 

number in 2000, but that sounds about right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Madden, there was a 

question raised about your categories, that is, you have 

white and then everything else. And it was suggested 

that if you are looking for diversity, what was -- the 

schools that you just mentioned had a large percentage 

of Asian-Americans, but they don't count.

 What is your response to that?

 MR. MADDEN: Well, the -- the problem that 

the board was addressing was principally a, a problem of 

the distribution of white and non-white students. The 

-- as a generality, 75 percent of all non-white students 

in the district lived in South Seattle. And that was 

true for all the ethnic groups except Native Americans, 

who are a very small --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that a problem? 

Suppose you have a school in which 60 percent of the 

students are either of Asian ancestry or Latino

ancestry, and 40 percent are white as you classify 

people. And there are no African-American students at 

all. You would consider that to be a racially balanced 

school, would you not?

 MR. MADDEN: I would say if that 

circumstance occurred, that that would be something that 

the board would have to pay attention to and consider. 

But the fact of the matter is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nothing under the 

plan requires that, does it?

 MR. MADDEN: No, because the numbers in 

terms of the distribution of ethnic groups, separate 

ethnic groups and the benefits or impacts of the plan 

were spread proportionately --

JUSTICE ALITO: And what is the theory 

behind that? Is, the theory is it that the white 

students there or the Asian students or the Latino 

students would not benefit from having African-American 

classmates? It is enough if they have either Asian 

classmates or Latino classmates or white classmates? 

How do you -- how do square that with your, your 

objective of providing benefits that flow from racial 

balance?

 MR. MADDEN: I may, I may have confused the 

answer to the hypothetical with the, with rationale on

the ground, which was that we did not have that kind of 

single minority ethnic group disparity existing in any 

school. I was saying, however, that if that existed, I 

think that would be something the board would have to be 

mindful of. As a practical matter, because our 

non-white ethnic neighborhoods in South Seattle are 

themselves quite integrated, that the movement under 

this plan did not produce disparities for or against any 

particular ethnic group. And so I think in the end it 

might have been more divisive to have individual 

tiebreakers for the separate minority ethnic groups.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What criteria of race does 

the school, just out of curiosity, does the school 

district use? I mean, what if a particular child's 

grandfather was white? Would he qualify as a white or 

non-white.

 MR. MADDEN: I would say -- well, the answer 

is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there must be some 

criterion. There are many people of mixed blood.

 MR. MADDEN: The district has no criteria 

itself. The district uses classifications that are 

developed by the Federal Government but allows parents 

to self identify children.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It allows parents to say

I'm white, no matter what?

 MR. MADDEN: That allows the parents to self 

identify, and the record in this case through the 

testimony of petitioner's president is they were aware 

of no abuse of that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Seems like a big loophole.

 MR. MADDEN: It seems like one but according 

to the record, it's not an issue. I'd like to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't defend the 

choice policy on the basis that the schools offer 

education to everyone of the same quality, do you?

 MR. MADDEN: Oh, yes. Yes. They offer --

the popular schools to which everyone had access under 

this plan who wanted access, I think it's -- there is no 

dispute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 

different from the separate but equal argument? In 

other words, it doesn't matter that they're being 

assigned on the basis of their race because they're 

getting the same type of education.

 MR. MADDEN: Well, because the schools are 

not racially separate. The goal is to maintain the 

diversity that existed within a broad range in order to 

try to obtain the benefits that the educational research 

show flow from an integrated education.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though in the 

individual cases the students, including minority 

students, and I gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being 

denied admission on the basis of their race?

 MR. MADDEN: They're not being denied 

admission. They're being -- seats are being distributed 

to them. This is not like --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They are being 

denied admission to the school of their choice?

 MR. MADDEN: Yes. But this is not like 

being denied admission to a state's flagship university. 

I think for that proposition, I would cite Justice 

Powell's opinion in the Bakke case where he was at some 

pains to point out that a school integration plan is 

wholly dissimilar to a selective university admissions 

plan.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If we look at the things 

that Parents are concerned about when they're 

considering where their children are going to high 

school, we look at things like SAT scores, for example, 

or performance on statewide tests, would we see that, 

the oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed 

schools have similar test scores?

you're talking about, Justice Alito. In this case, I

think the most important point to start with is that 

there was no contention that there was any material 

difference in quality between the five popular high 

schools.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we looked at 

Garfield and Cleveland, what would we find?

 MR. MADDEN: You would find a reasonable 

basis to perceive a quality difference between those two 

schools, but this plan didn't assign any students to 

Cleveland.

 I want to take a moment, if I can, to turn 

to the issue of individualized consideration, because so 

much emphasis has been placed on it in the earlier 

discussion.

 It seems to us, first of all, that this 

Court in Grutter said that not all uses of race trigger 

the same objections and that the Court must be mindful 

of the context. This is not, as I've said, a selective 

or merit-based system where we adjudge one student to be 

better than the other. We do consider individual 

factors before we get to race, starting with choice and 

family connection, and how close you live to the school.

 But ultimately, this is a distributive 

system which, as Justice Powell -- as I noted, Justice 

Powell said in the Bakke case, is quite wholly

dissimilar to a merit or selective-based system. What 

it seems to us is being suggested by the United States 

and by the petitioner is a system that would force an 

individualized merit-based review on any kind of race 

conscious program, specifically an assignment to public 

schools.

 That rule allows the means to define the 

ends; and it ends up, I think, defeating the purpose 

that the Court had of not stigmatizing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason that 

our prior tests have focused on individual determination 

is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to 

ensure that people are treated as individuals rather 

than based on the color of their skin. So saying that 

this doesn't involve individualized determinations 

simply highlights the fact that the decision to 

distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and 

not any other factor.

 MR. MADDEN: Mr. Chief Justice, in Grutter 

you said specifically that individualized review was 

required in the context of university admissions. In 

this context, the kind of review, the specific kind of 

review that I understand the United States to urge and 

the petitioner to urge, serves no purpose, and it may 

itself be stigmatizing in the context of public schools

where everyone gets a seat.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying that 

individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the 

objective here. I thought that's what you were saying.

 MR. MADDEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is 

correct. I am saying, however, that this plan, 

consistent with narrow tailoring, provided consideration 

of individual circumstances, including an appeal on 

hardship grounds for someone who felt that they had been 

denied a school that they needed to be in.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the emphasis on the 

fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me 

is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can 

get into the school that you really prefer. And that in 

some cases depends solely on skin color. You know, it's 

like saying everybody can have a meal but only people 

with separate skin can get the dessert.

 MR. MADDEN: Well, like the Michigan cases, 

sometimes student in the end of the day have an 

assignment determined by race. Just like in the 

university cases, at some point race will be a tipping 

factor. It's different, though, when we put someone in 

a basically comparable school.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're saying

but because they were assigned to those seats on the 

basis of race, it violated equal protection. How is 

your argument that there's no problem here because 

everybody gets a seat distinguishable?

 MR. MADDEN: Because segregation is harmful. 

Integration, this Court has recognized in Swann, in the 

first Seattle case, has benefits. The district was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me you're 

saying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. 

Can you think of any area of the law in which we say 

whatever it takes, so long as there's a real need, 

whatever it takes -- I mean, if we have a lot of crime 

out there and the only way to get rid of it is to use 

warrantless searches, you know, fudge on some of the 

protections of the Bill of Rights, whatever it takes, 

we've got to do it?

 Is there any area of the law that doesn't 

have some absolute restrictions?

 MR. MADDEN: There are many areas of the 

law, certainly in the First Amendment and the Fourth 

Amendment, that have considerable flexibility.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what about the 

Fourteenth? I thought that was one of the absolute 

restrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people 

on the basis of their race. You can pursue the

objectives that your school board is pursuing, but at 

some point you come against an absolute, and aren't you 

just denying that?

 MR. MADDEN: I think that in Grutter and 

Gratz, this Court rejected the absolute and instead 

described discretely, which we feel we need, and which 

is why we are not urging an absolute position. We say 

that we indeed comply with the requirements of narrow 

tailoring, and that the plan therefore should be upheld.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the question of 

integration, whether there was any use of a racial 

criterion, whether integration, using racial integration 

is the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far 

from the kind of headlines that attended the Brown 

decision. They were, at last, white and black children 

together on the same school bench. That seems to be 

worlds apart from saying we'll separate them.

 MR. MADDEN: We certainly agree, 

Justice Ginsburg. We'd go one step further and note 

that in Brown, this Court said that the effects of 

segregated schools are worse.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no effort 

here on the part of the school to separate students on 

the basis of race. It's an assignment on the basis of 

race, correct?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J.F. KORRELL

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. KORRELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

There were some questions of my friend Mr. Madden about 

the record and the statistics about enrollment, and I'd 

like to draw the Court's attention, particularly 

Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens' questions about what 

the schools look like now.

 If the Court looks at pages 6 and 7 of our 

reply brief, we provided the enrollment data. The 

information on page 7 comes from the school district 

website that provides enrollment data at the individual 

schools. In 2005 and 2006, enrollment at the 

oversubscribed schools is now 54 percent non-white, 

which is greater than it was under the district's --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is the -- as I gather, 

the plan where race is used, has to do only with the

ninth grade. And therefore, what you would like to note 

is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped 

using any racial criteria at all, what happened to those 

ninth grade classes. Did they become more heavily 

separated or did they retain their diversity? Are the 

numbers that you are about to read us, which I have in 

front of me, going to do that? Tell us that? I think 

they're about the whole school.

 MR. KORRELL: They are, Your Honor, but 

they're about the whole school after four years of 

operating without the race preference. So each of the 

four years they're represented in the aggregate shows 

the effect that I think Your Honor was asking about.

 So, the record in this case shows the 

Seattle schools are richly diverse. It's very important 

in our view that the Court not lose site of that. We've 

talked about integration and segregation, but I urge the 

Court to take a look at the data the petitioners submit 

regarding the actual enrollment in those schools.

 A couple of other record citations I'd like 

to bring to the Court's attention. Justice Kennedy, I 

think, asked about considering race at a last resort. 

It's simply not the case that the school district looked 

at race as a last resort. And I would draw the Court's 

attention to the superintendent's testimony at joint

appendix 224 and 25, where he said in essence, the 

reason we didn't consider race neutral plans is because 

we were interested in racial diversity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The numbers I have here, 

Franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent. 

Roosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up 

from about 51 to 59. Ballard jumped up from about 56 to 

62. Then Garfield went down some, more mixed. But 

those were the worst ones; am I right on that?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I think the 

numbers that you're reading are from the difference 

between the 2000 and -- '99 and the 2000 enrollments.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. KORRELL: The numbers I was trying to 

bring to the Court's attention were the difference 

between the enrollment under the race-based plan and the 

enrollment in 2005 and 2006, which shows significant and 

continued racial diversity in Seattle's high schools.

 Counsel suggested also that there is no 

material difference among the five oversubscribed 

schools. And I would draw the Court's attention to the 

testimony of the board president at joint appendix 261 

to 274, where she discusses in detail the programmatic 

differences. It is true that those five schools were 

oversubscribed and they were popular, but they all

provide unique programs, some of which as we indicated 

in our briefs, required children to meet certain 

prerequisites to be able to attend.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the board 

simultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or 

attractive programs in the undersubscribed schools?

 MR. KORRELL: Your Honor, I'm perhaps not 

the best person to answer that. I believe the board has 

been trying to introduce programs at all of its schools 

that would make each school unique, and I think that 

includes the undersubscribed schools as well.

 Justice Breyer asked a question about the --

about the process of this litigation, and my 

understanding is there was never a lawsuit against 

Seattle to compel desegregation, that they were always 

following a plan.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
