 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this morning in Case 08-441, Gross v. FBL 

Financial Services.

 Mr. Schnapper.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The court of appeals erred in holding that 

the plaintiff had to have direct evidence in order to 

obtain the specific instruction at issue in this case.

 This Court's decision in Desert Palace makes 

two important points that are relevant today. First, 

the Court noted that this Court had at no time imposed a 

direct evidence requirement without an affirmative 

directive from Congress to do so. Secondly, the Court 

noted that Congress, when it wished to impose heightened 

standards, had done --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That -- that 

statement may be wrong depending upon how you read Price 

Waterhouse, might it not? The first statement, that 

we've never imposed such a requirement. I mean, if you 

think Justice O'Connor's opinion was the determinative

opinion in Price Waterhouse, then -- then we had.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That -- that's true, Your 

Honor. That was not the view of the Court in Desert 

Palace. Desert Palace may have misspoken in that 

regard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was dictum. They may 

have been wrong.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, we -- we'd like to 

think they are right. I mean, we think they are right. 

But of course, as you say, that is, in a sense, one of 

the questions before us.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- I just want 

-- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden of 

proof-shifting requirement absent a directive from 

Congress? Are you --

MR. SCHNAPPER: No. I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or maybe -- maybe I 

misheard.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I may have misspoken, 

Your Honor. What the Court said was that this Court had 

never imposed a direct evidence requirement --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- in the absence of an 

affirmative directive from Congress.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is some

disagreement among the parties, of course, what "direct 

evidence" means, whether it means direct as opposed to 

circumstantial, or direct in the terms that for example 

Judge Collatin put it in the decision below.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, there is not a 

difference between the parties. We take no position on 

that. There is a considerable variety of views about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are telling 

us we never required direct evidence, but you are not 

taking a position on what direct evidence is?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you may be 

right or you may be wrong. But we kind of have to know 

what we're dealing with.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, the Court hasn't put 

those two things together in the way you did. I think 

that's fair. The Court's statement in Desert Palace 

didn't define direct evidence. It's not -- it's not 

clear in that sense exactly what the Court meant. I 

think it's fair to say it certainly meant that the Court 

hadn't required direct evidence in the sense of 

non-circumstantial evidence, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in your 

petition, you asked -- you used the phrase "direct 

evidence," and I just want to know in what sense you

mean that?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: We -- it's our view that no 

special evidence is required to get the instruction in 

this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a variety of 

views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant 

by the term "direct evidence"? It wasn't defined in 

Price Waterhouse either.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, it was not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there is a range of 

views on what it means, starting from direct versus 

circumstantial, to something like strong evidence.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: There is a range of views on 

that, but our view is the burden on the plaintiff is to 

show by a preponderance of the evidence that in this 

case age was a motivating factor, but it's not required 

to show it by any particular kind of evidence or to show 

it by strong evidence as opposed to merely evidence 

sufficient to establish that by a preponderance of the 

evidence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Price Waterhouse was a bench 

trial.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And Mt. Healthy was a bench 

trial, wasn't it?

MR. SCHNAPPER: I believe so, yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, would the -- if there 

is a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause 

a great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give 

an instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury 

will first have to decide whether a particular type of 

evidence is present in the case before it can tell 

what -- who has the burden of proof and what the 

standard is, but if Price Waterhouse is understood 

simply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to 

look at the evidence, does it present any of the 

problems that have been identified with the Price 

Waterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as 

applied to jury trials?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it wouldn't present 

the same -- there are special problems applying it to 

jury trials. We think that the requirement of direct 

evidence is simply wrong for a number of reasons. At 

the least, the Court would have to finally resolve what 

direct evidence means in this particular context.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's just an 

instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it 

could mean that if the judge sitting as the trier of 

fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong 

evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the

judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger 

evidence on the other side in order to rule against the 

plaintiff. It's not hard to figure out how it might 

work out in that situation.

 The problem comes when it has to be posed in 

the form of a jury instruction.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's a particularly 

serious problem there, but if you were to announce this 

as a rule, you would -- I think the time has come to 

explain definitively what "direct evidence" means. The 

courts of appeals are in wide disagreement about that, 

and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was the view of 

only one justice, Justice O'Connor alone. She did make 

the fifth vote, but no one else accepted a direct 

evidence test.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, she made the 

sixth vote. There were five members of the Court other 

than Justice O'Connor who agreed in the result in that 

case. The plurality expressly rejected a direct 

evidence requirement. Justice White --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you urge that 

we should count Justice white's decision as the 

controlling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: To the extent that you were

disposed to resolve this case based an interpretation of 

Price Waterhouse. But it's our view that the subsequent 

decision, unanimous decision in Desert Palace, makes it 

unnecessary. Desert Palace indicates that heightened 

proof requirements that -- those are the words of the 

opinion. It suggest they should not be imposed by the 

courts absent a statutory directive.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But Desert Palace was a 

Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to 

Title VII?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It was. But that part of 

the reasoning of the case is not based on the language 

of Title VII other than the absence from Title VII of 

that specific language. The structure of the opinion 

first talks about the definition of "demonstrate" in 

section 701(n). That's obviously not relevant to the 

ADEA. But it goes on to say that the absence in Title 

VII of any heightened proof requirement also weighs 

heavily against the Court's inferring, and that part of 

the reasoning isn't limited to Title VII.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your position, 

you rest heavily on the argument, I think, but there is 

no textual support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence 

requirement in order to shift the burden of proof. But 

isn't it true there is no textural support for shifting

the burden of proof at all? I mean, I don't see how 

you can -- can convince us of the first proposition 

without confronting the second.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, this Court has on a 

number of occasions allocated the burden of proof among 

the parties, including to a defendant, without a 

specific textual basis. The Court did so, for example, 

in Burlington Industries v. Eller, where the Court's 

opinion places on the defendant the burden of 

establishing an affirmative defense in certain types of 

sexual harassment cases. There wasn't a textual basis 

for that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, 

affirmative defenses, usually the burden of persuasion 

is on the party asserting the affirmative defense.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: In Justice -- in the case of 

Price Waterhouse, Justice White characterized this 

allocation as the burden, as an affirmative defense. 

But this sort of thing routinely with regard to the 

allocation of burdens. It does not happen routinely 

with regard to heightened evidence requirement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it the only issue 

that you have raised before us is whether the evidence 

that does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got 

to be, whatever this means, direct or not? That's the

only issue?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's the only issue before 

the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Am I right that the only 

source of argument for the proposition that it does have 

to be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion, 

separate opinion?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, that has been the 

primary basis for the argument in the courts below. I 

think Respondent has other arguments as well.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: There are arguments about 

the need for substantial evidence. But the argument for 

direct evidence goes back to the separate O'Connor --

O'Connor opinion.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's certainly the origin.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And are you -- I mean, 

we're going to hear about this. Are you going to make 

an argument to the effect that that should not be 

regarded as the controlling opinion, and if that is the 

source of it, that is the end of the issue. Are you 

going to get into that?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I would be happy -- I 

would be happy to get into it, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I think you should.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: As -- as Justice Ginsburg

pointed out, there are -- there were actually six 

members of the Court in Price Waterhouse who concurred 

in the result. Four members of the Court in the 

plurality expressly rejected a direct evidence 

requirement and said there were no limit on the type of 

evidence that could be used.

 Justice White said that the plaintiff's 

burden was to show that in that case gender was a 

substantial factor. He didn't say substantial evidence 

was required.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand the White 

opinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the 

evidence. It had to do with the degree of 

persuasiveness of the evidence; is that correct?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: With due respect, no, Your 

Honor. It had to do --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I don't understand 

what "substantial" means. What do you think he meant by 

that?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: The "substantial factor" was 

somewhere on the scale of a very unimportant factor or a 

very, very important factor, which is separate from how 

clear the evidence was that it was a small or large 

factor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to 

Justice Souter's question you said you're only focusing 

on the direct evidence threshold. But if direct 

evidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of 

shifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it 

really fair for you to be able to say, we are only going 

to take out one side of the behalf, we are going to 

leave the other side of the balance there? It seems to 

me that it's artificial to separate the two 

requirements, the two aspects of the Price Waterhouse 

inquiry.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- the Price 

Waterhouse plurality and Justice White didn't see two 

aspects. The requirement was proof by a preponderance 

of the evidence that in the case gender was a motivating 

factor, and for five members of the Court that was 

sufficient. There wasn't -- there wasn't something else 

that went with it. There was for Justice O'Connor, but 

she's the sixth vote. And -- and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand the 

difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in 

Price Waterhouse. But at least as it has been applied, 

my understanding -- I understand it has been applied in 

different ways. My understanding of what people mean 

when they say "the Price Waterhouse approach," which is

that there is a higher showing of evidence, direct 

evidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that 

means. But if you meet that showing, then the burden of 

persuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of 

causation.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that is 

precisely the issue on which the lower courts have been 

divided. Some courts have expressly rejected that view 

and have taken the view that there is no special 

heightened standard of any kind. Other courts think 

that it is required. That is what we are -- what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Schnapper, there 

is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your 

case -- between what is called the prima facia case that 

the plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas 

test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that 

in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor. 

I think you must concede that in order to fit within 

this double motive frame you must show not simply a 

prima facia case, but by a preponderance of the evidence 

that the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. We -- we are obligated 

to do that, and the -- the defendant has argued below 

and would, I think, on remand still be in a position to 

argue that we didn't have enough evidence to meet that

burden. But that question isn't before us.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- can one know if 

you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury? 

That is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown 

whether you have established by a preponderance of the 

evidence that age discrimination was a motivating 

factor.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, whether there is 

sufficient evidence is often tested by a motion for 

summary judgment. So courts do look at that matter, 

that issue, before trial. What -- what isn't knowable 

before trial -- and -- and frankly is often known only 

to the jury -- is whether the jury will conclude that 

the defendant acted with two motives or one motive. 

That -- that isn't something you would normally be able 

to -- to resolve before the case went to trial or even 

during the course of the trial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, correct me if I am 

wrong. I assume that in a jury case that simply was 

left to the jury, and the instructions would be 

something like this: If you find that the plaintiff has 

shown that age was a motivating factor, then you look to 

the next question. And that is: Has the defendant 

shown that he would have fired the plaintiff anyway? 

Isn't that the way it works?

MR. SCHNAPPER: That's the -- that's the way 

it works. Yes, that's the way it works. And that --

that is the way it works in -- in a Title VII case 

because of the language of the statute. The juries 

routinely get that instruction in those cases. That's 

certainly proof --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in -- in response 

further to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think 

Justice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any 

tactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that 

counsel face if they don't quite know which way the 

burden is going to shift before trial: The -- the 

number of witnesses you have waiting in the hallway or 

-- this -- this would be after summary judgment.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No more than would normally 

be the case. What happened here in terms of jury 

instructions was typical, which was the parties proposed 

their differing instructions a week before trial, the 

instructions were resolved at the end of trial. That --

that happens all the time.

 Sometimes if the parties don't know how the 

instructions are going to come out, that complicates 

their tactics, but that happens every day in trials.

 Thank you.

down, I -- I have been trying to figure out Justice 

White's opinion in Price Waterhouse. I mean, indeed he 

-- he voted to -- to remand the case, as did -- as did 

the four in the plurality, but for a very different 

reason. They remanded because -- "We reverse the court 

of appeals' judgment against Price Waterhouse because 

the courts below erred by deciding that the defendant 

must make" the proof of he would have been fired anyway 

by clear and convincing evidence. That -- that was the 

basis for their reversing and remanding.

 That was not Justice White's, because -- he 

said "because the court of appeals required Price 

Waterhouse to prove by clear and convincing evidence 

that it would have reached the same" -- "in the absence 

of the improper motive. Rather than merely requiring 

proof by a preponderance of the evidence, I concur in 

the judgment reversing this case in part and remanding. 

With respect to the employer's burden, however, the 

plurality seems to require that the employer submit 

objective evidence." And he disagreed with that.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: All right. There -- there 

were a number of different issues in the case. The 

first, the court of appeals had held that when the 

burden is on the employer to show it would have made the 

same decision anyway, the employer has to meet that

burden with clear and convincing evidence.

 The plurality and Justice White, the whole 

court rejected that.

 Secondly, the plurality suggested that the 

employer in response would have to have objective 

evidence. Justice White rejected that and the objective 

evidence standard has not been followed by the lower 

courts in -- in the wake of that.

 The third question was whether the burden 

should be placed on the employer. On that issue the 

Court was divided six to three. Six Justices, as we --

as we noted, were for that burden allocation. The --

Justice Kennedy and -- and yourself and the Chief 

Justice dissented. So there were many issues.

case. The question presented is the one of should you 

have a direct evidence requirement to obtain a mixed 

motive instruction under the Age Act. And there is the 

procedural posture, which is Desert Palace left 

unresolved a lot of very difficult and complicated 

questions about when do you get to the jury on mixed 

motive and what is the requirement that separates a 

mixed motive motivating factor instruction from the 

"but-for" or commonly known as the McDonnell Douglas. 

And Desert Palace left all that unresolved.

 On the question presented, there is the same 

conflict in the circuits under the Age Act. It is the 

same conflict in the circuits that was under Title VII 

-- is do you need any kind of evidentiary special 

showing to get to a mixed motive; and, if so, is it non-

circumstantial evidence or evidence that directly ties 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? Do 

you think that there is a tenable distinction between a 

mixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case? In 

every employment discrimination case that gets beyond 

summary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play?

 MS. BLATT: I think there is a lot to be 

said for that argument, and this is a very difficult and 

unsettled question under Title VII. I think what would

be on the table if this Court ever had an appropriate 

vehicle -- and this certainly is not the appropriate 

vehicle to get into this question -- there would be 

several options on the table. You could have what your 

view suggests, which is after summary judgment you could 

get a motivated factor instruction that the jury would 

be permitted to find both impermissible and permissible 

motives.

 You could also have a special verdict form 

that asks the jury: Do you find that there were two 

causes, one of which was an impermissible factor? And 

you could have a situation which I think prevails in 

trial courts now -- and it has been the EEOC's practice 

-- which is -- and it's not the most analytically clean, 

but they basically give the instruction, either a 

determinative cause or motivating factor instruction, on 

what they think best fits the evidence.

 And I think it's important for the Court to 

understand, as we -- the law exists now under Title VII 

and under all the other anti-discrimination acts, there 

are two regimes out there. There is a mixed motive 

regime and a determining factor regime.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Couldn't -- couldn't any 

Title VII case be presented in either framework?

 MS. BLATT: Yes. But this is -- I will also

give you, which I think is important especially when you 

write your opinion, the three reasons why you should not 

resolve this very difficult question in this case. And 

the first is that it wasn't pressed or passed on below 

or raised in the brief in opposition and did not receive 

full briefing by the parties and all the amici.

 And, second, just as you left this issue 

open in footnote 1 of your opinion in Desert Palace, 

Judge Collatin writing for the court recognized this 

precise issue in footnote 3 of the court's opinion on 

petition appendix page 12, saying: Assuming there is no 

direct evidence requirement, we are going to have to 

figure out when is it appropriate to give a motivating 

factor instruction, absent the -- the language, 

expressed language in Title VII?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you --

MS. BLATT: The third reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I will let you get 

your third reason in in a minute, but why -- do you 

really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated 

test that the court has constructed and say, well, this 

one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out? I mean, 

maybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole 

construct, or maybe none of the elements actually make 

sense. But it seems to me very artificial to focus on

one aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing 

what its impact is on the rest of the text.

 MS. BLATT: I see your point, even though 

that is exactly what you did in Desert Palace. But 

Price Waterhouse is a two-decade-old decision. We're 20 

years past that and it has been essentially codified in 

Title VII. So no matter what you do to, quote unquote, 

"fix this" under the Age Act, every -- the bulk of the 

discrimination cases fall under Title VII, and a 

motivating factor instruction is codified, and you 

unanimously held in Desert Palace there is no special 

evidentiary requirement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- that was 

because -- that was because of the 1991 Act which 

addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA 

out.

 MS. BLATT: Unless you overrule Price 

Waterhouse, which would be an upheaval in the law, and 

certainly -- this wouldn't be the appropriate case to do 

it, all the courts of appeals have unanimously held 

under the Age Act and under a wide variety of State 

statutes and other Federal discrimination statutes that 

the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework applies.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are asking us to 

overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct

evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's 

opinion.

 MS. BLATT: I don't think you need to decide 

that question. In a lot of other contexts, you have 

said, well, there is language in our opinion that may 

have been confusing or it's not clear what the holding 

is, but we henceforth are going to clarify, here's what 

the law is.

 You did it in the recent crack cocaine case 

in Spears, you did it in your nude dancing case, and you 

did it in a case called Jefferson v. City of Tarrant 

County, an opinion Justice Ginsburg authored, that you 

said: Well, there is language here that substantive 

cases make clear, and there is lots of reasons why you 

would not impose a direct evidence requirement, however 

you define that term.

 Since Desert Palace, there is a decision of 

Sprint/United v. Mendelsohn. And I think that case a 

fortiori forecloses all the arguments made by the other 

side that, well, even if it doesn't mean 

non-circumstantial evidence, it must mean something that 

is highly relevant to the issue of discrimination. In 

Sprint/United you said we're not going to have a per se 

rule about what is relevant to prove discrimination. 

The Court said the same thing in Reeves. I think that

was a unanimous decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would 

be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying 

let's get rid of all these artificial court 

constructions and say this is like any other case, the 

plaintiff has the burden of persuasion and the defendant 

can come up with what defenses he has, including that, I 

did this for some other reason, it wasn't because of 

age, and the jury looks at it and decides who they 

believe?

 MS. BLATT: You would still have the same 

issue as you have under the constitutional regime of 

what is causation? And if you ask my opinion, the 

Solicitor General in Price Waterhouse itself argued 

something different that no Justice adopted. We argued 

a standard of causation that no one -- no one was 

persuaded by. Six went off on this motivating factor 

with the burden shifting approach, and three of the 

Justices would have applied a straight "but for" 

causation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute -- the 

statute has language. It says "because of." Tell the 

jury that.

 MS. BLATT: Absolutely. And it did in Title 

VII, and this Court, for better or worse -- regardless

of what you think, in Price Waterhouse six Justices 

defined the language "because of." And we have Price 

Waterhouse now that is codified. And so --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any 

empirical evidence to show whether any of this really 

makes a difference. Have there been studies on the 

effect of the 1991 amendments, whether they have made a 

difference in the way cases actually come out?

 MS. BLATT: No. Let me just say two 

responses. Not that I have seen empirical. I can tell 

you the EEOC's experience, and that is they sometimes 

prefer a "but for" all the burden being on them and 

sometimes they prefer the motivating factor instruction. 

And despite what Respondent points out, they have some 

defendants that think they like the affirmative defense.

 And sometimes counsel just agree on what the 

instruction should be. And it hasn't caused that much 

of a problem, although there is a lot of confusion about 

this kind of case, where the defendant is insisting on 

one instruction and the plaintiff wants another 

instruction, and that's what Judge Collatin is reserving 

in a footnote saying: On remand I am going to have to 

sort this out.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what the 

parties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury,

regardless of instruction, is going to say something 

like this: If we find that -- that age really was in 

the boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss 

comes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the 

guy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late 

and so on, the jury is going to say: Did they really 

fire him because he was old or because he didn't come to 

work on time?

 They are going to do the same thing that 

they are going to do on the burden-shifting instruction, 

probably, aren't they?

 MS. BLATT: I mean -- there are two kinds of 

jury findings. There is -- but the problem in all this 

area, if you do ever get a case that is appropriate, I 

think what the Court should start with the assumption 

which Justice Alito alluded to: Price Waterhouse was a 

bench trial. The 1991 amendments under Title VII were 

against the backdrop of non-jury trials. And both the 

Price Waterhouse decision and the language of Title VII 

are written ex post. It's assuming some artificial 

world where there was a finding of mixed motive.

 But in today's world everything needs to be 

done ex ante. We need to know how to instruct the jury, 

and that's the fundamental problem.

 If you are looking at ex post world, you are

exactly right, a jury could either find this was all a 

pretext, I think what was really going on was ageism or 

sexism or racism, or it could find, a split the baby, I 

think it's both. But you can't possibly know that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't know it --

MS. BLATT: -- going in.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you said to the 

jury, do the right thing, they'd probably come out the 

same way it would come out if you gave the burden 

shifting instruction, I think.

 MS. BLATT: I think you are basically 

catching on the point that a lot of counsel in the real 

world are basically deciding, what do we think the jury 

is going to be most on our side with, with which 

instruction. And it's not always clear going into the 

case, and maybe depending on the relative strength of 

the legitimate factor being asserted. Some defendants 

may prefer the affirmative defense. Some may think, no, 

it's prejudicial, we don't want that, we want a straight 

determining factor instruction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason I raise the 

issue is, if -- if we are saying do we ditch Price 

Waterhouse, my questions I guess are suggesting 

something to the effect, what difference does it make?

ditch Price Waterhouse as a practical matter, because 

you are going to create -- I mean -- massive confusion, 

not only under the Age Act, but under the Americans with 

Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, a 

variety of labor statutes, disciplinary statutes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Juries -- juries are 

smarter than judges.

 MS. BLATT: Well, you can do that, but all 

the problems you think you are solving, you are going to 

have to face them in Title VII. That is the bulk of 

discrimination law, and you have two standards of 

causation in that statute right now.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead and make 

your third point briefly.

 MS. BLATT: Oh, on why you shouldn't decide 

it? It's essentially this, that this is complicated, 

difficult under Title VII. That's the leading 

anti-discrimination statute. I think the Court may want 

to resolve these very legitimate important questions in 

a Title VII case, because you have got statutory 

language.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 It does seem to me in some ways the 

Petitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing 

in the night because the issues here are unbelievably 

complicated. I will say in 25 years of advocacy before 

this Court I have not seen one area of the law that 

seems to me as difficult to sort out as this particular 

one is.

 That said, I would hope that the Court would 

seize upon this as an opportunity to provide some 

significant clarity in the law, rather than seize this 

as an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially 

most narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can 

tell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately, 

but certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass 

confusion that seems to exist among the lower courts.

 So, I would urge the Court not to evaluate 

this case strictly on the question of whether direct 

versus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to 

proceed. In part that's because that is not the basis 

on which the Eighth Circuit decided this case.

 The Eighth Circuit said that it interpreted 

Justice O'Connor's separate opinion calling for direct

evidence as talking about a specific link between the 

proof -- in the proof of the discriminatory 

considerations and the adverse action that was taken. 

So, direct versus circumstantial doesn't even -- you 

know, if you remand to evaluate non-circumstantial 

evidence, you are still not going to be in a position 

where that is going to affect the outcome.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the court 

of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was 

the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the 

narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to 

take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse.

 Then there's a question of what did she mean 

by direct evidence? But I think the Eighth Circuit 

certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the 

law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which 

their decision turned.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, then -- of course, they 

go on to say what they think that decision means. But 

there is no question, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the 

basis for that holding.

 So, I mean, I suppose the Court could say, 

no, we disagree with the basis of Price Waterhouse as 

Justice White's separate concurring opinion, which, 

frankly, I think it is -- you know, having read it more

times than I care to admit, is not exactly clear as to 

what he thinks the appropriate standard would have been. 

At least Justice Ginsburg's provides the formulation 

that the lower courts can use to try to provide some 

kind of a jury instruction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice O'Connor.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Did I say Ginsburg?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm going to hear about this 

one.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: I apologize.

 But the problem -- you know, the -- but the 

fundamental problem is, it's just simply not clear what 

Justice White's opinion means. And therefore, the lower 

courts have seized upon an opinion that at least 

provided serious guidance that they could embody into a 

jury instruction.

 It goes to the point that Justice Alito was 

making, which is that, it's one thing when you are 

dealing with bench trials and what do you ask the judge 

to do, it's something fundamentally different when you 

are shifting the burden of proof.

 Justice Kennedy asked the question does it

make a difference tactically, and the same question 

Justice Souter in some ways was asking and the answer is 

clearly it does, and you can see it in this case. 

Here's a situation where the defendant prior to the 

trial shows up, or when the jury gets selected. Opening 

statement says there is going to be no evidence of 

actual age discrimination in this case. The case is 

tried on that theory. The basis for the judgment that 

there is going to be no evidence of age discrimination 

in this case is the discovery, extensive discovery that 

has taken place, where there is no statements by anyone 

talking about age, no other employee who believes that 

he or she had been ever been affected by age. It's all 

of this very abstract claim and the notion that somehow 

there is no better explanation for what happened except 

for age.

 You go through the entirety of the trial 

saying to the jury, there is no evidence of age, there 

is no evidence of age discrimination, and then at the 

last minute, not because you have asserted an 

affirmative defense -- because we didn't assert an 

affirmative defense -- one is foisted on us by the jury 

instruction that the plaintiff asked for in this 

particular case that says that if there is a motivating 

factor, if you can prove a motivating factor -- which it

is interesting to get to the specifics of a motivating 

factor, which means it played a part or a role, which is 

about as minimalist as you can have it -- then the 

burden shifts and we then have the burden to prove that 

we would have taken the same action notwithstanding age.

 Well, that's a very different inquiry, and 

when you go to the jury at the end you can't conceive --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I ask 

you --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you your views 

on a question that I've asked myself over and over again 

and had trouble finding the answer. Supposing a company 

appointed a committee to decide whether or not to fire 

X. And the committee came back and said: "Yes, you 

should fire him; he's too old and he's late to work 

every day."

 Now -- and that's all the evidence in the 

record. Would the -- would the judge be obliged to 

enter a judgment on summary judgment -- at the end of 

the plaintiff's case, to enter judgment for the 

defendant?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't believe he would 

be required to enter judgment on the defendant.

have been proved was there is one motivating factor 

there, but not necessarily a decisive one.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but I -- it does seem 

to me that the jury -- it would be fair to ask the jury 

to decide which of those two considerations probably 

played the greater role. But I think -- and that's why 

I think taking it to the jury is one thing.  Switching 

the burden of proof to insist that we prove that the --

that the nondiscriminatory ground was the primary reason 

for the decision is -- is an inappropriate way to 

proceed because there is no basis in the statute for 

that. The plaintiff still retains the burden to prove 

that there was discrimination because of.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he has only proved 

that it is one of two possible motivating factors, but 

that is sufficient in your view to get to the jury.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I would think that that would 

be sufficient to get to the jury, because I don't think 

we have to prove -- I don't think the plaintiff has to 

prove, you know, obviously, beyond a reasonable doubt or 

anything. I mean, I think the jury could fairly say 

that those are the two grounds, and I think in some ways 

that -- that is the sort of common sense basis on which 

Price Waterhouse was decided. And it's -- you know, 

it's important -- if -- you know, the Chamber of

Commerce brief actually focuses a great deal, Justice 

Stevens, on this multi-member decisionmaking body. And 

you know, it seems to me if you look at cases like Mt. 

Healthy and Price Waterhouse, those are all cases where 

you have multi-member decisionmakers, and some of whom 

may have expressed some biases and others of whom 

clearly didn't, and how do you deal with that situation, 

which impresses me as fundamentally different that the 

situation here where you have a single supervisor 

dealing with a single employee and where the case is 

tried on the theory that there has been no 

discrimination whatsoever, and it's up to the jury to 

make that determination at the end, and at the last 

minute we have the jury instruction that shifts the 

burden to us notwithstanding that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would you --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- we never sought to make 

this an affirmative defense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Would you think you should 

have the burden in the following situation? At 10:00 

o'clock on March 21st the employer says: I am going to 

get rid of Smith because he's too old.

into the employer's office and says: "I've discovered 

that Smith was just convicted of larceny." All right? 

Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old. But 

I take it he can make the defense:  Well, Smith would 

have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired 

him, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get 

off. But he should make that defense, shouldn't he?

yes?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now we have 

the same situation, but the jury has said this bad 

reason, his age, was a motivating factor.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Played a role.

 JUSTICE BREYER: To me -- it didn't say 

played a role.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, it did.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it says in this 

instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one --

MR. PHILLIPS: It's on page 10 of the joint 

appendix.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have on page 7 of 

the -- of appellant's brief that the instruction was

defendant's decision."

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But -- right. It 

just --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now when I read that, I 

think --

MR. PHILLIPS: Can I just, if you go to the 

next instruction --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- it says a -- "Plaintiff's 

age was a motivating factor if plaintiff's age played a 

part or a role in the defendant's decision." So "a 

motivating factor" is a very narrow formulation --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, okay, all right, 

fine.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- as instruction in this 

particular case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Perfect, perfect. I didn't 

want to complicate it, but that may work in your favor 

to complicate it, and I want to be fair.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. It played a part. 

It did have a role: Age motivated in part. Now why 

isn't that the end of the matter? Because we have a 

statute that says age shouldn't play a role in. "Play a 

role" means it made a difference. I mean, to me.

Otherwise it played no role. It was an understudy, a 

ghost. It "played a role" if it would have made a 

difference. "Played a part," it would have made a 

difference, just like my first case.

 So we have an action, other things being 

equal, that should be illegal under this statute. But 

then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a 

defense: If you can show that in the absence of that 

age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway, 

which means the mix of motives would have been 

different, then you get off.

 So, if in the first case we in fact say it 

should be on the -- burden should be on the employer, 

why shouldn't it be in the second case?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean -- in the first 

place, saying that something is a motivating factor or 

played a role is, as a sufficient basis on which to 

impose liability, is flatly inconsistent with what this 

Court has said numerous time. It said it in Burdine, it 

said it in Reeves, it said it in Hazen Paper, it said it 

I think last term in the Kentucky case, where it says it 

has to play a role and be determinative. And that's the 

standard the Court has announced over and over again in 

age discrimination cases.

 The "a motivating factor" formulation does

come in Title VII, but that's because of the 1991 

statute that specifically frames the argument in terms 

of "a motivating factor." So the -- the bottom line 

here is that, unless the Court deviates from the 

historic practice, which is if you are in civil 

litigation the plaintiff retains the burden of proof 

throughout the process --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Price Waterhouse 

deviated -- that was --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have these two regimes 

out there. You are reciting McDonnell Douglas and say 

everything should follow that pattern, but to do that 

you have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave 

recognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out 

of Mt. Healthy.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, my basic point on Price 

Waterhouse is that it seemed to me reasonably clear that 

a majority of the Court, whether you -- whether you rely 

upon Justice White or Justice O'Connor -- clearly didn't 

intend for the jury -- for the burden of proof to shift 

willy-nilly. But it's supposed to be an exception to 

the rule, narrowly defined. And the reality --

the prima facie case that you make under McDonnell 

Douglas and -- he said: We don't have to just make a 

preliminary showing; we have to establish by a 

preponderance of the evidence that the prohibited 

discrimination was a motivating factor.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Played -- played a role. 

There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. But 

that is not much different, frankly, from a prima facie 

showing. The truth is if you only make a prima facie 

showing and the defendant doesn't show up, you will have 

in fact satisfied your burden.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you will get to the 

jury and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury 

can find in your favor. But the difference between a 

prima facie showing and what has to be shown here is, 

the jury must actually find, based on your at least 

prima facie evidence, that age was a motivating factor, 

and until the jury makes that finding, if it is properly 

instructed, it doesn't get to the question of whether 

the defendant has any burden to show something in 

response. Isn't that correct?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is no question --

I mean, although again what a motivating factor means is 

still to my mind extraordinarily narrow in this --

just --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- or limited in terms of 

what is required here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not quite sure I 

understand one thing. If it's a motivating factor, it's 

enough to get by summary judgment and get the case to 

the jury, but the -- the defendant will still win, if I 

understand all this, if he -- if the defendant proves, 

yes, I did do and it may have had an influence on it, 

but he would have fired him anyway. And if he -- if he 

can prove under Mt. Healthy that, yes, he thought about 

age and that -- what raised the issue and everything 

else, but after he got all through, he was clear he 

fired him because he was a lousy salesman --

MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and he wins.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Clearly he would win under 

those circumstances, but the problem there is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So he does not lose just 

because you say it's a motivating factor.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, he doesn't lose, but the 

question is, what do you do once you make that finding? 

Do you, in fact, at the plaintiff's behest, shift the 

burden of proof to the defendant? I mean, it admits one 

thing, and the Solicitor General, you know, has properly

identified that in some instances the defendants as a 

tactical matter are willing to accept as an affirmative 

defense and -- and pursue the course you just 

articulated, Justice Stevens.

 But that's not what happened in this case. 

We were not prepared to accept the idea that age played 

a role.  We still don't think the evidence supports 

that. That's obviously not the issue here before us, 

but it does make it extremely important to resolve the 

question of, at what stage can you foist, essentially --

JUSTICE BREYER: Will you --

MR. PHILLIPS: --- an affirmative defense on 

the other side?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Will you go back? I'm 

sorry to be hung up on this point. Maybe there are 

15 cases that just prove I am wrong. But I'm -- I'm 

trying to figure out -- let's try other areas of the 

law. The dam is a nuisance. We now show, to prove that 

it's a nuisance, that it played a role in the death of 

my fish. I mean, isn't that the end of the case? 

Damages might be at issue -- how much of a role -- but 

as far as liability is concerned the gears were rusty. 

The rusty gears played a role in the derailing of the 

train. Again, it might be a question of who is 

responsible for what, but that there is liability I

think in most areas of tort law would be over once you 

prove that the defendant's factor played a role.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So is the law here -- am I 

wrong about ordinary tort law? Possibly. I don't know 

it that well. Is it that I -- is it that this area is 

special? Is it that there are cases so you can say any 

of those three? I am prepared to be totally wrong. I 

hope not.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I am always reluctant to say 

that, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You can say that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think that, in ordinary 

tort law, the standard of causation is both a 

combination of "but for" and proximate causation, so --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I think "played a role" 

combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't 

know --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- that's a fair --

JUSTICE BREYER: "Played a role" -- how did 

it play a role if it was not a necessary?

Price Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in 

that case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a 

motivating factor is actually a standard below "but for" 

causation. The plurality was unwilling to accept even 

"but for" causation as a requirement under the Age 

Discrimination and Employment Act. The rest of the 

Justices seemed to not -- not accept that. But that 

seems to me the very -- yes, the basic holding of the 

plurality -- again, not of the Court -- is that 

something less than "but for" causation is required. I 

would be delighted, candidly, if the court would go back 

to just "but for" causation as the element of age 

discrimination because I think, if you get to that 

point, you get out of this business of trying to figure 

out at what point do you shift the burden. If you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that question -- I 

think it can't be before us. We would certainly want to 

know what the government's position is on it. And Ms. 

Blatt was very clear that the government is not taking a 

position on that issue today. Your brief in opposition 

did not so much as mention McDonnell Douglas. So how is 

anybody to think that was at stake, that that regime, 

which you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you 

think should be the sole test? How could that come into 

this case when it's not in the brief in opposition and,

therefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's 

not in the government's brief?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be clear about this, 

I'm not pushing so much the, quote, McDonnell Douglas 

framework as I am Burdine, Hazen Paper, and the other 

cases that talk about "determinative factor." And all 

we're saying is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your line is 

following that same formula. All those cases are 

following that litany: prima facie case, discriminatory 

reason --

MR. PHILLIPS: Determinative factor, right. 

I think the answer to the question, Justice Ginsburg, is 

the -- the way the Chief Justice asked the question, 

which is, how sensible is it to pull the one thread out 

of -- out of the Price Waterhouse analysis, assuming 

that Justice O'Connor speaks for the Court in some 

sense, you know, without examining how that plays in, 

given the underlying theory of the case? And I think 

that's a perfectly valid point. If the Court thinks 

additional briefing is warranted, then it would seem to 

me the right answer is to -- is to call for additional 

briefing, but I think --

going to affect all kinds of other acts. This is a 

watershed.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kennedy, 

clearly it's going to affect Title VII.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- pardon me?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Clearly is it going to affect 

Title VII.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's statutory.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, because there's a 

specific statute that defines it as a motivating factor, 

shifts the burden, and creates an entire remedial regime 

that doesn't exist under the age discrimination statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- let's assume we 

have authority to incorporate the Title VII 

jurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice. 

Are there reasons why there should be distinctions 

between the two regimes?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the primary one 

is the 1991 amendment, where Congress clearly changed 

the language in Title VII.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there reasons of 

administration or fairness other than -- I recognize 

that one is statutory and the others would -- would be 

our case law.

beyond that. I mean, there's almost a separation of 

powers problem when you say it's statutory because, 

again, Congress very consciously decided to modify Title 

VII, created a complete regime. It would be a bit of a 

stretch for this Court not only to modify the standards 

in a way that would change substantive liability but 

would create the -- the affirmative defense as a 

remedial component of it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in addition to that, 

Mr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with 

legitimate reasons for employment discrimination than 

race and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Both Congress and this Court 

have recognized precisely that as a problem. I mean, 

there are reasons to treat age discrimination 

differently from other forms of discrimination. But, 

again, you know, there's no question that if you revisit 

Price Waterhouse, it will change some -- the Americans 

with Disabilities Act and some of the other provisions.

 But the reality is, if you are talking about 

a mess to begin with, the truth is the lower courts are 

in a state of -- of disrepair at this point in any 

event. And it's even shown in this case.

 I mean, the truth is the Eighth Circuit has 

three different formulations of Justice O'Connor's

evidence standard: circumstantial, strong evidence, and 

substantial evidence, substantial factor. So if you are 

a district court judge sitting in the Eighth Circuit, 

you can pick any one of those -- those three to go with.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to 

Justice Stevens's hypothetical? You have two people 

making a decision; one says it's because of age and the 

one says it's because of something, and -- a legitimate 

factor -- and you acknowledge that could get to the 

jury?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe it could.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And is it under an 

instruction that simply says "because of"?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes -- I mean, if you were 

asking me how I would decide that case, yes, I think it 

ought to be -- it ought to be because of.

 Now, if the Court wants to formulate some 

greater specificity of how the causation standards 

apply, that's fine. But, at a minimum, it seems to me 

the Court would do well to go back at least to the 

notion of "but for" causation as embodied in the Age 

Discrimination and Employment Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean --

a Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say "but for" 

causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's 

hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say 

that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the 

alleged action, would not have happened but for one 

factor or the other if they are just two different 

factors. You would just leave that up to the jury to 

say because of?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me juries 

are asked to make that kind of a decision. I agree with 

Justice Souter: Juries are a lot smarter than the 

lawyers.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but not only that, 

but the jury would be free to say, well, there were both 

clauses, and the one was illegal. But under the Mt. 

Healthy defense, if they are convinced they would have 

fired this guy anyway, the company gets off.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and I understand that. 

And in those situations -- look, Justice O'Connor's 

analysis of this certainly -- certainly plays to a kind 

of gut feeling. When you -- and Mt. Healthy is a good 

illustration of it, even maybe more so, when you say: 

We are firing you for two reasons; one of them is 

completely invalid, and the other is completely valid.

What are you supposed to do in that situation?

 But it seems to me that under -- under 

normal civil litigation rules, and the ones that 

Congress clearly had in its mind, the approach you would 

take under those circumstances say that's enough to get 

you to the jury, but that's not enough to force the jury 

to be instructed that they have to rule in favor of the 

plaintiff unless the defendant can show that but-for, 

that -- that no matter -- regardless of the 

discriminatory animus, they nevertheless would have 

taken precisely the same action. That, to me, is the 

guts of -- of what -- of what this case is about.

 It's not about direct versus circumstantial 

evidence. It's about under what circumstances does the 

burden of proof shift? And -- and in a case like this 

where there's no assertion of an affirmative defense --

whereas, I think, Justice Stevens, in your situations, 

there were -- you know, most likely you would expect a 

defendant to say, I want to accept that burden because I 

think I can in fact prove something.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, but inevitably in 

these cases the employer is really -- whether he calls 

it an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular 

resistance to the plaintiff 's case, the issue is: Did 

-- would he have fired him anyway? And -- and if he --

if -- if that's what the jury believes, you can take 

Justice Breyer's view and say that's -- that's not a 

sufficient defense because they acted illegally.

 But if you are allowed that, you are saying 

notwithstanding the illegal motive, if you show that the 

real reason I fired him was unrelated to that, then the 

compelling reason, you win. And you win despite the 

fact that the process may have violated the statute.

 MR. PHILLIPS: There -- there is no question 

about that. And it is -- again, the only question is: 

Who bears the burden of proof? And what do you do with 

all of those decisions of this Court that say that 

the -- that the -- that the burden to -- to show that 

age, or whatever, was the determinative factor rests 

throughout on the plaintiff?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those weren't --

those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework. 

And what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive 

and say in a discrimination case there should be only 

one regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of 

persuasion from start to finish. But that's not what 

McDonnell Douglas did. It's not what the Eighth Circuit 

did, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up 

until the brief on the merits.

 So -- and you also said that Title VII is

out of it. The statute has taken care of it in 1991. 

Ms. Blatt, I heard her say distinctly that -- that Title 

VII would be affected. She urges us not to touch this 

question.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you have to go 

back to the -- to the question that Justice Alito posed 

actually, to say -- when -- when he asked her: How do 

you -- how much sense does it make to think about mixed 

motive versus other motive? Isn't it true that by the 

time the case gets to the jury everything is mixed 

motive, because there is going to be the claim that this 

was -- and this is a great illustration of that concept. 

There is a claim that age was the basis for the 

decision, and there is a claim that there are any of a 

thousand other possible reasons that are out there, and 

age just didn't happen to be one.

 And under those circumstances the question 

is: What's the reasonable way to proceed?

 Now, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize that we 

didn't raise this specifically in the brief in 

opposition. On the other hand, the reality is that the 

primary position that was taken by the other side was 

that this Court essentially can ignore or should 

overrule a portion of Price Waterhouse as a consequence 

of the -- of the intervening Costa decision.

And it seems to me under those 

circumstances, if you are going to put the issue of the 

validity of Price Waterhouse -- whatever it means -- at 

issue, then it seems to us a reasonable response on the 

merits to say, well, you shouldn't do it as -- as a --

in isolation. That that's a completely artificial 

inquiry, and you ought to take a step back and say, 

maybe we haven't gotten this right in the first place, 

particularly given the difficulty of the lower courts in 

trying to figure out exactly what Price Waterhouse 

means.

 Whose is the controlling opinion, and how do 

you allocate these burdens and under what circumstances? 

And given that the lower courts are in disarray, it 

would seem to me this is a situation where I don't know 

whether this is the best vehicle or the worst vehicle, 

but it is certainly an appropriate vehicle for the Court 

to step back and evaluate it.

 And if the Court is concerned about whether 

it has enough information to allow it to assess what 

would be the -- the significant impact of revising Price 

Waterhouse, then it seems to me the right answer would 

be to ask the parties to -- to brief that in addition to 

the way they briefed it at this stage. And now you 

simply throw up your hands.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I assume -- and I 

assume the government, because it would certainly be 

informative to know what the agency responsible for the 

administration of Title VII thinks of this question.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't disagree with 

that, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I don't think there are 

any -- any guidelines out there that speak directly to 

this specific question. But, obviously, to the extent 

that the Solicitor General could speak for the EEOC, 

that would -- I am not denying that that would -- that 

might be helpful. But I think what the -- what the 

Court needs to do is recognize that what it cannot --

what it should not do in this case is take the -- the 

very narrowest way of vacating and remanding. Because 

if it follows that course, nothing will move. Nothing 

will have been achieved by all the work that has been 

put into this case at this point, because the court of 

appeals didn't believe the difference was between direct 

and circumstantial evidence. And, therefore, the Court 

at some point is going to have to evaluate beyond the 

quality of the evidence what quantity of evidence is 

appropriate under the circumstances.

 It seems to me the Court has that in front 

of it. The jury instruction in this case shifted the 

burden way too early or on -- on way too little showing.

A part, a role, that's not enough to shift the burden 

under -- I don't even think under Justice White's 

version.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We can't -- I mean there is 

no question about quantitative evidence here.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is a question 

about the adequacy of the jury instruction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The adequacy of the jury 

instruction, but there isn't a question as to whether 

the issue should have gone to the jury in the first 

place. And I -- I think that --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. No, I don't -- there 

is no question that -- that -- well, there is a question 

on that. It's not before you. It's -- it's back in 

front of the Eighth Circuit.

 But there is still the issue of whether a 

motivating factor, meaning that it played a role, is a 

sufficient basis on which to trigger the -- the burden 

shifting instruction in this case. That -- that is the 

narrowest basis on which this Court could affirm by 

simply saying that Justice White's opinion requires a 

substantial showing. The instruction in this case 

clearly doesn't accomplish that, and, therefore, the 

Court should set that aside, or the Court should affirm 

the Eighth Circuit and remand so that the district court

 If there are no further questions, I'd urge 

the Court to affirm.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Now, Mr. Schnapper, two minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 We are in agreement with the government that 

the Court should decide the -- the narrow question 

presented and not revisit Price Waterhouse. If I might 

respond to the question from Justice Breyer -- and I am 

going to summarize to some extent materials which were 

referred to in footnote 18 of our reply brief.

 The Court ruled that there was a 

circumstance, very well established, which under tort 

law but-for causation was not the standard. And that 

was the situation in Cory versus Havener, which is the 

leading case in this area in which there were two 

causes, each sufficient to have brought about the 

result. And Cory was a case of two motorcyclists in 

district court.

 And the rule in those cases was that -- that 

either cause -- that the tort feasor involved with

either cause could be held liable.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Don't those cases involve 

two independent physical causes of an event, not the 

breaking down of human motivation into -- into separate 

factors?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's -- it's -- but 

it's the analogous area of tort law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What they are trying to 

say, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot 

about -- we have a human being who did certain acts. 

And we know this. We know that human being had a mix of 

motives and that the bad motive played a role. It was a 

motivating force. And that might be sufficient. It is 

under Title VII. And if you want to interpret this by 

Title VII, that's fine. That's the end of it.

 But then we are going to let someone off if 

we imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation. 

The hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there.

 Well, it's hard to prove what human beings 

would do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real 

situation. And I take it that's the reason we have 

imposed this burden upon the employer.

 Is there an analogy to that in tort law?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the problem that 

comes up with multiple causes is it is hard to

reconstruct what would happen. And there is a long line 

of cases, including a number of decisions by Learned 

Hand in 1938, one which we have cited, Transportation 

Management, in which the lower courts have agreed that 

where multiple factors are involved it's reasonable to 

put the burden on the defendant which -- of sorting it 

all out. And we think that is appropriate here.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
