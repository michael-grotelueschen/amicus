 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-6407, Panetti versus Quarterman.

 Mr. Wiercioch.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY W. WIERCIOCH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Fifth Circuit found that Scott Panetti 

suffers from paranoid delusions that cause him to 

believe that he is being executed because of a 

conspiracy against him and not as punishment for his 

crimes. Despite that finding, the Fifth Circuit held 

that Scott Panetti is competent to be executed because 

an inmate need not have a rational understanding of the 

reason for his execution but only be aware of it. This 

standard is a profound misreading of Ford versus 

Wainwright but before I address the merits of that 

issue, I would like to discuss two preliminary matters 

first.

 First, Scott Panetti's petition containing 

his execution competency claim is not second or 

successive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death 

Penalty Act. And second, the State court adjudication

of that claim resulted in a decision that was an 

unreasonable application of clearly established Federal 

law as determined by this Court.

 The first issue: This is not a second or 

successive petition.

 Martinez-Villareal recognized that a 

numerically second petition is not successive, it's not 

a mere mathematical computation, it's a term of art. 

And if you bring the claim the first time it's 

justiciable, it's not second or successive. Texas law 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I didn't understand 

that to be what the case said. I thought that the case 

held that it wasn't successive there because the claim 

had, in fact, been brought in the first petition, and 

that first petition was dismissed as premature. And the 

argument was made that this is just a continuation of 

that first petition.

 Now, the difference here is that the claim 

was not brought in the first petition, even though it 

was pretty clear after that case of ours that you had a 

sure route to raising the claim if you raised it 

prematurely, and then brought the petition later.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Your Honor, I think the 

difference is, or the central holding, I believe, of

Martinez-Villareal is that we do not bring these Ford 

claims until they are justiciable, until they're ripe. 

It's the unique nature of Ford claims. They are 

uniquely time specific.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you bring it earlier, 

it will be unripe. But it did, I think, leave open the 

precise procedural posture that we're in now. It didn't 

resolve that.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Martinez-Villareal did not 

resolve that question, Your Honor, that's correct.

 The other problem with the case, I think, is 

as you suggest, Justice Scalia, that there is a real 

danger that these claims could be adjudicated 

prematurely. And that has happened in the Fifth 

Circuit, a case that both the State and we have cited in 

our briefs, Valdez versus Cockrell. And that was a post 

Martinez-Villareal case.

 The other thing to keep in mind is that 

Texas law believes that these claims are premature as 

well. So it was premature under Martinez-Villareal, but 

it was also unexhausted and unexhaustible under Texas 

law. And I think what Martinez-Villareal and Texas 

recognize together is that these claims are most 

efficiently litigated at the end of the process, because 

of the unique nature of these claims.

The constitutional violation here is forward 

looking, unlike most constitutional habeas claims that 

are backward looking. And it's the State's setting of 

the date or making it imminent that triggers the 

violation, that it is now going to carry out the 

execution of someone who is potentially mentally 

incompetent.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The difference is that in 

Martinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this 

was not a second petition. Now you may be quite right, 

that there is good reason to say you shouldn't bring 

something that isn't ripe. But in that earlier case, we 

were able to get around the language of the statute 

which says a second or successive petition is not 

permissible.

 Here, how do you get around the language 

other than to say it shouldn't be that way, that you 

should be able to bring a second or successive petition 

when you're raising an issue that was not ripe at the 

time of the first petition?

 I mean, as a policy matter, that's a very 

good argument. But what do you do with the language in 

the statute? And after all, Congress is entitled to 

say -- to place limits upon our ability to review State 

court judgments.

MR. WIERCIOCH: My answer would be that the 

Court didn't make the mere mathematical calculation in 

Martinez-Villareal. That claim actually was raised 

twice. It was raised in the first petition, and it was 

raised in a second when it was ripe. We've only brought 

our Ford claim one time. We brought it when it was 

ripe, when the execution date was set. And I think 

that's the difference there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say a second run 

at the same claim. It says a second petition. Even if 

you bring new petitions in your second claim that 

weren't raised in your first, it's still a second or 

successive petition, and I find it hard to get over that 

language.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: The only thing I can say is 

that the claim in a sense doesn't even exist until the 

State is announcing its intention to carry out the 

execution in the near future by setting the date. And 

if we adopt the rule that the State wants, it's going to 

have, as in Martinez-Villareal, perverse and seemingly 

far-reaching consequences for habeas practice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it material to your 

position to show that there was deterioration in his 

mental condition between the time of the sentence and 

the time you brought the petition? I.e., the -- during

his incarceration, his condition worsened?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I think that is definitely 

part of it, Your Honor, but it also is the fact that we 

cannot predict with any reliability how severe mental 

illnesses are going to influence somebody's mental 

processes. And the nature of delusions themselves that 

fluctuate in intensity and severity, often influenced by 

life events, can have an impact on the inmate's ability 

to understand the reason for his execution.

 In this case it is, his delusion is wrapped 

up, it's central to it, as the reason he's being 

executed. And the intensity of his delusions or our 

ability to predict that is -- we can't do it until that 

event actually occurs, the event that's going to 

influence him, and that's the setting of the date.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why can't you have 

sought leave to file a second or successive application 

and met the requirements, if you're right that the 

factual predicate for the Ford claim doesn't arise until 

the execution is imminent?

 Couldn't you have fit your claim under 

2244(b)(2)(B), I guess, on that basis? And then we 

don't have to engage in the fiction that a second 

petition is actually not a second petition.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I don't think we could have

fit under that provision, Your Honor, because that 

provision requires that the evidence, established by 

clear and convincing evidence but for constitutional 

error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the 

applicant guilty of the underlying offense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it doesn't 

fit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument 

would be that -- guilty of -- we've used the concept of 

being guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty 

of the crime before, and the fact finder -- you wouldn't 

be sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you 

were incompetent. I appreciate that it's not the most 

comfortable fit, but at least the part -- it seems to be 

addressed to the question of a factual predicate that's 

not present at the time of the first habeas petition. 

And that seems to be your justification for not filing 

it at that time.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: That's part of the 

justification, but it's actually I think more than that, 

that the claim isn't justiciable, that the claim doesn't 

exist. I think it would be as if trying to force a 

petitioner to raise, who's attacking a sentence of a 

number of years, to raise in that petition deprivation 

of good time credits, that there would be no claim at 

that point for them to raise it. So it's the

justiciability, I think, is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. The point is 

that (b)(2)(B) is addressed to that precise situation 

where the facts aren't present when you file the first 

application.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: The facts aren't present, 

but the constitutional violation has already occurred, 

and I think that's got to be the difference.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The constitutional 

violation won't occur until the execution?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's prospective, as 

you said?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So your position basically 

is that "petition" hear means petition that could have 

been brought. This couldn't have because up to this 

point there was nothing that was justiciable; is that --

MR. WIERCIOCH: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the textual argument?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Yes, it is.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then if you get beyond the 

second or successive question, your next point was 

whether or not AEDPA applies?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the course of your 

argument, could you answer this: Suppose we find that 

the State did not comply with the mandate of Ford 

because it didn't give adequate procedures to the 

defendant, it did not give him an adequate opportunity 

to present his defense. Suppose we find that. I'm 

going to ask the same question of the State. Does that 

mean that the district court should then send it back to 

the State? Or is the district court at that point 

entitled and required to hold a new hearing on the 

substantive issue of Ford competency?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I would think it's the 

latter, Your Honor. The State would argue --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be within the 

discretion of the district court to send it back to the 

State? And say well, now you didn't give the correct 

procedures and that's -- an invalidity. So we're 

sending it back to you. Would the district court have 

discretion to do that?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I -- I would think not. I 

mean it's, the exhaustion remedy or the due process 

constitutional requirements were not met by the state 

court judge, and they had their opportunity. They 

didn't live up to the Ford procedures, and now we've had 

a full, constitutionally adequate procedure in Federal

court and we developed those facts. The only thing we 

really need now is a standard from this Court and we can 

send it back to the district court and apply that legal 

standard.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may be much harder for 

you to get that standard on this Court's review of a 

collateral proceeding than this Court's review of a 

state proceeding, because of AEDPA.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: But our contention is that 

the AEDPA does not prevent this Court from addressing 

the merits of the constitutional issue here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Because the State court did 

not abide by the minimum due process procedures set out 

by Justice Powell's opinion in Ford versus Wainwright, 

and that is the clearly established law even though it 

is a concurring opinion. He does not provide as much 

due process protections as Justice Marshall's plurality 

did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before we get too far into 

the merits --

MR. WIERCIOCH: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I, I'm not done about 

the jurisdiction yet. I wanted to ask you about the 

statement you made in response to a question; you said

it's not successive and it isn't a second petition if 

the first one could not have been brought. Right? If 

the first one was unripe?

 But we've just decided this term that that's 

not the rule. In Burden, we -- we -- we said that even 

though a first, an earlier petition was unripe, the 

second petition was still a second petition. So that 

can't be the principle that you're espousing, unless you 

want us to overrule Burton the same term.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: You don't have to overrule 

Burton, Your Honor. Burton is distinguishable; Burton 

had two or more petitions attacking the same custody of 

the same judgment. The nature of the Ford claim is not 

that we are telling the State that they cannot carry out 

the execution of Mr. Panetti. We are just saying they 

cannot carry it out under a limited set of 

circumstances.

 Mr. Burton, on the other hand, could have 

raised all of his claims at the same time, but he -- he 

went ahead and raised his conviction -- claims related 

to his conviction before he raised his claims related to 

his sentencing.

 If we had done that, if we had waited until 

the Ford claim was ripe, all of our usual type habeas 

claims would have been lost under the statute of

limitations. That would not have been the case in 

Burton.

 To get back to your question, 

Justice Kennedy, the problem here -- let me just say, 

the essential language of Justice Powell's decision on 

the minimum due process requirements is that, number 

one, an impartial decision-maker is required; and 

secondly, that decision-maker has to have the ability to 

hear argument and receive evidence from prisoner's 

counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may 

differ from the State's own psychiatric examinations.

 That boils down to exactly what we didn't 

have here. Now the key point is when the State's or the 

court's appointed experts went to evaluate Mr. Panetti, 

new issues were raised; and those are the issues, they 

were determinative issues, that we didn't have an 

opportunity to respond to. What happened is when they 

went to see Mr. Panetti, they characterized his behavior 

as filibustering about the Bible, answering questions 

with Biblical verses, refusing to answer questions until 

they told him whether or not they were Christians. They 

took all of those behaviors to mean that Mr. Panetti was 

controlling, manipulating and deliberately refusing to 

answer questions, leading them to the conclusion that 

Mr. Panetti was competent and he was just malingering.

That is exactly the type of evidence that we 

were not able to respond to. We asked in a number of 

ways throughout the State court proceedings to the trial 

judge, please, give us an opportunity of some sort to 

address the issues, to make this proceeding fair. And 

these -- these procedures that we asked for included 

cross-examination at a hearing and also funds to hire 

our own defense expert.

 It's important to point out that our pro 

bono attorney who -- I'm sorry, our pro bono expert who 

did an emergency evaluation two days before the 

execution, was not a constitutionally adequate 

procedure. The reason is clear. The State 

court-appointed attorneys -- I'm sorry, experts, had not 

yet been appointed, and they had not yet done their 

evaluation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: These -- these were not 

appointed by the prosecutor; they were appointed by the 

court?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Am I right?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that's 

inadequate. We have to have a full adversarial trial of 

psychiatric experts in every case where a prisoner

claims that he's not mentally competent to be executed.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I respectfully disagree, 

Your Honor. We do not have to have that. What we do 

have to have in a situation like ours where there is a 

new issue that is brought up by the charges of, 

basically malingering, that we have got to have an 

opportunity to respond to those charges, and engage that 

issue; and we were not able to engage that issue; and we 

asked for intermediate steps.

 The other thing to keep in mind, Your Honor, 

is that the Texas procedure itself allows for a hearing. 

That's how they comport with Ford. So we're not asking 

the Court to overrule Texas's procedures. What happened 

here is a maverick judge decided not to follow the 

statute. And so it was specifically to our case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me, and 

there's nothing in our history that requires, that you 

need a full dress trial to decide this issue. And it 

seems to me perfectly reasonable for the trial court to 

appoint experts, not selected by the prosecutor but 

selected by the judge, and have them conduct the -- the 

examination of the individual.

 I, I certainly don't want to -- you know --

a full dress trial on this issue in every case. And I, 

I don't know anything in our, in our tradition of due

process that requires it.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: And we're not asking for 

that, Your Honor. We're asking for something 

intermediate to that. It could have, like I said, it 

could have been resolved by having the opportunity to 

have our own expert especially in a situation where new 

issues are raised.

 I would contrast that with a situation where 

our pro bono expert had sent out a report; we overcame 

the threshold showing that was necessary; two mental 

health experts are appointed under the statute, and 

those experts addressed our experts' report and didn't 

raise any new issues, didn't bring anything new into the 

mix, but what was brought into the mix here is the 

malingering charge.

 And I should add --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- you did have 

your own expert, though? You had one expert of your 

own, right? No?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: We had a pro bono expert --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well.

anymore after that initial threshold showing that we 

made. And I'd like to point out that our position was 

vindicated when we finally did get constitutionally 

adequate procedures. Because what happened was this 

Federal district court judge found that Scott Panetti 

does suffer from a mental illness and it is 

significantly characterized by a delusional belief 

system in which he believes himself to be persecuted for 

his religious activities and beliefs. So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your position is that the 

affidavit submitted to the district court by the 

psychiatrists are sufficient to vindicate your 

substantive position that he cannot be executed under 

Ford?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: That's right. We had a full 

hearing. So we did more than just submit affidavits 

from our experts. But that did vindicate our position, 

Your Honor, yes.

 I'd like to turn now to the merits. The 

test for competency that we have proposed is derived 

directly from Justice Powell's test that he set out in 

his concurrence in Ford versus Wainwright.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This very important matter 

is going to be decided on the basis of the opinion of 

one, one justice, what, 30 years ago?

MR. WIERCIOCH: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have no other appeal to 

a long tradition of how we determine this matter, but 

just one opinion by one justice because he was the 

lowest common denominator on the Court at that time. 

That seems to me very peculiar.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: That's not what Justice 

Powell did. I mean, what happened in Ford is that the 

Court did look at all of the common law rationales for 

the ban, the common law ban on executing the 

incompetent. And those rationales were also set out in 

Justice Powell's opinion, and they -- the Court -- a 

majority of this Court agreed with certain of those 

rationales.

 The two rationales being that execution of 

the mentally incompetent does not further the 

retributive goal of capital punishment, and secondly, 

that it's simply cruel to execute someone who does not 

have the ability to take comfort of understanding, to 

prepare spiritually and mentally for his passing.

 So the basis for this standard --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you maybe 

elaborate on that? And mean if you have someone who is 

competent at the time they're convicted, competent at 

the time they're sentenced, and you say they're walking

to the gurney to be executed, you know, they fall and 

hit their head and they don't understand it, it's 

somehow very cruel to go forward with the execution at 

that point, while it wouldn't have been before?

 I -- it seems to me, I mean, obviously 

competence at the trial and sentencing is important. I 

just don't understand the concept that it has to 

continue to the point of execution.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I think that's the very 

nature of the Ford right, that it is something that 

intervenes. We're not saying that Scott Panetti was not 

fully culpable, found guilty, sentenced to death; we're 

not attacking that at all. Something happened. And 

what happened was he did lose the ability to understand 

rationally the connection between his crime --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well does he 

understand why he's being imprisoned? I mean, does 

this, the Ford right extend to prison? Is it cruel to 

keep someone locked up for life when they don't 

understand why they're being locked up for life?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I think that would be a 

different situation, Your Honor, because number one, we 

don't have a common law heritage stretching back a 

thousand years to prevent the incapacitation or the 

incarceration of the mentally incompetent. And I think

the difference also is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't have 

incarceration.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't have 

incarceration extending back a thousand years. We -- we 

had misdemeanors and felonies, all of which were 

punishable by death.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: The -- the difference, 

though, I think, is if you're going to incarcerate 

somebody or incapacitate them, we're not concerned with 

their mental state. All we are trying to do at that 

point is deter them from committing other crimes. So I 

don't think it's the same situation here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's an 

element of retribution to imprisonment, just as there is 

to capital punishment. Both deterrence and retribution 

in both instances, I would have thought.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: In capital punishment, yes, 

but I guess I'm responding to your hypothetical, a 

person who is sentenced to life in prison who is 

mentally incompetent, and I would think that the main 

goal there is incapacitation, deterrence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How far does your argument 

go? If the defendant thinks the State or the jury had

some ulterior motive for his sentence, is that 

sufficient to -- to -- mean -- does that mean the person 

doesn't have a rational understanding of the reason for 

the death sentence?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: No, Your Honor, it doesn't.

 I think the key point here is that the 

person must be suffering from a mental illness; and it 

is that mental illness that has to deprive the person of 

his capacity to understand the connection between his 

crime and his punishment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me ask you 

this specific question. Let's assume that the 

individual understands that both the necessary and the 

sufficient condition for his execution was his 

conviction of the crime. He also believes that they 

probably wouldn't actually execute him except that they 

are persecuting him, in this case for his Christian 

advocacy.

 Does that person who understands the 

necessary and sufficient condition for execution, but 

believes something else is afoot in the motivations of 

those who are going to execute him, does that person 

have a -- what you call a rational understanding such 

that he may be executed?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I would say that person does

not. And the reason being if the person in your 

hypothetical is suffering from a mental illness, and 

these mental illnesses are very small fraction of the 

type that include delusions, distortions in thought 

content, distortions in perception, distortions in 

thinking, that those very things prevent them from being 

reasoned out of their delusion by the facts that you've 

suggested.

 If they take those facts, such as Scott 

Panetti, that he knows the State's purported reason for 

his execution, but that's not good enough.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's more than -- in my 

hypothetical, it's more than a purported reason. He 

understands what the law is. The law is if you're 

convicted of this crime, that enough -- is that -- that 

will -- and sentenced to death at the penalty phase, 

that is alone sufficient and in fact a required 

condition for your execution.

 Why can't that person, even though he thinks 

some ulterior motivation is what's really driving the 

executioner, why can't that person prepare for death 

just as well as the -- I won't say just as well, but why 

can that person not prepare for death just as he would 

prepare for death if he were not suffering from the 

persecution delusion?

MR. WIERCIOCH: I think the difference in 

your hypothetical has to be, Your Honor, that it's the 

crime itself. It's not the conviction. It's the crime, 

that this person has a rational understanding to connect 

his crime to his punishment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you claim in this 

case that he does not understand that he was convicted 

of committing a crime or that he thinks he didn't commit 

a crime?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: No, not that he does not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's the case, then 

every person who believes he's innocent of the crime is 

at least a candidate for the rule that you're asking 

for.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I would disagree, Your 

Honor. The difference is that again it has to be the 

product of a mental illness, and then that mental 

illness has to deprive the person of that capacity. So 

if it's somebody who just thinks they've been --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One problem with a mental 

illness that is a peculiar feature of this case, in 

other cases something different is introduced late. It 

wasn't ripe. It wasn't there before. But here you have 

an individual who has a severe mental impairment. He 

had it before he committed these murders. He's had it

when he was -- when there was the original competency to 

see if he could stand trial.

 He had it all along. It may have manifested 

itself with different delusions at different times. And 

yet at every stage he says he's incompetent to stand 

trial. They hold he is competent to stand trial. Then 

he says, well, I'm competent, so I want to represent 

myself. The judge says, yeah, you're able to represent 

yourself, you're competent.

 Every -- this is not anything new that has 

happened to him. He has been in this delusional state 

all along. And now to say at this point it counts, but 

at other points it didn't?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I think the difference has 

to be, Your Honor, that, yes, he has suffered from a 

delusion for 20 years and that's the spiritual warfare 

between himself and the devil. But the delusion takes 

on a different form in the sense of when his execution 

date was approaching it's now the culmination of this 

battle between himself and Satan, and that is something 

that we can't predict with any sort of reliability years 

in advance of the date. He didn't get his first date 

until four years after his first Federal petition was 

filed.

 If there are no more questions --

Is that what you're saying?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I wouldn't say that the 

delusion itself is changing. I mean, the delusion is 

there, but it's taken a specific form of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's taken a specific 

form because the circumstance is different. He was 

being tried yesterday. He's going to be executed today. 

But it's the same delusion, and it seems to me that 

Justice Ginsburg's issue is a kind of a proper issue 

even though the event on which he focuses has changed.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: That's true, Your Honor. 

But again, I don't think we can predict that with any 

reliability because of the nature of delusions, the 

severity, the intensity fluctuating; that until that 

event, until that execution date is set and is imminent 

there is no reliable way of predicting how it's going to 

affect his thinking, how it's going to affect his 

ability.

MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For centuries courts have struggled with how 

to reconcile mental illness with criminal justice. In 

this case, however, the court should not reach the 

merits of that issue because the AEDPA presents two 

independent jurisdictional bars to reaching the merits. 

First, Section 2254 bars relief because the State court 

proceedings complied with clearly established law under 

Ford; and second, the plain text of Section 2244 bars 

relief because Panetti's claim was a second or 

successive habeas application.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How should he have 

raised the claim to avoid the second or successive bar?

 MR. CRUZ: He could have raised it in 

precisely the same way the petitioner did in 

Martinez-Villareal. He could have raised it in the 

first Federal habeas application. It would have been 

dismissed as unripe. And given -- following the Court's 

majority opinion in Martinez-Villareal, that claim could 

then be reopened at what time it did become ripe.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that's a silly 

fiction. You're not reopening a claim. We can use any 

kind of language we want. The fact is that when he 

first raised it he didn't have a claim which bore a

close enough relationship to the time of execution. 

When he was able to raise the claim that bore enough of 

a relationship, it was a freestanding claim itself.  It 

seems to me that to say, well, he's simply reopening 

something that he reopened before is just playing with 

words.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Souter, I don't disagree 

with you that as a policy matter it's not the most 

satisfactory outcome. The difficulty -- and it's the 

difficulty this Court wrestled with in 

Martinez-Villareal -- is the plain text of the statute 

suggests a clear outcome, an outcome that is not 

necessarily the most practical or efficient.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you can deal with 

the text of this. I mean, given the fact that there's 

no neat satisfactory solution to this no matter where we 

turn, the -- at least the text of the statute can be 

read to say that second successive petition at least 

means a petition when it raises -- refers to a petition 

in which a claim could previously have been brought. 

And if we say, look, unripe claims can't be brought at 

an earlier time, then it's not a second and successive 

petition in that sense. That's one way to you know --

admittedly, it's interpretive, but it's one way to deal 

with the text. It's kind of a -- it seems to me more

forthright than saying, well, he's just continuing or 

reviving the claim that he raised the first time around.

 MR. CRUZ: In our judgment that reading is 

not consistent with the plain text of the statute.

 The only two bases that Petitioner could 

legitimately advance for disregarding the plain text are 

that doing so would be absurd following the plain text 

or unconstitutional. He has attempted to advance 

neither. He's simply arguing it would be more 

efficient.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: More than that, the section 

goes on to make an exception from the bar of second or 

successive. The exception itself is a situation in 

which he could not have raised it earlier, namely he can 

get out of the bar if he shows that the claim relies on 

a new rule of constitutional law, which he couldn't have 

raised before, or the factual predicate didn't exist 

before, which he couldn't have raised before.

 All of those exceptions would be unnecessary 

if we interpret the provision itself to contain within 

it an exception for anything that couldn't have been 

raised before.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, I think that's 

exactly correct.

indication from those two exceptions that Congress 

simply wasn't adverting to this problem?

 MR. CRUZ: Congress may not have been -- I 

don't doubt that there is a real possibility Congress in 

drafting this statute was not specifically considering 

Ford claims. But what Congress was doing was writing 

into law a general principle that every claim a habeas 

petitioner has that petition must include in his first 

petition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Has. Has. He doesn't have 

the claim at that first point.

 MR. CRUZ: Well, but given the exceptions, 

also every claim he intends to raise at any point in the 

proceeding. In this case, Panetti was on full notice. 

He had been arguing about competency from day one and he 

had not only Martinez-Villareal which gave him a direct 

path to preserve this, but he had Fifth Circuit 

precedent that required him to raise this and he 

disregarded the Fifth Circuit --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You in effect are telling 

us that we've got to read this to mean that any claim 

that he could conceivably have under any set 

of conceivable circumstances has got to be raised on the 

first petition with these two exceptions, and that in 

effect is a formula for frivolous pleading and, I mean,

Congress couldn't have intended that.

 MR. CRUZ: Congress intended that this 

statute be followed in order to have Federal district 

court jurisdiction over claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This would mean that in 

every first Federal habeas, no matter how farfetched, 

every single Federal petitioner has to bring a Ford 

claim. Otherwise he won't have it at the end of the 

road. Has to burden the district judge with this that 

is frivolous because it's so far premature. But that's 

what you're saying, Congress -- the statute can be read 

only that way, to say that the Ford claim has to be made 

even when there's no basis for it, even though it 

couldn't be handled by the district judge.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that 

is the way the Court found in Martinez-Villareal, to 

harmonize Ford claims with 2244.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's your opinion, then, 

how this is supposed to work? A person has been on 

death row for ten years, perfectly sane, no problem. 

He's going to be executed next month. Tomorrow he 

becomes catatonic, absolutely insane, no doubt about it, 

and now it is unconstitutional to execute such a person. 

Nobody denies that. All right, now what's supposed to 

happen?

because I didn't memorize every page. I read it. So 

what's your opinion how that works?

 MR. CRUZ: Under the plain text of the 

statute, that individual would be barred access to 

Federal district court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So your opinion is -- and 

then is that constitutional, if in fact Congress passes 

a statute and says there will be no court review of a 

person who clearly the Constitution forbids to execute, 

the State to execute him. Nobody doubts that. Nobody 

doubts this is an unconstitutional execution, but there 

will be no court review of a decision to the contrary. 

Is that constitutional?

 MR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Breyer, 

that's not our position, because Texas State law --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know that's not --

MR. CRUZ: -- provides court review, and so 

that individual could raise a claim in State court, and

the State proceeding does not require that it had been 

raised previously, and this Court would have certiorari 

jurisdiction over any decision from Federal -- from 

State Court rejecting that claim. So there is court 

review in addition to original habeas actions filed 

before this Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Constitution doesn't 

require Federal district court review.

 MR. CRUZ: That's correct. The Constitution 

doesn't require Federal district courts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, I got that. So 

should we treat this petition as if it's one for 

original habeas here?

 MR. CRUZ: The Court court do see.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? Why not? 

Because we have, after all, a claim that the Fifth 

Circuit has as a general matter misapplied the standard 

of this Court's cases as to what counts as insanity for 

purposes of the Constitution. Now, you say this blocks 

it, but it doesn't block a direct writ for habeas, so 

why not? It's an important general question. Someone 

may be executed whom the Constitution forbids to have 

executed. Why not?

that?

 MR. CRUZ: Yes, we would.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. CRUZ: Because the Court has made clear 

that the standards for an original habeas corpus are 

particularly exacting and are informed by the 

legislation Congress has passed governing habeas, and in 

particular Section 2254. Section 2254 in our judgment 

provides the simplest and clearest path to resolve this 

case, and it doesn't resolve dealing with legislation 

that admittedly is in some tension with the most 

practical and efficient course.

 Section 2254 requires that in 2004, at the 

time of the State court proceedings, that the only way 

that the judgment can be set aside is if it was contrary 

to clearly established law by this Court. In our 

judgment, no fair reading of Ford can yield such an 

outcome.

 Panetti points to two aspects of the State 

court hearing that he finds fault with: First, that it 

was not a live evidentiary hearing; and second that the 

State did not appoint a psychiatrist for him and pay for 

it. Neither of those are consistent with the holdings 

of Ford. With respect to the first point, no 

evidentiary hearing, Justice Powell's controlling

concurrence was explicit. Ordinary adversarial 

procedures complete with live testimony, 

cross-examination, and oral argument by counsel are not 

necessarily the best means.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't know that he's 

disputing that. I thought his dispute was there's got 

to be some means for us to respond to what was a new 

issue as a result of the reports of the two 

court-appointed experts, the issue of malingering.

 And I don't know that he's saying it's got 

to come in one way or another way, but there's got to be 

a means at least to respond to that new issue. What's 

your answer to that?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Souter, there was a 

means. In fact, the State court explicitly invited him 

to respond. He did in fact respond. He filed a 20-page 

objection, a detailed objection.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You gave him one week and 

there were no funds for his own psychiatrist.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, that's correct, 

but that leads to the second argument that the State 

should have paid for a psychiatrist. That may perhaps 

make sense as a prospective rule, but to do so would 

require extending the rule of eight to habeas, to which 

it has never been extended, and extending it in

particular to competency hearing on execution. That 

would be a new rule under Teague, and the plurality in 

Ford explicitly suggested extending Ake to these 

circumstances, and Justice Powell did not join that 

proposition. And so in my judgment, there is no fair 

way to read Ford to say a plurality that didn't control 

clearly established a holding that Ake extended to the 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You do agree that Ford 

stands for the proposition that there must be a hearing 

that meets the essentials of fairness so that the 

defendant can contradict the hearings that -- the 

conclusions of the State-appointed psychiatrist?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, I would frame 

the holding a little more narrowly, and I would use 

Justice Powell's words because his was the controlling 

concurrence. And what he said is, "The State should 

provide an impartial officer aboard that can receive 

evidence and argument from the prisoner's counsel." And 

so "receive," I would suggest is the critical word 

there.

 The Ford situation was very strange. In 

Florida the governor had refused to accept any 

submissions from counsel, said I won't read anything 

your psychiatrist submits. That was the principal

failing Ford focused on. In this case the district 

court asked for a response, received a 20-page written 

response, received an expert psychiatric report that was 

obtained by counsel. On any level, it satisfied the 

holding of Ford.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There's also the 

substantive part, that is, I think there's also an 

argument that the district court here, and the court of 

appeals, applied not just Justice Powell, but Marshall's 

even stronger, and they took -- they say about the same 

thing in Ford, I didn't see much of a difference, but if 

there is, take Powell.

 And it seems to say, the Fifth Circuit 

following, that if you can answer the question yes, 

prisoner, are you being executed? Yes. What does that 

mean? I'll die. And why are you? Because I committed 

a murder. That that's the end of it. And they say 

explicitly, it doesn't matter if the next thing the 

prisoner says and the reason that's going to happen is 

because of the wild dogs. You say, what do you mean? 

The wild dogs are manipulating the minds of all of the 

State officials, all the witnesses, because I'm a victim 

of the wild dogs forever. And you have 15 psychiatrists 

and they absolutely prove that's what he thinks, and he 

thinks that this is all about dogs.

Now should he have that delusional system, 

as I read the Fifth Circuit and the district court, that 

happens to be irrelevant as to whether he is insane and 

can't be executed. Now I can't read Powell and Marshall 

as saying that, so they're saying it's clearly contrary 

to Powell and Marshall, that sounds like a substantive 

claim, and they say correct the Fifth Circuit please.

 What about that one?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, the argument that 

you suggest, Panetti has at no point made an argument 

that substantively the State court decision violated 

clearly established law. And there's a reason for that. 

Because there is no clearly established law on what the 

standard is for competency. In Ford, there was one 

justice writing alone, because Justice Powell was not 

joined by anyone, and his opinion was not controlling on 

the standard for incompetency. It was solely --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I did understand 

counsel's argument to say that relief must be given, he 

cannot be executed, if he lacks the capacity to form a 

rational understanding of the nature and justification 

for the punishment. You, I take it, would agree that if 

we can just use the lay term, you cannot execute an 

insane person if he is grossly psychotic, and you can't 

execute a comatose person?

MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, we agree with 

the proposition that executing the insane is 

unconstitutional. That was a holding of Ford.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we're talking about 

what insane means, and that's a lay term. So suppose 

there's a gross psychosis which is a severe 

disorientation from reality and from rationality, and he 

cannot understand, and he lacks the capacity to 

understand the nature and the justification for his 

punishment.

 MR. CRUZ: That test is very close to the 

test the State proposes. What Panetti is endeavoring to 

do is to incorporate into the test rational 

understanding, which is deliberately borrowed from the 

Fifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence concerning 

competency to waive counsel and to stand trial, and we 

would suggest is a standard wholly inappropriate to this 

circumstance.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you went back. 

You see, you say it's just Justice Powell. But Marshall 

said for the Court, today we explicitly recognize that 

it has been, for centuries, is abhorrent to exact in 

penance the life of one whose mental illness prevents 

him from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or 

its implications.

So that sounds like a stronger statement 

than Powell. So you add Marshall to Powell, and you get 

a court.  It isn't just Powell. And I agree with you 

that I don't know that that standard you just enunciated 

about the rational one is the right test. Maybe the 

right test is just to repeat these words from Powell or 

some others. But I think their claim is whatever that 

is, the Fifth Circuit's been using the wrong test.

 MR. CRUZ: In this case, Panetti satisfies 

that test.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That may be. So maybe the 

thing to do is to send the case back to the Fifth 

Circuit and say you've been using the wrong test, this 

is the right test. Do it again.

 MR. CRUZ: There's no reason to do so. 

Because the district court's factual findings 

demonstrate conclusively that Panetti meets the 

appropriate test for competency to be executed. The 

district court found that Panetti understands he 

committed these two murders. He knows that he murdered 

two people. He understand that he is going to be put to 

death.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's different from 

having a rational capacity to understand the nature and 

justification for the punishment. I think it is. I

would conclude it's a fair conclusion from the 

psychiatrist's affidavits and from their testimony, that 

he knows he committed a crime, he knows he's being 

punished, and he's going to be executed for that crime. 

But it stops there. The delusions prevent his 

understanding.

 MR. CRUZ: Well, it extends a little further 

than there in that the test that Panetti possess 

rational understanding is found nowhere in any holding 

from this Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about just 

repeating -- see, what is worrying me is that the 

district court said precisely what the Fifth Circuit 

said, indeed stronger. It says, "Despite the fact that 

petitioner's understanding of the reason was impaired by 

delusions," the Fifth Circuit concluded that that didn't 

matter. Now, that means he is applying the same test in 

the district court that then the Fifth Circuit applied.

 What would you think about our just quoting 

the language from the Supreme Court opinions and say 

this is the language of the test. We can't do better 

than that. Go apply it.

 MR. CRUZ: As an initial matter, I do not 

believe the Court has jurisdiction to reach it because 

of 2254, because of the proceedings that on any level

comply with clearly established holdings from Ford. The 

only way Panetti gets there is by extending Ake to these 

proceeding, and no court holding has ever so done.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I really do need your help 

on a procedural part of AEDPA. Let's assume -- I know 

that you don't agree with it -- let's assume that the 

State erred because it gave inadequate procedures to the 

defendant with reference to the adjudication of 

competency to be executed. Let's assume that.

 Would the district court have had 

discretion, if it made that finding, to send the case 

back to the State court to have new proceedings?

 MR. CRUZ: Yes. And Justice Kennedy, I 

agree with you. And in fact, under AEDPA --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was asking the question. 

So don't agree with me.

 MR. CRUZ: I agree with you that the better 

course if the district court had concluded that would 

have been to send it back to the State court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it had discretion to 

do that?

 MR. CRUZ: I don't believe the district 

court had discretion --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. Assuming he made 

that finding.

MR. CRUZ: I believe he had to do that. I 

don't believe he had discretion. I believe that's what 

the district court had to do, because Section (e)(2)(B) 

of AEDPA, which is the proceedings, the rules governing 

when the district court can hold an evidentiary hearing, 

require the exact same thing that 2244 requires, namely 

that the claim go to the underlying guilt of the 

offense.

 So I don't believe the district court had 

the authority under AEDPA to hold an evidentiary 

hearing. If the district court concludes the 

proceedings didn't satisfy Ford, the remedy would to be 

send that back.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do if there's 

incompetency of counsel in a routine, not a death case, 

incompetency of counsel, and the district court finds 

incompetency of counsel? It then goes ahead and he 

hears all of the issues that a competent counsel would 

have addressed, or it sends back to the State court?

 MR. CRUZ: In that circumstance, if the 

underlying failure, the unconstitutional action, is a 

failure to provide enough proceedings in a State court, 

I agree with your suggestion that the better course of 

action, the course consistent with AEDPA, is to send it 

back to the State court to provide that procedure.

But even if this Court thinks prospectively 

that extending Ake to these circumstances is a good 

rule, there is not a word in Ford that so holds.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Cruz, may I just go 

back to the suggestion that there be, in effect, a 

remand to the State court. If we accept that 

proposition, then we are turning the United States 

district court in effect into an appellate court 

reviewing the State judgment and the State action, and 

that certainly is not what habeas is.

 MR. CRUZ: That is not the case, and in fact 

AEDPA provides the Federal district court can hold an 

evidentiary hearing and consider new facts if the claim 

goes to the underlying guilt of the offense.

 This particular --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it's acting, it's 

acting in its own right. Some of the factual record 

that it must be concerned with is determined by what 

happened in the State courts; but it's not reviewing the 

State court as an appellate court would do. But if it 

can remand and say, you didn't do enough for whatever 

reason, it seems to me it's exercising the equivalent of 

appellate jurisdiction.

 MR. CRUZ: Technically speaking, the way 

Federal district courts do this is they issue the writ

conditioned, conditional upon the district court 

holding, or the State court holding the hearing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure.

 MR. CRUZ: And so I don't disagree with you 

that it's functioning not that different from an 

appellate court, but through the formalism of issuing a 

conditional writ.

 Turning to the merits or returning to the 

merits, there was a square factual finding that Panetti 

knows that he's been sentenced to death for committing 

these murders, and an additional factual finding that he 

has the capacity to understand the reason for that. The 

district court didn't resolve whether he, in fact, 

understands the reason for it, although the State court 

did. The State court explicitly concluded that he in 

fact understands the reason.

 The circumstance we have here is exactly the 

circumstance suggested by Justice Souter's hypothetical. 

You have an individual who knows he committed a crime, 

knows he's going to die, knows that he is -- the State 

is going to execute him because he committed the crime, 

but he doesn't believe that reason. He at least asserts 

he believes something else is going on.

 But nothing in this Court's precedents or 

nothing in the principles behind the Eighth Amendment

require a prisoner to believe the State's motivation. 

It is enough that he is able to prepare to die, and the 

central focus Justice Powell focused on was the ability 

to prepare oneself to die. Panetti knows he's going to 

be put to death.

 There's an exchange in the record with 

respect to one of his experts where he was talking about 

other executions. And in particular he goes through 

with Dr. Mary Alice Conroy on page 148 of the joint 

appendix, he's talking about what happens when other 

people are executed. And he says, you know, well, they 

go to be executed and then sometimes they get a stay, 

and when they get a stay they come back, and when they 

don't get a stay, well, then they go on either to be 

with the lord or someplace too horrible to talk about.

 And his understanding of that is in marked 

contrast to Alvin Ford's. Alvin Ford is the simplest 

and clearest metric to compare an individual defendant. 

Alvin Ford didn't know he was going to be executed. He 

was unaware of what was going on. And this Court 

concluded in Ford that it was cruel and irrational to 

subject someone who had no idea what was coming to the 

death penalty.

 Here Panetti knows he's going to die and he 

also knows he's guilty. So in terms of preparing for

death, he can make his peace with the lord, he can make 

his peace with the victim's family, he can prepare for 

death. He may in fact not believe the State's reasons, 

although it's worth noting that no court has ever so 

held. What the Federal district court said is that his 

experts state that he doesn't believe the reasons. But 

on the other side, no fewer than six different 

professional psychiatrists have concluded that Panetti 

is deliberately exaggerating his symptoms, that he is 

malingering, that he's acting bizarre in order to appear 

more insane.

 And that presents a very difficult factual 

question. What do you do with someone who plainly has 

some mental illness, but at the same time whom six 

psychiatrists who have studied him, in some cases for 

years, who have treated him for years, six professional 

psychiatrists come in and tell the district court this 

individual is exaggerating? That is an incredibly 

difficult factual matter. The only way our system can 

deal with it is to let the factfinder hear the competing 

experts and make a judgment.

 In this case, the Federal district court 

concluded that the evidence of malingering, quote, 

"casts doubt on the extent of Panetti's mental illness 

and symptoms." And that's at page 363 of the joint

appendix.

 Rather than resolve the question whether he 

in fact doesn't believe the State's reasons, what the 

district court said is the Constitution doesn't require 

that he believe the State's reasons. The Constitution 

simply requires that he know what is happening, that he 

understand what is happening.

 The test we have proposed focusing on two 

things. One, capacity, which Panetti now agrees; and 

the second thing we suggest is the test should be 

whether a defendant can recognize he's going to die and 

the reason. And "recognize," we submit is consistent 

with the words Justice Powell used, Justice Powell used 

the words "understand," "aware of," and "perceive."

 And so recognize was our attempt to capture 

what Justice Powell was talking about. It is less than 

rational understanding, it is less than the full panoply 

of being able to make all the litigation decisions one 

is required, say, to waive counsel; because as Panetti 

concedes in his reply brief, there are no strategic 

decisions remaining to be made. At the time of 

execution, all that remains is for him to make peace and 

move on so that the State may execute a justly entered 

sentence.

 That test, we submit, is entirely consistent

with this Court's precedents. It furthers both 

retribution and deterrence. One point on deterrence. 

The test Panetti points out really invites abuse. 

Because rational understanding is -- is a standard that, 

particularly when you think about mental illness and the 

ability through medications of an individual to 

affirmatively decide to stop taking medications and 

exacerbate his symptom, it invites real abuse. Because 

rational standard we would -- or rational understanding 

we would suggest is too high of a standard.

 In our prisons there are unfortunately a 

great many people suffering from some degree of mental 

illness. At some level that's unsurprising. If you 

look at the DSM-IV definition of sociopathy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your experience and in 

your present position, have you seen many condemned 

people with the symptoms as severe as this defendant?

 MR. CRUZ: We -- we have litigated cases 

where people have raised Ford claims. In fact one of 

the ones we recently litigated involved an individual 

who was convinced he was on death row and being executed 

because there was a conspiracy of Jews and homosexuals 

that was out to get them -- out to get him. That sort 

of delusion unfortunately is not uncommon on death row 

and it is not uncommon in prisons for paranoia -- the

testimony of one of Panetti's experts, Doctor Conroy 

said, quote, "The major portion of our population in our 

in-patient units are diagnosed with some form of 

schizophrenia."

 If you think of sociopathy, which is defined 

as -- quote -- under the DSM-IV, "a lack of regard for 

moral or legal standards in the local culture." It is 

unsurprising that people that have a lack of regard for 

right and wrong, a lack of regard for others' lives, 

frequently commit crimes in which they murder and injure 

other people.

 And yet our criminal justice system is 

predicated upon holding people to account unless they 

meet the standards for legal insanity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't suppose you have 

statistics of how many have been sentenced to death and 

have later been found incompetent?

 MR. CRUZ: We have endeavored to compile 

those statistics and that has been -- we don't have any 

for the court. One difficulty is in practice sometimes 

the State will not seek death. Often these are 

unreported decisions across the State. So unfortunately 

we don't have those statistics, although we did endeavor 

to compile them.

 If there are no further questions?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY W. WIERCIOCH

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. WIERCIOCH: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Thank you.

 The, the only point I'd like to make is 

we're talking about a very narrow fraction of serious 

mental illnesses here. We're talking about people who 

have distortions in thought content, distortions in 

perception, distortions in their thinking processes. 

This is not the vast majority of people on death row, 

and it is, certainly, I have seen no one as mentally ill 

as Scott Panetti. There are very few people that would 

be compared to him.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How would you phrase the 

test to determine how severe the mental illness has to 

be?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I think it has to be a 

mental illness -- again I would come back to the fact 

that the mental illness has to deprive the person of the 

capacity to make that rational understanding, and that's 

why delusional behavior is crucial in most of these

cases to depriving that person of the capacity. Because 

even if you tell the person they're being executed for 

the crimes they've committed, that is not enough to talk 

them out of their delusion. It is not enough to reason 

them out of their delusion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Rational understanding of 

what? That's -- that's the problem. Rational 

understanding of what. The State says he has rational 

understanding of the fact that he is going to die, and 

the reason he is going to die.

 Now, what -- what beyond that do you insist 

he have a rational understanding of?

 MR. WIERCIOCH: He has to have a rational 

understanding that he is being executed precisely 

because of the crime that he committed. He -- the 

district court never found that he had that. That he 

had an understanding or that he was aware of the State's 

it's stated reason for his execution, and that stated 

reason becomes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so if he, if 

he firmly believes for whatever reason that he's 

innocent, then he can't be executed under your test.

 MR. WIERCIOCH: I would disagree Your Honor. 

What it is is if he is suffering from a mental illness 

that deprives him of that capacity. So someone with
