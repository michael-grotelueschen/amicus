3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez, 

and the consolidated case. 

6  Ms. Kruger. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Under section 1229b of Title 8, an alien who 

12 has not been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 

13 years, or who has not continuously resided in the United 

14 States for at least 7 years following admission in any 

status, is not eligible for cancellation of removal 

16 under the first prong of the statute. That is true 

17 regardless of whether the alien can show that his 

18 parents, or any other third party, for that matter, did 

19 satisfy those requirements.

 The Ninth Circuit, alone among the courts of 

21 appeals, has recognized a rule of imputed eligibility 

22 under section 1229b(a). That rule is wrong for at least 

23 two reasons. First of all, it is inconsistent with the 

24 plain text of the statute.

 The touchstones of eligibility under section 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 1229b(a), LPR status, admission, and residence, are all 

2 terms that are defined in the INA to refer to attributes 

3 that are individual to the alien seeking relief, 

4 attributes that cannot be satisfied by a third party.

 But even if the statute were thought to be 

6 ambiguous with respect to this question, the Board of 

7 Immigration Appeals has interpreted the statute to mean 

8 that the alien seeking relief must personally and 

9 actually satisfy both durational requirements. That 

interpretation is at the very least a reasonable reading 

11 of the statute, if not the only reasonable reading of 

12 the statute. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But did it make that 

14 determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its 

discretion? As I read its opinion, it felt that it had 

16 to come to that conclusion as a matter of law. 

17  MS. KRUGER: I think --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we were to find the 

19 statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy 

decisions independent of its legal conclusions? 

21  MS. KRUGER: First of all, Justice 

22 Sotomayor, we don't think the statute is ambiguous; and 

23 so, we don't think there's any reason to go to Chevron 

24 step two in this case.

 But if you look at the Board's decision in 

5

25

Official 

1 Escobar in particular, I think the Board makes clear
 

2 that, although it thought the statutory language was
 

3 clear, it also rested its decision on other
 

4 considerations that are uniquely within the Board's
 

expertise. It discussed how the imputation rule 

6 comports with the general policies of the statute, how 

7 it comports with the rule that the Board itself has 

8 recognized over time, that LPR status is something 

9 that's individual to a particular alien, and that the 

alien seeking relief has to individually, both 

11 procedurally and substantively, satisfy the eligibility 

12 requirements. 

13  And it also noted that the imputation rule 

14 would create significant holes in the statutory scheme. 

It would mean that an individual who may not even have 

16 been eligible for admission to the United States or 

17 lawful admission for permanent residence would 

18 nevertheless receive a significant benefit that goes 

19 along with that status.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say that you 

21 think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't 

22 address issues of imputation at all, does it? 

23  MS. KRUGER: It does not address issues of 

24 imputation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn't

1 even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is 

2 that it's ambiguous. 

3  MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't think that a 

4 statute, as this Court has recognized, has to address 

every conceivable possibility in order to be 

6 unambiguous. And this statute, I think, is unambiguous 

7 in that it refers to eligibility requirements that are 

8 by their nature, as defined in immigration law, 

9 individual to a specific alien. There's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- there 

11 was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile --

12 a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based 

13 on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the 

14 child's?

 MS. KRUGER: Right. There -- the 

16 Respondents relied very heavily on three court of 

17 appeals cases that had interpreted the predecessor to 

18 this statute, former section 212(c), to allow imputation 

19 of a parent's domicile to a child. Those courts relied 

on the common law rule that a child's domicile follows 

21 that of his parents. And applying that rule, they 

22 allowed children to rely on their parents' domicile in 

23 the United States to satisfy the 7-year lawful 

24 unrelinquished domicile requirement in that statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess a child doesn't 

7

Official 

1 have any domicile except the parents'; right? Children 

2 who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do 

3 they? 

4  MS. KRUGER: Under this Court's decision in 

Holyfield, the common law rule is that the child's 

6 domicile is determined by that of his parents, 

7 regardless of where the child resides in fact. When 

8 Congress repealed former section 212(c) and enacted the 

9 current cancellation of removal statute, it removed any 

reference to the word "domicile," instead replacing the 

11 requirement of 7 years unrelinquished domicile with two 

12 durational requirements that are at issue in this case. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that change alone 

14 sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear 

indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to 

16 alter the imputation rule? 

17  MS. KRUGER: I think if this Court is 

18 willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress 

19 would have been aware of these three court of appeals 

decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very 

21 late in the life of a provision that had existed in more 

22 or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917, 

23 then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware 

24 that the basis for those decisions was the common law 

definition of the term "domicile" and that Congress 

8

Official 

1 meant what it did when it replaced "domicile" with three 

2 eligibility criteria that are defined terms in the 

3 immigration law and all of which refer to attributes 

4 that are individual to a specific alien.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does a child who is not 

6 emancipated have the capacity to independently establish 

7 a residence? 

8  MS. KRUGER: Under the -- how the INA 

9 defines the term "residence" is an actual principal 

dwelling in fact. So, yes, a child will dwell somewhere 

11 in fact and can do so independent of a parent. That is 

12 in marked contrast to the common law rule of domicile 

13 that this Court explained at length in its Holyfield 

14 decision and that the courts of appeals applied in 

interpreting former section 212(c). 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can a parent ask for a 

17 permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child? 

18  MS. KRUGER: Yes, a parent could. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if you have two cases, 

one -- two 5-year-olds. One, as in this case, lives 

21 with the parent, but the application has not been 

22 granted or not been filed; and the other, the 

23 application has been granted. And they're treated --

24 they're treated differently?

 MS. KRUGER: I think that's right, 

9

Official 

1 Justice Kennedy. And I think that that is a necessary 

2 corollary of the way the immigration system is 

3 constructed. As a general rule, LPR status and 

4 admission are criteria that are individual to a 

particular alien. To be sure, minor children of lawful 

6 permanent residents receive a high preference in the 

7 immigration visa system. 

8  But there's no rule that says that children 

9 automatically receive the same legal status as their 

lawful permanent resident parents. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming we don't accept 

12 Respondents' -- what appears to be their argument, that 

13 being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we 

14 assume that being an LPR is what triggers the 

availability for the Attorney General's exercise of 

16 discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation 

17 rule harm the statute? The child has lived with the 

18 parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well, 

19 after, it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of 

LPR status. How does that harm the purposes of the 

21 statute? 

22  I thought the idea of the statute was to 

23 give individuals who had ties to the United States an 

24 opportunity to stay. If a child's been with their 

parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to 

10

Official 

1 deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of 

2 discretion merely because the administrative process has 

3 taken too long to give them something which they're 

4 going to get and which they've gotten?

 MS. KRUGER: I think it's worth separating 

6 out two different components of the cancellation of 

7 removal decision. It is certainly true that it's an 

8 important criteria, in determining whether or not an 

9 individual is entitled as a matter of discretion to 

cancellation of removal relief, how strong their ties 

11 are to the United States, what their family ties are and 

12 so on. But it has never been thought that particularly 

13 compelling reasons for the exercise of discretion can 

14 overcome the plain threshold requirements for 

eligibility for the exercise of discretion under 1229b. 

16  The difficulty with the imputation rule that 

17 the Ninth Circuit has recognized is that it undermines 

18 the plain requirements for those threshold 

19 determinations of eligibility, conferring an important 

benefit that goes along with long-time permanent 

21 resident status and long-time continuous residence after 

22 admission on individuals who not only did not receive 

23 the necessary formal authorization from immigration 

24 officials at the requisite time; they may not even have 

been eligible to receive those authorizations. 

11

25

Official 

1  I think it's also worth noting that this 

2 statute is not the beginning and the end of discretion 

3 in the immigration system. It is always true, and it is 

4 -- certainly was the case when Congress enacted the 

statute in 1996, that immigration officials have the 

6 discretion not to bring removal proceedings in the first 

7 place, to terminate removal proceedings once they have 

8 begun, to defer action on the execution of a removal 

9 order. And current immigration and customs enforcement 

guidance makes clear that a minor receives particular 

11 consideration within the totality of the circumstances 

12 in determining whether or not prosecutorial discretion 

13 is something that should be exercised. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: So, how does it work? I'm 

-- how does it work? Two legal permanent residents, a 

16 man and his wife, happen to show up in New York, and 

17 they have a 6-month-old child. All right. What's the 

18 legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship 

19 him off? I mean there -- is it just discretion? Or is 

there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that 

21 from happening? 

22  MS. KRUGER: It will depend on the 

23 individual circumstances. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no. I've given you 

the hypothetical. I mean, there we are.

Official 

1  MS. KRUGER: Right.
 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: That's all you know.
 

3  MS. KRUGER: So, Congress has taken some
 

4 steps with respect to some subset of aliens.
 

Respondent, for example, brings up the LIFE Act, and 

6 that is an example of where Congress has taken a step 

7 to --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not asking for that. 

9 I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know. All 

right? There are -- you know the hypothetical. 

11  I want -- one possible thing to say would be 

12 that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that 

13 he's here for lawful permanent residence, too. Every 

14 circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and 

moreover there are other areas of law where I have found 

16 imputation rules in the immigration law. Roughly, I 

17 have three or four cases on that. But they're --

18 they're not exactly comparable. 

19  Okay. So, I just want to know what is it 

that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him 

21 off to China if we don't impute? 

22  MS. KRUGER: Well, I think the answer is 

23 certainly not that we impute the admission of the -- as 

24 to child.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not asking that. You

Official 

1 know the question. I just want your best effort --

2  MS. KRUGER: So, if there --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: -- to give an answer. Or 

4 I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing; it's 

either imputation or nothing. 

6  MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that that's --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: And you don't want me to 

8 reach that conclusion. 

9  MS. KRUGER: No, I think that that's 

incorrect. There are certain provisions of law that 

11 would allow for the child to be admitted but on an 

12 independent basis from the parents. If a child is not 

13 admissible --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the supposition -- if 

the supposition is that the parents -- I think 

16 Justice Breyer's supposition was that both parents were 

17 LPRs. The likelihood of the 6-month-old child being 

18 born in the United States and therefore being a citizen 

19 would be rather large.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, that's certainly right. 

21 It is also true that --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That isn't my 

23 hypothetical. 

24  (Laughter.)

 MS. KRUGER: Right. The child in your

25

Official 

1 hypothetical -- the child is not born in the United 

2 States, right? 

3  If the child does not independently satisfy 

4 the criteria for admissibility, then the child has 

entered the United States illegally and remains here at 

6 the discretion of immigration officials. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if they come with 

8 somebody else's 6-month-old child, they'd have to send 

9 that child back to China, too, wouldn't they?

 MS. KRUGER: Well --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would be very sad, 

12 but that would be the law, right? 

13  MS. KRUGER: Well --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Actually they came from 

Italy, in my hypothetical. 

16  (Laughter.) 

17  MS. KRUGER: I mean, I think that 

18 Martinez --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: They should not have sent 

him back to China, then. Why did they do that? 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  MS. KRUGER: I think that Martinez 

23 Gutierrez's situation, I think, is a good example of 

24 this. He entered the United States illegally with the 

-- with his parents and remained here illegally until he 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 was admitted as an LPR at the age of 19 as an adult. 

2 Until that time, there were no efforts to remove him 

3 from the United States, and I think that that's fairly 

4 typical, but that's not because his parents' admission 

or their lawful status in the United States was imputed 

6 to Martinez Gutierrez, and there is no background 

7 principle in the law that would allow for such 

8 imputation of an individual formal authorization to 

9 remain in the country by immigration officials to be 

imputed from one to another. 

11  Rather, the immigration system sets up a 

12 system in which a lawful permanent resident parent can 

13 seek to -- to petition for an immigration visa on behalf 

14 of a child and facilitate that child's eventual 

adjustment to lawful permanent resident status, but it's 

16 not something happens automatically. It's something 

17 that happens through a regular, orderly process. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example 

19 of an instance in which a child who is the child of two 

lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent 

21 resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he 

22 can at the age of 15? I mean, what commonly happens 

23 between that period that would make him ineligible --

24 eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter 

of providing all the documents? 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  MS. KRUGER: That would make him ineligible 

2 at the age of 15? 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- the whole 

4 point here is that some children are given lawful 

permanent resident status and -- and some are not. But 

6 I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two 

7 lawful resident parents, ever make it so that a child 

8 who was formerly ineligible is now eligible? He was 

9 ineligible at 5, but he's eligible at 14? I mean, how 

does that work? 

11  MS. KRUGER: I think the most common 

12 scenario is one in which a visa number doesn't become 

13 available until the child is -- is --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I don't mean a visa 

number. But nothing -- nothing with -- with respect to 

16 the child's real status other than his -- where he is on 

17 the queue in the immigration department? 

18  MS. KRUGER: That would be the most common 

19 scenario, is -- is where the child is in the queue. And 

I think Respondents place a great deal of emphasis on 

21 the amount of time it takes for visa numbers to become 

22 available for both children and spouses of lawful 

23 permanent residents, but that has been a regular and 

24 acknowledged feature of the immigration system for 

decades.

1  The Congress that enacted IIRIRA in 1996 was 

2 well aware of the waiting times for these visa numbers. 

3 It had before it proposals for reducing the backlog, and 

4 it rejected those proposals. It enacted in the 

cancellation of removal statute two eligibility criteria 

6 that do not turn on potential eligibility for receiving 

7 LPR status or admission to the United States but, 

8 instead, turn on actually having received that formal 

9 authorization from immigration officials.

 And I think that the best inference that we 

11 can draw from the statutory language is that Congress 

12 meant what it said; it attached special significance to 

13 that formal authorization, the formal exercise of 

14 authority by immigration officials, and not simply the 

potential for that exercise in the future. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, you take a 

17 statute that doesn't say anything about imputation one 

18 way or the other, and you say that statute can still be 

19 unambiguous. And that would I think be true as a 

general matter. But now you add to that statute a 

21 history and a tradition and a practice in immigration 

22 law of imputation of various kinds. One is imputation 

23 of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are 

24 other imputations that occur throughout the field of 

immigration law. Some cut for the alien; some cut

1 against the alien. 

2  In the world of that practice and tradition, 

3 are you at least in a sphere in which there's ambiguity, 

4 in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide 

whether it wants to impute in this way? 

6  MS. KRUGER: I think the answer is "no," 

7 Justice Kagan, because the other circumstances in which 

8 imputation had been allowed under the immigration laws 

9 differ in very important respects from the imputation --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But none of them are 

11 textually commanded; is that right? I mean, the --

12 they're all situations in which the agency has decided 

13 that there are good reasons to impute various factors. 

14  MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't think that the 

only reason that the agency has allowed for imputation 

16 is that there is good reason as a general policy matter. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I can't hear you 

18 very well. Would you --

19  MS. KRUGER: Certainly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you crank up the thing 

21 or something?

1  The reason the -- the agency has allowed for 

2 imputation in other circumstances is with respect to 

3 certain inquiries that involve an inquiry into the 

4 alien's intent. So, for example, the Board has allowed 

for imputation under section 1182(k), which provides for 

6 -- for discretionary relief from the Attorney General 

7 when an immigrant did not know or could not have known 

8 that they were inadmissible. And the Board has said 

9 that, for those purposes, the parents' knowledge of 

inadmissibility is imputed to the minor child. So, too, 

11 in the context of abandonment of LPR status. The Board 

12 has said --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That first one 

14 usually cuts against the immigrant, I would assume. So, 

if the parents knew, the child knows, and the child 

16 normally would not know, right? 

17  MS. KRUGER: Well, that's correct. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

19  MS. KRUGER: That's correct. But I think 

the critical point is that the agency has interpreted 

21 imputation of intent, of state of mind, to be 

22 permissible, in part for the same reason that the common 

23 law rule about domicile formed, which is that --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, you think that all the 

imputations that exist in immigration law are all a

1 matter of imputing intent? 

2  MS. KRUGER: I think that that's -- all of 

3 the imputations that Respondents have pointed to concern 

4 state of mind type requirements. They don't concern 

formal authorizations by immigration officials. The 

6 Board, I think, has been very consistent, certainly in 

7 the context of cancellation of removal, in not imputing 

8 the legal status of being an LPR or admission from 

9 parent to child. And it's difficult to see any other 

examples in which such imputation would be permissible, 

11 in part because the background presumption of the 

12 immigration law is that those are both attributes that 

13 have to be individually achieved and the eligibility 

14 criteria have to be independently satisfied by each 

individual alien. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why is a parent's 

17 fraudulent conduct imputed to a child? There's no 

18 intent there. The child obviously doesn't have an 

19 intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime. 

So, why is that imputed by the BIA? 

21  MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Other than that it's a 

23 holding against the immigrant, which your adversary 

24 points out is not a very favorable outlook for the 

agency, that it only imputes when it harms the

1 immigrant. But, putting that aside, there's no intent 

2 involved in the fraud. It's just the commission of an 

3 act. 

4  MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that where the 

imputation has come in, in the Board's analysis, is with 

6 respect to the state of mind and not with respect to the 

7 objective conduct. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the state of mind 

9 of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?

 MS. KRUGER: It's -- I think where this has 

11 come up is in the context of knowing that the -- that 

12 the alien is not in fact admissible to the United 

13 States, is generally where it's come up. I'm not --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The child doesn't commit 

a fraudulent act. 

16  MS. KRUGER: But, again, I think that the 

17 principle that the Board has applied is that, because 

18 the child is presumed not capable of forming a requisite 

19 intent, the parent's intent is imputed to the child.

 But I think for present purposes the 

21 critical point is, even in that context, what is being 

22 imputed is not a formal status conferred on an 

23 individual alien by immigration officials, or admission, 

24 a formal authorization to enter the country. That is, 

again, conferred on an individual basis by immigration

1 officials. I think Respondents can identify no 

2 circumstance, no precedent, for that type of imputation, 

3 and it's one that would be inconsistent with the basic 

4 structure of the immigration system.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They do say --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd that the 

7 domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements, 

8 and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile 

9 case but not -- not in the residence case. It seems 

almost backward. 

11  MS. KRUGER: Well, to be --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Congress enacts a more 

13 forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes 

14 away the imputation.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, to be clear, 

16 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not supply a definition of 

17 the term "domicile." And so, the court of appeals 

18 opinions that Respondents are relying on followed the 

19 common law rule that says that a child's domicile 

follows that of his parents, but those courts applied 

21 that rule in very different ways. 

22  Two courts of appeals permitted children to 

23 benefit from the domicile of their parents in the United 

24 States even when they were not even physically present 

in the United States for the full 7-year period; whereas 

23

Official 

1 the Ninth Circuit, for its part, applied that rule only 

2 where the alien child had been -- had entered the United 

3 States lawfully with his parents, according to the Ninth 

4 Circuit, remains lawfully in the United States 

thereafter, and simply had become an LPR outside of the 

6 full 7-year period. 

7  In crafting the current cancellation of 

8 removal statute, there's no reason to believe that 

9 Congress was aware of these three court of appeals 

opinions that were, again, decided very late in the life 

11 of former section 212(c). But even if it had been aware 

12 of those decisions, it also would have been aware that 

13 by using defined terms in the INA that are defined in a 

14 way that's individual to the particular alien, it was 

eliminating any reference to the common law rule. 

16  Unlike domicile, there is no rule that says 

17 that a child's LPR status follows that of his parents or 

18 that a child's admission follows that of its parents. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how -- were you 

finished? 

21  MS. KRUGER: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how the -- you 

23 can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases 

24 -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well. 

They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said

Official 

1 the 7 years of domicile have to come after their 

2 admission for permanent residence. And then the dissent 

3 says, hey, what about permanent residents? And what 

4 they say is this case is different because, in that 

earlier case, the parents had never been admitted. He 

6 came after he was married in this case. He's here after 

7 his parents were admitted. Now, I grant you they didn't 

8 explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached 

9 their conclusion without it.

 And then there's a different split in the 

11 circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods, 

12 you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera. And 

13 that seems to be what Congress resolved. 

14  So, I think if you're talking about what was 

the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did 

16 impute for residence. And then Congress sort of just 

17 doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly 

18 different thing. Is that a fair reading, or what do you 

19 think?

 MS. KRUGER: I don't think it is, but first 

21 I'd like to clarify that the Ninth Circuit had no reason 

22 to impute residence in Lepe-Guitron, in part because the 

23 alien in that case had resided in fact in the United 

24 States throughout the 7-year period. I think 

Respondents make the argument that Lepe-Guitron was in

1 fact imputing LPR status, as opposed to residence in
 

2 fact.
 

3  But I think that that is an incorrect
 

4 reading of the Ninth Circuit's decision as well, and
 

that's for the following reason: All three courts of 

6 appeals that Respondents rely on dealt separately with 

7 the threshold requirement under former section 212(c) 

8 that the alien be a lawful permanent resident. None of 

9 those three courts permitted LPR status to be imputed 

from parent to child. So, where there was an explicit 

11 requirement in the statute that LPR status be obtained 

12 by the alien seeking relief, the courts were very clear 

13 in requiring that the alien before them independently 

14 satisfied that requirement.

 In Lepe-Guitron, the Ninth Circuit 

16 acknowledged that, under circuit precedent, it had held 

17 that domicile requires an intent to remain permanently 

18 in the United States lawfully and said that that meant 

19 that the alien had to be in LPR status. Lepe-Guitron 

said that with respect to children, that intent to 

21 remain in the United States lawfully need not be an LPR 

22 status so long as their parents were lawfully domiciled 

23 in the United States. 

24  If the Court has no further questions, I'd 

like to reserve the balance of my time.

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN

 NO. 10-1542 

6  MR. KINNAIRD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

7 please the Court: 

8  Children present special problems under the 

9 immigration laws, and, as discussed, both the courts and 

the agency in various contexts have resorted to 

11 imputation to cure those problems. And here the -- the 

12 statute is silent as to imputation, and ambiguity arises 

13 as applied to the special circumstance of children who 

14 were minors during the years in question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know 

16 whether -- I'm having trouble applying the concepts of 

17 unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation. As far as 

18 I can tell, this is something that the statute just 

19 doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you 

characterize that correctly as ambiguous. It's just 

21 kind of off the table. 

22  MR. KINNAIRD: I think it's ambiguous as 

23 applied to this specific circumstance. And the 

24 ambiguity arises because the requirements for which 

there is imputation, status and residency, are matters 

27

1 that are not within the capacity or the control of a 

2 minor. A minor does not decide whether or when a parent 

3 will apply for LPR status for him or her. He does not 

4 control the -- the maintenance of that status over a 

period of years, and he also does not control where he 

6 resides. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, can you give any 

8 example -- the Government says you can't -- of an 

9 instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just 

status; where the status that the parents have is 

11 automatically given to the child or, for that matter, 

12 automatically taken away from the child? 

13  MR. KINNAIRD: Section 212(c) imputed 

14 status, as the Ninth Circuit found. The reason was that 

the requirement there was not just for unrelinquished 

16 domicile but lawful unrelinquished domicile, and, 

17 therefore, they had to reach back to the period in which 

18 the parent was an LPR --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: But there -- there, you --

what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the 

21 place, right? And that's -- that's an -- that's intent. 

22 That's imputing intent. 

23  MR. KINNAIRD: No, they also had to impute 

24 lawfulness, which meant that the parent had to be an LPR 

for that period or at least in some lawful status. And

1 in each of the three instances, the parents were LPRs in 

2 the times in question. So, there definitely was a 

3 foregoing rule of imputation of status. And I would 

4 submit that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the child would not 

6 have been lawfully there but for the imputation of 

7 lawfulness from the parents. 

8  MR. KINNAIRD: That's right. He -- well, he 

9 would not have qualified for -- for a waiver of removal.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that 

11 the point you're making is the statute is ambiguous in 

12 the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from 

13 making this imputation if it wants to. But the BIA 

14 clearly doesn't want to. So, where does that leave you?

 MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I think if it is 

16 ambiguous, then the BIA actually has to exercise its 

17 discretion and grapple with that ambiguity. And that is 

18 one of the fundamental problems, as Justice --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, are you saying that 

the BIA needs to write an opinion that says now we are 

21 doing Chevron step two analysis? Is that what you're 

22 saying, that this is a matter of labeling? 

23  MR. KINNAIRD: I don't think it's a matter 

24 of -- of magic words, but what it has to do is actually 

grapple with and recognize the ambiguity, at least in

1 the alternative, and then exercise its discretion to say 

2 if this is a permissible construction of the Act and 

3 there's another permissible construction, which of the 

4 two better serves the statutory purpose.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't have 

6 to grapple with everything that's not there. I mean, 

7 there are a lot of things that the statutes don't 

8 address. 

9  MR. KINNAIRD: Agreed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 

11 they don't have to grapple with everything that's there. 

12 You just have to say this doesn't address it. So, 

13 whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you, 

14 loses.

 MR. KINNAIRD: I don't think --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying: We 

17 think this law should allow -- should provide for this, 

18 should be extended for this. And it's one thing to say, 

19 well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children 

in one category but not in another category; so, the 

21 issue's there; we don't know what they meant. It's 

22 another thing if it's something that's totally not on 

23 the table. I mean, if -- if you claimed that the law 

24 required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't 

say the statute was ambiguous about that. You'd say it

2  MR. KINNAIRD: Well, that's right, Your 

3 Honor, but I think the ambiguity arises here because the 

4 matters in question are ones not within the capacity or 

control of the minor, and that's been the traditional 

6 basis on which the BIA has looked for imputation. And 

7 when you take into account --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In your -- your 

9 argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who 

never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a 

11 cancellation of removal based on the parents' status. 

12  MR. KINNAIRD: I don't think that's right. 

13 The Ninth Circuit did not address that, but I think the 

14 better reading of the statute, even if (a)(1) is 

somewhat ambiguous on that point, is that you have to be 

16 an LPR in order to seek cancellation. And then for 

17 these durational requirements and the look-back to 

18 status, there you do imputation. 

19  And the reason is twofold. One, section 

212(c), which it replaced, was limited to LPRs. The 

21 second is that there is a separate subsection, 

22 subsection (b), of that same statute. I don't believe 

23 it's in the addenda provided to the courts, but it is 

24 cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent 

resident aliens. And the critical distinction between

1 the two, besides differences in criteria, is that that 

2 one authorizes adjustment of status as well as 

3 cancellation. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would --

MR. KINNAIRD: So, if you're not an actual 

6 LPR, you need to have adjustment of status to -- to not 

7 be in a legal limbo. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Kinnaird, what would 

9 happen if the child remains with the grandparents in 

Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6 

11 years until they can afford to take him. Is the 

12 parents' residence then imputed to the child so that 

13 when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to 

14 have been there for 6 years?

 MR. KINNAIRD: I think if there's a 

16 significant separation of that duration, I think there 

17 would be a question about whether you have the 

18 significant relationship between parent and child to 

19 warrant imputation. But it is true that under former 

section 212(c), at least in two of the cases, they 

21 imputed residency where the child was not actually 

22 resident. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: You had an example in your 

24 brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was 

an example of status rather than intent. The example 

32

25

Official 

1 that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is 

2 where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you 

3 can't get it if you were resettled in another country. 

4 And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement 

program. And then that seemed like a status, a 

6 residence. Were you resettled in the other country or 

7 were you not? That's his status, and then that's 

8 imputed to the child. 

9  MR. KINNAIRD: That's right. And the 

resettlement doesn't have any element of intent to it. 

11 So, it's not true that everything turns upon intent. 

12  And I would also point out that, under 

13 section (a)(1), it's not simply a requirement that there 

14 have been some grant of LPR status at some point and 

passage of 5 -- of 5 years. The statutory definition of 

16 "lawfully admitted for permanent residence" includes a 

17 requirement that the status has not changed. And that 

18 requires domiciliary intent because the BIA has 

19 interpreted that phrase to mean that you can change your 

status by intent, and in fact the Department of Homeland 

21 Security has defended against cancellation claims on the 

22 grounds that there was abandonment during a -- during 

23 the 5-year period. So, if you had a child coming forth, 

24 you would have to look, in certain circumstances at 

least, to the parent for intent of abandonment.

Official 

1  So, I think this is an element where there 

2 is direct continuity from section 212(c). It makes 

3 eminent sense. And even if the BIA is deemed to have 

4 exercised its discretion here, I think its rule is 

patently unreasonable, and for a number of reasons. 

6  First, they're not able to advance a single 

7 policy reason that would be favorable to non-imputation. 

8 It destroys family unity, and it forecloses eligibility 

9 for relief for even people like Mr. Martinez Gutierrez, 

who has lived here since the age of 5. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- this Court has 

12 dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child 

13 relationships under the immigration law. And let's take 

14 Fiallo v. Bell. There the Court said, well, it tells us 

that for married parents it's this way, and for a child 

16 born out of wedlock, that relationship is something 

17 else. That could be considered quite arbitrary when the 

18 question is, is the child left orphaned? But the Court 

19 said, well, that's what the statute said. It made that 

distinction, and the Court upheld it. 

21  But there are a number of cases where there 

22 is -- the statute does say, parent-child relationship, 

23 this is imputed, that is not, and dealt -- the Court 

24 dealt with that in Miller and Nguyen.

1 Congress has the latitude to be -- to draw arbitrary 

2 lines. I don't think the agency does if imputation is a 

3 permissible alternative. I think they have to give a 

4 reasoned basis for denying imputation when it was the 

prior rule. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- why 

7 can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background 

8 principle apply that you're not entitled to admission 

9 unless you make an affirmative case for it?

 You say, well, the -- the government hasn't 

11 advanced any policy reason on the other side. Why isn't 

12 that the basic policy of the government? 

13  MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I think they have to 

14 look to the actual statute, and they have to give their 

own reasons, which I don't think they've done adequately 

16 as a matter of discretion. But here, this is a --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it -- why isn't 

18 it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and 

19 in their decisions that the prior word was "domicile" 

and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that 

21 the word under the new statute is "residence" and the 

22 child's residence is not necessarily the residence of 

23 the parent? That seems to me a perfectly valid reason. 

24  MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I wouldn't say that's 

Chevron step two discretion. But I think you also have 

35

25

Official 

1 to look to the fact that there was not only imputation 

2 of domicile; it required lawfulness. And -- and in 

3 imputing domicile, they were also imputing residence. 

4 So, it's true the word "domicile" has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but it's 

6 a different word. 

7  MR. KINNAIRD: It's a different word, yes. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And the one word demands 

9 imputation; the other doesn't. So, I mean, I don't 

think you can say there's no -- no rational basis given 

11 by the agency. 

12  MR. KINNAIRD: Well, the rational basis 

13 comes in if -- if there's ambiguity and they're 

14 determining why -- if it's a permissible construction, 

why it should be rejected or not. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of the problems that 

17 I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable 

18 doctrine. 

19  MR. KINNAIRD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21 means discretionary. 

22  MR. KINNAIRD: Yes. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And to me, that often 

If it is that,

to say than "I don't want to," because it renders lots

1 of issues open, like what do we do with 1229b(a)(2)? 

2 Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year 

3 statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we're imputing a 

4 parent's residence or any of the things that you're --

that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its 

6 decision? 

7  I mean, you can't force a court to -- the 

8 BIA to impute. So, what more do they have to say than 

9 we don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if 

it is ambiguous to do this? 

11  MR. KINNAIRD: Well, I would say the statute 

12 has an equitable purpose which allows imputation. I do 

13 not think there's discretion, if imputation is 

14 permissible unless there's a rational basis in serving 

the policies of the Act, to deny imputation. And 

16 discretion does come in at the second phase, which is 

17 when the Attorney General determines whether or not the 

18 -- the cancellation should be granted. 

19  So, we should bear in mind that this is a 

statute strictly for eligibility, simply to get to the 

21 phase where there's unreviewable discretion in the 

22 Attorney General to deny relief. And this is a 

23 once-in-a-lifetime remedy. You can only apply for 

24 cancellation once in your life.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's so reasonable 

6 about a child who lives with their grandparents outside 

7 the country? Why should their parents' being in the 

8 U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child? I

Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years 

11 old. 

12  MR. KINNAIRD: Right. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --

14  MR. KINNAIRD: And if -- BIA, I think, would 

be reasonable to draw a narrower rule, and we could 

16 prevail under that rule, but I think the rationale is 

17 family unity; that even though there are periods of 

18 residence where there's a dysjunction, the real reason 

19 is simply the operation of quotas. And -- and there was 

a historical practice of allowing imputation of 

21 residence. Since you still have the family ties, I 

22 think imputation is permissible there, as long as you 

23 have the significant relationship.

7 control. That's been the basis for their abandonment
 

8 decisions. They have invoked imputation only to the
 

9 detriment of the alien where the child has no intent
 

whatsoever. 

11  So, there's no common law principle for 

12 imputing mens rea, for example, knowledge of 

13 inadmissibility to a child; no basis for really imputing 

14 an intent to abandon when the child has none whatsoever. 

So, at the very least, they have to explain that. 

16  And because -- and the BIA has also not 

17 really taken into account the nature of these as simply 

18 eligibility rules. 

19  Thank you.

1  MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

2 and may it please the Court: 

3  So far as subsection (2) of the provision 

4 that we're talking about this morning, which is the 

provision that concerns me in the Sawyers case, we think 

6 that the Government's reading is simply not a sensible 

7 approach to the statute. And in that sense, our 

8 position is not that the statute is ambiguous. We think 

9 that the statutory context and the particular meaning of 

the words that Congress used require imputation in the 

11 circumstances of this case. 

12  I'll start with the statutory background, 

13 where I think the Government understates the nature of 

14 the prevailing settled rule that it applied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We usually like to 

16 start with the statutory language. Where is this issue 

17 addressed in this statute at all? 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: Imputation as such, as has 

19 been said, is not directly addressed. But the words 

that the -- that Congress used, the word "residence" and 

21 the word -- particularly "continuous residence" are 

22 words that Congress would have thought carried along 

23 with it the concept of imputation. And the reason why 

24 that is so, I think it's necessary to start with a 

little bit of the background both of the statute and how

1 those words have been interpreted in prior usages. 

2 Congress would have been aware of when it used them in 

3 the statute. 

4  Under the prior relief provision here, 

section 212(c), the old provision, the courts that --

6 courts of appeals that had addressed it had uniformly
 

7 applied an imputation rule. The Government says it's
 

8 three courts. Two of those courts are the Second and
 

9 Ninth Circuits, the largest immigration circuits that
 

decide two-thirds of the immigration cases in the 

11 country. So, I think one can presume that Congress 

12 would have been aware of this rule. 

13  And the Government concedes that Congress 

14 didn't change the language of 212(c) because it was 

dissatisfied with imputation. It had other purposes in 

16 mind altogether. And so --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does the 

18 statute say about imputation of individuals' residence 

19 to grandparents?

 MR. ROTHFELD: The rule -- it says nothing 

21 directly about it. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says nothing 

23 about it. So, would you say the statute is ambiguous on 

24 whether or not residents' legal permanent residence 

status should be imputed to grandparents?

Official 

1  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think there could be 

2 circumstances in which imputation is appropriate when --

3 when the child is in the custody of the grandparent. 

4 But I'm focusing on parents because that's how the cases 

have been decided up to that point. 

6  The BIA itself had said, prior to the 

7 enactment of this statute, in the In re Ng case that --

8 which I think is the case the Justice Breyer had 

9 referred to -- it had said in so many words the 

residence of the parent is imputed to child when the 

11 child is a minor. Congress would have been aware of 

12 that when it used the word "residence" in 

13 subsection (2). 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do -- what 

you do if the parents -- the father is an LPR, the 

16 mother is not? Do we then impute to the child the 

17 father's status? The couple is not married. 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: There are rules, common law 

19 rules, that the courts had applied in determining whose 

residence and whose domicile would be attributed to the 

21 child when the parents were not -- didn't have joint 

22 custody. When the -- if we're talking only about 

23 residence here --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They have joint custody. 

They live together. They're just not married.

1  MR. ROTHFELD: I think that -- again, the 

2 courts have applied -- if we're distinguishing -- for 

3 purposes of residence -- and I'm not talking about the 

4 technical LPR status here when I'm using the term 

"residence"; I am referring simply to kind of the 

6 general common law concept. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I think it was 

8 agreed that -- that LPR status would be necessary. At 

9 least, Mr. Kinnaird said that.

 MR. ROTHFELD: We --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, we're talking about 

12 the 5-year period and the 7-year period. The child 

13 would have to have LPR status. 

14  MR. ROTHFELD: We agree ultimately, to get 

relief, the child has to have LPR status and certainly 

16 under subsection (1) of the provision, which is not at 

17 issue in the Sawyers case. That concerns 5 years of LPR 

18 status. Subsection(2), which is all that I'm concerned 

19 with in Sawyers because that's the only -- only element 

of the relief provision that he was deemed not to 

21 satisfy, concerns only the term "residence," not LPR as 

22 such; simply continuous residence in the United States. 

23  And so, the question of would Congress have 

24 thought that residence, continuous residence, is 

imputable from parent to child -- I think it would have

1 for two reasons: First of all, it would have believed 

2 that residence as a general matter is imputable. The 

3 BIA had said so itself in the Ng case. And as it --

4 domicile, which the Government concedes was imputable, 

necessarily includes --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Was residence 

7 at issue in that case? 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: It was indeed. It was a firm 

9 resettlement case, and the question was whether or not 

the alien had been a resident of Hong Kong. And the 

11 parents were residents, and the BIA said, well, the 

12 parents' residence is imputed to the child. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just for factual 

14 correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was 

living with his mother -- Mr. Sawyer was living with his 

16 mother. 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: That's correct. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the answer to that 

19 is? Is this a child living with a grandparent out of 

the country or not? 

21  MR. ROTHFELD: The record does not 

22 reflect -- we don't know if he was living in U.S. in an 

23 unlawful status up until the point he became an LPR at 

24 age 15. The record simply doesn't answer that question.

1 want to hear your whole argument here. You're saying 

2 they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng 

3 case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the 

4 fact that you were about to say, that domicile 

necessarily includes residence. And is there something 

6 else? 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: That's the principle, but 

8 that --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's correct. That -- but 

11 I can add to that a little bit, that in the section 

12 212 cases, in which domicile was imputed, as the 

13 Government recognizes, in at least two of those cases, 

14 the child was not in the United States for a portion of 

that time; and, therefore, necessarily those courts must 

16 have been imputing not only domicile but residence. And 

17 that is necessarily the case because -- residence is an 

18 element, a subset, of domicile --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: So, if he came to the United 

States at 15 from Jamaica, he was a resident of the 

21 United States before he came --

22  MR. ROTHFELD: As a -- as a legal matter, 

23 just as he was -- would have been domiciled in the 

24 United States.

2  MR. ROTHFELD: I think not. I think -- I
 

3 think our common law would have regarded him as a
 

4 resident of the United States --

JUSTICE ALITO: If his father was living in 

6 the U.K., would he be a resident of the U.K.? 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: There might be legal rules 

8 that -- that specify the physical presence is equivalent 

9 to residence for particular purposes. But as this Court 

held in Holyfield, as the Government recognizes in a 

11 domicile context, a child can be a domicile of a 

12 jurisdiction in which they have never set foot. The 

13 legal presumption is that a child is -- takes the 

14 domicile of the parent, and -- and residence is a 

necessary subset, as this Court has said long ago, 

16 before any of these statutes were passed. The 

17 definition --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can be a resident 

19 without being a domiciliary?

 MR. ROTHFELD: One can be -- yes, because 

21 the definition, as this Court said, of -- of "domicile" 

22 is residence in a particular place accompanied by an 

23 intent to remain there indefinitely. And so, you have 

24 to have both. You can't be a domicile without being a 

resident of the jurisdiction.

1  Congress would have been aware of that. And 

2 when it used the term "residence," it would have been 

3 aware of that as a general proposition, and it would 

4 have been aware that in the particular context of 

section 212(c), imputation rule for relief in the 

6 immigration laws, that use of the term "resident" 

7 carries with it imputation. 

8  I think that makes this -- so far as we're 

9 concerned, that makes the use of the term "continuous 

residence" in subsection (b) unambiguous and requires 

11 imputation. Congress would have been aware of this. 

12 There's no reason to think, the Government concedes, 

13 Congress was not trying to change the imputation rule 

14 when it changed the terminology from -- from "domicile" 

to "resident." 

16  In fact, it's sort of perverse to say that 

17 Congress had -- achieved that purpose, because it was 

18 a -- this was a liberalizing change. The reason that 

19 Congress -- it's quite clear from the statutory 

background why Congress changed the language from 7 

21 years' unrelinquished lawful domicile in the old 212(c) 

22 to continuous residence after admission in any status in 

23 -- in subsection (b) of the new statute -- was to 

24 broaden the availability of relief.

 Congress was confronted with a split in the 

47

20

25

Official 

1 circuits on the interpretation of the old rule, as to 

2 whether or not one could achieve unrelinquished 

3 domicile -- lawful unrelinquished domicile while not in 

4 an LPR status, because the BIA had taken the position 

that for -- to have lawful domicile, you have to 

6 lawfully intend to stay here permanently; you can't do 

7 that if you're not an LPR. 

8  And, therefore, Congress, confronting the 

9 split on circuits -- because some courts had rejected 

the BIA's view, Congress said, okay, we're going to put 

11 in subsection (a) of the new statute a requirement of 5 

12 years' LPR status. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: If Congress had wanted to 

14 use the term "resided" in the ordinary sense of the 

word, they wanted to require that the alien actually 

16 have lived in the United States continuously for 7 

17 years, what language would they have used? What 

18 language should they have used? 

19  MR. ROTHFELD: For -- for the child? Well, 

I think --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: If they wanted (2) to mean 

22 that the alien must have actually -- that person must --

23 the one who committed the crime later must actually have 

24 resided in the United States continuously for 7 years --

MR. ROTHFELD: I would --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: -- then what should they --

2 actually lived in the United States for 7 years, what 

3 language should they have used? 

4  MR. ROTHFELD: For -- for an adult, the 

language that they did use, because I think "continuous 

6 residence" carries with it the requirement that the 

7 person be physically present in the United States --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: For a minor. 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: If they're a minor?

 JUSTICE ALITO: For that to apply to 

11 everybody. 

12  MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I would think, given the 

13 context, of which imputation was the settled rule, that 

14 Congress would have had to indicate affirmatively that 

imputation was impermissible. Just as if -- if Congress 

16 uses the term "domicile" as they did in the old section 

17 212(c), knowing the context in which, as a universal 

18 matter, the domicile of the parents is attributed to the 

19 child, one would expect --

JUSTICE ALITO: "Domicile" is a legal term. 

21 You don't go around and you meet somebody and say, Where 

22 are you domiciled? 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: You might not even say, 

Where do you reside? But it's closer to being ordinary

1 language. 

2  MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- and "reside" can have 

3 different meanings in different contexts. There is a 

4 definition in the statute which the BIA itself has said 

does not apply to conditional uses of the term. So, you 

6 know, "residence" in its plainest sense -- I mean, as 

7 this Court said in the Savorgnan case, which is where 

8 Congress derived the -- the definition which is now in 

9 the INA, that was under the plainest use of the term 

"residence." You know, unadorned. And that was the 

11 statutory definition, which says without regard to 

12 intent. 

13  But when there's a conditional use, when 

14 it's continuous residence, as in subsection (b) of the 

statute, or permanent residence, necessarily one has to 

16 look at intent. And, therefore, that statutory 

17 definition cannot apply. The BIA itself has said that 

18 expressly in the Huang case, which we discuss in our 

19 brief, that so far as permanent residence is concerned, 

the statutory definition has no application because 

21 necessarily one has to look to intent. 

22  And so, this is sort of a second --

23 secondary argument here, but insofar as intent is 

24 essential for imputation, which is what the Government 

says -- the Government says the reason that the switch

1 from "domicile" to "residence" matters is because 

2 "domicile" looks to intent, and "residence" doesn't. 

3 But, in fact, continuous residence does, necessarily 

4 does, look to intent because it's the intent to remain 

continuously or permanently. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there some 

7 advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for 

8 early lawful permanent residence? Because under your 

9 view, parents wouldn't have to bother to apply for it at 

all. I'm -- I'm wondering about the --

11  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the consequences of 

13 deciding in your favor. And the other one, quite 

14 distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would 

not be some floodgate of -- of imputed residence cases. 

16  MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I -- the only thing 

17 we're talking about here, of course, is -- is a 

18 particular relief from removal provision. And so, 

19 certainly, the -- the expectation that the child someday 

down the road may seek relief from removal --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

22  MR. ROTHFELD: -- if they do -- if they 

23 become an LPR and do something wrong is not going to

3 removal, right? 

4  MR. ROTHFELD: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How often does -- are 

6 applications for cancellation of removal granted? I 

7 mean, is it a common phenomenon, or are we really 

8 talking here about just spinning it out longer so that 

9 the -- so that the person who will ultimately be 

deported can stay here that much longer? 

11  MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't give you current 

12 statistics. I think this Court said, I believe in the 

13 St. Cyr case, that a fairly -- substantial -- 40 percent 

14 or so of the cases are granted. The Gutierrez case, in 

fact, the IJ would have granted removal and --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it's as high as 

17 40 percent? 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: I believe that that's -- I 

19 wouldn't swear to that, Your Honor, but -- but it is 

a -- a significant percentage. And, again, Gutierrez is 

21 an example of that. The IJ would have granted it but 

22 for the -- the rejection of the imputation rule further 

23 on in the -- in the process. 

24  And I think this is actually kind of a 

significant point, which goes to what Congress would

1 have had in mind. We are only talking about not

3 to ask the Attorney General, in the exercise of his 

4 unreviewable discretion, to grant relief to deserving 

immigrants who would otherwise be forced out of the 

6 country by application of an inflexible rule. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose one of the 

8 things he could take into account in exercising his 

9 discretion is whether we're actually dealing with a 

minor, or, as I understand in this case, it's someone 

11 who is quite a bit older. 

12  MR. ROTHFELD: He -- it is unreviewable 

13 discretion, yes. He could take anything into account. 

14 And, certainly, the nature of the family ties, the --

the background of the immigrant, all of those things are 

16 taken into account. But the question -- whether or not 

17 Congress when it passed this statute, knowing how 

18 section 212(c) had been interpreted, the prospect that 

19 Congress meant to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that's a very 

21 big assumption. I mean, yes, it's the two biggest 

22 circuits who have defined domicile and imputation, but 

23 it wasn't us, number one. And, number two, going back 

24 to Justice Alito's question, they didn't adopt the same 

word, "domicile"; they changed it. So --

6 mean, it is a presumption that Congress is aware of 

7 judicial decisions, but I think that presumption --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It can't be aware of all 

9 judicial decisions.

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, but in this particular 

11 context, there's particular reason to think they were 

12 because Congress, it is agreed, enacted this legislation 

13 to cure a conflict in the circuits involving the 

14 application of this cancellation provision. And so, 

there would have been particular reason for Congress to 

16 be aware of what the courts had done.

1  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

2  MS. KRUGER: Thank you. 

3  I'd like to make three quick points --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the Respondent said 

that the BIA gave no policy reason, no policy 

6 justifications, for its -- for its interpretation. 

7  Is that correct in your view? 

8  MS. KRUGER: I don't think that that is 

9 correct. The BIA noted -- to be clear, the BIA was, I 

think, heavily influenced by what it saw as the clear 

11 language of the statute, but it also noted that the 

12 imputation rule was inconsistent with a history of 

13 non-imputation of LPR status, an approach that treats 

14 LPR status as accorded to individual aliens.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you respond to the 

16 point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just 

17 intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also 

18 attributed? 

19  MS. KRUGER: I think this goes back to the 

answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier. Where 

21 former section 212(c) had an explicit lawful status 

22 requirement, which is the status of being a lawful 

23 permanent resident, no court of appeals allowed 

24 imputation from parent to child.

 Their argument is a little bit more 

55

1 convoluted than that. It is that because domicile, 

2 lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean 

3 the ability to form a lawful intent to remain 

4 permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit 

said you could only form such an intent if you are a 

6 lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the 

7 Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR 

8 status from parent to child. 

9  I think the more straightforward way to read 

the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the 

11 intent to remain permanently in the United States from 

12 parent to child, based in part on the parents' 

13 establishment of a domicile, and based on the common law 

14 rule that the child's domicile follows that of his 

parents. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in response 

17 to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a 

18 policy reason, your answer was that they, you know, 

19 followed the history. I'm not sure that's the same as a 

policy. 

21  MS. KRUGER: Well, in -- in addition to 

22 discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they 

23 also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's 

24 imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run 

around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR 

56

1 status. So, theoretically, you could have an individual 

2 minor alien who's not eligible, who's inadmissible for 

3 adjustment of status, who would nevertheless be accorded 

4 a substantial benefit of that status without regard to 

whether or not he could have received that status in 

6 fact. 

7  I want to --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that the case under the 

9 prior law?

 MS. KRUGER: Under the -- under former 

11 section 212(c). 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, when -- yes. 

13  MS. KRUGER: Again, no court --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's not unthinkable.

 MS. KRUGER: No court had imputed LPR 

16 status, the threshold requirement for relief under --

17 under the predecessor statute, from parent to child. 

18 So, it wasn't the case that somebody who was actually 

19 ineligible for -- for LPR status would nevertheless be 

eligible for waiver of removal under -- under that 

21 provision. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just don't understand 

23 that argument because they've conceded that you need 

24 the -- the child needs their own LPR status before it 

triggers --

1  MS. KRUGER: Right, and I think that
 

2 concession --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- residency.
 

4  MS. KRUGER: I think that concession is
 

important for the following reason: When Congress 

6 enacted the present cancellation of removal statute, it 

7 preserved that threshold requirement that you had to be 

8 an LPR in order to seek relief, but it added a 

9 durational requirement. You had to have attained that 

status at least 5 years before you sought relief. 

11  There's no reason to think, if there's no 

12 precedent for imputing LPR status in the first place, 

13 that there would be precedent for imputing LPR status 

14 going back 5 years. One necessarily follows from the

17 proposition that Respondent Sawyers makes, that courts 

18 were necessarily imputing residence as an element of 

19 domicile. That argument relies heavily on the 1967 

regional commissioner decision dealing with firm 

21 resettlement.

23 that the regional commissioner focused very intensely on 

24 the minor alien's particular actions -- identity, 

documents that he received personally from the foreign

 The case is submitted.
