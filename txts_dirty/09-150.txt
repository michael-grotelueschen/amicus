 Ms. Palmer. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MS. PALMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 Formality is indeed essential to testimonial 

11 utterance. So said this Court in Davis, which dealt 

12 with two related situations: On-the-scene questioning 

13 by police officers and questions by 9-1-1 operators. 

14 This Court noted that such questioning may often lack 

the formality essential to testimonial utterance, as 

16 officers called to investigate need to know whom they 

17 are dealing with in order to assess a situation, the 

18 threat to themselves, and the potential danger to 

19 possible victims.

 The question here is whether those same 

21 assessing questions -- what happened, who did it, where 

22 did it happen -- asked by police officers who, upon 

23 receiving a radio report of a man shot, found a wounded 

24 man lying on the ground next to a car at a gas station, 

bleeding, visibly in pain, and having trouble talking -­

1 were made in a formal context sufficiently similar to a 

2 magisterial examination so that the answers by the dying 

3 -- by the dying victim are testimonial. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it can't all 

be the formality of the context. I mean, if the police 

6 came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I 

7 guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was 

8 the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the 

9 answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same 

lack of formality. 

11  MS. PALMER: Which is where the ongoing 

12 emergency test from Davis comes into play. The 

13 questions need to be -- the primary purpose needs to be 

14 to meet an ongoing emergency. So assessing the risk, 

assessing the danger to others. And any questions 

16 beyond that could arguably be testimonial, while -­

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Forget about formality, in 

19 other words. Formality or no formality has nothing to 

do with it. 

21  MS. PALMER: Well, under Davis, you said 

22 that was how you tested the formality. If -- the Davis 

23 test is a gauge of formality. If there are questions 

24 that respond to ongoing emergency, then this Court has 

said that that is an indicator that it lacks the

1 formality. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we tell that? 

3 Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what 

4 happened, you'd ask the very same questions. You're 

saying the questions are relevant also to securing the 

6 situation. But what -- what different questions would 

7 you ask if you wanted to find out what happened? What 

8 was the past -- what were the past events? 

9  I mean, I'm trying to understand how you 

take these questions and say we can put a label on them 

11 here that says, well, this is to control an emergency 

12 situation versus we want to know what happened 

13 historically. 

14  MS. PALMER: Well, I think that what you 

have to do is look at the -- I mean, obviously, things 

16 can have dual purposes and often will. You need to look 

17 at the primary purpose here. And you said in Davis it's 

18 an objective -- what would an objective person 

19 viewing this test -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But whose primary 

21 purpose is it? 

22  I mean, the victim here knew that the 

23 incident hadn't happened there. There was nothing he 

24 had to share with the police, because they could see he 

was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot. He

1 apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem 

2 to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat 

3 to him. He had driven away. Rick didn't know where he 

4 had gone.

 So what's the ongoing emergency to the 

6 victim? 

7  MS. PALMER: Well, I think here -- which is 

8 why in Davis you said is the primary purpose of the 

9 questioning, is what you look at in Davis. And we're 

not asking you to overrule that. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, wait a minute. 

12 What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a 

13 footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant 

14 is what is at issue?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is -- that is what it 

16 says. 

17  MS. PALMER: What -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the -- it's the -­

19 it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the 

questioner. 

21  MS. PALMER: But the formality indicators 

22 that the Court delineated in Davis did not include 

23 whether the answers to the questions were for the 

24 purpose of establishing past events, but whether the 

primary purpose of the questions were for those ends.

1  The -- the question is one of context, not 

2 content, as you noticed in -- as you said in Crawford. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in Davis, the 

4 issue is why was the declarant talking? What you were 

trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was 

6 seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested. 

7 That's how I read the situation. 

8  The questions provided context for that. 

9 Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you 

talking about an event, attempting to get the police to 

11 intercede and arrest the person? 

12  Isn't that a fair reading of that case? 

13  MS. PALMER: Yes. And in Davis, you said 

14 also that there comes a point where courts can tell when 

the questioning takes on a different tone and the 

16 answers might become testimonial. 

17  When the questioning seeks answers that go 

18 beyond meeting the emergency, then courts can properly 

19 find there's a point where the nontestimonial statements 

end and the testimonial statements -­

21  JUSTICE ALITO: In a situation like this, do 

22 you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary 

23 purpose of the victim was when he responded to the 

24 police and said who shot him?

 You have a man who has just been shot. He

1 has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and 

2 he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and 

3 he says: My primary purpose in saying this is so that 

4 they can respond to an ongoing emergency. No, but I 

also have the purpose of giving them information that 

6 could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's 

7 a little bit less my purpose than responding to the 

8 ongoing emergency. 

9  It seems like it's totally artificial.

 MS. PALMER: Yes. And I think it -- any 

11 time you ask the courts to delve into the subjective 

12 intent of someone who is not present and cannot testify 

13 and cannot tell you, it necessarily complicates things. 

14 And I think it would -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: What possible response to 

16 an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind? What 

17 possible response to an ongoing emergency? 

18  MS. PALMER: He did ask for EMS -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: He was bleeding to death, 

and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death. 

21 Now, that statement would -- would be, you know, 

22 suggesting an ongoing emergency. 

23  But giving the name of the person who shot 

24 him, where he was shot, what does that have anything -­

how does that have anything to do with an ongoing

1 emergency? 

2  MS. PALMER: Well, the police, upon 

3 responding to the scene, don't know that this emergency 

4 is limited -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But he does. 

6  MS. PALMER: -- to that person. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: But he does. 

8  MS. PALMER: Which is why you have to look 

9 at the entire context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He knows -- he knows that 

11 his -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near 

12 there. He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far 

13 away was it? Six blocks or -- a good distance from 

14 where the shooter was. He knows all of that.

 The only reason he could be giving the name 

16 of the person who shot him is so that person could be 

17 apprehended and punished. 

18  MS. PALMER: And yet that subjective mindset 

19 doesn't affect the formality. It doesn't change the 

fact that this is an informal situation. You don't have

1 then the prosecutor says, I want to introduce this 

2 evidence against Bryant. Would you say that, yes, it's 

3 nontestimonial, so it comes in? 

4  MS. PALMER: He would have to be unavailable 

for it to come in. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why, if it's 

7 nontestimonial? 

8  MS. PALMER: Well, under -- the way the 

9 current jurisprudence is, he would have to be 

unavailable. If it's not testimonial, I do not think it 

11 would offend the Confrontation Clause for it to come in. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you said -- you said 

13 it's -- you're typing it nontestimonial. It goes to 

14 emergency situations. So I'm saying: Would that carry 

over to the man survives and the prosecutor says, I 

16 don't need to put him on the stand so he can be 

17 cross-examined; I've got nontestimonial evidence that I 

18 can put in? 

19  Would it become testimonial, then, if he 

survived? 

21  MS. PALMER: No, I don't think it would 

22 change the nature of what happened at the time. I do

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then -- then your 

2 answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my 

3 trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in. 

4  MS. PALMER: As long as it was not somehow 

barred by the rules of hearsay, which I believe it would 

6 be. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm confused of 

8 what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on. Is it the 

9 purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the 

declarants? 

11  We say the statements are testimonial when 

12 the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no 

13 such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of 

14 the interrogation is to establish or prove past events. 

The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the 

16 interrogation, which seems to be the question of what 

17 the police thought, not what the -- the person dying 

18 thought. 

19  MS. PALMER: That's correct. And I 

understand there is the footnote stating that, 

21 obviously, the declarant's statements are at issue. If 

22 there were no declarant, then -­

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I mean -­

24  MS. PALMER: -- there wouldn't be an issue.

1 footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the 

2 footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the 

3 declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question, 

4 that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.

 So which -- I guess, which is it? 

6  MS. PALMER: Well, I think what happens is 

7 the -- the interrogator's statements are not what are 

8 going to be determined to be testimonial or 

9 nontestimonial. They provide a glimpse into the context 

so we can determine whether those statements that are at 

11 issue are testimonial or nontestimonial. They are one 

12 way to determine the formality of the situation. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: One way to evaluate those 

14 statements is what they are made in response to. If 

they are made in response to a certain type of police 

16 inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial. And 

17 another kind -- you know, are you dying? They are more 

18 likely not to be testimonial. But it is ultimately the 

19 statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether 

they are testimonial or not. 

21  MS. PALMER: Correct. But as -­

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then, how does 

23 that apply? The officer says, what happened? And 

24 the -- the declarant says, Rick shot me.

2 to help them solve an emergency, but the police don't

look at the purpose of the questioning -- here, to 

6 respond to an ongoing emergency. The police don't 

7 know -­

13 ask the declarant to describe past events, which is 

14 testimonial.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: And if you're worried about 

that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on 

6 the ground or do you examine the gas station first, 

7 rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter 

8 that you think is still in the gas station? 

9  The -- the behavior of the police here gave 

no indication that they thought they were in danger 

11 immediately and were interrogating this person in order 

12 to assess the danger to them. That wasn't what they 

13 were after. 

14  MS. PALMER: Well, to be fair, this was 

before Crawford was answered. The questions were asked 

16 were to determine whether this was an excited utterance, 

17 and the questions that we would like to know now were: 

18 What did you do for your safety? How were you worried? 

19 What were -- that was not at issue, and that was not 

asked. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not -- I'm not 

22 sure that policemen should read Crawford before they 

23 perform their -- their peacekeeping duties. The -­

24 no -- no one questions the right of the police to -- to 

ask these questions and to use the word either "happens"

1 or "happening" or "happened." 

2  The question is whether the -- the answers 

3 are later admissible. Those are two different 

4 inquiries.

 MS. PALMER: Correct. And I was simply 

6 saying the record would have been available to check -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, Crawford 

8 rejects reliability as a criteria. 

9  MS. PALMER: Yes. So our position here 

simply is that you cannot evaluate an ongoing emergency 

11 from hindsight. 

12  When police -- you know, arrive on a scene 

13 and find a wounded man bleeding, they don't know the 

14 circumstances until they can find out what happened, who 

did it, and where did it happen, and try to assess the 

16 risk of harm, as you said in Davis, to themselves, to 

17 the victim, and to others. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have 

19 to do -- we're back to the reliability test, really, 

because they didn't do anything wrong. They were trying 

21 to assess the situation. But that's what they do when 

22 any report of criminal activity occurs. That's a 

23 different inquiry than the inquiry of why should that 

24 statement be permitted to be introduced at trial?

 It goes to the very essence of reliability.

1 Was the statement made under circumstances that would 

2 suggest an intent to testify? That's really what you're 

3 getting at, isn't it? 

4  MS. PALMER: No. No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you are, because 

6 you're trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing 

7 emergency that suggests that in those situations, 

8 whatever the person is saying is okay because it was 

9 done to assess an emergency situation and not done for 

purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of 

11 catching somebody. 

12  MS. PALMER: Which is what this Court said 

13 in Davis, and said that that was not related to 

14 reliability but to formality there, and that that was 

not a formal thing akin to magisterial examinations. 

16  We're not trying to question or in any way 

17 change the test already set forth by this Court in 

18 Davis. We agree with that test. We simply disagree 

19 with the application by the lower court of that test 

here and the limitation it put on it. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So are you saying that 

22 the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be 

23 in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent 

24 emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what 

had -- the nature of the crime?

Official 

1  MS. PALMER: We're not saying that any time 

2 there is a perpetrator at large, there is automatically 

3 an ongoing emergency until that person is caught. 

4  What we are saying is that preliminary 

inquiries on the scene to try to determine who the 

6 perpetrator is and where it might be would be -- would 

7 be nontestimonial -­

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For all crimes, or only 

9 for shooting crimes or knifing crimes? For explosions? 

What kinds of crimes would qualify? 

11  MS. PALMER: I think, obviously, violent 

12 crimes raise ongoing emergencies, emergencies to 

13 which -- more than others. There could also be contexts 

14 in which it would apply to other crimes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So at least whenever the 

16 police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a 

17 violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could 

18 plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not 

19 still nearby, and that testimony will always be 

admissible? 

21  MS. PALMER: It is preliminary questions 

22 designed to assess the risk to themselves, the public, 

23 and -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Strike "designed to assess 

2 the risk." You don't know what they're designed to do. 

3 These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk. 

4 They just asked the questions. And that's what is going 

to happen in future cases. 

6  And you're saying, whenever policemen come 

7 upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it, 

8 what's his name, all of that will always be admissible 

9 because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?

 MS. PALMER: I think if the context shows 

11 that's the primary purpose, then, yes, that will often 

12 be the case. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean? How 

14 could it possibly be admissible?

 First, there has to be a degree of 

16 formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the 

17 kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay 

18 tests. So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, 

19 it is not admissible.

 MS. PALMER: Well, here, for instance, it 

21 was admitted as excited utterance. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course, there are 

23 exceptions. There could, in fact, there could be a 

24 co-conspirator exception. There could be a dying 

declaration exception. But what we're talking about is

1 whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State 

2 law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception -­

3 would permit it in. 

4  So the answer is no, it's not the case that 

whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him 

6 questions, it's going to be admissible. It depends. 

7 The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether 

8 there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Only when he's excited, 

right? Only when the victim who has been the object of 

11 a violent crime is excited. 

12  Or if State law doesn't apply and we're 

13 dealing with a Federal crime and Federal officers, 

14 right, and trial in Federal court? And in that case, 

what Justice Breyer just said would not apply. 

16  MS. PALMER: That's correct. And I -­

17  JUSTICE BREYER: It would not apply? There 

18 are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule? And there 

19 are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER, 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

13  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

14  MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

16  As we understand the rule of 

17 Davis v. Washington, it is a rule that focuses on the 

18 primary purpose behind police interrogation, because 

19 it's designed for a particular purpose: Not to provide 

a comprehensive definition of the term "testimonial," 

21 but rather to identify those statements that are 

22 testimonial because they are made in response to police 

23 interrogation. 

24  When the objective primary purpose of that 

interrogation is to enable police to meet an ongoing

2 possible prosecution, the statements that are given in 

3 response to that interrogation are nontestimonial. That

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you distinguish between 

6 collecting evidence for a future prosecution and 

7 collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the 

8 felon? Do you distinguish those two? 

9  And you can say these police -- these 

policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future 

11 prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter 

12 was and where he was so they could go get him. Would 

13 that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that not be

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it has to be 

21 for the purpose of a future prosecution. Just -- just 

22 in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who 

23 committed this crime, that doesn't qualify? 

24  MS. KRUGER: I think that what would qualify 

under the Davis test is if police need to apprehend the

1 person, not for purposes of bringing the person into the

proven themselves both capable and -­

who has used a weapon that's capable of inflicting 

16 deadly harm on multiple victims in a short period of 

17 time, or someone who has used their fists, like the 

18 alleged perpetrators -­

a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets 

21 admitted into evidence, because the police could -­

18 That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of the 

19 testimonial rule is. That's always going to be the 

case, at least when there's a violent crime. 

21  MS. KRUGER: Well, I think -­

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you may as well take 

23 Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of

1 case at all, Justice Scalia. I think it's actually very 

2 much consistent with what this Court said in Davis. 

3  It may very well have been that the 

4 subjective purpose of the 9-1-1 operator was also to 

bring the perpetrator in that case to justice. But this 

6 Court, I think quite properly, recognized that in an 

7 emergency situation, the attention of both law 

8 enforcement and the declarant is quite properly going to 

9 be focused on dealing with the emergency at hand and is 

not going to be made of the kind of focused 

11 understanding of -­

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: The crime was ongoing in -­

13 in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with 

14 the operator. It was ongoing. She was seeking help 

from the emergency that was occurring to her at that 

16 moment. There's nothing like that here. 

17  MS. KRUGER: It's true that that is a 

18 factual distinction between this case and Davis, but we 

19 don't think that it's one that makes a dispositive legal 

difference. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the police know that 

22 that was the case when they began the questioning? Did 

23 the police know that this man was not on a rampage, that 

24 he was not going to act in self-defense when they came 

after him?

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct. They had no 

6 way of knowing that. And neither, for that matter -- I 

7 think it's important to emphasize -- did the declarant. 

8 The fact that he was able to escape the scene and 

9 managed to drive himself six blocks away in no way 

indicates that he had any -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Will they ever know that? 

12  MS. KRUGER: I -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, is that -- is that 

14 likely not always to be the case when -- when you come 

upon a person who has been the -- the victim of a 

16 violent crime? 

17  You could say it all the time. No, they 

18 didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so 

19 whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a 

trial. 

21  MS. KRUGER: Well, I think it's important to 

22 emphasize that what we're arguing for is not a rule that 

23 would say, as long as there's a violent perpetrator at 

24 large, as long as he is at large, any questions that 

police ask of -- of potential people who have

1 information about the crime will necessarily be 

2 nontestimonial. 

3  Our argument is a far narrower one, and one 

4 that we think follows very closely from the principle 

articulated in Davis, which is when the primary purpose 

6 of a police interrogation is to obtain information 

7 that's necessary to enable them to meet an ongoing 

8 emergency -­

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, how do you know 

that? Because they would ask the same very questions if 

11 what they wanted was testimonial evidence. So you 

12 can -- you can characterize that set of questions either 

13 way. What would lead us to pick one rather than the 

14 other?

 MS. KRUGER: I think it's actually not the 

16 case, Justice Ginsburg, that they would have asked the 

17 very same questions. We know from reading the trial 

18 testimony that the officers, as they appeared on the 

19 scene in response to the police run of a man being shot, 

asked the same question over and over again. Each 

21 officer, as they approached him, said: What happened? 

22 Where did it happen? And wanted to know how to 

23 recognize the shooter so when they proceeded to the 

24 scene, they would know who they were dealing with and 

how to safeguard themselves.

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say that we -- let's 

say that we agree with you that there was an emergency 

6 and the police were asking questions in order to 

7 mitigate the emergency. 

8  What would be the rationale for admitting 

9 this statement, then? Is it more reliable? Because if 

we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which 

11 says reliability is not the key. 

12  What is the reason for that? Is it because 

13 the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -­

14 the statements and to ask loaded questions? That in 

itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's 

16 the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the 

17 rationale for the distinction? 

18  MS. KRUGER: We think that the principle 

19 that this Court announced in Davis and we're asking the 

Court to apply again today reflects two principles that 

21 underlie the Confrontation Clause as this Court 

22 interpreted in Crawford. 

23  The first is that testimony is typically 

24 characterized by the kind of focused understanding by 

the declarant that the person is providing information 

27

1 for potential use in a future prosecution. It's -- the 

2 petitioner in Davis, I would note, made an argument to 

3 this Court that whenever a person calls 9-1-1, they do 

4 so with an awareness that the information they provide 

may be used for prosecutorial purposes. 

6  But this Court rejected that argument, 

7 because it understood, I think quite rightly, that 

8 there's a difference between providing that sort of 

9 information to law enforcement with a sort of vague 

awareness that that might be its potential use, and 

11 doing so with a kind of focused understanding that has 

12 been characteristic of the testimonial statements this 

13 Court has so far identified, like Sylvia Crawford's 

14 stationhouse interview in Crawford or Amy Hammon's 

interview with the police officer from the safety of her 

16 kitchen that resulted in the execution of a formal 

17 affidavit in the Davis case. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we look to the 

19 specific situation? I mean, one of the officers zeroed 

in on the victim. No one was looking around to see if 

21 anybody was lurking in the bushes. Then, as far as 

22 protecting the public, do we take into account that this 

23 was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are 

24 not likely to be many members of the public around? Or 

do we just say you find someone who looks like he has

1 been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter 

2 whether the public is around or not, we -- that's 

3 enough, the victim of a violent crime can be asked these 

4 questions?

 MS. KRUGER: To take your first question 

6 first, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the trial 

7 testimony is not quite as clear on the question of what 

8 fears the officers had as I think Respondent has 

9 suggested in his brief. If you look at Joint Appendix 

page 136, Officer Stuglin testified that he was, in 

11 fact, afraid for his safety when he got to the gas 

12 station. I would note that all of the officers, when 

13 they left the gas station after EMS arrived, they 

14 proceeded immediately to the location of the shooting, 

the location that Anthony Covington had identified for 

16 them. When they got there, they took a tactical 

17 position, they waited for back-up, and they did so 

18 because they were afraid that a shooter was in the 

19 house, and they wanted to proceed very cautiously in 

making sure that they neutralized the threat that 

21 shooter posed to the public safety, including their own. 

22  I think that in examining the exigencies of 

23 a situation a court would be justified in looking at the 

24 circumstances in which the crime occurred, and could 

very well take into account the fact that the crime

1 occurred at 3 o'clock in the morning as opposed to 5

4 what the police officers in this case did, which was 

proceed directly to the scene, not use their interview 

6 with Anthony Covington as an occasion to execute an 

7 affidavit or otherwise engage -­

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but then you're 

9 saying that the focus is on the police officers. I 

mean, after all, we're not saying that police officers 

11 can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects 

12 can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your 

13 friend is arguing for. I still have trouble figuring 

14 out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating 

officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant? 

16  MS. KRUGER: I think that the test that the 

17 Court set out in Davis is one that focuses on the 

18 purpose of the interrogation because of the limited 

19 context in which that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And what do 

21 you do with the last sentence of footnote 1. It's the 

22 one that says -­

examine.

6 volunteered as was Lord Cobham's letter, for example, in

14  MR. VAN HOEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

16  When Anthony Covington made his statement to 

17 the officers at the gas station, not just once but 

18 several times, he reasonably understood that he was 

19 providing the police information as to events which had 

concluded a half hour earlier at a location six blocks 

21 away, with an understanding that that information would 

22 assist the police in locating, apprehending, and 

23 potentially prosecuting the person he felt was 

24 responsible for his injury.

7 a State law or the Federal Rules of Evidence admit it as

likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's

 MR. VAN HOEK: Okay. The reason, Your 

11 Honor, that the Confrontation Clause is the 

12 fundamental -- part of the fundamental law of the 

13 country, and what this Court, I believe, decided in 

14 Crawford and then applied to those situations -- similar 

situations in Davis and Hammon, is that where you have a 

16 statement from a witness to a police officer as part of 

17 a questioning and that statement is the functional 

18 equivalent of testimony that witness would have given 

19 had he or she appeared at trial and been subject to 

cross-examination, then the admission of that statement 

21 at trial even under a hearsay exception without 

22 cross-examination effectively allows the police to 

23 present -­

1 there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be 

2 used at trial? Or it may just happen to turn out? I 

3 mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the 

4 situation? When I looked into history I thought -- I'm 

not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand 

6 there have been situations where the Court's gone back 

7 to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it 

8 doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it 

9 a little bit. I think that that goal could be open to 

us. 

11  So I want to know what the basic reason is 

12 that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say, 

13 an investigation. There's an investigation of a crime, 

14 and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes 

some statements just generally that help the 

16 investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as 

17 co-conspiracy, okay? 

18  What in the Constitution, what functional 

19 principle, is there that says we should keep that out of 

Court? 

21  MR. VAN HOEK: Because I think what this 

22 Court said in Crawford and Davis is that is the primary 

23 test. That is what our Constitution requires to allow 

24 the reliability, the believability, the trustworthiness 

of that evidence to be evaluated by a jury. We don't

6 confederates, all of that's wiped out by Crawford and 

7 the -­

8  MR. VAN HOEK: It would be wiped out if the 

9 statement at issue qualifies as testimonial under the 

test this Court announced in Crawford and Davis.

12 Crawford, isn't it? 

13  MR. VAN HOEK: Yes, it is.

for now because I'm -- is whether there's any sense to 

16 that. What is the constitutional rationale? I joined 

17 Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many 

18 second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended 

19 as I have written it.

 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, I would have to say the 

21 constitutional justification for that is the reason why 

22 the right of confrontation is, isn't it, in the 

23 Constitution, where you had a situation in English 

24 common law, as we said, where magistrates were allowed 

to go out, interview witnesses, come into court, and

I'm looking for. What I'm looking for is I can go into 

6 Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this 

7 was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial 

8 and the Marian judges. And now what I need is a line. 

9 Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done, 

which seems just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar 

11 virtually all hearsay exception evidence, of which for 

12 400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a 

13 lot in the courts.

16  JUSTICE BREYER: What, in your view, is the 

17 correct line and why, most importantly why? 

18  MR. VAN HOEK: I believe this Court in 

19 Crawford and Davis correctly established that line, in a 

situation like this where it is the response of a 

21 citizen to questions from a police officer, that you

23 of that statement. If that's -­

1 contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford? 

2  MR. VAN HOEK: Well, this Court certainly 

3 has suggested that in Giles, that a dying declaration 

4 might be an exception to Crawford as an exception that 

existed at the time of the framing. We don't have to 

6 deal with that question in this case because this is not 

7 a dying declaration. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why not? 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: I understand -- I understand 

that, but assume -- assume for the sake of argument that 

11 it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying 

12 declaration, which the Court has suggested. What does 

13 that tell you about the understanding of the scope of 

14 the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth 

Amendment was adopted? Because a dying declaration may 

16 very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be 

17 testimonial under the Crawford test. 

18  MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. And I think that the 

19 dying -- maybe the dying declaration as being in that 

situation is an indication. What's different about 

21 dying declaration from all these other hearsay 

22 exceptions is that, at the point the statement was made, 

23 it's an understanding that that witness is never goint 

24 -- will not be testifying, that there -- that there is 

no potential that that witness will appear in court in

3 officer arrives at the scene they have no way of knowing

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought -- I thought the 

6 rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they 

7 are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable. You can 

8 certainly question that. But I thought that that was 

9 the rationale that the courts gave.

 MR. VAN HOEK: I think that's correct. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: On your death bed before 

12 you're going to meet the maker, you're not going to 

13 lie -- I think that was the test. So it was a 

14 reliability component, correct?

 MR. VAN HOEK: That's true. And I think 

16 that's -- that's also the -- the background of most 

17 hearsay exceptions is that for the circumstances that 

18 there's some degree of inherent reliability to that 

19 statement which excuses the absence of cross-examination 

if the witness is unavailable. But -­

21 think that the fact that someone calls 911 and makes a 

22 report, whether they're talking about an ongoing 

23 situation or reporting a past event, makes that somehow 

24 inherently more reliable than if they used another 

medium.

1  I think the distinction made in Davis is 

2 that the beginning of the 911 call that Ms. McCottry was 

3 making to the case was not relating past events. It was 

4 a declaration of emergency. It was a call for immediate 

assistance. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't -- isn't the 

7 reason we accept that is because it's reliable? It's an 

8 excited utterance. It's an account of an ongoing event. 

9 It's a contemporaneous observation. Therefore, it is 

reliable. 

11  MR. VAN HOEK: I don't -- no, I don't think 

12 that was the basis on which this Court held it was 

13 nontestimonial. I think this Court held it was 

14 nontestimonial because it was not what a witness does 

during a trial. It was -­

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to this 

17 case. 

18  MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Excited utterance was -­

the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he -­

21 and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened. 

22  I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back 

23 there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited 

24 utterance wouldn't work. Could he have raised dying 

declaration? She said absolutely yes.

1  So my question to you is: Just assume that 

2 we should hold the Confrontation Clause is applicable. 

3 Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say, 

4 well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying 

declaration plea here. So it would only be fair to 

6 allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this 

7 testimony was a dying declaration? 

8  MR. VAN HOEK: Well, in -- in this case, 

9 when -- when the initial attempted admission of this 

evidence, at the preliminary exam, when it met a hearsay 

11 objection, the prosecutor at that point argued that it 

12 was admissible under Michigan evidence rules as either 

13 an excited utterance and/or a dying declaration. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then she did argue dying 

declaration. 

16  MR. VAN HOEK: Well, they argued dying 

17 declaration. The judge sustained the objection and said 

18 he had not established the foundation for either one of 

19 those. The prosecutor at that point established a 

foundation solely for excited utterance. The judge 

21 ruled the evidence admissible and specifically said 

22 admissible only as excited utterance. 

23  At that point, the prosecution abandoned any 

24 attempt, throughout the State court proceedings, to say 

this was a dying declaration.

Court has not reached that question directly, and -- and

6 here who is -- who is threatening you? Is there someone 

7 here who is coming to threaten you or threaten other

3  MR. VAN HOEK: I think that in the absence 

4 of any statement by the witness alleging that there's 

any current, ongoing, imminent danger, if the witness

7 events, then it's not a showing of -- of an ongoing

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the police under those

7 a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous 

8 victims. Maybe it's a gang fight. He's shot one member 

9 of an opposing gang; now he's going to go shoot another 

member of an opposing gang.

8 an answer to this. 

9  But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and 

that line is dividing what I think of as the 

11 Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation, 

12 which I have in my mind as people going into a room and 

13 saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it 

14 out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a 

letter, and they say "bye," and then they walk next door 

16 to the trial and introduce it. I mean, that's Walter 

17 Raleigh, in my mind. 

18  And then, on the other side of the line, is 

19 an -- evidentiary rules that are basically in State 

cases run by the State. And they sometimes let hearsay 

21 in, and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability, 

22 et cetera, judgments in developing their -- their 

23 decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work. Okay?

danger. There have been a string of robberies. They go 

6 around and ask the grocery store people and everything 

7 what happened. Now, I don't know why we should keep out 

8 evidence that, say, is given in that situation by a 

9 confederate. It turns out he was the assistant -- why?

 And if I don't like that, I don't like the

emergency rule, you are perfectly free to say it.

18  MR. VAN HOEK: I -- there is nothing -­

22 victim or another witness -­

arrest someone and see what the situation is. And 

6 they're getting narratives of past events from 

7 witnesses, and they're acting on that. And nothing 

8 about this rule prevents them from doing that. 

9  But the admissibility -- for them to be able 

to come into court, and they alone to come into court, 

11 and say this is what this witness told me and this is 

12 what this witness told me and this is what this witness 

13 told me -- and by the way, defense counsel, those 

14 witnesses aren't going to be here today, and you're not 

going to be able to ask them what they meant by that or 

16 whether they were telling the truth. 

17  No. Mr. Bryant at this trial was never able 

18 to question Mr. Covington. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, but in the past 

that situation you are describing arose only where there 

21 was a hearsay exception. I would imagine most likely it 

22 would be the case of a confederate, someone who was part 

23 of the conspiracy. So if I think if that's going to be

17 in Crawford this Court looked at that and thought that

19 the Roberts standard of whether a statement fell within 

a firmly established hearsay rule, was not sufficient 

21 under the Constitution, under the Confrontation Clause,

1 far afield from the subject matter before us. And I 

2 will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford. 

3 So I'm really asking about that scope and, in 

4 particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or 

to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping 

6 out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a 

7 co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent 

8 to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited 

9 in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.

 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, I'd have to go back to 

11 my answer that the Confrontation Clause is the primary 

12 law of the country, not State hearsay evidentiary rules. 

13 Many of the examples -- the co-conspirator -- the 

14 co-conspirator exception is not going to be applicable 

in many cases because those statements aren't made to 

16 police officers; they're made between co-conspirators in 

17 the course of a conspiracy. That's the foundational 

18 requirement. 

19  It's not going to eliminate hearsay rules. 

Statements made to private citizens, statements made in 

21 a lot of different circumstances are still going to be 

22 evaluated solely under hearsay rules because they're not 

23 going to be defined as testimonial, because they're not 

24 the product of police -- police questioning.

volunteered to the police or in response to questions

18 don't know who it is? What if he's thrown away his gun? 

19 Of course, if they come upon him and he has his gun in 

his hand, then it's not a question. Bu what if he has 

21 disposed of it? They have to know who to -- who to go 

22 for. 

23  MR. VAN HOEK: And they can ask all of those 

24 questions. As Justice Scalia said, there's nothing in 

the -- in this Court's opinion in Davis or nothing in my

2  JUSTICE ALITO: But I still -- I'm totally 

3 puzzled now as to what you -- when you think there's an 

4 ongoing emergency and when there isn't.

 MR. VAN HOEK: I think there's an ongoing 

6 emergency -- that a statement relates -- would become 

7 nontestimonial relating to an ongoing emergency when 

8 there's some indication from the statement made by the 

9 witness that such -- that there's some immediacy. 

There's some request for assistance -­

11  JUSTICE ALITO: It has to be made by the -­

12 by the declarant? It can't be inferred from the 

13 circumstances? 

14  MR. VAN HOEK: No, I don't think just from 

the circumstances, because if you -­

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure it can. If 

17 he says the principal did it. It's -- it's 10 o'clock 

18 in the morning; you assume the principal is at the 

19 school; and he says the principal did it. You can infer 

from the circumstances that he's referring to an ongoing 

21 emergency. 

22  MR. VAN HOEK: I don't -- I don't agree. I 

23 don't agree because if that's the case, any report -- as 

24 Justice Scalia I think said previously, any report of a 

past crime certainly raises the potential that a

2 -­

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's quite 

4 different than saying, you know, this happened to some 

guy driving by, or something like that. If he says the 

6 principal did it, it's at 10 o'clock, it's in the 

7 school -- that suggests to me more, not that the dying 

8 student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that 

9 the principal was convicted, but that there's an 

emergency, something is happening. 

11  MR. VAN HOEK: Well, again, I think that if 

12 all it is that the principal shot someone before, that 

13 basically is I think the -­

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think there's 

a danger implicated by coming onto the lawn of a school 

16 and a student is there and says the principal shot me 

17 inside? You don't think that that suggests an ongoing 

18 emergency, that the principal is still inside with a 

19 gun?

 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, if they ask those 

21 questions and the principal is still inside and there is 

22 an indication that the -­

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no. You 

24 don't want them to have to go through, you know, a whole 

list of questions while the student's there dying and

4  MR. VAN HOEK: No -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- blindly, and he says 

6 he shot me? 

7  MR. VAN HOEK: No. I'm not taking the 

8 position that they have to go through a whole list of 

9 questions before they can do anything. If you go in 

that a situation and a student says the principal shot 

11 someone, certainly nothing about the Davis rule stops 

12 them from immediately running into the school and 

13 determining if there's a situation there. But -­

16  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER 

17  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

18  MS. PALMER: I'd just like to reiterate that 

19 the underlying principle, as this Court has said 

repeatedly in Crawford and in Davis, is formality, and 

21 that's what the purpose of any inquiry should be in 

22 looking at -- at the scene, whether there's an emergency 

23 or not, or declarant's view or not. It all comes down 

24 to formality akin to a magisterial examination. And I 

would also -­

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go to formality. 

2 It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and 

3 everything a victim tells you is admissible. There has 

4 to be some emergency. That's what we've said.

 MS. PALMER: Right. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Correct? So the issue 

7 here is how do you define that dividing line between 

8 emergency and non, when the police officers are just 

9 asking questions that by their nature are always going 

to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try 

11 to use whatever is said later? So, in discerning the 

12 primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying you 

13 can't go by what the police officers are asking because 

14 they are going to be asking dual motive always. You 

have to look to what the declarant tells you. And is he 

16 or she telling you something that suggests an emergency? 

17  MS. PALMER: Well -­

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's really the 

19 difference between the two of you, I think.

 MS. PALMER: Well, even if -- even if you 

21 take that view, that it's the declarant's purpose, 

22 objectively viewed, that controls, I think here it's 

23 difficult to see how Covington's purpose could have been 

24 to provide evidence any more than the 9-1-1 call in 

Davis. I think he was in shock from a bleeding wound.

1 He didn't call the police. They came to him. You know, 

2 this wasn't even a 9-1-1 call where he sought them. 

3 They came to him. It's not clear who called, but it was 

4 not him.

 So even taking it from his point of view, 

6 it's -- it's difficult to see here how the purpose would 

7 have been anything other than, as he said, when is EMS 

8 coming to help me. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what 

you're saying. You mean he has to intend to provide 

11 evidence that he knows will be used at trial? I don't 

12 think that's the test. 

13  MS. PALMER: I don't agree with that, and -­

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: He's intending to accuse 

somebody. 

16  MS. PALMER: Well, I think here he's 

17 intending to seek help because he has been mortally 

18 wounded.
