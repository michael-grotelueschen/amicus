 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-22, Caperton v. 

Massey Coal Company.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a 

fundamental constitutional right. That means not only 

the absence of actual bias, but a guarantee against even 

the probability of an unfair tribunal. In short --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who says? Have we ever 

held that?

 MR. OLSON: You have said that in the 

Murchison case and in a number of cases, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A guarantee against even --

MR. OLSON: Yes, the language of the 

Murchison case specifically says so. The Court said in 

that case: "A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic 

requirement of due process. Fairness, of course, 

requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of 

cases, but our system of law has always endeavored to

prevent even the probability of unfairness."

 And in that paragraph, the Court goes on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Has always endeavored."

 MR. OLSON: Pardon?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Has always endeavored." 

"Has always endeavored."

 MR. OLSON: Yes, but that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And there are rules in the 

States that do endeavor to do that.

 MR. OLSON: But the Court has said that 

frequently, not only the probability of bias, the 

appearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent 

suspicion of bias. The Court has repeatedly said that 

in the context -- a series of contexts or cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Probability" is a 

loose term. What -- what percentage is probable --

MR. OLSON: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you've a 50 

percent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance? Probable 

means more than 50?

 MR. OLSON: It's probable cause, Mr. Chief 

Justice. The Court frequently decides questions 

involving due process, equal protection, probable cause, 

speedy trial, on the basis not of mathematical 

certainty, but in this case where an objective observer

would come to the conclusion -- knowing all of the 

facts, would come to the conclusion that a judge or 

jurist would probably be biased against that individual 

or in favor of his opponent, that would be sufficient 

under the Due Process Clause, we submit. The Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it mean the same 

thing as likelihood of bias?

 MR. OLSON: The Court -- the Court, Justice 

Ginsburg, has used the changes interchangeably. We 

think the probably -- the "probable" standard is the one 

we would advance to this Court. But the -- but the 

seminal case, the Tumey case, said that even if there 

was a possibility -- any procedure where there would be 

a possible temptation for the judge not to hold the 

balance nice, clear, and true, would be the standard. 

But -- and the Aetna -- in the Aetna v. Lavoie case not 

very many years ago, the Court repeated that standard, 

and that standard has been repeated again and again. 

The likelihood or the possibility or even the temptation 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you claim that there is 

such a temptation here because of gratitude?

 MR. OLSON: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You've been around 

Washington a long time. How far do you think gratitude

goes in -- in the general political world?

 MR. OLSON: Well, let me put it this way, 

Justice Scalia. If -- an ordinary person would say that 

it would be very difficult for a judge to hold the 

balance nice, square, and true when that judge has just 

been put on the bench during the pendency of the trial 

of the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million 

to his election.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- that 

person contributed money to my election because he 

expected me to be a fair and impartial judge. And I 

would be faithful to that contributor only by being a 

fair and impartial judge. That is showing gratitude. I 

should do what he expected me to do, and I have no 

reason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases 

in order to come out his way. What I expected he wanted 

me to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful 

to him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by 

being a good judge.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I would go back to the 

words of this court in the Tumey case, the seminal case: 

"Due process is not satisfied by the argument that men 

of highest honor and greatest self-sacrifice could carry 

it out without danger of injustice."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't a matter of honor

and sacrifice. You talk as though what gratitude 

consists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but 

that is not necessarily what gratitude consists of. 

Gratitude consists of performing the way this person 

would like me to perform. Now, in this case, I will 

acknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based 

upon more. This contributor never even met the judge, 

did he?

 MR. OLSON: Well, it's not clear. There is 

a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They're certainly not good 

buddies.

 MR. OLSON: We're not claiming that there is 

a basis based on personal relationship, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And his contributions, as I 

understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to 

the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that 

-- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in 

favor of the plaintiffs' bar. And if -- if the 

contribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to 

me it would simply be that this other candidate would do 

what he promised in his campaign and that is not be an 

activist judge and not distort the tort law of the 

State.

 MR. OLSON: Well, if I can address part of

the premise of your question and invite the Court to 

look at page 188a of the joint appendix. This addresses 

the point that you just made that he was contributing 

his money to defeat Justice McGraw as opposed to 

supporting Justice Benjamin. On page 188a is one of 

those financial disclosure reports that's required by 

West Virginia law. It's filed by Mr. Blankenship and it 

says on that page: "Expenditures made to support or 

oppose," and he underlines the word "support," and then 

he types in the word "Brent Benjamin."

 Then if you'll turn over to page 200a, which 

is the last page of that report, that shows that he 

directly spent $508,000 of his own money to support 

Justice Benjamin.

 Now, to the larger part of your point, the 

context of this case suggests that, while the appeal was 

going to be coming to the -- to the West Virginia 

Supreme Court, Mr. Blankenship, who was the CEO, 

chairman, major stockholder and a -- the prime mover in 

the case that gave rise to liability in this case, 

decided to unseat Justice McGraw, who he thought would 

be unfavorable to him, and elect Justice Benjamin, who 

he thought would be favorable to him.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if, instead of 

having the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade

group that's making the donation. Ten companies form a 

trade group. Is the judge recused in the case of every 

one of those companies?

 MR. OLSON: I think that -- I think the 

answer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but this 

is, like your cases involving reasonable search and 

seizure, it's going to require an analysis of the 

complex of circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's just 

take this case, the same amount of money, except it's 

not from an individual, not from that individual's 

company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up 

by ten.

 MR. OLSON: I think the Court would -- a 

reasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts 

would not feel that that -- that trade group was not a 

party to the case, who is not personally involved in 

having a personal stake in the election or the outcome 

of that particular case, but may be interested in a 

panoply of cases or judges that approach things in a 

certain way; that would not give rise to what you're 

concerned about here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, okay. Now, 

I'm sure you know where I'm going next. What if it's 

five companies in the trade group? When do you decide

that there's a probability? I take it if there are two 

companies, under your theory there would be a 

probability of bias?

 MR. OLSON: If those are the companies that 

are a party to the case, if it's when their case is 

pending, if it's a vast magnitude -- the magnitude --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, can I stop you 

right there, "When their case is pending." The Massey 

Company has a lot of cases pending, so is it only those 

cases that were pending on the day of the election?

 MR. OLSON: No, I think that that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then we 

shouldn't talk about pending cases.

 MR. OLSON: Well, no. I think that that is 

-- I answered your question whether it's only those 

cases. That is a part of the circumstances that would 

give rise -- you have decided, this Court has decided 

that the possibility that a $12 benefit, the Tumey case, 

might ultimately come to the judge is a disqualifying 

interest. You've decided in the Monroeville case that 

because the adjudicator was the mayor of a town who 

might receive some fines --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's the 

whole distinction that your friend on the other side 

makes. Those cases involve financial interest and the

recusal rules are, you know, if you have one share of 

AT&T stock and it's in AT&T, you have to recuse. But 

this is different. This is a probability of bias, not 

financial interest.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I would submit that your 

cases say that when the judge has an interest in the 

case and that interest leads to the likelihood of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, they don't say that.

 MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are only two 

categories of cases, only two categories. One -- one is 

where the judge is almost the aggrieved party in 

conducting contempt proceedings against someone who is 

contemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is 

cases where the judges have a financial interest. 

That's far from this broad category of whenever there is 

a possibility of bias.

 I was appointed to the bench by Ronald 

Reagan. Should I be any -- should I have been any less 

grateful to Ronald Reagan than -- than the judge here 

was grateful to the person who spent a lot of money in 

his election?

 MR. OLSON: Well, let me -- let me answer 

that. There's more parts, there's more than one part to 

that question. Let me answer the first part first. The

Court hasn't said that there are only two categories of 

disqualifying bias. I submit the Court has said that 

it's an interest in the outcome. That interest in the 

outcome might be financial --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Two categories are the only 

categories in which it has applied that.

 MR. OLSON: I respectfully submit, Justice 

Scalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't 

have a personal financial interest. He had what the 

Court called a partisan interest because the money that 

might have been assessed in the way of fines might have 

come to the city. In the Lavoie case, the judge didn't 

have a direct financial interest. He had an indirect 

potential financial interest. In the Johnson v. 

Mississippi case, the judge had been named in an 

institutional suit about racial bias and whether juries 

should be -- those -- there's a panoply of 

circumstances, all of which add up, Justice Scalia, I 

submit, to a situation where a judge is -- a reasonable 

person would suspect that the judge would have a hard 

time, in the words of this Court, "holding the balance 

nice, clear, and true."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nice, clear, and true. Are 

you going to tell me why I shouldn't have been grateful 

to Ronald Reagan?

MR. OLSON: And I was going to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And he had a lot of, a lot 

of issues coming before me while his presidency 

continued.

 MR. OLSON: In the first place, there is a 

-- there is a significant difference with respect to the 

framers of the Constitution who gave the members of this 

Court and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very 

purpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary. 

There is a separate consideration that this Court has 

mentioned because of the fact that judges and justices 

of this Court cannot be replaced if they feel that they 

must recuse themselves. There is -- another interest is 

institutionally presidents appointing justices all of 

the time for a variety of reasons, but not to attempt to 

affect the outcome in their case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

United Mine Workers. If they give a contribution to 

somebody's campaign, is that judge then recused in every 

labor case? Or I don't know if they give contributions 

or not, but a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 

because they think the other judge is too lenient in DWI 

cases, so they give contributions. Is their preferred 

judge recused in every DWI case?

 MR. OLSON: No, Chief Justice Roberts.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or are those all 

factors and circumstances we have to look at?

 MR. OLSON: Well, of course they're factors 

and circumstances, but the -- when -- when an individual 

or a group of individuals makes contributions in the 

context of elections -- and we are going to have State 

elections of -- of judges. We have them in 40 -- 39 

States, and there's no sign that those are going to be 

discontinued any time soon.

 But when a group of individuals or an 

individual is -- is making contributions because they 

think the jurist is going to be sensitive to -- to the 

rights of criminals or sensitive to the rights of 

victims of criminals, those are generic concerns that 

people participating in the electoral process --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, also, if there 

is a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even 

United Mine Workers, involving particular union members, 

and the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that 

-- that judge is recused?

 MR. OLSON: I can't -- I can't rule out a 

situation where there is a potential litigant who has a 

stake in front of a case. The amounts here have to be 

taken into consideration, too.

question in this case is this: In your petition for 

certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came 

here you would have a standard for us that we can work 

with. You know, all of us know, that a ruling in your 

favor means that law and motion practice will -- could 

-- could change drastically in States all across the 

country. Disqualification for bias will now become a --

a part of the pretrial process, and I'm asking you what 

your standard is.

 Your standard is an unacceptable risk of 

impropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some 

more specific standards within which to fit this case. 

You give a general standard, and then we hear about the 

amount of the contribution. We hear about the fact that 

it was a contested election, et cetera.

 MR. OLSON: It would be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your standard 

of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give 

sufficient -- or "unacceptable risk of bias" doesn't 

give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this 

rule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case. 

Now, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system. I 

understand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the 

standard you offer us is specific enough.

 MR. OLSON: Well, there are several answers

to that. In the first place, the Conference of Chief 

Justices of all of the States of the United States filed 

a brief in this case and said that we need a standard 

with respect to recusals for extraordinary campaign 

contributions in cases. They also said that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was their standard the same 

as yours? I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in 

this case. The various amici and -- and you come up 

with, you know, a wide divergence of standards. And all 

of them say: By the way, these seven factors or five 

factors or six factors, whatever they say, are not 

exhaustive; There may be others as well.

 MR. OLSON: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right?

 MR. OLSON: That's because, Justice Scalia, 

the -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection 

with standards like due process or probable cause or 

speedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down 

with levels of specificity. It would be very inviting 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to articulate 

some substandards that have -- that are general in 

nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are 

more specific than the probability of bias.

we approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy, 

is the probability of bias is something that this Court 

has said repeatedly. But let me answer your question 

this way: When the circumstances, including the timing 

of the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the 

contribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable 

person in possession of all of the facts -- these are 

all words from these courts' decisions -- to believe 

that the judge would have a difficult time being other 

than biased in favor of one of the parties, that would 

be the standard that would be applied. It's a general 

standard, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: To what --

MR. OLSON: -- the Conference of Chief 

Justices --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent do you 

rely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that 

you have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in 

fact a prime culprit from the point of view of the 

plaintiff? That is, Blankenship, who made all these 

contributions, is charged with driving Caperton out of 

business. So he is not simply the CEO of the company 

that's named as the defendant, but he is targeted as the 

perpetrator. So that's an -- an additional factor.

 Is that just one of a laundry list, or is

that central to your view that there is really an 

appearance of impropriety here?

 MR. OLSON: It is very much central, but 

it's not exclusively central. If the -- and -- and that 

is absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. On pages 63 

through 65a of the joint appendix, for example, are the 

specific post-trial motion findings of the judge saying 

that the prime mover in the -- in the conduct that was 

declared to be fraudulent and a deliberate effort to 

drive this company out of business was Mr. Blankenship. 

So factually that's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

MR. OLSON: That is a central factor. If he 

had given one dollar --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But not the only central 

factor.

 MR. OLSON: It's not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You said it's one central 

factor.

 MR. OLSON: Well, that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You really have no test 

other than probability of bias. We can't -- we can't

this Court that uses terms like "appearance of bias," 

"likelihood of bias."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not for situations 

that have such an infinite variety as -- as the 

appointment of judges and the election of judges and --

and as funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund 

or joining some agglomeration of -- of other 

institutions that fund.

 The -- the variety is immense, and you give 

us nothing to hang onto except, you know, case by case 

we're going to have to decide whether there's a 

probability of bias.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it would be -- it would be 

-- I would be delighted to say that the standard was 50 

percent of the contributions in an election, and we 

would come along in a case where there would be a very 

small amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all 

of those situations are distinguishable.

 I admit this is not easy, but the Conference 

of Chief Justices specifically said, to get back to 

Justice Kennedy's question, what did they propose and 

are they proposing something comparable to us? They are 

-- they are -- and this is on page 4 of the Conference 

of Chief Justices' brief. They are the judges who would 

have to live with this decision. They said: (A), we

need it, extraordinary, out of line campaign support 

from a source that has a substantial stake in the 

outcome of the proceedings where those extreme facts 

create a probability of actual bias.

 And then they go on to say, to answer the 

floodgate problem that my opponent raises -- this is 

going to open the floodgates, and you will have nothing 

but recusal motions. They explicitly state that concern 

is not -- is unfounded. No bright line rule can or 

should be attempted. These are the judges --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think it would be 

easier to solve the problem, as some States have done, 

not by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever 

judge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but 

simply limiting the amount of contributions that can be 

made? Isn't -- isn't that a much more sensible 

solution?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the States are perfectly 

free to do that. But let me --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And some of them are doing 

that.

 MR. OLSON: Let me make this point, Justice 

Scalia. The contribution limit in West Virginia is 

$1,000. Mr. Blankenship contributed $1,000, and then he 

put up three million additional dollars, three thousand

are the States really free to do that? We have 

recognized First Amendment interests in participating in 

the electoral process before. I mean, would your 

approach constitutionalize McCain-Feingold at a State 

level?

 MR. OLSON: I -- I think that this Court's 

-- this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence 

acknowledges the appropriateness of campaign 

contribution limits, the very point that Justice Scalia 

just made, and other limits. And in -- and, in fact, 

States have limits against corporate contributions, 

limits against union contributions. I think the United 

Mine Workers incident came up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this -- this 

MR. OLSON: But -- but the -- and -- and the 

States do have limitations with respect to what 

litigants can do.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Mr. Olson, the 

very fact that they do raises what I think is one of the 

difficult issues in this case, and it's raised by --

specifically by the -- the brief of the nine States, 

Alabama and so on. And -- and I would put it this way.

It's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the 

problem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as 

not only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a 

substantive due process kind of problem.

 One of the factors that goes into the 

recognition of at least a substantive limitation when 

there has been none before is -- is the issue of timing. 

Is the political process in fact working now toward a 

solution? Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total 

unreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and --

and the courts ought to stay their hands. So my 

question is, what do you say to the argument that there 

is a political process going on addressing this issue? 

And I forget the details, but my recollection is that it 

may well have been that brief pointed out that the State 

of West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation 

since these events began to transpire.

 So the nut of the question is, is 

the political process in process and is that a good 

reason for us to stay our hand in recognizing a new 

procedural or substantive due process right at this 

point?

 MR. OLSON: I think there are -- there are 

more than one answer to that question. One, the 

political process to which you refer is spiraling out of

control. There is a financial arms race in judicial 

elections in various States throughout the country, and 

the briefs --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I think we all 

recognize that. Is there -- is there a 

counter-political process going on?

 MR. OLSON: It hasn't done the job so far, 

and the trend seems to be in the opposite direction, but 

even if it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What happened in West 

Virginia?

 MR. OLSON: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is my recollection correct 

that West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of 

limiting legislation?

 MR. OLSON: I believe that is correct, but I 

don't think that would have addressed the problem in 

this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they closed the 

527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much 

above the individual limit.

 MR. OLSON: Irrespective of that, I was 

going to go on and answer this in response to Justice 

Souter's question. The Conference of Chief Justices, I 

think, provide a second answer to that question. They

are the ones where the rubber meets the road, so to 

speak. They are saying, and the entire conference is 

saying, we need some guidance here with respect to a 

constitutional limit --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they propose a 

seven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know 

a lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests. 

Public Citizen has ten factors, the ABA has four 

factors. In an effort to see if this can be put in more 

concrete terms, I wonder if you would be willing to say 

categorically that your -- the holding that you're 

proposing would not apply under any of these situations: 

Where the judges are appointed, where there are massive 

contributions and a hotly contested election, but the 

issue is not an economic issue, it's a social issue; 

where there isn't any specific issue headed for the 

court but there are massive contributions by, let's say, 

the plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar? Could you say 

categorically in any of those situations that your rule 

would not apply?

 MR. OLSON: I would hesitate -- I would 

hesitate to do so, Justice Alito. I think you've put 

your finger on some of the circumstances that would take 

it out of the context of the appearance of justice for 

sale.

I'm going to reserve, if I may, the balance 

of my time, but finish with a reference to the principle 

that we're articulating here is not new to the 

jurisprudence of the western world and the legal 

jurisprudence that we come from. In the Magna Carta the 

king promised: "To no one will we sell justice." And 

Blackstone repeated that and restated it and stated: 

"For injury done to every subject, he may take his 

remedy by the course of law and have justice freely 

without sale."

 This circumstance in this case involves the 

appearance of judges being bought. Now, we're not 

saying that there's actual bias because there's actual 

-- as this Court has repeatedly said, that's impossible 

to prove, and that's why the appearance of probability 

of bias is so important to the respect that we need to 

have for the judicial system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Frey.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FREY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

statutory amendment, they did, as Justice Scalia

suggested, close the 527 loophole and limit 

contributions by individuals to 527 groups to $1,000 

after the 2004 election in response to the concern about 

the amount of money that was being spent through 527 

groups in that election. So I think this is a situation 

where the States are dealing with it legislatively and, 

and as I hope to get to in a minute or two, the Court 

has recognized that this is -- repeatedly recognized 

that this is something that is meant to be dealt with 

through legislative or canons of judicial ethics or 

codes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it -- is it --

this Court's decision in the Republican Party of 

Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a 

legislator. Are you extending that notion that an 

election is an election to this area of the appearance 

of impropriety? I mean, is it your position that the 

judge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and 

legislators all the time are beholden to interest 

groups?

 MR. FREY: Well, of course I don't agree 

that Justice Benjamin was in the least beholden to 

anybody in this case. But the Republican Party case was 

a case about the First Amendment right of candidates in 

an election to speak their position on issues. I'm not

sure that I follow what this has to do with this case. 

But I will say that this is not a case about 

appearances. The petition was about appearances. 

They've -- the other side has withdrawn or it has 

abandoned an appearance argument, and with good reason 

because the Due Process Clause --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frey, is it your 

position that the appearance of impropriety could never 

be strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?

 MR. FREY: Well, we might have appearance of 

impropriety overlapping with conditions that would 

justify --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm assuming appearances 

only. Are you saying that appearances without any 

actual proof of bias could never be sufficient as a 

constitutional matter?

 MR. FREY: I think we are.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that your position?

 MR. FREY: We are saying that the Due 

Process Clause does not exist to protect the integrity 

or reputation of the State judicial systems.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not an answer to my 

question.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing, for example, 

the judge had campaigned on the ground that he would 

issue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and 

the United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money 

saying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our 

favor in all the cases we're interested in. Would that 

create an appearance of impropriety?

 MR. FREY: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or take another example. 

The Chief Justice asked what if there are ten members of 

a trade association and would all -- and they all 

contributed to get a judge to vote in their favor in a 

case that involved a conspiracy charge among the --

charged the ten of them for violations of the Sherman 

Act, something like that. And if all ten of them raise 

money publicly for the very purpose of getting a judge 

who would rule favorably in their favor, that would 

clearly create a very extreme appearance of impropriety. 

Would that be sufficient, in your judgment, to raise a 

constitutional issue?

 MR. FREY: If you were -- if -- if you 

thought there was no basis for believing there was 

actual bias, but it looked bad --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, it would meet the test

be tempted under the circumstances. That's the test 

that the Conference of Chief Justices judges --

MR. FREY: That I don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And do you think that 

could ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due 

process issue?

 MR. FREY: No, I don't think just appearance 

could ever raise a due process issue.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No matter how extreme the 

facts?

 MR. FREY: The question is whether there is 

actual bias of a kind that is recognized as 

disqualifying. The Court has recognized --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The whole point of this 

case is it has not been recognized. We have never 

confronted a case as extreme as this before. This fits 

the standard that Potter Stewart articulated when he 

said "I know it when I see it."

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREY: I would take exception to the 

characterization of this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we adopted 

his principle, did we, in the obscenity area?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The question is not 

whether we have, but whether we should.

MR. FREY: I hope to address that question. 

Let me start off by pointing out, as Justice Benjamin 

said in his opinion on discussing the recusal issue, his 

July opinion, which I commend to the Court, he is being 

asked to recuse on the basis of activities of a third 

party over which he had no control, in a case whose 

disposition offers him no current or future personal 

benefit, and where he has no personal connection with 

the parties or their counsel, has expressed no opinion 

about any of them. He has done nothing that would call 

into question his objectivity, his impartiality.

 I think that's a very important point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the view that 

Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause? 

Wasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the 

company, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action 

insisting on that very point, that in recusal matter --

-

MR. FREY: Well, that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it wasn't -- well, 

maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was. It was a 

charge --

MR. FREY: Yes, it challenged the procedure. 

That's not an issue that's before the Court here, and 

our -- our position today is that this Court has

consistently allowed recusal matters to be decided by a 

-- the single justice who is challenged. I don't think 

the Court thinks it's unconstitutional to do that.

 I understand the -- the concerns about 

having the judge making the decision about whether 

recusal is required, but that is not the practice of 

this Court, and if it's not the practice of this Court I 

frankly doubt it's unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was the position 

that Blankenship took?

 MR. FREY: Well, it was -- no, not 

Blankenship. Massey.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may not be per se 

unconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing 

factor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system 

that we have depended on up to this point is not working 

very well.

 MR. FREY: Well, I don't think -- I don't 

think the system -- I don't -- I don't agree that the 

system is not working well. I mean, of course there are 

adjustments --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And in fact --

MR. FREY: -- but appearances, but 

appearances -- I don't mean to interrupt you. If I'm --

 MR. FREY: Appearance is a standard for 

recusal, a nonconstitutional statutory standard for 

recusal in virtually every State, so we already have --

and in the Federal system, so --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. And we have -- and we 

have an appearance standard under the ABA Canons, but I 

think it would be difficult to make a very convincing 

argument that that standard was effective in this case.

opinion. I -- I --

been?

 MR. FREY: I think I would agree that 

reasonable people could have a different view one way or 

the other about whether there is an appearance of 

impropriety for Justice Benjamin sitting. I would agree 

with that. I don't think I would go further than that 

because my personal view is that there was no 

impropriety, that it was reasonable, and if you read his 

opinion I think you'll see a -- a fair, balanced, 

thoughtful statement of the reasons why he feels he 

could sit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to be able to 

elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you 

know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance 

standard has -- has much to recommend it. In part it 

means that you don't have to inquire into the actual 

bias; it's -- it's more objective. Now, of course it 

has to be controlled, it has to be precise. But I just 

thought that you know that I -- I do have that 

inclination.

 MR. FREY: But -- but we're here on the 

question of constitutional requirements and the 

Constitution --

protection.

 MR. FREY: Well, what you're really asking 

is whether you should abandon what is a fairly clearly 

stated rule and practice of this Court, dating back to 

the common law, that questions of bias in general as 

opposed to interest are matters for legislative 

resolution and not for -- not for constitutional --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course the appearance 

standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable. Once it is 

clearly established that a certain -- certain set of 

facts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is 

solidly established, then the set of facts right next to 

that suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety 

because it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously 

improper. And -- and so we go down and down and down. 

And I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule 

that is a sliding scale like that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, you can stop at 

what is obviously improper.

 MR. FREY: I don't -- I think, first of all, 

the Petitioner has not advanced on the merits in this 

case an appearance standard. A lot of the --

that? Because I was taking appearance, likelihood, 

probability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice

Marshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a 

grand jury, and he said that due process is denied in 

circumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance 

of bias. And there are other decisions, too, that use 

those terms interchangeably. So I don't know that 

probability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance --

that -- those seem to me synonyms.

 MR. FREY: All right. Well, if you're 

viewing them as cinnamons -- synonyms, then the question 

is whether that kind of standard is a -- is the 

constitutional standard; and let me say about the Tumey 

case which -- the "possible temptation" language in the 

Tumey case, which is of course a wide open standard: 

That was discussed only after the Court said questions 

of bias are not constitutional, they're for the 

legislature; questions of interest, pecuniary interest 

in the Tumey case, are. And then the language that Mr. 

Olson quoted came in the discussion of the question of 

whether the pecuniary interest was substantial enough to 

create a disqualification, constitutional 

disqualification.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think you're quite 

right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is 

that the reason -- why is appearance never 

constitutional? Why should that be? Can you talk about

that?

 MR. FREY: Because it seems to me to be --

if we're talking about appearance as distinct from 

actual bias or probable -- you know, I can understand a 

rule that says the probability of bias is enough. I 

think it would be a very ill-advised rule without 

historical foundation, without foundation in the Court's 

precedents, and open-ended and creating all kinds of 

problems; but I can understand that rule. That at least 

is addressed to the right of the party to get a fair 

trial.

 Appearance is addressed to a different 

thing. It's addressed to the reputation of the judicial 

system, which is not, I think, the function of the Due 

Process Clause to address.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?

 MR. FREY: Because I think the Due Process 

Clause is concerned with the fairness of the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think the 

community's confidence in the way judges behave is an 

important part of due process?

 MR. FREY: No, I think it's -- it may be a 

systemically important value. But I think as long as 

the judge is impartial in the -- in the case at hand, I 

don't think there's a problem.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But our whole system is 

designed to ensure confidence in our judgments.

 MR. FREY: Well, I don't -- I think this is 

a side point.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems -- it seems 

to me litigants have an entitlement to that under the 

Due Process Clause.

 MR. FREY: Well, I don't think so, but I 

don't think it -- I don't think it really essentially 

matters. We're -- we're dealing with a semantical 

quibble here, where the real question is, is possibility 

of bias, a temptation of bias, a subconscious effect 

that -- even a probability of bias, whatever -- there's 

a lot of different standards that have been put 

forward -- is that a constitutional basis for 

disqualifying a judge, A? B, if it is sometimes a 

constitutional basis for disqualifying a judge, is it a 

basis under the debt of gratitude theory? And, C, if 

the debt of gratitude theory is a viable theory -- for 

reasons I hope to have a minute or two to address, I 

think it's not viable -- does it apply on the 

circumstances of this case?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you -- I mean, 

there were a few recusal motions in this case. Judge, I

think it was Matthew, moved to disqualify Judge 

Starcher, and Justice Starcher did indeed recuse 

himself. He had spoken out against what went on here. 

If he had refused to recuse after speaking out as he 

did, would that be compatible with due process, the due 

process owed to the Massey Company?

 MR. FREY: That would raise an interesting 

question and I think a much closer question than this 

case, because that would involve the question of whether 

-- there is -- the Court has recognized that where a 

judge is embroiled with a litigant, and has a personal 

animosity arising out of the relationship with the 

litigant, that is a -- that is possible ground for 

recusal. So it's a -- it's a stronger case. I'm not 

sure it's strong enough.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the animosity 

was directed at Judge Benjamin?

 MR. FREY: No, no. The animosity is 

directed at Massey and Mr. Blankenship, who were --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you think the 

Constitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you 

think due process might have been violated if that judge 

had remained on the bench?

 MR. FREY: I think it's a closer case. I'm 

not prepared to say that it would have been violated

even then.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Frey, you've tried a 

couple of times to -- to get to your -- your point that, 

even if we assume probability of bias is the standard, 

the debt of gratitude would not qualify. I'll be candid 

with -- to say that I don't see why probability of bias 

is necessarily an inappropriate constitutional standard, 

whether we should adopt it or not. But would you give 

your argument on why the debt of gratitude could not 

qualify?

 MR. FREY: Of course. I'd be happy to.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because that may illustrate 

the point.

 MR. FREY: Let me say just one point about 

probability of bias, which is conceptually -- the rule 

is quite clear at common law, as the Court knows, that 

that was not a ground for disqualification of a judge. 

Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I don't know what 

common law -- how much help common law is. Common law 

didn't have elected judges.

 MR. FREY: No, but it had --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Common law did not have 

this contribution system, which your colleague referred 

to as spiraling out of control.

MR. FREY: That's the point I wanted to 

make, that while common law did not have elected judges, 

it had the issue of bias. After all, elected judges are 

not really the issue here. The issue is not whether 

judges should be elected; the issue is whether --

whether there should be disqualification for bias. That 

is an issue that the common law confronted. This is not 

like some novel situation that has arisen that the 

common law didn't deal with.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't deal with an 

abstract setting. We have the setting of elections, of 

elections of judges and millions of dollars spent on 

them. That's the context in which this case arises.

 MR. FREY: Yes, I understand, and the 

question is whether that -- that gives rise to bias. So 

let's -- let's turn -- let's turn to the question of 

whether the debt of gratitude theory, which I take it is 

the principle that would underlie disqualification in 

the election context --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't take it as the 

principle, but I take it as an application of the 

principle. And I thought if you get to responding to 

the application, I may understand your position better 

on the principle.

 MR. FREY: Debt of gratitude I think is a

principle. You have to ask yourself what is the reason 

why somebody would conclude -- why a court would 

conclude that Justice Benjamin is -- is not biased.

 And let me say that one of the key elements 

which is not mentioned by the other side which is very 

important is the presumption of impartiality. It goes 

back to Coke and Blackstone. Judges are clothed with a 

presumption of impartiality. There has to be something 

that overcomes that presumption. And let me say that, I 

ask the Court to ask yourselves if you were in Justice 

Benjamin's situation, do you really think you would be 

incapable of rendering an impartial decision in a case 

involving Massey? Because if the answer to that is no, 

if the answer to that is you would not be incapable of 

rendering an unbiased decision, then there's no 

justification for saying that Justice Benjamin would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on your 

challenge to the probability of bias as a standard. Do 

you think it's an unworkable standard or that even if 

there is a probability of bias, that should not be 

constitutionally disqualified?

 MR. FREY: I think it's an unworkable 

standard, and -- and I ask the Court to look at --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it any more 

unworkable than probable cause in a Fourth Amendment

 MR. FREY: Well, the Fourth Amendment has

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it has probable 

cause as a standard.

 MR. FREY: If there was a standard that said 

judges should recuse themselves when it would be 

reasonable to suppose that there was bias, if the 

Constitution said that, we wouldn't be here today or we 

would be here arguing about whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me get back to the 

question. Why is probability in this context any more 

difficult to figure out than probability in the Fourth 

Amendment context?

 MR. FREY: I'm not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or is it?

 MR. FREY: I'm not sure of the answer to 

that. What I am sure is that if you start down the road 

of debt of gratitude, which I think is the animating 

principle if there is going to be a probability of bias.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm not -- I'm not 

asking you about debt of gratitude. I'm asking you why 

isn't the probability standard perfectly administerable, 

just as it is in the Fourth Amendment? And surely you 

would agree --

and provide standards. I think that could be done.

regard to the reasonableness standard. We -- it's not a

standard?

waiting.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREY: I've been trying to get to it, 

but I was answering Justice Stevens's question.

 The problem with debt of gratitude is that 

it's not a principle with any reasonable limit. If you 

apply it here, if you say there's a debt of gratitude 

here, then you have the question about all the other 

circumstances. The plaintiffs' lawyers gave a million 

and a half dollars to Justice McGraw to support his 

reelection. Suppose he had won? What do you do? It's 

true that no one individual gave a lot of money, but 

it's -- if you're looking at it in terms of what is the 

probability of bias, it's at least as great, if not 

greater than here. The doctors gave $750,000 to 

Benjamin.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't the only 

theory. That is, in my own mind -- I don't know if you 

want to call it "probability" or "possibility," you 

don't manacle a defendant in a courtroom even though 

this jury may not have been affected. I read the 

opinion Justice Benjamin wrote, it was a very good 

opinion. I sympathized with his problem. Okay? So I'm 

not talking about him. I'm talking about we don't 

manacle defendants because many jurors, maybe not this

one, would have been adding affected, and that seems the 

problem here.

 The debt of gratitude I think, no, that 

isn't the theory that underlies it, though it may in 

part. It's that you have here the largest amount by a 

factor, an order of magnitude perhaps, I mean hugely 

greater than any other contribution given to a judge by 

a single person.  It doesn't just affect the fast 

through gratitude. A normal human being also thinks, if 

I play my cards right, maybe it will be repeated, and 

they'll want to keep me in office. And we have the fact 

of how it looks, and we don't have a situation where the 

something like this is inevitable, where you appoint 

judges. It's inevitable that there will be an 

appointment. I mean, hey, but that isn't true of 

sitting on this kind of case.

 So we have all those things that make it 

extreme. So what is the problem? If we say there is an 

envelope that the Due Process Clause doesn't touch, and 

that envelope is greater, and we touch less, if the 

States are regulating it themselves. Where they're not 

-- and this is way outside the envelope -- at that point 

the Due Process Clause comes into play. Now, end of 

opinion. Now, what terrible mess will the Court get 

into if they write just that?

MR. FREY: Well, if you have a -- you have 

to have a logical principle. I'm sorry, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: A logical principle or, I 

thought, if I was mentioning all those things that might 

lead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the 

past, because of the size, in the fact that it's a 

single individual, in the fact that there's a case 

coming up that's likely that the judge will decide --

all those things that are listed by the chief justices 

in their brief, all those things together make it a 

serious risk that there will be bias, even though an 

individual might not be. There is a serious risk.

 Call it a "probability"; call it an 

"appearance." Use the language that you want, but put 

them together, and they spell "mother."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter what 

language you use because it's pretty vague anyway --

"probability," "likelihood," "appearance" -- it doesn't 

really --

JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you understand what I 

mean? I'm not worried about what you call "probability" 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frey, why don't 

you take a shot at answering it?

MR. FREY: I don't agree with you, Justice 

Breyer. I think you have to -- you have to have a 

reason. You don't have a decision that's good for this 

case only. You have to have a decision that's 

principled, and when -- and when you ask what is the 

principle, what is it that would cause Justice Benjamin 

-- and by the way, let me say that I think if Justice 

Benjamin was moved to do anything, it's to vote against 

Massey or to recuse himself to avoid the controversy 

that would attend a vote for Massey that he knew was 

going to happen. And if you look at page 692 of the 

joint appendix, he actually discusses that problem.

 So I don't think you can even predict which 

way these circumstances would cause him to go, but I do 

think you need a principle, and the principle is either 

debt of gratitude or hope of future benefit.

 As to the hope of future benefit in this 

case, that is totally not viable for a couple of 

reasons. One is Justice Benjamin's not running for 

another eight years.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How long has Massey been in 

business, eight years?

 MR. FREY: A long time. Sure. A long time.

MR. FREY: But you wouldn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If one is going to go into 

that calculation, one is going to assume that in eight 

years, there's going to be another three million dollars 

waiting to be spent.

 MR. FREY: That -- well, there's several 

problems with that, Justice Souter. The first is 

there's no more likely to be spent on Justice Benjamin 

than on any other member of the court who might be 

sympathic.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, one has hopes.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREY: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: One has hopes.

 MR. FREY: A lot of members of the Court 

would have the same exact hopes, with another reason, 

they might be running sooner, they might end up with an 

opponent who is more distasteful to Mr. Blankenship.

 By the way, Mr. Blankenship is not Massey. 

They are two separate things.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say that and I 

say that because we took corporate law. But in -- in 

terms of my brother a moment ago spoke of we've been 

around Washington for a while, and I don't think that 

fine distinction counts very much on the issue that 

we've got.

MR. FREY: But why would -- why would 

Blankenship be more likely to support Benjamin than to 

support Justice Davis or justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We'll have to see when the 

next election comes along. An expectation has been 

created that if there is an interest, the money will be 

spent, and it seems to me that underlies Justice 

Breyer's analysis just as it does mine.

 MR. FREY: Where that takes you is all the 

judges have to recuse themselves because they all have 

the possibility of garnering support.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They all have not had the 3 

million.

 MR. FREY: But either you look to the past 

and you look at debt of gratitude, and in our brief we 

have indicated a number of circumstances where the same 

debt of gratitude rationale would apply. There are a 

lot of things that led to Benjamin's election, and 

Blankenship's money is not necessarily the main thing at 

all. And if you're looking forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but with respect, 

Justice Breyer disassociated his question from debt of 

gratitude. I understand you -- you are arguing against 

a debt of gratitude theory, but if I recall his 

question, it was not based upon the debt of gratitude

theory.

 MR. FREY: Right, but what I'm saying is you 

can't. If -- if you're looking at -- at where -- where 

would the bias come from, and I'm assuming now that some 

probability of bias standard is accepted by the Court, 

and I'm asking where would the bias come from. It 

either would come from a debt of gratitude for past 

contributions or an expectation of future benefits. If 

it's an expectation of future benefits, it is not 

reasonable to assume that Benjamin has any stronger 

expectation than other members of the court. So it 

seems to me you're in a position where if he has to 

recuse, they all have to recuse.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then debt of 

gratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running 

out, have you said what you need to say on debt of 

gratitude?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really anxious to hear 

what you have to say on debt of gratitude.

 MR. FREY: Well, okay.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREY: I don't know. Some of the ground 

is covered already by questions during Mr. Olson's 

argument. I think the debt of gratitude cannot be 

limited consistent with neutral principles to large

endorsements. Clearly you could have a debt of 

gratitude there. Newspaper could be a party in the 

case.

 You have the plaintiff lawyers and the 

doctors which we've talked about. You have labor unions 

getting out the vote. You have political figures 

endorsing. And you have appointed judges and -- and to 

say that there's no -- to say that you're going to carve 

out the gratitude that the judges feel toward the 

president who appointed them -- I mean, the fact is in 

the Nixon tapes case, and in Clinton --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frey, there is 

obviously a difference between appointed judges and 

elected judges. But why do we have to rest on just one 

factor? The Conference of Chief Justices suggested 

their seven factors should be taken into account. Why 

is that totally unworkable? Why does it have to be just 

one theory, debt of gratitude and nothing else?

 They don't -- the chief judges who are 

elected don't think that's the way to do it.

 MR. FREY: I think you're mixing up two 

different things. What is the -- one question is what 

is the wellspring of the bias? Why do we think the 

judge has bias? And the second question is how do we

measure that?

 And what I'm saying is if you think that 

Justice Benjamin would be biased in this case, which I 

certainly don't, and I think his track record has shown 

no bias in favor of Massey, then why would -- why would 

an appointed justice, appointed by a president in a case 

where the president's personal interests are at stake 

not have the same feelings of bias, and yet justices sit 

in those circumstances.

 Justice Scalia, you mentioned that the words

The words "due process" are in the Constitution, and 

that is what we're talking about today. This Court has

fair tribunal.

fair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position? That, 

I submit, is not the question, because this Court has 

repeatedly said actual bias is something that's 

virtually impossible to prove, the counsel of -- the 

Conference of Chief Justices said don't go there. We 

can't ever determine that.

 And so the question is what is -- is someone 

likely to be biased, likely to be unfair?

 And, Justice Kennedy, one of the factors 

that led us to the conclusion that an objective 

standard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the 

facts would probably be biased is language from a number 

of these court -- this Court's decisions, including your 

concurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky, 

L-I-T-E-K-Y -- in which you said the objective observer 

would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's 

impartiality.

 Now, that's a case involving section 455 and 

not the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with 

respect to the application of the test and the ability 

of this Court and other courts to apply it, as the 

Conference of Chief Justices said they could, is the 

same.

 MR. OLSON: The -- the -- there's a number 

of questions. In the first place, there's life tenure 

for federal judges.

 Secondly, was that appointment made --

JUSTICE ALITO: Specifically if Justice 

Benjamin were term limited, would this case be 

different?

 MR. OLSON: No, I think it wouldn't be 

different because of all the confluence of 

circumstances. If a detached observer, again to use 

Justice Kennedy's words --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, you can't have it 

both ways. I mean, if your response to the first 

question is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't 

respond to the second question would it make a 

difference if he was term limited by saying, no, it 

wouldn't make a difference.

 MR. OLSON: He might be running for another 

court, he might need the benefits. This was $3 million 

in a race in which that amounted to more money than 

everybody else collectively put into this race while 

this case was pending.

 Now, the language that I think is important

is from the Tumey case, might not a defendant with 

reason say that he would fear he would not get a fair 

trial. So instead of the question that my opponent 

asks, would you be fair, which is not the standard 

because actual bias isn't the test, would there be a 

perception, likelihood, probability appearance of bias, 

to use the language used by this Court over and over 

again.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --

MR. OLSON: Ask yourself this question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 

protective donations? You actually give, not three 

million, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you 

don't want deciding your case. And it comes up, and you 

say, you have to recuse yourself because --

MR. OLSON: As this Court has said, I think, 

in one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to 

try to game the system in that way. What I was getting 

to instead of the question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know? I 

mean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every 

case that the judge is going to rule against the 

particular entity?

 MR. OLSON: It's not going to be clear in 

every case, Mr. Chief Justice. It's going to be would a

detached observer conclude that a fair and impartial 

hearing would be possible? So instead of the question 

that Mr. Frey was asking whether you, yourself, could be 

-- I would like to ask you to ask this question. If 

this was going to be the judge in your case, would you 

think it would be fair and would it be a fair tribunal 

if the judge in your case was selected with a $3 million 

subsidy by your opponent?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a reasonable 

person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?

 MR. OLSON: That is the standard that 

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Would a 

reasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the 

lawyer and the judge were very close friends?

 MR. OLSON: No, I don't think so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think so? 

A reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all 

the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings, 

whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for 

recusal.

 MR. OLSON: Then if it was a basis for a 

recusal, you would have to be recusing all the time, 

because that is a standard that's reasonable question of 

impartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the

State codes. The courts handle these decisions all of 

the time. These are factors, and I think I would go 

back to Justice Stevens' and Justice Breyer's question, 

this is a situation where there has got to be some 

limits.

 Our opponents say there's -- bias tribunals 

are not prohibited by the Due Process Clause nor 

probably biased or the appearance of bias. We think 

there has to be some constitutional limit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
