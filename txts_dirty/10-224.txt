3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-224, National Meat 

Association v. Harris. 

6  Mr. Wells. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. WELLS 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. WELLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Congress has unmistakably ordained that one 

12 set of rules govern animal handling and treatment, 

13 inspection, and determinations of meat quality for sale 

14 at federally inspected slaughterhouses from California 

to Maine, and those rules kick in at the slaughterhouse 

16 gate, and they continue through the sale of the meat by 

17 the slaughterhouse. California has enacted its own set 

18 of rules regarding nonambulatory animals, rules which 

19 were intended to be and are different than and in 

addition to the Federal rules regarding the handling of 

21 nonambulatory animals. 

22  Where Federal law sets requirements for 

23 receipt and allows for receipt if the -- if those rules 

24 are followed, California law bans receipt of the animals 

altogether.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about purchase? What 

2 about -- what about the contract to purchase? The 

3 California law addresses that. Do you -- do you contend 

4 that that is pre-empted as well?

 MR. WELLS: We do, Your Honor. And --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: How so? 

7  MR. WELLS: Justice Scalia, the reason 

8 that -- the reason that we do is because, to the extent 

9 that purchase is -- is even relevant with respect to a 

federally inspected slaughterhouse, I think all the 

11 parties agree that it occurs on or after the receipt; 

12 so, it's part of the operational process. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: What if it weren't? What if 

14 it took place at an auction site apart from the 

slaughterhouse? 

16  MR. WELLS: Well, Justice Kagan, I --

17 because the scope of the FMIA starts at the gate of the 

18 slaughterhouse and ends with sale, California, I think, 

19 could regulate and not -- not have its regulation be 

expressly pre-empted if it attempted to prevent purchase 

21 before the purchase occurred. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or contract of purchase. I 

23 mean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the 

24 slaughterhouse itself, they could make it unlawful for 

the -- the person who raises the animals to sell them

1 when they're nonambulatory and unlawful for the 

2 slaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long 

3 as the contract is off the premises? 

4  MR. WELLS: So long as the -- so long as the 

contract -- so long as title didn't pass, Your Honor, or 

6 the -- it didn't interfere with what happens on the 

7 premises from the gate through sale, then I believe that 

8 would not be expressly pre-empted by --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. WELLS: -- by Federal law. There could 

11 be implied pre-emption issues, however, in that 

12 circumstance --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, your -- your 

14 position is if the contract for purchase is consummated 

in some way on premises, that's pre-empted? And so, 

16 your answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia is that 

17 if the purchase contract occurs before the animals 

18 arrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse, that that 

19 would not be pre-empted?

 MR. WELLS: Not be expressly pre-empted. 

21 Again, there may be implied pre-emption issues, but if 

22 the law -- I think, Your Honor, if the law is intended 

23 to target --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, your whole 

argument is on express pre-emption.

1  MR. WELLS: Yes, Your Honor. Absolutely 

2 right. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've given up any 

4 argument on implied.

 MR. WELLS: Before -- we've not raised that 

6 argument before this Court. That's correct. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please tell me why you 

8 think the sale of the meat is expressly pre-empted. The 

9 Solicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of 

the meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law 

11 is involved only with the operations and -- of the 

12 premises and manner of slaughtering and has nothing to 

13 do with sales. So, why is the sale of the meat 

14 pre-empted?

 MR. WELLS: Your Honor, sale is a -- it is a 

16 practical step. And the word "operations" as used in 

17 678, I think all the parties agree it encompasses all 

18 the practical steps of the slaughterhouse. Sale clearly 

19 is the last practical step, to which all other practical 

steps are directed. So, it is an operational step. It 

21 would be news to the slaughterhouses that sales is not a 

22 part of their operations. That's --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how about there's a 

24 law that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs, or horses, 

or you can't sell cats, dogs, or horses for slaughter?

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or for consumption. 

4  MR. WELLS: I'd have to put --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that pre-empted? 

6  MR. WELLS: It -- it would be. Well, with 

7 respect to cats and dogs, the answer would be no, 

8 because those are not amenable species that are subject 

9 to inspection at a federally inspected slaughterhouse. 

So, that's outside the scope of the FMIA. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a Federal 

12 regulation to that effect? 

13  MR. WELLS: No -- yes. Only amenable 

14 species can be slaughtered. Amenable species are 

defined at U.S.C. -- 21 U.S.C. section 601 subsection 

16 (w). And cats and dogs are not amenable species. So --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: And what's that definition? 

18  MR. WELLS: Well, the definition is -- it's 

19 kind of a roundabout definition, Your Honor. Amenable 

species is -- mentions -- I mean, frankly, it mentions 

21 catfish and -- and other species, and then all of the 

22 animals which were amenable species prior to the 

23 amendment of the Act in 2005. We set that forth in 

24 footnote 11 of our -- our brief, but it clearly includes 

swine, and it includes -- it includes horses. It 

7

Official 

1 includes cattle, obviously. 

2  JUSTICE ALITO: So, the Seventh Circuit 

3 and -- and I forget what the other circuit was -- were 

4 incorrect in saying that the -- that the State could 

prohibit the slaughter of horses? 

6  MR. WELLS: Yes, Your Honor. I believe they 

7 were incorrect, although I would say that, even under 

8 the rationale that the Fifth and Seventh Circuits used, 

9 their rationale would not save this State law. And the 

reason that it wouldn't is, even if you were to decide 

11 that those -- those cases were decided correctly, the 

12 rationale that the court used was we can interpret those 

13 States' laws in a way that the -- the laws never have to 

14 affect the operations of the slaughterhouse because we 

can interpret those laws to keep the animals off the 

16 slaughterhouse -- off premises. 

17  It's easy to identify what's a horse and 

18 keep it off the premises. That's not true with 

19 nonambulatory animals. Nonambulatory animals present 

with the symptom of nonambulatory-ness on the premises 

21 or on the trucks that are waiting to arrive on the 

22 premises. So, there is no way that this State law could 

23 be interpreted in a way not to operate on premises. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't it seem 

strange to hold that the Federal Meat Inspection Act

1 speaks to an issue like that? This doesn't have 

2 anything -- whether or not horses should be slaughtered 

3 and sold and their meat should be sold doesn't have 

4 anything to do with food safety, does it? And it 

doesn't have anything to do with humane treatment, 

6 assuming the same methods of slaughter are used? 

7  MR. WELLS: Well, I would disagree, Your 

8 Honor. It clearly has to do -- this issue clearly has 

9 to do with both of those issues. As the State has 

admitted on page 6 of its brief, this law was intended 

11 to address both -- both humane handling of animals, 

12 which is covered directly in section 603(b) of the -- of 

13 the Federal --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: No, I wasn't speaking of the 

California law. I was speaking of the law that 

16 prohibits the -- the slaughter of horses --

17  MR. WELLS: Well--

18  JUSTICE ALITO: That's based just on a 

19 judgment, a societal judgment, that this is an animal 

that should not be slaughtered and sold for food. What 

21 does that have to do with any of the purposes of the 

22 Federal Meat Inspection Act? 

23  MR. WELLS: Well, because Congress has made 

24 a different -- a different judgment, Justice Alito; and 

what Congress has said is we have identified -- we, 

9

Official 

1 Congress, have made a moral judgment that the following 

2 species are amenable and may be inspected on 

3 slaughterhouse premises. And to the extent that the 

4 State is making a different moral judgment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that presumably is why 

6 Congress excluded cats and dogs? 

7  MR. WELLS: That -- Congress -- correct. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, Lassie -- Lassie and 

9 Kitty are no good?

 MR. WELLS: Congress made a moral judgment 

11 that --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: But Dobbin is all right. 

13  MR. WELLS: I believe that's right, Your 

14 Honor. It's a moral -- it is a moral judgment by 

Congress as to which animals are going to be amenable 

16 for slaughter and which ones aren't. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Young, you suggested 

18 that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there 

19 would still be a difference because of ease of 

identification. You can tell a horse is a horse and 

21 keep the horse away from the slaughterhouse. Would it 

22 be possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory 

23 swine? And I guess my question is, do nonambulatory 

24 swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the 

slaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine

1 earlier? 

2  MR. WELLS: They -- nonambulatory swine 

3 become nonambulatory -- may become nonambulatory in 

4 transit. They may become nonambulatory on the 

slaughterhouse premises. The only way that the 

6 slaughterhouse operator knows that an -- that an animal 

7 that has been transported has become nonambulatory, 

8 however, is when the truck is brought onto the premises, 

9 the gates are thrown open, and the animals are 

shepherded off, and one of them doesn't move. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: But I guess the -- the 

12 State could make it unlawful for a rancher or -- what 

13 are the people that ship the animals to you called? 

14 Could it --

MR. WELLS: Could be a rancher or a farmer. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: A rancher or farmer could 

17 make it unlawful for them to ship a nonambulatory swine, 

18 could they not? 

19  MR. WELLS: Your Honor, Congress actually 

has enacted regulations that don't -- they don't apply 

21 to slaughterhouses because, again, the scope with 

22 respect to slaughterhouses started at the slaughterhouse 

23 gate. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but as far as this 

statute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law

1 that forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a
 

2 nonambulatory swine, right?
 

3  MR. WELLS: That's correct. There are
 

4 Federal -- I should point out, there are Federal
 

regulations that govern the transportation of dead, 

6 dying, and diseased animals. They don't apply to 

7 slaughterhouses. They may apply in the situation that 

8 Your Honor is contemplating. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

that your argument on sales would apply at the front end 

11 as well. You say sales can't be regulated because it's 

12 really just a way to get to the regulation of what goes 

13 on at the slaughterhouse. Wouldn't that concern also 

14 apply at the front end?

 MR. WELLS: Well, Your Honor, our argument 

16 about sale is slightly different, and it's a little 

17 different than the argument that's being made by the 

18 Government. Our argument with respect to sale is there 

19 are requirements specifically regulating sale. That's 

found in 21 U.S.C. section 610(c). That says, 

21 essentially, meat may not be sold if it is adulterated, 

22 or, to put it another way, you may sell the meat if it's 

23 unadulterated. So, that's a requirement. It's within 

24 the scope of the FMIA. It -- it goes directly to sales 

as an operation. 

12

1  And it is different than and in addition to 

2 the State regulation because what the State -- the State 

3 adds another condition. They say you may not sell the 

4 meat if it is from a nonambulatory animal, or, looked at 

the other way, you may sell the meat as long as it's not 

6 from a nonambulatory animal. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- isn't 

8 that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow? 

9 You may not sell meat if it's been adulterated doesn't 

mean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been 

11 adulterated; right? 

12  MR. WELLS: Well, no. I think --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One is a limitation, 

14 not a grant.

 MR. WELLS: Well, I think, though, that 

16 there were -- I think that -- the Federal -- what the 

17 Federal Government has done is established a requirement 

18 for the sale of meat. California has established 

19 another requirement for the sale of meat.

 Under Federal law, one requirement for the 

21 sale of meat is that it not be adulterated, that it pass 

22 through inspection, that it be stamped "USDA approved," 

23 all the conditions that happen at a slaughterhouse. The 

24 State, though, has set forth a different condition, and 

that is you may not sell that meat unless it comes from

1 a nonambulatory animal --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't it the case that 

3 most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because 

4 of the method of transportation that's used? Do you 

dispute the statistics in the brief of the non-State
 

6 Respondent that -- Respondents that, nationwide,
 

7 approximately 220,000 swine die during transport,
 

8 another 440,000 become nonambulatory during the
 

9 transportation process?


 MR. WELLS: I don't -- Your Honor, the short 

11 answer is I don't know where those statistics come from, 

12 and to my knowledge they are not accurate. But I don't 

13 have additional statistics to --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute the fact that 

the reason -- that ranchers generally do not ship 

16 animals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip 

17 begins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals 

18 become nonambulatory during the transportation process? 

19  MR. WELLS: I think that is a fair 

assumption, Your Honor, with respect to pigs that 

21 present being nonambulatory when -- when the doors to 

22 the -- to the truck are opened. I think that that's 

23 correct. I think that the practice is not to ship 

24 nonambulatory animals if you know beforehand that they 

are nonambulatory.

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: And you think it's difficult 

2 to identify which animals are nonambulatory? That's the 

3 difference between horses -- between prohibiting the 

4 slaughter of horses, because you can tell whether it's a 

horse or a pig, but you can't tell whether a pig can 

6 walk? 

7  MR. WELLS: No. It isn't the only 

8 difference, Your Honor. Really, it -- the -- what I'm 

9 really saying is the -- the condition of being 

nonambulatory presents on the slaughterhouse premises. 

11 And so, there is no way for a law to -- no way for us to 

12 say the California law can be interpreted in a way that 

13 will not tell a Federal slaughterhouse what to do and --

14 and how to do it with respect to nonambulatory animals. 

That's not true in the horse case. In the horse case, 

16 you can say keep the horses out. The -- the Federal 

17 slaughterhouse doesn't have to have anything to do with 

18 horses. So --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Would it be possible --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me, if it's 

21 okay for California to say you can't sell a 

22 nonambulatory animal and that that applies to everyone 

23 off the slaughterhouse premises, is that -- that's 

24 basically your position. So that if the purchase occurs 

on premises, then the person who's selling it, even if 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 it's not the slaughterhouse, can still sell it on the 

2 premises? 

3  MR. WELLS: If I understand your question, 

4 Your Honor, if the -- if, let's say just for the 

shorthand, if title passes on the premises, if that's 

6 how it's understood in the industry and that's what it 

7 is, that would be pre-empted. But if the law took 

8 effect --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What a -- what a 

fascinating area of immunity. Now what we're saying to 

11 auction houses and everyone else is don't pass title 

12 until you get to the slaughterhouse. 

13  MR. WELLS: Well, Your Honor, it's just -- I 

14 mean, I think the -- the real question is what has the 

Federal Government said about nonambulatory animals in 

16 general, and are those amenable species and may they 

17 be -- may they be slaughtered and turned into food? And 

18 the Federal regulations deal directly with that 

19 situation. So, whether title passes before or after, if 

the animal is on the Federal premises, there are a whole 

21 series of Federal regulations that tell the 

22 slaughterhouse worker exactly what the worker is 

23 supposed to do with that animal. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Does that mean that a State 

could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's 

16

25

Official 

1 say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop 

2 at the State facility before it gets to the 

3 slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check 

4 to see whether there are nonambulatory animals and make 

sure that those animals don't go on to the 

6 slaughterhouse? Would a State be within its rights to 

7 do that? 

8  MR. WELLS: Your Honor, the language of 

9 section 603(a) says that the inspection is to occur 

before they enter the slaughterhouse. Now, that has 

11 been interpreted by the Secretary to essentially mean 

12 immediately before; so -- so, trucks in line. 

13  So, I think, under -- on Your Honor's 

14 hypothetical, if the State had set up their own 

inspection program right immediately outside of a -- of 

16 a federally inspected slaughterhouse, that currently 

17 would be within the scope of the FMIA, because that's 

18 how the Secretary has defined it. The further upstream 

19 it goes, though, the -- the less likely it is to be 

expressly pre-empted. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if they do it at the 

22 weigh station that a truck has to stop at when it enters 

23 the State, that would be okay? 

24  MR. WELLS: That would not be expressly 

pre-empted, Your Honor. There might be implied

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

8  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  I haven't heard any quarrel this morning 

12 with the proposition that if an animal goes down, say, 

13 as it's entering the abattoir to be slaughtered, that 

14 the State cannot at that point tell the slaughterhouse 

how it is to handle that animal. 

16  But that is not any different, of course, 

17 than the situation where a pig goes down as it's coming 

18 off the truck, or it presents as nonambulatory when the 

19 gates of the truck are opened, because it's still an 

operational consideration; the same humane handling 

21 requirements still apply; it's still a State 

22 requirement; and it's not -- it's still different from 

23 the Federal requirements. 

24  So, the Court's questions this morning, I 

think, have gone to kind of the situations at the 

18

1 margins, at the extreme. So, let me try to -- try to 

2 address some of those questions. 

3  The -- the question about whether -- the 

4 question about the purchase of the nonambulatory animal 

and the regulation, the regulation there, the first 

6 thing is, as a practical matter, I think you have to 

7 think about it in a concrete situation, which is that 

8 there is a nonambulatory animal that's on the 

9 slaughterhouse premises. That's the hypothetical that 

we're in. And the question is, what is the 

11 slaughterhouse employee to do with that animal? And the 

12 State law says, well, you can't buy it, you can't hold 

13 it, you can't receive it, you can't turn it into meat, 

14 and you have to immediately euthanize it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you get to that 

16 point, the animal has to be transported. Does Federal 

17 law regulate for humane purposes the transportation of 

18 animals to slaughterhouses? 

19  MR. HORWICH: There are Federal laws 

regarding transportation. The Federal Meat Inspection 

21 Act has not been interpreted by the Secretary to apply 

22 specifically to trucks that are in transit, although I 

23 should say that the Secretary has, for example, 

24 interpreted the FMIA -- and this is in part 309.1(b) --

to apply, at least to the extent of humane handling, to

4 as I think, Justice Kagan, your hypothetical envisioned, 

where a State determined that it wanted to essentially 

6 assert an inspection jurisdiction over animals that were 

7 in transit to a slaughterhouse -- so, essentially 

8 between the pen and the slaughterhouse -- the Secretary 

9 might well recognize that -- that his authority needs to 

extend -- needs to extend to those, because the purpose 

11 of the Act, after all, is to set a Federal inspection 

12 standard for animals to determine if they're suitable to 

13 be turned into meat. And in your --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Federal -- if 

Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation 

16 of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why 

17 should a State law that aims at that objective be 

18 pre-empted? 

19  MR. HORWICH: Well, if you -- if you 

disagree with -- if you disagree with me about the scope 

21 of the FMIA in that regard, the State law with respect 

22 to the handling of the animals while they're in transit 

23 wouldn't be pre-empted. But, of course, the injunction 

24 that I understand Petitioners to be seeking is not one 

that goes to State regulation of trucks but, rather, to

1 State regulation of animals that are on the 

2 slaughterhouse premises. And the Secretary has made 

3 unmistakably clear that the scope of the FMIA is at 

4 least as large as the official slaughter establishment's 

premises. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the State could 

7 inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to 

8 the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing 

9 when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more 

practical to do that? 

11  MR. HORWICH: Well, accepting the premise of 

12 your hypothetical that the State could do the inspection 

13 on the truck --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute -- you 

dispute that? 

16  MR. HORWICH: I dispute that, but I'll 

17 accept that premise. Even if I accept that premise, the 

18 question here is different because the Secretary has 

19 drawn a line that says the scope of the FMIA -- and 

that's -- the question is the scope of Federal law here. 

21 That's in section 678. The Secretary has made very 

22 clear that the scope of the FMIA extends to -- to all 

23 animals that are on the premises of the establishment. 

24 That's -- you can look at appendix --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, is there anything

1 saved to the State? I mean, there is a savings clause. 

2 Once you get to the entrance to the slaughterhouse, is 

3 there any room for any State regulation? 

4  MR. HORWICH: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. 

I mean, State laws of general applicability would, to 

6 the extent they don't in some particular application 

7 intrude into the scope of the FMIA, they would apply. 

8  And I also want to be very clear, so that 

9 there's no mistaking the Government's position: State 

prosecutions for animal cruelty are not pre-empted to 

11 the extent they are prosecuting conduct that is unlawful 

12 under Federal law, because that is -- that is an example 

13 of a State that is not applying a different or an 

14 additional standard of conduct but simply adding --

applying its own sanction for conduct that Federal law 

16 would similarly sanction. So, there's absolutely room 

17 for State -- the application of State law on the 

18 premises of the slaughterhouse. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In that respect, do State 

inspectors routinely go on the premises of 

21 slaughterhouse to ensure that their coextensive laws are 

22 properly enforced? And if that's so, are there problems 

23 of judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is 

24 okay under Federal law, and the State official says, no, 

this is not okay under the State law, even though they

1 say the same thing? 

2  MR. HORWICH: I'm -- I am not aware that in 

3 general State inspectors or other State officials would 

4 go to a federally inspected premises as a general 

matter. But let's assume for the sake of argument that 

6 they were, and then your question -- excuse me --

7 presents the question about these sort of differences in 

8 judgment that might be made. The Federal regulations 

9 generally provide that the disposition made by 

veterinarians, by Federal veterinarians, is the 

11 conclusive judgment of the Secretary as to the fitness 

12 of the animal for turning into meat. And so, in that 

13 situation, the State official would not be able to reach 

14 a different judgment on that question. And so, I -- so, 

I think that would resolve any situation where State 

16 officials were there. 

17  Of course, the situation where State 

18 officials do inspections is the one that the Act itself 

19 envisions and that California has not taken the 

opportunity to implement, which is for intrastate-only 

21 plants, States can enact their own inspection 

22 regulations and have their own inspectors there as long 

23 as they're following Federal standards at a minimum. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: What am I supposed to do --

I have a quick procedural question, which I think is

25

Official 

1 similar to Justice Ginsburg's. Suppose this is three
 

2 sections, the State law, and some of them have three
 

3 parts. Suppose I thought, well, the word "buy" -- I
 

4 mean, "buy" might cover an awful lot of things that
 

don't have much to do with operations. Maybe sometimes 

6 they do. Suppose I ended up thinking that, but I 

7 thought you were right about all the rest of it. What 

8 am I supposed to do? 

9  MR. HORWICH: Well, I would like to have an 

opportunity to take issue with your premise. But the 

11 answer your question --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I'm just doing 

13 that hypothetically. 

14  MR. HORWICH: Yes. Yes. The answer to your 

question is this case comes here on preliminary 

16 injunction; so, I think the Court could appropriately 

17 articulate its answer and its understanding of the 

18 different provisions, and that probably would then lead 

19 to the lower courts working out the particulars of the 

injunction. 

21  But let me actually make a point in that 

22 regard about what the injunction might or might not look 

23 like with respect to the buying provision, which is that 

24 I don't understand the State to have some free-floating 

interest in when title does or doesn't pass. The State

Official 

1 is interested in regulating what animals can be 

2 purchased because of a background principle of State law 

3 that I assume exists, that slaughterhouses can't 

4 slaughter things they don't own.

 And if you put those two pieces together, 

6 the ban on buying is nothing -- is nothing but doing in 

7 two steps what the State clearly can't do in one step, 

8 which is tell slaughterhouses how they are to deal with 

9 an animal that is on their premises. At least, they 

can't -- States can't tell slaughterhouses how to do 

11 that when there is a Federal regulation on the subject. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have to peel this 

13 onion in order to decide this case? I mean, do we have 

14 to go through --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

17 the statute and say this is in, this is out, this is in,

19  MR. HORWICH: Well, I have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't we just either affirm 

21 or reverse the particular preliminary injunction that 

22 was -- that was issued here? 

23  MR. HORWICH: I think the Court could --

24 could do that, although I think there's some concern 

that if the Court were to find -- to have some concern

1 with some specific aspect of the injunction -- and I

3 there would be some concern that vacating the injunction 

4 so that it could be corrected would leave the -- the 

Petitioner in a spot where it wouldn't have protection 

6 from the vast majority of provisions --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: But what I discover is 

8 there are at least 11 different provisions in this, and 

9 I have exactly Justice Scalia's question.  Do we have to 

write an 11-part opinion where we treat each of these 

11 different things, which are different, separately and 

12 analyze it? I'm not trying to get out of the work. I 

13 just want to know. 

14  (Laughter.)

 MR. HORWICH: Well, I think -- I think the 

16 Court --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to get out of the 

18 work, to tell you the truth. 

19  (Laughter.)

 MR. HORWICH: The right way to get out of 

21 the work would be to understand that -- that California 

22 has made every effort here to implement a provision 

23 that -- to implement one underlying requirement, which 

24 is that it wants to tell slaughterhouses: Don't turn 

these animals into food; immediately euthanize them

1 instead. And the rest of these are just ways of 

2 implementing that underlying requirement. And this 

3 answers your question --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we agree with you 

about that. We say, if I agree with you about that, 

6 there we are; you're supposed to pick up this animal 

7 which is on the slaughterhouse floor and kill it right 

8 away. That seems to have to do with operations. All 

9 the rest of these other 10 provisions are just 

variations on that theme, according to the Government, 

11 and we send it back for them to argue this out below. 

12  MR. HORWICH: If there would be anything 

13 left to argue out below at that point. I think --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are 10 other 

parts. There are 10 other parts. 

16  MR. HORWICH: Well, there are the 10 parts, 

17 but I actually want to answer -- well --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to give a 

19 one-sentence answer?

 MR. HORWICH: I think I can. 

21  -- Justice Sotomayor's question, which is 

22 the question about the sale of the meat, which, again, I 

23 think fits under the rubric that it's just implementing 

24 the underlying prohibition that California seeks here.

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN K. SMITH 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 

6 please the Court:
 

7  In order to be pre-empted here, the State
 

8 provisions have to be -- excuse me -- the State law
 

9 provisions have to be within the scope of the Act and
 

with respect to the premises, facilities, and 

11 operations. None of the State provisions are within the 

12 scope, and some are not even operations. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you define the 

14 scope?

 MS. SMITH: The scope are the -- the 

16 mandates of Federal law dealing with the method, 

17 quality, and marketing of turning animals into meat for 

18 human consumption. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, now 

explain how under your definition it's not among at 

21 least one of those. 

22  MS. SMITH: None of the provisions are 

23 within the scope because California is not regulating 

24 animals that are going to be turned into meat. And the 

Federal Meat Inspection Act, the purpose of the Act, the

Official 

1 legislative history of the Act, show that the scope of 

2 the Act is concerned with animals that are going to 

3 become meat. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is that true, Ms. 

Smith? I thought that under the Federal program some of 

6 these animals could become meat, that under the Federal 

7 program, you take a nonambulatory animal and you say, 

8 well, some of them might be condemned, but some of them 

9 are suspect, and if they're only suspect, it may be that 

eventually they'll be turned into meat. 

11  MS. SMITH: That is correct. But the entire 

12 purpose of the Act is to inspect and examine animals to 

13 determine whether or not their meat will be wholesome 

14 and unadulterated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. No. Provisions 

16 of the Act, at least as amended, also require humane 

17 treatment of the animals while they're being processed. 

18 That has nothing to do with whether the meat is any 

19 good. It has to do with humane treatment of the 

animals. 

21  MS. SMITH: The humane treatment of the 

22 animals deals with animals in the connection of 

23 slaughter or while being slaughtered. And the animals 

24 that California is regulating, the nonambulatory animals 

that we're withdrawing from the process, will not be 

29

1 slaughtered, will not be turned into meat. Even the --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I don't -- you mean 

3 the Federal requirements of humane treatment do not 

4 apply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal 

will not be slaughtered for meat; then the 

6 slaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor 

7 animal? That can't be right. 

8  MS. SMITH: Well, the language of the 

9 regulations -- of the Federal regulations dealing with 

U.S. condemned animals, for instance, say that U.S. 

11 condemned animals shall be killed and shall not be 

12 slaughtered and dressed in the same facility with 

13 animals that will be turned into meat. So, even in the 

14 regulations there's a distinction between animals that 

will be slaughtered for meat and that will be edible and 

16 ones that are -- are condemned and will be killed. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the provision 

18 that says that they will not be exposed to sharp --

19 sharp instruments that can injure them? Does that apply 

to only those that are going to be sold for meat? 

21  MS. SMITH: It applies to -- well, 

22 specifically the provisions in the Federal Meat 

23 Inspection Act apply to the animals that are going to be 

24 turned into meat. To the extent they apply to other 

animals or all animals as has been referenced, they

Official 

1 would be pursuant -- those provisions would be pursuant 

2 to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which is -- does 

3 not have a pre-emption clause and does not --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, no. But that 

Act amends, amends, the Act that does have a pre-emption 

6 clause. 

7  MS. SMITH: Correct. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, it seems to 

9 me the pre-emption clause applies to the humane 

provisions as well. 

11  MS. SMITH: It applies to the humane 

12 provisions with animals -- with respect to the animals 

13 in connection with slaughter and that will be 

14 slaughtered, with respect to the Federal Meat Inspection 

Act. Because the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act was 

16 not incorporated into the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 

17 it does not have an express pre-emption clause, and 

18 there's no language in the text of that Act, the Humane 

19 Methods Act, or in the legislative history showing that 

it was an attempt to federalize animal cruelty law, for 

21 instance. So, the idea that --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Just in slaughterhouses. I 

23 mean, to the extent it's incorporated in that Act, it 

24 only applies to humane treatment by slaughterhouses, 

right? 

31
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  MS. SMITH: Correct. 603 and 610 of the 

2 Federal Meat Inspection Act reference the Humane Methods 

3 Act and reference that that is to be applied when the 

4 animals are in the -- being processed in the connection 

with slaughter and being slaughtered. So, again, it 

6 is -- it is limited to the animals that -- that are 

7 going to become meat under the Federal Meat Inspection 

8 Act. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't --

you don't know whether they're going to become meat 

11 until after the Federal process of post-mortem 

12 inspection and all of that. And your rules seem to 

13 prohibit that. 

14  MS. SMITH: Our rules -- well, the ante-

mortem inspection and post-mortem inspection are 

16 required of animals that are going to be turned into 

17 meat, correct. And our -- the California law does not 

18 touch on post-mortem inspection at all. And only in the 

19 case -- excuse me. And the -- as far as --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I mean 

21 your -- your argument up to this point has been that 

22 this doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the 

23 Federal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is 

24 for consumption. And you say with your -- with respect 

to your animals, that's not what it is. 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1  But here, as I understand the Petitioner's 

2 and the Government's position, it is that nonambulatory 

3 animals can be turned into meat for consumption. So, 

4 you don't know whether it fits under the definition of 

the State law until you've violated it. 

6  MS. SMITH: No, because when an animal 

7 becomes nonambulatory, it is readily apparent. That's a 

8 characteristic that is readily apparent. And in -- at 

9 least in California, when the animal becomes 

nonambulatory, the requirement would be to immediately 

11 euthanize the animal because it's not part of the meat 

12 supply system. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's exactly where the 

14 California system diverges from the Federal system 

because under the Federal system you separate the animal 

16 out, and then you take a look at it, and then you decide 

17 whether that animal can continue to go through the 

18 process and eventually become meat, or whether you 

19 euthanize it. So, the California system commands an 

action that the Federal system say may be necessary but 

21 may not be. 

22  MS. SMITH: It commands an action, but it's 

23 not within the scope of the Act because at the very 

24 outset California is saying that these animals are not 

to be part of the meat supply system in California.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Where the Federal system has 

3 said maybe they should be part of the meat supply 

4 system.

 MS. SMITH: They may be part of the meat
 

6 supply system, but it's not required. It's not --

7 nonambulatory animals are not --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: But in any case, it's --

9 look, this is a simple question that occurs. I am an
 

inspector at a federally inspected meat facility. I 

11 look around, and there is a -- a cow and it's lying 

12 down. All right? It seems to me that your law says I 

13 have to go over and see that it is immediately 

14 euthanized.

 Now, how is that not what is forbidden, a 

16 requirement -- the exact words are -- "in addition to or 

17 different from the Federal requirements governing the 

18 operations of that Federal meatpacking facility." 

19  The Federal law does not require me 

immediately to go over and euthanize the cow. Your law 

21 does require me to go over and immediately euthanize the 

22 cow. And, therefore, your law seems an additional 

23 requirement in respect to the operations of a -- a 

24 federally inspected meatpacking facility. Now, that 

seems to me the obvious, simple argument that people 

34
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 have been making, and I would like to know your obvious, 

2 simple answer. 

3  MS. SMITH: Certainly, Your Honor. The 

4 euthanization is an operation of the slaughterhouse. 

But it's -- but this -- California's provision is not 

6 within the scope. And pursuant to 678, to be expressly 

7 pre-empted, it has to be within the scope and with 

8 respect to operations. 

9  So, with respect to that provision, the 

euthanization provision, we concede that it is -- it is 

11 part of the operations. But it is not within the scope 

12 because we're dealing with an animal that California has 

13 deemed as not part -- as -- excuse me --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understood that the 

Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm 

16 misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal 

17 of any kind, that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait 

18 until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether 

19 it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold.

 And the reason why the inspection occurs, as 

21 I understand it, is that there are some diseases that 

22 are so contagious that if the inspector decides that 

23 that animal is carrying that disease, that the whole lot 

24 will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed. So, are you 

fighting with -- that that's what the purpose of 

35
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 pre-inspection under the Federal system is for?
 

2  MS. SMITH: The distinction I would make,
 

3 Your Honor, is that the purpose of the ante-mortem
 

4 inspection is to determine if the -- if the animal's
 

meat will be wholesome and unadulterated. To the extent 

6 that the pre-inspection or the inspection also finds 

7 diseases that can be passed on to other animals or -- or 

8 to the rest of the herd, that's -- that's certainly a 

9 benefit, but it's not part of the purpose of the Federal 

Meat Inspection Act. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm having a hard time 

12 drawing that distinction. If there is a valid purpose 

13 to the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you 

14 can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases 

that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory 

16 or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see 

17 how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope 

18 of the statute. If the scope of the statute is to 

19 ensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the 

risk of contagion, that has to be within the scope. 

21  MS. SMITH: Two points. One, the diseases 

22 that were referenced by the amicus dealing with this are 

23 diseases that will be passed to the animals, not to 

24 humans.

 And the second point is that the -- the 

36
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 purpose, again, of the Act as specified in 602 is to 

2 make sure that the meat of the animal is wholesome and 

3 unadulterated. And the ante-mortem inspection will 

4 occur for every animal that goes into the meat supply 

system. 

6  So, if California withdraws a nonambulatory 

7 animal, it doesn't receive the ante-mortem inspection, 

8 it's not going into the meat supply system. But all of 

9 the other animals in that pen that are ambulatory, 

pursuant to the Federal law, will receive that 

11 ante-mortem inspection and will, by the inspector or the 

12 veterinarian, be declared disease free or not. So, they 

13 will find -- they will be able to find those diseases in 

14 the ambulatory animals and the ones that are going into 

the meat supply system. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I suppose what you're 

17 saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is 

18 entitled to take certain categories of animals outside 

19 of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of 

animals from the whole process and so to exclude them, 

21 if you will, from of the scope of this chapter. And 

22 much as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply 

23 exclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're 

24 saying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the 

scope of this statute. 

37
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

20

25

Official 

1  But then you have to, you know, ask yourself 

2 the question: Are nonambulatory swine so easily 

3 excludable as horses? Why couldn't the State then 

4 exclude swine with various kinds of diseases? And then 

it would be clear that the State was doing something 

6 that the Federal statute is supposed to be doing. 

7  MS. SMITH: Your Honor, if your question is, 

8 would that be pre-empted if California excluded pursuant 

9 to other diseases, it would not be expressly pre-empted. 

So, California can make decisions on categories of 

11 animals, here nonambulatory swine, and the -- it would 

12 not be expressly pre-empted. There may be questions 

13 about conflict pre-emption, but in this particular case, 

14 conflict pre-emption was litigated in the Ninth Circuit, 

and the Ninth Circuit found that there was no conflict 

16 pre-emption. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's an additional 

18 requirement. I don't know why it's conflict 

19 pre-emption. It's express pre-emption. If indeed the 

Federal regulations say that these diseases disqualify 

21 the animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and 

22 California says no, we think additional diseases should 

23 disqualify the slaughter and sale, that's an additional 

24 requirement. I don't know how you say that's somehow 

conflict pre-emption. It's express pre-emption.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: You keep saying "not within

6 the scope." Why is it not within the scope? 

7  MS. SMITH: Because the scope of the Federal 

8 Meat Inspection Act does not include every animal on the 

9 premises of a slaughterhouse. It's limited by the 

language of the -- of the text of the Federal Meat 

11 Inspection Act and the authority given to the Secretary. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and what -- what 

13 limits it? What enables the State to disqualify other 

14 diseases that the Federal law does not disqualify?

 MS. SMITH: California would -- there's no 

16 requirement in -- there's nothing in the text of the 

17 Federal Act that specifies that States cannot withdraw 

18 animals based --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: "No additional 

requirements" is what the Act says. 

21  MS. SMITH: Correct. But that is -- no 

22 additional requirements going to animals that are going 

23 to become meat. If California -- if California had a --

1 of the operations, both the operations that pertain to 

2 those animals that are later sold as meat and the 

3 operations that pertain to those animals that are 

4 slaughtered and whose carcasses are burned or disposed 

of. How do you get the limitation to only those animals 

6 that are -- that are slaughtered for meat? 

7  MS. SMITH: Because it's also within the 

8 scope. Within the scope is part of the -- of the -- of 

9 678. The express pre-emption clause references within 

the scope of the chapter with respect to premises, 

11 facilities, and operations. So, there -- the scope of 

12 the chapter must be considered in terms of what the 

13 purpose is, what the language of the text allows the 

14 Federal Government --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument is 

16 that because the Act doesn't speak to whether or not 

17 cats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can 

18 also say it's not within the scope because it doesn't 

19 speak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can 

be sold as meat or not. 

21  MS. SMITH: Correct, and since, Mr. Chief 

22 Justice --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that seems to 

24 me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals 

that are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the

1 difference is that the State law says you can't sell 

2 that as meat while the Federal law says you can. Right? 

3 In other words, you're saying, well, just because the 

4 Federal law says you can doesn't mean that the State 

can't say you can't. 

6  MS. SMITH: Correct. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Correct? Well, 

8 isn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is 

9 that -- that you can't sell it is that you can. So, 

when the Federal law says you can, that pre-empts the 

11 rule from the States that says you can't. 

12  MS. SMITH: Well, the Federal law doesn't 

13 say you must. It does not say you must sell the meat or 

14 you must --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But we're not talking about 

16 conflict pre-emption. If it said you must and the State 

17 says you can't, then there would be conflict 

18 pre-emption. But we're talking about express 

19 pre-emption, which says in so many words no additional 

requirements. And I don't know how you can get around 

21 the fact that this is an additional requirement. 

22  MS. SMITH: Because the "no additional 

23 requirements" has to be qualified within the scope of 

24 the Act.

1 You're right. I see where you're going. It says we're 

2 talking about regulations that are within the scope of 

3 the Act. But I have assumed that that means we're not 

4 talking about airplanes; we're talking about the subject 

matter of the Act. And so, is this the kind of 

6 regulation that is within the subject matter of the Act? 

7 And it seems to be. It has to do with how you slaughter 

8 animals. It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so 

9 specific as you say the only things that are within the 

scope of the Act are the specific requirements that are 

11 there already in the Federal Act, then this prohibition 

12 against extra regulations means nothing. 

13  I mean, it can't mean that. So, it just 

14 means the subject matter. And now, if it means the 

subject matter, then why don't you lose? 

16  MS. SMITH: This -- well, even if one looks 

17 at the subject matter instead of the scope of the Act --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, instead 

19 of? What is the scope of the Act? Are you saying the 

scope of the Act refers only to those particular 

21 provisions that are already in the Act, requirements 

22 already there? 

23  MS. SMITH: Yes, the scope of the Act --

in something saying you can't add anything?

1  MS. SMITH: Because the "in addition to" is 

2 qualified by on the -- with respect to the premises, 

3 facilities, and operations and within the scope of the 

4 Act.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you define the scope 

6 almost exclusively by purpose. And regulatory power is 

7 broader than purpose, I mean, as is reflected by the 

8 regulations here which are dealing not merely with 

9 animals that are adulterated but are dealing with the 

whole process of what happens from the minute they 

11 arrive to the minute they're sold. So, if we don't 

12 accept your limitation based on a scope being defined by 

13 purpose, how do you win? 

14  MS. SMITH: If one looks at the authority 

given to the Secretary as well in 621, the authority is 

16 specified as dealing with -- or making sure that no 

17 adulterated meat or any carcass, part of carcass, meat 

18 food product therefor is not adulterated. So, the focus 

19 in 621 on the Secretary's authority is on making sure 

that -- that the meat is not adulterated. So -- so, 

21 it's not simply the -- the purpose of the Act at 602 but 

22 also the scope of the authority given to the Secretary. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you seem to be 

24 assuming that in effecting its obligations that only 

when it finds adulterated meat is that within the -- the

1 scope. The Government has basically said: We've got to 

2 figure out if it is, and this is how we're going to do 

3 it: We're going to do it starting from the receipt of 

4 the swine through its sale, and we're going to have 

inspections all through the process, whether or not the 

6 meat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what 

7 happens in that slaughterhouse. That --

8  MS. SMITH: Correct. But the -- the focus 

9 of the Secretary's authority, as well as the specified 

purpose of the Act, is focused on not all animals, but 

11 animals that will eventually become meat and making a 

12 determination, by inspections or examinations, whether 

13 or not -- whether or not those swine or those meat will 

14 be wholesome and not adulterated.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I didn't see your 

16 argument, and now I see it. Okay. So, I understand 

17 where you're going. 

18  But then if I look at section 610 of the 

19 Act, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including 

prohibitions and references to how you slaughter 

21 animals, and including how you slaughter animals 

22 humanely. So, there, how do you say that this provision 

23 which talks about euthanizing an animal that you look 

24 around and it's lying down -- how is that not within the 

scope of the Act? I'm not saying that they have that

1 particular thing, but the subject matter, slaughtering 

2 animals, indeed humanely, is something the Act 

3 absolutely deals with. 

4  MS. SMITH: It -- as I mentioned earlier, 

it's certainly part of the operations. Euthanization 

6 is --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: No, I didn't say that. I 

8 said yes, it's part of the operations, but also it's the 

9 subject matter with which the Act deals. The Act deals 

with the humane slaughter of animals and other forms of 

11 slaughter of animals. So, how -- how is -- so, I repeat 

12 my question. 

13  MS. SMITH: It deals with animals in 

14 connection with slaughter and that will be slaughtered. 

And so, to the extent that that -- that slaughter is 

16 seen as an animal that is going towards the meat supply 

17 system, as opposed to one that's condemned and being 

18 killed and not -- not --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I see. That's what 

you said before --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's what 

22 within the scope means. The pre-emption provision here 

23 in the statute has two provisions. The first one, which 

24 is the one we're talking about, says requirements within 

the scope of this chapter with respect to premises, 

45
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 facilities, and operations which are in addition to or 

2 different than those made under this chapter may not be 

3 imposed. That's the first one. Okay? Requirements 

4 within the scope with respect to premises, facilities.

 Now, the second pre-emption provision reads: 

6 "marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient 

7 requirements in addition to, or different than, those 

8 made under this chapter." Now, I read the difference 

9 between those two being, under number two it has to be 

different from something that has been made; whereas 

11 under number one, it just has to be different from 

12 anything that could have been made under this chapter. 

13  It's within the scope of the chapter. It's 

14 within the Secretary's authority to prescribe under this 

chapter. I think that's what Congress meant by the 

16 difference between requirements within the scope and, in 

17 number two, "in addition to, or different than, those 

18 made," and that to my mind is -- is a much more 

19 plausible explanation of "within the scope" than -- you 

know, it's directed to the purpose of -- of the statute. 

21  I don't think within the scope has anything 

22 to do with the purpose. It has to do with whether the 

23 Secretary is authorized to act in this field under the 

24 chapter.

1 Secretary is given several -- at several different 

2 points authority to act under this chapter, and the

inspections and examinations --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're not 

7 seriously arguing that the Secretary couldn't regulate 

8 in the manner California has, that the Secretary is 

9 powerless under this Act to say you can't slaughter 

animals that can't walk? 

11  MS. SMITH: No. The Secretary has done --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Secretary could do 

13 that? 

14  MS. SMITH: Yes. The Secretary -- yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because that would be a 

16 requirement? Is that -- is that -- do you rely heavily 

17 on -- on the distinction between a requirement and 

18 something that's merely permissive? 

19  MS. SMITH: No, we don't. Our -- our focus 

is on -- on the scope of the Act and not on 

21 requirements. We -- we concede that the -- that 

22 California statute is setting out requirements, the 

23 requirements in the penal code dealing with animal 

24 cruelty in -- in areas traditionally regulated by the 

State. So, we -- we do not dispute that the -- the

1 provisions in the State law are requirements. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: But suppose, Ms. Smith, you 

3 decided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in 

4 terms of inspecting for disease. So, I guess that 

there's some disease called diamond skin disease which 

6 affects a lot of pigs. And you just thought that the 

7 inspection standards were far too lenient, and you said, 

8 okay, we're not going to allow pigs with diamond skin 

9 disease to be slaughtered. Under your theory you could 

do that, too; isn't that right? 

11  MS. SMITH: Yes, we could because we would 

12 be categorically withdrawing the animal from -- from the 

13 process. I want to be clear, though, we're not -- with 

14 this law we are not setting up an inspection and 

examination process. It's -- this provision is in the 

16 penal code. It's an animal -- it's within the animal 

17 cruelty statutes. It is not an attempt to set --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: But in fact it requires a 

19 parallel inspection system. It's trying to do the exact 

same thing that the Secretary is trying to do, which is 

21 trying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease, 

22 and it requires an inspection system of its own. 

23  MS. SMITH: In our -- our case or in your 

24 hypothetical?

4  MS. SMITH: Well, it -- it would not be
 

expressly pre-empted, the hypothetical that you have 

6 given me, because we're withdrawing these animals from 

7 the scope of the Act. There may be questions about 

8 conflict pre-emption in that -- in that example, but 

9 with respect to what we're doing, what the California 

provision is doing there, it's not setting up a parallel 

11 provision. It's not trying to set up a --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: The other argument is that 

13 it is within the scope of the Act because it is 

14 pre-eminently something that the Secretary is authorized 

to regulate, this nefarious diamond skin disease which 

16 we're all familiar with. 

17  (Laughter.) 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's within the scope of 

19 the Act, because he could act and indeed is -- is told 

to act to prevent stuff like that. And that's why it's 

21 within the scope of the Act for California to do 

22 something in addition to what he has chosen to do. 

23  And that's why there's a difference between 

24 one and two, requirements within the scope, and 

marketing, labeling, and packaging requirements in

1 addition to or different from those made. This one 

2 isn't made, but it is within the scope of what the 

3 Secretary could make. And, therefore, California should 

4 butt out.

 MS. SMITH: Let me be precise about -- if 

6 one -- if one saw that -- that paragraphs (b) and (c) of 

7 the California law were within the scope, there's still 

8 an argument that they have to be with -- part of the 

9 operations, the premises, facilities, and operations. 

And certainly with respect to requirement (a), the 

11 buying, selling, and the sale of meat, those are not 

12 necessarily operations. And we do dispute the -- the 

13 factual assertion that's been made that all purchasing 

14 happens on the -- on the slaughterhouse grounds. 

There's no -- no factual record of that in the -- in the 

16 lower record. We have no way to dispute that because it 

17 was not -- it was not litigated. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I agree with you on 

19 that but don't agree with you -- or least I'm dubitante 

on that and -- and disagree with you on the rest. What 

21 do I do? 

22  MS. SMITH: We believe the -- the law could 

23 be or would be severable. In the Ninth Circuit, the 

24 preliminary injunction went to all provisions except for 

subparagraph (e). We would have to litigate

1 severability, of course, but we do think that it would

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what purpose 

4 does the ban on buying and selling have, other than to 

implement the restrictions that go to operations? 

6  MS. SMITH: Well, the purpose of the 

7 California law is twofold. One, general public health, 

8 but there's also a very strong component of prohibiting 

9 animal cruelty. And so, prohibiting the purchase, 

buying, selling, or the sale of meat --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to me 

12 to be, the answer, that, no, it doesn't have anything 

13 else to do because the animal cruelty that you're 

14 concerned about takes place on the premises as a result 

of the operations. And so, you prohibit the buying and 

16 selling of an animal that wasn't treated the way you 

17 think it should be treated, to give effect to your views 

18 on how it should or should not be treated, which seems 

19 to be expressly pre-empted.

 MS. SMITH: Well, not necessarily, because 

21 the law -- if we look at the entire California penal 

22 code section, it's dealing not just with 

23 slaughterhouses. So, it is trying to deal with a 

24 comprehensive problem that it sees with respect to 

nonambulatory animals, not just at the slaughterhouse

1 but at other market agencies, et cetera -- and livestock 

2 agencies. And so -- so, the focus on purchasing, 

3 buying, receipt, selling of the meat is to prohibit and 

4 -- and stop the -- the commerce in nonambulatory 

animals. 

6  And California's purpose there, as I said, 

7 was twofold, to, one, protect general public health but 

8 also to prohibit animal cruelty in an area where --

9 where California legislators were concerned about the 

humane treatment of nonambulatory animals, not just 

11 swine, because the law is broader than that, but that's 

12 what's at issue here today. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does it include 

14 besides swine?

 MS. SMITH: It includes cattle, sheep, 

16 goats, and swine. And the preliminary injunction was 

17 brought --

19 all go through slaughterhouses?

 MR. WELLS: Thank you. I just have a couple 

52
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 of quick points to make. One is that the Secretary has 

2 interpreted the -- section 602 and section 603 and 

3 section 604 to require that all animals be handled --

4 all animals on the premises be handled humanely and that 

all animals be subject to the regulations under the 

6 chapter. That's set forth in 9 C.F.R. 302.3, and it's 

7 also set forth in the Secretary's directives. It's 

8 directive 6100 at appendix at 47. 

9  So, the Secretary does not make a 

distinction in implementing section 602 through 604 

11 between animals that the State may choose to try to 

12 categorically remove. It applies to all animals, and 

13 that is critical because a State -- a slaughterhouse 

14 worker who is on the premises needs to have one set of 

rules that -- that the worker follows so that the worker 

16 knows that if he follows the advice of a Federal 

17 inspector and, for example, puts a nonambulatory 

18 animal -- separates the animal, puts it in a covered 

19 pen, and lets it go through the ante-mortem inspection 

that it's required to have under Federal law, that the 

21 slaughterhouse worker won't go to jail. 

22  And that's why it's critical that -- to 

23 Congress -- that was critical to Congress that we had 

24 this uniformity, and I think it's critical that this 

Court find pre-emption in this case because otherwise 

53

Official 

1 Federal law will appear and disappear, apparently, based 

2 on when the State believes that it's removing animals 

3 from -- in connection with slaughter, whenever that 

4 would occur.

 Just one other point, and that is it is also 

6 crystal clear that the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act 

7 of 1978 incorporated the standards of humane treatment 

8 that were included in the Humane Methods of Slaughter 

9 Act of 1958, and it isn't just the preamble to that 

public law that indicates that. 

11  Those requirements are found now in 21 

12 U.S.C. section 603(b), and they are backed up by 

13 prohibitions which are backed up by criminal penalties 

14 in section -- in 21 U.S.C. section 610 -- yes, 610(b).

 And if the Court has no more questions, I'll 

16 conclude my remarks.

18 counsel.
