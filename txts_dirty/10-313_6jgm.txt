2                                  (11:07 a.m.)

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next this morning in Case 10-313, Talk America v.

5 Michigan Bell, and the consolidated case.

6             Mr. Bursch.

7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             Interconnection is the lifeblood of local

12 phone competition.  That is why, in section 251(c)(2) of

13 the Telecommunications Act, Congress guaranteed that

14 competitors would have interconnection at the location

15 and at the method of their choosing and at TELRIC rates

16 irregardless of market impairment.  The question in this

17 case is whether that 251(c)(2) obligation encompasses

18 the tens of thousands of existing entrance facilities

19 that even today are interconnecting competitive and

20 incumbent networks.  And the answer --

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did you get -- you get

22 (c)(2) at TELRIC rates?

23             MR. BURSCH:  Yes, you do, Your Honor.  You

24 get (c)(2) and (c)(3) at TELRIC rates.

25             And so, the answer to the question presented



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

5

1 is yes, for three reasons:  First, because the FCC says

2 so.  And, as the expert agency charged with interpreting

3 and implementing the Act, that conclusion is entitled to

4 deference.

5             Second, the FCC's conclusion is consistent

6 with the plain text of the statute and the implementing

7 regulations.

8             And, third, the FCC's conclusion is

9 consistent with the policies embodied in the Act,

10 because the practical result of affirming the Sixth

11 Circuit opinion in this case is that a competitive

12 carrier, like Sprint for example, will be forced to

13 either charge its customers more for interconnection or

14 lay tens of thousands of duplicate entrance facility

15 cables, and those are precisely what the Act were

16 designed to prevent.

17             I'd like to start with the Sixth Circuit

18 opinion -- and, specifically, this is at page 20a of the

19 Talk America cert petition appendix -- because this goes

20 to the heart of AT&T's position and the Sixth Circuit's

21 conclusion with respect to the orange plugs and cords

22 analogy.  You'll recall that the Sixth Circuit said this

23 was like a situation where a homeowner had a plug in

24 their garage and a long orange cord extending out to a

25 park, which the court called the entrance facility, and



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

6

1 then the competitive carrier would be that person in the

2 park.

3             On page 20a of the petition appendix in

4 footnote 9, about halfway down, this is the key flaw in

5 the Sixth Circuit's reasoning:  The Sixth Circuit says,

6 "If you, as the homeowner" -- that's the -- I'm sorry,

7 that's the incumbent -- "had said that they may plug

8 into the surge protector, then the big orange extension

9 cord is just an 'entrance facility.'  But, if you had

10 said they must plug into the big orange extension cord,

11 then the big orange extension cord becomes the

12 'interconnection facility' and, consequently, the park

13 goers" -- the competitors -- "may plug into it."

14             The problem with this is that the Sixth

15 Circuit was wrong in that the incumbent doesn't get to

16 choose where the point of connection is.  The statute

17 and the regulations and the FCC make clear it's the

18 competitor that gets to choose.  So, if the competitor

19 chooses the end of the extension cord where it connects

20 to the CLEC network in the park, then even the Sixth

21 Circuit agrees with us and the Seventh, Eighth, and

22 Ninth Circuits that the entrance facility is the

23 interconnection facility.

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have just one small

25 question on that.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

7

1             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that there are two

3 competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each

4 of them wants to connect at a different point and in a

5 different way.  Must the incumbent accommodate both if

6 they're technically feasible?

7             MR. BURSCH:  Justice Kennedy, the answer is

8 yes.  The statute gives the competitive carrier the

9 opportunity to choose the point and the method, all at

10 TELRIC rates.

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Doesn't it say something

12 about feasible?  It -- it doesn't -- it doesn't give

13 free choice entirely.  It says -- what are the words?

14 That the -- the interconnection doesn't have to be put

15 just anyplace if it's not feasible or it's undue expense

16 or something to that effect.

17             MR. BURSCH:  Justice Ginsburg, the statute

18 and the regulations make clear that it must be

19 technically feasible, but there is an almost

20 irrebuttable presumption that when there are already

21 facilities in place performing that function, that is

22 technically feasible.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- you want the

24 incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and

25 extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

8

1 And what they say is, no, you -- you bring your

2 switching equipment here; we'll -- we'll allow you to

3 connect at, you know, the end of our facilities; but, by

4 God, you -- you make -- you make your own connection

5 to -- to the switches.

6             Now -- now, moreover, you're -- you're

7 making them -- you'll pay them for the orange cord, but

8 only at TELRIC rates, which are not realistic.  Now, why

9 -- why are they wrong and you're right, especially when

10 you have legislation, the purpose of which was to

11 encourage the independent building of new facilities?  I

12 mean, it's clear that the Act wanted these new entrants

13 where -- where possible to build new facilities, and not

14 simply to glom on to the extant facilities of the

15 incumbents.

16             MR. BURSCH:  Three responses to that

17 argument, Your Honor.  First, this case is about

18 existing facilities, not about facilities to be built,

19 although there's a lot of talk about that.  This isn't a

20 head-on challenge to the statute or the regulations.

21 The procedural posture is that this was AT&T trying to

22 get out of arbitration agreements that it had for

23 existing entrance facilities.  And so, that's the

24 posture of our case.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but the logic of your



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

9

1 case, as you described it, would also require AT&T to

2 build out the orange cord.

3             MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And -- and two

4 additional points, Your Honor, on that.  First, they say

5 this is a large obligation because we're talking about

6 miles and miles.  That is not the position that AT&T

7 took with the FCC when they were commenting on the TRRO.

8 At page 16a of the Michigan blue brief, in footnote 397

9 of the TRRO, the FCC acknowledges AT&T's statement that

10 entrance facilities involve very short distances.  In

11 addition, we have the FCC's regulation and the Local

12 Competition Order, paragraph 553 --

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, excuse me.

14             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Extant entrance facilities

16 I assume they were referring to.

17             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  I believe that's correct,

18 yes.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Well --

20             MR. BURSCH:  They're very short distances.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But if you ask for

22 a longer distance, they would presumably have to build

23 it.

24             MR. BURSCH:  Well, not necessarily --

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And charge you TELRIC



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

10

1 rates.

2             MR. BURSCH:  Right, because the FCC has

3 promulgated in -- in 521, the meet-point obligation,

4 which is another way that you can have interconnection.

5 And that demonstrates two things:  First, that sometimes

6 AT&T as the incumbent is required to build out

7 facilities, that it's not just a passive obligation.

8             But, in addition, when they're talking about

9 meet point, they say that it's up to State commissions

10 to decide the appropriate and reasonable distance.

11             So, even if we were presented with the

12 case -- not this case, but a different case -- where

13 you're talking about what's the appropriate length of

14 the facilities, the FCC has already acknowledged there

15 could be some reasonable limits on that.

16             And the most important fundamental point,

17 the fourth point on this, is that Congress already in

18 (c)(2) said you're going to have interconnection without

19 regard to market impairment, and so we're not going to

20 look at the availability of other entrance facilities in

21 the market.  If a competitor asks to have this location

22 and this method and it's technically feasible, they do

23 get the TELRIC rates.

24             And the competitive carriers would take

25 issue with the presumption that TELRIC rates are -- are



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 unfair.  You know, the regulations do contemplate that

2 they're going to recover not only their cost but a

3 reasonable profit.  And we can disagree about the

4 congressional wisdom of requiring rates like that, but

5 in the Verizon case, this Court definitively put to bed

6 the question of the reasonableness of the TELRIC rates.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Where would I read this?

8 As I read the statute, the statute says the cheap system

9 here is where they provide -- they have a duty to

10 provide the incumbent interconnection, okay?  That

11 requires some physical stuff.

12             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And they have to --

14 they -- you have to -- you're not charged a lot for

15 that; there's a limit on what they can charge you for

16 the interconnection.

17             MR. BURSCH:  Correct.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, somebody is going to

19 have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being

20 tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they

21 have to pay for a wire across country to get the

22 interconnection or not.  That seems unreasonable.

23 Across the street, maybe they do.

24             My candidate would normally be the FCC or

25 some regulator decides that kind of thing, and it's up



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

12

1 to them to say whether this is or is not what's needed

2 for interconnection.  That would be an intuitive account

3 I would have, without having read the statute in depth.

4             So, now what do I read to find out how this

5 works?  What is it that distinguishes something that is

6 ridiculous, like my California example, from something

7 that makes a lot of sense, like they're next door and

8 have to make 50 feet of wire.

9             MR. BURSCH:  Justice Breyer, if you look at

10 paragraph 553 of the Local Competition Order, which

11 appears at page 27a of the Michigan blue brief --

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Michigan blue --

13             MR. BURSCH:  At least that's where it

14 begins.  If you flip over to -- to page 28a, this is the

15 second page of the paragraph.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Where -- where -- 28a,

17 okay.

18             MR. BURSCH:  Very good.

19             About halfway down the -- that paragraph

20 there, it says:  "Regarding the distance from an

21 incumbent LEC's premises that an incumbent should be

22 required to build out facilities for meet-point

23 arrangements" -- so, again, this is in the meet-point

24 context -- "we believe that the parties and State

25 commissions are in a better position than the commission



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

13

1 to determine the appropriate distance that would

2 constitute the required reasonable accommodation for

3 interconnection."  So, again --

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, it's up to the

5 State commission.

6             MR. BURSCH:  Exactly.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  This is the FCC speaking?

8             MR. BURSCH:  The FCC is speaking --

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And the State

10 commission says -- they say it's up to the State

11 commission.  And the State commission here said?

12             MR. BURSCH:  Well, here, the State

13 commission didn't say anything, because we're talking

14 about existing facilities.  There's no one requesting a

15 new entrance facility to be built, for example, from

16 Lansing to Detroit.  That's not this case.  This case is

17 about the existing facilities.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bursch, the -- the key

19 to your case is -- is that an entrance facility is

20 interconnection, right?

21             MR. BURSCH:  Correct.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to equate those

23 two -- those two terms.

24             MR. BURSCH:  I do.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you rely upon to



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

14

1 equate them?  Because the -- as I read the regulations,

2 they -- they use them as separate terms.

3             MR. BURSCH:  Regulation 51.5 defines

4 "interconnection" as the mutual -- or, I'm sorry -- as

5 the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of

6 traffic.  There is no dispute that an entrance facility

7 physically links a competitive network with an incumbent

8 network; thus, when that entrance facility is used for

9 the mutual exchange of traffic, it is providing

10 interconnection.  And that's exactly what the FCC has

11 concluded.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't -- doesn't the

13 interconnection -- doesn't it have to be part of the

14 internal system of the incumbent carrier?

15             MR. BURSCH:  It has to be part of their

16 network.  But in the TRRO, the FCC made clear repeatedly

17 that entrance facilities constructed by incumbents are

18 part of their network.  And so, there's really no

19 dispute that it can be part of the network.  And so --

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You say that this is a

21 link, and your -- the opposition says that it's a --

22 that it's transport.  Is that correct?

23             MR. BURSCH:  It is transport.  By

24 definition, interconnection has to include transport

25 because it involves the mutual exchange of traffic from



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

15

1 one to another.

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but the reg

3 says interconnection does not include transport.

4             MR. BURSCH:  Well, we address that point at

5 length in our reply brief, because AT&T advances that

6 argument, and it's really a fundamental misconception or

7 misunderstanding of the regulation.  51.5 --

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have -- I've got it in

9 front of me.  It says, "This term does not include

10 transport."  But you -- you say it does?

11             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  Well, the entrance

12 facilities do include transport.  All interconnection

13 facilities --

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I'm talking about --

15             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- interconnection.

17             MR. BURSCH:  Right.  What 51.5 -- I assume

18 that's what you're looking at.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

20             MR. BURSCH:  That -- that goes to a term of

21 art or a phrase of art, "transport and termination of

22 traffic."  And as the FCC made clear in its regulation

23 51.701, which is at page 35a of the red brief, what

24 they're really distinguishing there are the two types of

25 charges.  You have 251(c)(2) interconnection charges and



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

16

1 you have 251(b)(5) transport and termination of traffic

2 charges.  And those are two separate concepts.

3             The interconnection charge runs from the

4 competitive network to the incumbent network.  The

5 transport and termination of traffic charge runs from

6 the point of interconnection to the incumbent's end

7 customer, and that's very clear.  The Ninth Circuit

8 specifically acknowledged that point in note 16 of the

9 Pacific Bell case.  But common sense tells you that has

10 to be right because under AT&T's view, the way they

11 interpret 51.5, there would be no interconnection

12 obligation because there's always going to be transport,

13 a mutual exchange of traffic when interconnection is

14 involved.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that right or --

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you read --

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there a mutual

18 exchange of traffic when you're talking about

19 backhauling?

20             MR. BURSCH:  No, there is not, and we don't

21 take that position.  The mutual exchange is when a

22 competitive customer talks to an incumbent customer or

23 vice versa.  Everything else we can call backhauling,

24 and that's not what's at issue when we're talking about

25 251(c)(2).



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

17

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I go back to my

2 question?  Because I haven't gotten an answer.

3             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  You see, I would think --

5 you said, well, this is an existing facility.

6             MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  But my intuition would be

8 that makes no difference whatsoever.  You could have

9 some kind of mechanism that connects two companies.

10 Now, half of it is a simple wire and half of it is bells

11 and whistles.  And so, we have to decide which part is

12 the part that's necessary for the interconnection and

13 which part is some kind of -- well, I don't know, extra

14 bells and whistles, and therefore, since it's not an

15 impairment kind of problem, they have to pay full price

16 for it.

17             That, again, seems like the kind of job that

18 Congress would leave up to a commission, but I guess I

19 want you to tell me:  Who's to decide that kind of

20 thing, and how do we decide it?

21             MR. BURSCH:  Are you talking about the

22 distance, or what the bells and whistles are--

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know what it is.

24 Often, these things are not distance.  Often, a

25 connection is all kinds of complex things, you know?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

18

1 And some are necessary and some aren't.  But I can --

2 can't you imagine with me the same kind of California

3 problem arising, but it just arises in -- in kind,

4 rather than in distance?

5             MR. BURSCH:  Well, as far as --

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  My -- if I'm so far off

7 base you can't get the question, forget it.

8             MR. BURSCH:  No, not at all, Justice Breyer.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I might not be able

10 to get an answer.

11             MR. BURSCH:  I think it's a very good

12 question.  And really --

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't have to think

14 it's that.

15             MR. BURSCH:  I'll take it in two parts.  You

16 know, again, with respect to distance, in the meet-point

17 context, the FCC has already delegated in LCO paragraph

18 553 appropriate and reasonable distances.

19             With respect to the bells and whistles, it's

20 really not that complicated.  You've got a cable.

21 That's your entrance facility, you know, typically a

22 fiberoptic cable.  And there's going to be a conduit

23 that it needs to run through.  There might be, you know,

24 risers or spacers with little twisty ties or something

25 similar to that, zip cords, that will allow the cable to

1 be run into a building and up a wall and connect into

2 the appropriate place.  But to the extent those are

3 interconnection facilities, those are necessarily part

4 of the 251(c)(2) obligation.

5             And unless there are any further questions,

6 I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

8             MR. BURSCH:  Thank you.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Miller.

10              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

11    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

13             MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14 please the Court:

15             There are a lot of statements by the FCC at

16 issue in this case, but I'd like to focus on two

17 statements by the commission in its published regulation

18 and orders that, taken together, resolve the question

19 presented here.  And the first is the commission's

20 determination in 47 CFR 51.305(e), which appears at page

21 5a of Michigan's brief, that it is the competitor, not

22 the incumbent, that gets to select the point at which

23 interconnection takes place.

24             Specifically, that regulation says that if

25 an incumbent wants to deny a request for



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

20

1 interconnection, it has -- at a particular point, it has

2 the burden of proving that interconnection at that point

3 would be technically infeasible.  And that undercuts a

4 key premise of the decision below, which was that as

5 long as the incumbent provides interconnection at some

6 technically feasible point that it has selected, then

7 it's discharged its obligation, and if the competitor

8 doesn't like it, that's just too bad.  They can build

9 their own facility if they want to interconnect

10 somewhere else.  That's --

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, underlying that

12 question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and

13 Scalia were asking.  Technically feasible is different

14 from economically ridiculous or economically burdensome.

15 How does that, "economically burdensome" -- does it get

16 considered by anyone so that -- because one could

17 imagine, as Justice Breyer said, that a competitor could

18 come in and say, now, build me the Taj Mahal as an

19 entrance facility or as an interconnection facility.

20 So, is there anyone controlling for that latter issue?

21             MR. MILLER:  In terms of the definition of

22 "technical feasibility" -- that's a defined term in

23 section 51.5 of the regulations, and it does not include

24 economic considerations.

25             Nonetheless, as the commission explained



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

21

1 when it adopted those regulations in 1996 at paragraph

2 209 of the Local Competition Order, competitors have an

3 incentive to ask for an economically efficient means of

4 interconnection because they have to pay for it.  I

5 mean, the -- they don't pay as much as AT&T would

6 like -- because they're paying TELRIC rates -- but they

7 do still have to pay for interconnection, so they have

8 incentive to ask for a reasonable method of it.

9             And what's at issue in this case, to get to

10 the second part of your question, is not --

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's why it's only

12 technically feasible, because the economic burden is --

13 is not on the company.  It has to provide it at the

14 place if it's technically feasible, but it doesn't pay

15 for it.

16             MR. MILLER:  That -- that's right.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Miller, you

18 began by saying there were two regulations that disposed

19 of the case.  You got one.  What's the second?

20             MR. MILLER:  The -- the second is the

21 commission's determination in the Triennial Review

22 Remand Order in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand of

23 its previous order, that entrance facilities are,

24 indeed, part of the incumbent's network because the

25 statutory obligation, of course, is to allow



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

22

1 interconnection at any technically feasible point within

2 the incumbent carrier's network.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Where do I find that?

4             MR. MILLER:  That's in paragraph 137 of the

5 Triennial Review Remand Order, which appears at page 10a

6 of Michigan's brief.  And in the preceding paragraph,

7 the commission traced the history of its definition of

8 the dedicated transport network elements in the Local

9 Competition Order, its revision of that in the Triennial

10 Review Order, in which it had said that the facilities

11 are not part of the network.  The D.C. Circuit then

12 vacated that.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What section are you

14 referring to?  On page 10a?  Which one is it?

15             MR. MILLER:  Well, I've -- I've just gone

16 back to the previous two pages, but it -- 10a is

17 paragraph 137, where the court says, "In response" --

18 excuse me -- where the commission says, "In response to

19 the court's remand" -- that's the D.C. Circuit's remand

20 in the USTA case -- "we reinstate the Local Competition

21 Order of dedicated" -- "Order definition of dedicated

22 transport."  And that was a definition of a network

23 element that included entrance facilities.  So, what the

24 commission was saying there by its reference back to

25 that definition --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

23

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you do not need to

2 provide unbundled access under (c)(3) to entrance

3 facilities, right?

4             MR. MILLER:  That -- that's correct, and the

5 court of appeals, I think, perceived a contradiction

6 between saying that this isn't something to which you

7 have to provide unbundled access under (c)(3), but it is

8 something that has to be made available for

9 interconnection under (c)(2).

10             And there is no contradiction there because

11 these are separate, independent statutory obligations,

12 and what's particularly significant about the difference

13 between the two statutes -- statutes is that (c)(3) has

14 an impairment test.  You only have to make available

15 those network elements without which the competitor

16 would be impaired in its provision of service.

17             (C)(2) does not have an impairment test, and

18 that's because Congress recognized that interconnection

19 is absolutely fundamental to any effective telephone

20 competition.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what's the

22 definition difference between entrance facility and

23 interconnection facility?  How do we know which is

24 which?

25             MR. MILLER:  If you're referring to the --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

24

1 what the -- in the way the commission used those terms

2 in the --

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I'm not.  I want to

4 know what's the difference.  Tell me in English what the

5 difference is.

6             MR. MILLER:  An entrance facility --

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I mean, how do we

8 know which is which?  We see some big lines and stuff in

9 it; how do we know which is which?

10             MR. MILLER:  The -- an entrance facility, as

11 the commission explained in the TRRO, is just the link

12 between the incumbent's office and the competitor's

13 office.  And an interconnection facility is anything --

14 any part of the network that's being used for

15 interconnection.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a genus and -- and the

17 entrance facility is the species --

18             MR. MILLER:  It can be.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- in your estimation?

20             MR. MILLER:  It -- it can be when it is used

21 for interconnection.  It could also sometimes be used

22 for other things, but we're talking about the situation

23 where the competitor wishes to use the entrance facility

24 for interconnection.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Could



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 you run that by me again?

2             MR. MILLER:  The -- the entrance facility is

3 just the link between the two offices --

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.

5             MR. MILLER:  -- the incumbent and the

6 competitor.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Got it.

8             MR. MILLER:  That can be used for a couple

9 of different purposes, but one of the purposes for which

10 it can be used is interconnection.  And when it is being

11 used for that purpose, it is appropriately described as

12 a -- as an interconnection facility.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Miller, would you,

14 before you sit down, explain what is the Government's

15 position when an agency is asked to file a brief?  The

16 Sixth Circuit asked -- invited the FCC to file a brief,

17 it did, and then the Sixth Circuit disagreed.  And there

18 was some suggestion that when an agency files a brief

19 here in this Court, as opposed to a court of appeals, it

20 deserves more weight.

21             MR. MILLER:  We -- we agree with the view

22 expressed by Judge Sutton in his dissenting opinion

23 below, that there really is no reason to distinguish

24 between amicus briefs, particularly those filed at the

25 invitation of a court, in the court of appeals, from



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

26

1 those -- filed here.  In this case, of course, the

2 question of --

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there may be a -- a

4 reason to give less weight to briefs in this Court,

5 different from the briefs filed with a court of appeals.

6 And you've taken a different position here on -- on the

7 issue of whether, when backhauling is included, it's

8 part of the -- it's -- it's part of the interconnection

9 facility?

10             MR. MILLER:  No.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I do not think you made

12 that distinction below about, you know, oh, it is part

13 where there is back -- where there is not backhauling,

14 but where there is, it isn't.

15             MR. MILLER:  I think our briefs in -- in the

16 two cases are consistent.  Our brief here provides more

17 detail in explaining the commission's orders, but in

18 both cases, we have taken the view, as the commission

19 has consistently taken the view since the TRRO, that

20 entrance facilities don't have to be made available as

21 unbundled elements for purposes of back haul, but they

22 do have to be made available when the incumbent seeks to

23 use them for interconnection.  And I think this is

24 precisely the sort of case where --

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  They have to be as



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

27

1 unbundled elements?  I thought they never had to be --

2             MR. MILLER:  No, they -- they --

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- made available as

4 unbundled elements.  That's (c)(3).

5             MR. MILLER:  That's right.  Then they are --

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your argument here is that

7 only have to be made available under (c)(2)?

8             MR. MILLER:  Exactly.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is not unbundled?

10             MR. MILLER:  Right.  And it's only for

11 purposes of -- of interconnection.  And I think this is

12 precisely the sort of case where deference under Auer is

13 appropriate, given that you have a highly complex

14 statute regulating a very complex, dynamic industry, and

15 so the commission's regulations involve not only the

16 exercise of --

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You certainly encourage us

18 to throw up our hands.  There's no doubt about it.

19             (Laughter.)

20             MR. MILLER:  I -- another way of saying that

21 would be that it's appropriate to recognize the

22 commission's not only policy-making discretion but

23 technical expertise in the industry that's being

24 regulated.  And certainly the commission has tried to be

25 as clear as it can in its regulations, but this is an



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

28

1 area where some level of imprecision is probably

2 inevitable.  And I think that's why it's appropriate to

3 defer to --

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I don't know why --

5 why it's so hard.  I mean, I got out my orange cord, and

6 I --

7             (Laughter.)

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- I wasn't sure of

9 if -- if it was a transport or link.  That -- that's my

10 concern.

11             MR. MILLER:  Well, I guess I would say maybe

12 we need to put the difference between interconnection

13 and transport in concrete terms.  It would be the

14 interconnection charge which is at TELRIC rates under

15 252(d)(1).  There would be a flat fee for setting it up

16 and then a flat monthly fee just for having the link

17 there.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, continue.

19             MR. MILLER:  Thank you.  And that's

20 independent of usage.

21             Then, separately, each time a call is made,

22 there is a charge under 252(d)(2) for the transport and

23 termination of the call.  And that goes both ways.  So,

24 when the competitor's customer calls the ILEC, the

25 customer -- the competitor pays the ILEC for terminating



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

29

1 the call and vice versa.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

3 Mr. Miller.

5           ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT H. ANGSTREICH

6               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

8 Justice, and may it please the Court:

9             In this case, the agency is trying to use an

10 amicus brief to interpret a few sentences in orders from

11 years ago to create a new legal rule without ever going

12 through a process that would result in judicial review.

13 In fact, in the Triennial Review Orders, where the

14 agency supposedly announced this new obligation, it

15 assured incumbents like AT&T that it was not altering

16 its interpretation of the statutory interconnection

17 duty.  And the Government correctly concedes here that

18 before those orders, the Government had never

19 interpreted the statutory interconnection duty to

20 require companies like AT&T to sell a fiberoptic cable

21 at TELRIC rates.  Yes --

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I know you're

23 saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the --

24 what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say.  But I go

25 behind that and I go -- I think the Government's entire



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

30

1 argument is not based even on those.  It's based on the

2 LCO regulations themselves.  They've cited two, which is

3 51.305 and 51.321.  They're not relying on those TROs in

4 their back and forth there; they're relying on the

5 regulation.

6             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, Your Honor, I

7 actually read their brief differently, and I note that

8 in the Sixth Circuit, they didn't rely on any

9 regulations at all.  The argument was entirely based on

10 paragraph 140.

11             But going to the regulations, at the same

12 time they promulgated those rules, the government did

13 define interconnection to exclude transport, and when

14 they defended that exclusion --

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how do you address

16 their point that there are two different charges at

17 issue?

18             MR. ANGSTREICH:  There are --

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That one -- that

20 interconnection by definition includes transport.  It's

21 hard for me to think of how it doesn't because they've

22 got to travel from one place to another, so --

23             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Your Honor, when the FCC

24 explained this to the Eighth Circuit, what it said is

25 there are really three things going on.  One is (c)(2),



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

31

1 is the duty to interconnect at a point, not to provide a

2 whole host of facilities that get you to the point, but

3 literally the duty to interconnect at a specific point

4 in the world; selected by the competitor to be sure, but

5 that only tells you where interconnection occurs.

6 That's the point.

7             The commission then said:  Okay, then there

8 are other obligations in the statute.  One of them is in

9 section 251(b)(5), and that's what obligates the

10 incumbent to accept telephone calls that are sent to

11 that point and to send telephone calls through that

12 point to the competitor.

13             And then, there's the third thing, and this

14 is directly from the government's brief to the Eighth

15 Circuit, where they explain that section (c)(2) --

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Sixth Circuit?

17             MR. ANGSTREICH:  The Eighth Circuit.  We

18 cite this at -- from 1996, this is the contemporaneous

19 view of the agency at the time it promulgated the

20 interconnection regulations.  It's defending those

21 regulations against a challenge that they are too

22 narrow.  And what the agency says to the Eighth Circuit,

23 which then deferred to this interpretation, is if

24 section (c)(2), interconnection, included routing and

25 transmission, (c)(2) would overlap with other sections



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

32

1 that, one, describe a duty to route and transmit

2 traffic, telephone calls; and, two, a duty to lease

3 facilities that will be used for routing and

4 transmission.  Footnote:  Those duties are (b)(5) and

5 (c)(3).  To the extent there is a duty to lease the

6 facilities, the fiberoptic cables that competitors are

7 going to use to get to the interconnection point of

8 their choice, that duty has to arise, the commission is

9 saying here, only under section 251(c)(3).

10             And we know it doesn't arise under that

11 section because these aren't things that are bottleneck

12 elements.  These aren't things that competitors can't

13 get themselves.  Competitors are interconnecting today.

14 Wireless carriers, other competitors, everyone in the

15 State of Ohio has since 2005 not been paying TELRIC

16 rates, and as the amicus brief showed, there has been no

17 detriment to competition.  Interconnection is occurring.

18             And so, what the Government is trying to do

19 here is impose this leasing obligation under the

20 interconnection duty in a way that never gave AT&T and

21 other incumbents any opportunity to challenge it.  They

22 never explain how it squares with the text and structure

23 of the statute, with their prior statements, or why

24 there's any policy basis for interpreting what they

25 claim is an ambiguous statute to require TELRIC pricing



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

33

1 for things that are not bottleneck elements.

2             Back in the Local Competition Order, Justice

3 Sotomayor, when they adopted the TELRIC methodology,

4 they recognized -- this is in paragraph 702 --

5 interconnection services -- that's what they called it

6 back then -- are bottlenecks, not things that

7 competitors can build themselves or buy from third

8 parties in the marketplace, as the agency has found is

9 the case since 2005.  They never --

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, now you're reading

11 limitation into the statute.  All the statute says is

12 you're obligated to provide interconnection services.

13 It doesn't say how or limit it only to things that are

14 not bottlenecks or things that are bottlenecks.  It just

15 says you're obligated to do X.  And that's what the

16 agency's saying.

17             MR. ANGSTREICH:  I understand this, Your

18 Honor.  But if the agency had ever done that through

19 notice and comment with a rule and published it in the

20 Federal Register -- which they concede that before 2003

21 they hadn't done that as to entrance facilities -- and

22 they claim they had no occasion to address the

23 question -- and then in 2003 we get a single sentence in

24 a paragraph of an order where there was no notice they

25 were considering interconnection duties, no publication



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

34

1 of a new regulation, no publication -- nothing that

2 would have, you know, told AT&T and other incumbents you

3 should seek judicial review of this if you think it's

4 wrong.

5             And now we're being told 8 years later that

6 when they said "facilities" in that paragraph, they

7 meant entrance facilities.  And we're being told 2 years

8 later when they said "interconnection facilities," that

9 they meant entrance facilities, even though when they

10 were asked that question by the Sixth Circuit they said

11 we didn't define that term.  And Mr. Miller might want

12 to say they've just said a little bit more now, but

13 they've said something radically different.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- in that regard, in

15 all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is

16 no other incumbent that has provided interconnection

17 services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC

18 rates?

19             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Prior to 2003 and 2005,

20 when there was an unbundling rule in place -- and the

21 commission had always recognized when it established

22 that unbundling rule in 1996 that competitors would use

23 unbundled transport facilities to connect to incumbent

24 switches, so to connect to those interconnection points.

25 And, sure, prior to 2005 when the unbundling rule was in



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

35

1 place, competitors would lease these facilities and pay

2 TELRIC rates and use them to get to the interconnection

3 point, but there was never during that time any

4 statement that even if there was no impairment, section

5 251(c)(2) would require the exact same thing to get to

6 the interconnection point.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What happened to the

8 unbundling rule?

9             MR. ANGSTREICH:  It got -- it was gotten rid

10 of.  It doesn't exist anymore.  So, now AT&T has said

11 those things you used to buy under the unbundling rules,

12 we don't have to sell them to you at TELRIC rates

13 anymore.  We have a tariff.  We've always had a tariff.

14 We'll sell them to you at just and reasonable rates

15 under the tariff.  You can build them yourself, as

16 competitors and wireless carriers are doing.  You can

17 buy them from the third parties that build them and

18 advertise their offering of them.

19             But what you can't do is say all of a sudden

20 that the interconnection duty had always required the

21 exact same thing as the unbundling duty, at least not

22 without going through a rulemaking where you lay out

23 your policy grounds.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why was the unbundling rule

25 abandoned?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

36

1             MR. ANGSTREICH:  It was abandoned because

2 the record evidence showed unambiguously that

3 competitors don't need these things from incumbents.

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a bottleneck?

5             MR. ANGSTREICH:  It's not in any way, shape,

6 or form a bottleneck.  And I guess that gets to the

7 second point I'd make, which is that, again -- and I

8 don't think they rely on the regulations, Justice

9 Sotomayor, and they've never -- and the Government

10 concedes in footnote 6 that the regulations themselves

11 don't get them to where they want to go.  They need

12 these statements they made in 2003 and 2005.  And even

13 if you credit their new position that when they said

14 facilities and interconnection facilities, that was just

15 an imprecise way of saying entrance facilities, those

16 statements don't get you to the rule that they're

17 endorsing.

18             What the agency actually said is that

19 competitors will have access to these facilities -- and

20 let's pretend that means entrance facilities for the

21 time being -- will have access to entrance facilities at

22 cost-based rates to the extent that they require them to

23 interconnect, and that's paragraph 140 of the Triennial

24 Review Order and -- remand order, and they said the same

25 thing, although they used the word "need," not

1 "require."

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is (c)(3).

3             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, I think the point is

4 what they -- this is why we think the right reading of

5 those statements is that the facilities they're

6 referring to are things they actually do require and

7 need, which are the things inside AT&T buildings that

8 they can't replicate, that it's strange for them to have

9 said you're going to get these facilities you require,

10 but to have meant something that they don't in fact

11 require.

12             But even if you want to read, again,

13 facilities and interconnection facilities to mean

14 entrance facilities, the rule that they're endorsing --

15 and, you know, Michigan now wants, if it's in the ground

16 we have to provide it; if we'd have to build it, we

17 don't have to provide it.  It's the first time we've

18 heard of that in the scope of this litigation.  The

19 Government seems to only be willing to -- to talk about

20 those few facilities that had been gotten under the old,

21 now-gone unbundling rules, but that's not the

22 distinction that the commission drew when it said this

23 thing that's supposedly imposing an obligation on AT&T

24 and other companies.  It limited it to those things that

25 competitors require.

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's -- that's

2 (c)(3).

3             MR. ANGSTREICH:  But that's what --

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: (C)(2) says you just --

5 you have to.  It imposes an affirmative obligation to

6 provide interconnection -- an interconnection.

7             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, it imposes an

8 obligation, Your Honor, to provide interconnection at a

9 point -- it's at a point within our network.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  That's your

11 point, I thought.  I thought it is precisely your point

12 that it is (c)(3) rather than (c)(2).

13             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, that's -- my point

14 is, yes, if there is a facilities leasing obligation, it

15 has to exist under (c)(3).  That's absolutely right,

16 Justice Scalia, that -- we think that's the right

17 reading of the statute, we think that's what the FCC

18 told the Eighth Circuit, we think it's what the FCC said

19 in the Local Competition Order.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't -- what I --

21 there's no way for you all to go to the FCC and decide

22 what part of this thing is -- or any State regulator,

23 what part of it is -- part of what's necessary to

24 facilitate interconnection and what part of it is really

25 providing the work primarily of the -- simply

2             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Your Honor --

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  What part is doing

4 something else?

5             MR. ANGSTREICH:  There's really no

6 dispute --

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  There's no way to do that?

8             MR. ANGSTREICH:  No.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so a judge has to

10 say, on the basis of what, on the basis -- the judge has

11 to say on the basis of the statute, which just uses the

12 word "interconnection"?

13             MR. ANGSTREICH:  The Michigan commission

14 decided that the FCC in that paragraph 140 created this

15 obligation.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  But the -- the --

17             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's wrong.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I -- I thought

19 it was conceded that -- that none of this is -- is

20 necessary under (c)(3).  I thought that's what the

21 Eighth Circuit said and which is why they eliminated the

22 unbundling obligation under (c)(3).

23             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's -- that's absolutely

24 right, Your Honor.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, it is accepted by both



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

40

1 sides, I think, that this is not necessary.

2             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's right, and because

3 it's not necessary, you can't read, as the government

4 tries to, belatedly, years after the fact, those

5 statements in their orders from 2003 and 2005, those few

6 statements in these matching orders --

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't help because

8 it's a network element if it's in (3), and what this is,

9 is something that's going to be needed to -- to

10 interconnect.  If it's -- if it's in -- if it's in the

11 first one.  And I don't know which is which, and I

12 gather that sometimes it would be tough.  And what

13 courts use to do with the ICC when they got into this

14 kind of situation is a doctrine called primary

15 jurisdiction, and they'd ask them for a brief.  All

16 right?  So, if that's what we've done hypothetically, we

17 have the brief.

18             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, Your Honor --

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, why don't we have to

20 follow the brief?

21             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Because the brief here

22 doesn't do what a decision on a primary jurisdiction

23 referral would do, which is square what the agency is

24 doing with the text and structure of the statute with

25 prior statements that contradict --

41

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree that it has to

2 be needed to interconnect?

3             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Your Honor --

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The whole problem here is

5 it doesn't have to be needed to interconnect.

6             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Our --

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has to be needed under

8 (c)(3), but under (c)(2), it's -- it's up to the -- to

9 the new company to say I want to interconnect here; and

10 -- and the incumbent cannot say, oh, no, you -- you

11 don't have interconnect here; you can interconnect

12 somewhere else.

13             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That -- Your Honor, that's

14 absolutely right, Justice Scalia.  They get to pick a

15 point.  The point has to be within our network.  Rule

16 51.305 identifies a series of illustrative points, all

17 of which exist inside AT&T buildings.  And that's what

18 they've done.  They've picked a point --

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But wait a minute.  Does

20 -- don't the regulations now and the commission's TRO,

21 et cetera, say that an entrance facility is within your

22 network?  You haven't challenged that.

23             MR. ANGSTREICH:  We do disagree.  I mean, at

24 the time of the Triennial Review Order, they said it was

25 outside of our network.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

42

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it's now they --

2             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's when they also

3 supposedly adopted this rule.  So, somehow, this rule

4 they've adopted has to coexist with the notion that

5 these things are outside of our network.  But in or out,

6 I think it's important to recognize they're not

7 claiming --

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If they're in your

9 network --

10             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Pardon me.  I think -- if

11 you have the Network Engineers' brief, figure 4 on page

12 19, I think it does a very good job of illustrating what

13 it is we're talking about.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Like orange wires and such?

15             (Laughter.)

16             MR. ANGSTREICH:  They draw them in black,

17 but yes.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  In black?

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Figure 4.

20             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Figure 4 on page 19.  What

21 the competitors in this case and Michigan have long said

22 is that the competitor has picked as its point of

23 interconnection a point inside the box on the right

24 labeled Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier Central Office.

25 And then they need some fiberoptic cable to bridge the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

43

1 gap to that interconnection point.  That's how Judge

2 Sutton understood it in dissent.  That's how Judge

3 Batchelder understood it in the majority.

4             And all the interconnection duty talks

5 about, all any of the interconnection regulations talk

6 about, is letting the competitors pick that point.  How

7 they get to the point is up to them.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's not what the statute

9 says.  The statute says the carriers have a duty to

10 provide interconnection.

11             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Right.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, in carrying out a duty

13 to provide, you say that's just picking a point.

14 Somebody could equally well say, no, it's a duty to

15 provide means to get to the point.  Now, either of those

16 seem equally consistent with the language.

17             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Your Honor, there's more

18 language that I think forecloses those interpretations.

19 It's not just the duty to provide interconnection.  It's

20 the duty to provide interconnection for the competitor's

21 facilities and equipment --

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

23             MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- at a point within the

24 incumbent's network.  Nothing in that statutory language

25 says that the duty is to provide the competitor with the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

44

1 facilities and equipment --

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't say that,

3 but it doesn't say the opposite.  And, therefore, you

4 might have an agency reasonably deciding that to provide

5 -- to fulfill that duty, you must provide equipment

6 reasonably necessary to allow the competitor to connect.

7 That's equally sensible.

8             MR. ANGSTREICH:  And, Justice Breyer, you

9 might have an agency that did that.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

11             MR. ANGSTREICH:  We don't have an agency

12 that did that.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Apparently, you have an

14 agency that never really said one way or the other.

15             MR. ANGSTREICH:  And that means that

16 Michigan was wrong when it thought that the agency had

17 said it, and the Sixth Circuit was right when it agreed.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it used to say the

19 other.  You -- you contend it used to say the other, and

20 it has never, by proper means, gainsaid its prior

21 position.

22             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's correct, Justice

23 Scalia.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see what the

25 other -- I didn't hear anything that said they said the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 other.  They've said when you have wires and you're

2 using the wires for communication, then they don't fall

3 outside this; that's true.  But if you're using them for

4 interconnection, and they're necessary to use for

5 interconnection, maybe it does fall inside this.  I

6 don't --

7             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, Justice Breyer,

8 again, we point you to their definition of

9 "interconnection" where they excluded transport from

10 interconnection and explained to the Eighth Circuit's --

11 you know --

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Excluded -- they excluded

13 transport -- all transport to the point of

14 interconnection, where you could not provide the

15 facility to interconnect unless you had the transport?

16 Is that what they did?

17             MR. ANGSTREICH:  What they said is --

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Did they do that?  Yes or

19 no?  I bet the answer is no.

20             MR. ANGSTREICH:  What they -- I -- Your

21 Honor, I just -- I don't think you're describing it in

22 the way that consists --

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

24             MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- comports with the

25 language of the Act.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

46

1             What they said is a duty to lease facilities

2 that will be used for routing and transmission of

3 telephone calls to the point, that's (c)(3).  That's not

4 part of the interconnection duty.  When they contrasted,

5 in their Local Competition Order, paragraph 172, they

6 said what interconnection does is it lets the competitor

7 pick the place where they're going to drop the traffic

8 off.  But it is section (c)(3) that lets the competitor

9 say:  I'd prefer to use incumbent facilities at TELRIC

10 rates to get to that point.

11             They have made that very distinction.  But

12 what they're trying to do through their amicus brief

13 here is to turn (c)(2) into a facilities leasing

14 provision.

15             Now, again, we don't think this Court needs

16 to say that they could never have promulgated a rule

17 with reasons that would get you there, but they've never

18 done it.  If they had done it, we would have had the

19 opportunity to seek judicial review.  They would have

20 had to explain themselves.  We've never had that

21 opportunity.

22             When they've said -- put, you know -- I

23 think it's important, when they put out these sentences

24 in the Triennial Review Order and Triennial Review

25 Remand Order that supposedly told us of this new



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

47

1 obligation, they never asked for notice about this, even

2 though, in their notice of proposed rulemaking, they

3 said, should we get rid of entrance facilities under

4 (c)(3)?  They didn't say, and if we do, what would that

5 mean for (c)(2)?  They didn't ask the question.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought they said,

7 moreover, that they were not amending (c)(2),

8 specifically.

9             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's exactly right.  In

10 the orders themselves, they assured AT&T and others that

11 they weren't changing anything with regard to (c)(2).

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  But there are -- there are

13 cases, I think, in primary jurisdiction where what a

14 district court has done, anyway, is to hold the case

15 while the ICC went and had a proceeding.  And I'm sure

16 that hasn't been used in a long time.

17             MR. ANGSTREICH:  No, that is still used,

18 Justice Breyer.

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  It is?

20             MR. ANGSTREICH:  But I'd point --

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, maybe this is the

22 case for it.

23             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, I don't think

24 there's -- and I'd point to this Court's decision by

25 Justice Ginsburg in Northwest Airlines v. Kent, 510 U.S.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

48

1 355, where this Court said:  Nobody has asked us to

2 invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; we're not

3 going to do it; instead, we will adopt an interpretation

4 of the statute that will suffice for the purposes at

5 hand.  And as the Court later recognized in Brand X,

6 that leaves it open to the agency, in a rulemaking, to

7 actually do the work that, as Justice Scalia noted, the

8 agency has never done here.

9             And so.  It's -- rather than imposing

10 something through a combination of amicus briefs and

11 statements that don't actually set forth the rule that

12 the agency is trying to defend here, we'd have a real

13 rulemaking --

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I --

15             MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- and a chance --

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess the problem I'm

17 having is that you tell me on the one hand that up

18 until, what, 2005, you were always paying the cost plus

19 profit rates, the TELRIC's rates, for interconnection at

20 a -- at an entrance facility.

21             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's not quite right,

22 Justice Sotomayor.  Up until 2005, companies like Talk

23 America were allowed to get both the actual physical

24 linking at TELRIC rates and the transport facility at

25 TELRIC rates, but under two separate statutory



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

49

1 provisions.  They were getting the transport facility

2 under (c)(3); that's gone away.  They were getting the

3 linking under (c)(2).

4             Now, there were other companies like

5 wireless carriers.  They were getting the linking at

6 TELRIC rates under (c)(2), but they were paying full

7 freight for the transport, because they have never been

8 allowed to get unbundled network elements.  So, this

9 notion that there's going to be a price increase to

10 wireless carriers is a fiction.

11             But what -- so, competitors were doing two

12 things under two provisions.  One of those has gone

13 away.  And it was only after it went away that anybody

14 raised this notion that maybe that transport facility

15 had always been required under (c)(2) also.  But that's

16 nothing the commission has ever done in a rulemaking.

17             It never did that in the proper way in the

18 Triennial Review Order or the Triennial Review Remand

19 Order.  As Justice Scalia noted, it assured AT&T and

20 other incumbents that it wasn't changing the law.  When

21 it published things in the Federal Register, which is

22 where it's supposed to publish substantive rules, it

23 identified specifically the elimination of entrance

24 facilities as unbundled network elements, and said not a

25 word about any continued duty to provide them under



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

50

1 section --

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it did in its

3 footnotes.  It said -- that's what the whole dispute is

4 about, which is we're not changing the obligation to

5 provide interconnection services.  So, it said it

6 clearly.

7             MR. ANGSTREICH:  It -- it said it --

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Its view --

9             MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- but then the question,

10 Justice Sotomayor, is:  Well, what was that obligation?

11 And the government concedes in footnote 6 that prior to

12 making those statements, it had never interpreted that

13 obligation to include the duty to lease that transport

14 facility.  It claims the question never came up because,

15 while it was an unbundled element, it didn't matter.

16             Now, I think it's quite telling that while

17 it was an unbundled element and we were having 10 years

18 of litigation about what the right standard is for an

19 unbundled element, nobody even thought to say:  By the

20 way, all of this litigation is beside the point with

21 respect to the use of these facilities when we attach

22 them to an interconnection point.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Eighth Circuit's

24 decision would have been unnecessary and the revision of

25 the rule?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

51

1             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Exactly, Justice Scalia.

2 It's very strange that no -- I mean -- and I think from

3 the fact that nobody thought to say it comes to what we

4 view has happened, is that this is a rear-guard effort

5 to preserve TELRIC pricing for things that the

6 commission has said should no longer be available as

7 TELRIC -- at TELRIC pricing.

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the commission didn't

9 like the Eighth Circuit's decision.

10             MR. ANGSTREICH:  I -- I think it's probably

11 a fair statement that the commission does not like the

12 decisions vacating its unbundling rules, but

13 nonetheless, that's what happened, and the new rules get

14 rid of this element.

15             Again, what the Michigan commission found

16 was that the FCC had specifically determined that there

17 is a leasing obligation under (c)(2).  That never

18 happened.  The Sixth Circuit was right about that.

19 There is no leasing obligation that the commission has

20 ever established.

21             I think, Justice Breyer, to go back to your

22 question, whether they could do it is a separate

23 question.  I don't think they could.  I think we have an

24 incredibly good chance to prevail if they were to ever

25 promulgate such a rule, but they never did it.  They



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

52

1 said things directly to the contrary.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  It all didn't matter

3 because, in fact, they got the TELRIC rates under (c)(3)

4 until they changed the impairment part?

5             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Right.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  So, who cared?  And now

7 after that, they care.

8             MR. ANGSTREICH:  Right, they care.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  And now -- now -- now the

10 other side cares, of course.  And so, now -- now we're

11 faced with a situation where they're just putting this

12 in the brief for the first time, but they can't base it

13 on anything the commission actually did?

14             MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's exactly right.  And

15 if the commission had actually --

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Amd I'm glad it's right

17 because I don't know what I'm talking about.

18             (Laughter.)

19             MR. ANGSTREICH:  I'm glad -- I'm glad we're

20 at least agreeing with each other, Justice Breyer.

21 But -- and I think that really is the key administrative

22 law point here, is that if the agency in the Triennial

24 actually said what they say in their brief, we never had

25 occasion to consider this question before.  Now we're

1 considering it, and here is why we think it's

2 appropriate to read (c)(2) to impose leasing.

3             And despite the fact that, you know --

4 again, the commission claims that the statute's

5 ambiguous.  They'd need a policy reason why it's

6 appropriate to read this ambiguous statute to require

7 TELRIC pricing for things that third parties are

8 actually investing in and selling at marketplace rates,

9 why it's appropriate to undercut those third-party

10 business models with this TELRIC pricing for something

11 the competitors can and are building themselves, third

12 parties are selling --

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we accept their

14 policy arguments, what does that do to your main

15 argument?

16             MR. ANGSTREICH:  I --

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because I think they've

18 explained it to my satisfaction why this is necessary

19 because (c)(2) requires interconnection.  Congress has

20 made a judgment that interconnection is the mainstay of

21 competition in this area.  So, if I accept that --

22             MR. ANGSTREICH:  With due respect, Justice

23 Sotomayor, I don't think they've made that policy claim

24 here, and in particular this is not a case about whether

25 interconnection is going to occur.

54

1             Competitors and wireless carriers are

2 picking their points of interconnection.  They are

3 interconnecting today.  They have been doing it.  And

4 wireless carriers never had TELRIC priced transport

5 facilities, and yet they're interconnected.  Competitors

6 in nearly a dozen States that have addressed this issue

7 and disagreed with Michigan and agreed with the Sixth

8 Circuit are interconnecting today using their own

9 facilities, using third-party facilities.  And when they

10 come to AT&T and say we'd like to plug our facility into

11 this point, AT&T says, absolutely, and does the work

12 necessary to get those two things connected.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't say it that

14 happily.  It really doesn't.

15             MR. ANGSTREICH:  You're right.  It

16 certainly --

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, okay.

18             MR. ANGSTREICH:  It's -- it's an imposition

19 on AT&T.  But the notion that in any way, shape, or form

20 the price of the cable will alter the interconnection of

21 telephone networks is simply false.  Yes,

22 interconnection is an important policy, and Congress

23 said we have to provide it at points within our networks

24 selected by competitors.  And we do that.

25             But Congress didn't say, and the FCC has



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

55

1 never said, that we also have to provide them whatever

2 it is that they want to use to get to that point.  And

3 there really is -- and I think some of the questioning

4 pulled that out, though they want to say I think because

5 the Government won't endorse the absolute position the

6 Petitioners were taking in their opening briefs, that

7 this is only about things that used to be ordered as

8 unbundled elements or things already in the ground.

9             But their position, their interpretation of

10 the statute has no stopping point.  It would cover

11 anything a competitor might ever want to use to get

12 telephone calls to the interconnection point.  And

13 they've never defended that limitless reading.  And if

14 the agency ever wanted to adopt it, we would challenge

15 it.  And as I've said, I like our chances, but until

16 they do it, Michigan was wrong to conclude that the

17 commission had done it, and the Sixth Circuit was

18 correct to reject that.

19             If there are no further questions, I'll sit

20 down.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

22             Mr. Bursch -- Bursch, you have 4 minutes

23 remaining.

24            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

25               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

56

1             MR. BURSCH:  Your Honors, everything you

2 heard in the last 30 minutes is premised on the idea

3 that the FCC is doing something new and that there was

4 never a promulgated regulation.  That is demonstrably

5 false.

6             If you turn with me to page 32a of the red

7 brief, this is the FCC's regulation, promulgated all the

8 way back in 1996, which defined the scope of the (c)(2)

9 interconnection obligation.  It's 47 CFR 51.321.  And

10 this goes directly to the points that Justice Sotomayor

11 was making.

12             On page 32a, the FCC says that an incumbent

13 must provide interconnection at a particular point upon

14 a request by a telecommunications carrier, such as a

15 competitor.  "Technically feasible methods" -- this is

16 in sub (b) -- "include, but are not limited to" -- and

17 they give two examples:  collocation and meet points.

18 But this isn't the be-all-end-all of interconnection

19 obligations.  These are exemplary.

20             To take an analogy, assume you had a high

21 school cafeteria, and the school board said you have to

22 provide vegetables to students when they ask for them,

23 and you have to give them the vegetable that they ask

24 for; those include broccoli and green beans.  And they

25 don't say anything else.  Then you have a separate



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

57

1 obligation in (c)(3), and the school board says until we

2 see that the kids have enough nutrition, you must give

3 them peas.  That's entrance facilities unbundled under

4 (c)(3).

5             So, some time goes by, and the school board

6 says, okay, the kids are getting enough peas; we're

7 going to wipe away that second restriction, but the

8 initial restriction, the obligation in 321, is still

9 there; and if a student asks for peas, it's within the

10 scope of 321 because broccolis and green beans were

11 representative examples, and peas are another one.  And

12 that's where entrance facilities fit.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why did they fight the

14 Eighth Circuit litigation?  Why did -- I mean, it --

15 you're telling me it made no difference whether (c)(3)

16 allowed them to do what they wanted to do and what the

17 Eighth Circuit said they couldn't do, right?

18             MR. BURSCH:  The premise -- no, that's

19 incorrect, Your Honor, because if you have an entrance

20 facility under (c)(3), you can use it for more things

21 than you can under (c)(2) because under (c)(3) you can

22 have it for backhauling and still get TELRIC rates.

23 Under (c)(2), you're limited to interconnection.  So,

24 it's a different question.

25             But the idea that somehow the FCC can --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

58

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Very slightly different.

2 That's not that big a deal.

3             MR. BURSCH:  Backhauling is a big deal to

4 competitors.  And so, to say that they did something new

5 in the TRRO is wrong.  And to prove that point, if you

6 look at the comments --

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Incidentally, where do

8 you -- where do you get that backhauling restriction

9 from?

10             MR. BURSCH:  The backhauling --

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, yes.  The --

12             MR. BURSCH:  From the TRO and the TRRO, and

13 the FCC discussed that distinction in the Sixth Circuit

14 briefing at pages 6 to 7.  So, this isn't anything new,

15 either.

16             So, the fact that this is not something new

17 is demonstrated conclusively by comments in the TRRO

18 proceedings from Bell South, which is now an AT&T

19 subsidiary.  And Bell South says, at page 59 of its

20 comments, fully recognizing the obligation that went all

21 the way back to 1996 in reg 321:  Because entrance

22 facilities may be required for interconnection purposes

23 and Congress explicitly enacted provisions that govern

24 carrier obligations to provide interconnection in

25 251(c)(2), it was altogether reasonable for the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

59

1 commission to exclude these network elements from a

2 definition of ILEC dedicated transport intended for

3 unbundled access under 251(c)(3).

4             So, even incumbent carriers knew what the

5 FCC was doing in paragraph 140 of the TRRO, and there

6 was nothing new there.

7             One other small point with respect to the

8 Network Engineers' map.  This entrance facility right

9 here on page 19 already exists.  We're talking about

10 existing facilities.  And it's true, as the Sixth

11 Circuit said, that if the point of interconnection is

12 here at the ILEC switch, then that's where

13 interconnection takes place, and this entrance facility

14 is -- is truly providing transport, not interconnection.

15             But when a competitive carrier chooses its

16 own switch as the point of interconnection, this is the

17 end of the AT&T entrance facility, then interconnection

18 takes place there.  And even in the Sixth Circuit's

19 view, that entrance facility is interconnection under

20 (c)(2).  And as Congress has said, that's the obligation

21 that is immutable because it is so important,

22 fundamental to competition.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

24             The case is submitted.

25             MR. BURSCH:  Thank you.
