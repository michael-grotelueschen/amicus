(11:22 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications 

Commission v. Fox Television Stations. 

General Verrilli. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

In its previous decision in this case, the 

Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a 

license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable 

part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable 

public obligations. One of those enforceable 

obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress 

has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to 

enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 

Respondents in this case have for years 

benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use 

of public spectrum. They argue, however, that neither 

Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their 

licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting 

indecent material when children are most likely to be in 

the audience.

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Verrilli, it 

seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only 

go so far. I mean, if the idea is just we gave them 

something, now they have to do whatever we say, you 

wouldn't accept that. So, the question is why is this 

condition appropriate when many other conditions would 

not be appropriate? I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if 

you would say all conditions are appropriate. But I --

I frankly think you wouldn't. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: This condition is 

appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a 

defining feature of the broadcast medium from its 

inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has 

continued to be a defining feature of this medium 

throughout its history. And the argument that my 

friends on the other side are making here is that that 

norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been 

recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been 

applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be 

overturned now because circumstances have changed. 

And I would point out first, if I may, 

something that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's one of their 

arguments. I mean, another one is that you haven't 

defined it precisely enough, right?

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's true. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a separate -- really 

a separate argument. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainly true, 

Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, 

if I -- if I may just continue on this line. 

The -- their argument is that circumstances 

have fundamentally changed. I want to point out at the 

outset something I think is significant, which is that 

their argument would sweep away indecency restriction 

with respect to radio as well as television, and they 

would sweep that away in the arguments they are making 

today without making any showing that circumstances have 

changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or 

accessibility of radio. 

And I think if one looks at the FCC orders 

that this Court cited in its prior decision in this 

case, one will see that a lot of the most vile and lewd 

material really is in radio. So, I just want to put 

that marker down at the beginning here because I do 

think it is quite important. No showing has been made 

about radio. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't quite understand 

that. Today there's a -- there's either a potential or 

a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in

radio? I didn't quite -- just to understand your point. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Pacifica itself, 

Justice Kennedy, was a case about a radio broadcast. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, I understand that. 

Yes. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: And the Respondents are 

arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled 

because the circumstances that justified its rule no 

longer obtain. I want to put a marker in at the outset 

here with respect to radio, because I do think it's 

quite important, that they haven't made any argument 

that those circumstances are any different with respect 

to radio. It's just as ubiquitous as it was. There 

isn't even any argument that there's blocking technology 

available. And I want to make sure, given the kind of 

vile material that the record demonstrates has been 

transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses 

on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are 

making here. 

Now, with respect to television, I do think 

they're making an argument that -- that television 

broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way 

that it was before. They're not making an argument --

but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument 

than one would normally get in support of a -- the

suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis. 

They're not -- they're not arguing that 

broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was. 

If anything, it's probably more pervasive now. They're 

not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no 

longer exist. What they're arguing is that there are 

other media that present harms as well and that with 

respect -- and that because those other media also 

present harms, the circumstances require a change in the 

rule with respect to broadcasters. 

Now, that -- you can I think look at that in 

one of two ways. You could say either that's an 

argument that it's futile to continue to impose this 

restriction on broadcasters. And I think that's what 

Fox says at page 33 of its brief. 

Two points in response to that. I think a 

significant, if not complete, answer was in this Court's 

prior decision in this case in which it said that the 

maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly 

important in the context of these changes, a broadcast 

safe haven. And also I do think that the idea of 

futility in that nature is foreign to our First 

Amendment jurisprudence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, I took 

it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that

the major objection is that one cannot tell what's 

indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, 

that's saying "Private Ryan" is okay, "Schindler's List" 

is okay, but "NYPD Blue" is not. And I do think that 

that is the major objection, that we have a government 

agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity 

is okay and when it isn't. You can't do it in terms of 

time because "New York" -- the "NYPD" was 7 seconds and 

another broadcast, "Catch-22," was 40 seconds. 

So, it's -- it's the appearance of 

arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in 

concrete situations. That I think is the major flaw. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Let me turn to that, 

Justice Ginsburg. The -- two points about that: The 

first one is that as we read this Court's recent 

decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on 

the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is 

vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered 

by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here. 

In other words, was there fair notice with respect to 

these specific broadcasts? 

And I will get to that, but I -- but let me 

first go directly to Your Honor's more significant 

question. And I think the -- the problem with looking 

at the case that way is that the lens is focused too

narrowly in that there, actually, if you -- one 

broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of 

decisions that the commission is making about indecency 

and then broadens it out even further and looks at the 

wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number 

of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even 

raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is 

a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction.  It's even 

quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to 

broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as 

indecent or not indecent. 

And, yes, we would concede that there is not 

perfect clarity in this rule. It's a context-based 

rule. As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in 

Pacifica that a context-based rule may well be what the 

Constitution requires here, and that's going to result 

in some -- something less than absolute precision. But 

the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from 

my friend's perspective, would be worse. The commission 

could have a list that said never say the following, 

however many words; never show broadcasting between the 

hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of 

6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 

That would be clearer, but it would -- but, 

in a way, the commission here, I think by following the

context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested 

was required, is being -- I mean, "punished" is too 

strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's 

trying to make reasonable accommodations for First 

Amendment values. 

And so, I think when one looks at it both in 

terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused 

here and the fact that the -- the alternative of perfect 

clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of 

First Amendment values, then I do think that the 

commission's position is quite -- quite reasonable and 

defensible. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Could you -- could you 

digress for one minute to help me understand the 

procedural posture of this case. When it was here last 

time, we were dealing with an issue called "fleeting 

expletives," and that was Fox. And the Fox case 

involved just that. They didn't really, or we didn't, 

or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now 

at issue. And then, without it going back to the 

commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground 

that sets aside the 2001 order. 

Now, can we here just decide the fleeting 

expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has 

to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order

and has to do with part 2(2) or something. I mean, it 

has -- and how you interpret the words "material dwells 

on or repeats." Now, that I -- that I understand how to 

get at. 

The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise 

fleeting expletives. It wasn't fleeting. And it raises 

the question of the validity of -- under vagueness 

grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been 

applied. But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that 

case. It sent it back to the commission. 

So, has there been a commission decision 

recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being 

made here about the validity of the 2001 industry 

guidance as applied? Has there been such a thing? 

Alternatively, has there been an appeals 

court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I do -- I agree with you, 

Justice Breyer, (a) that this is a complex procedural 

posture; (b) that the Court would have some discretion 

in how it approached and resolved the case. 

With respect to the ABC case, as I read the 

commission's orders, which are in the appendix to the 

petition, it applied the 2001 industry guidance to reach 

the conclusion that the ABC broadcast was indecent. And 

then that was -- that -- then ABC appealed that to the

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and then essentially 

applied that analysis to the ABC case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I see. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: So, I think in 

fairness --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. When this ABC 

case was argued in front of the commission -- I have 

here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are 

filled with very good arguments. Were those arguments 

made to the commission in the context of the ABC case?

Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought 

when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox 

coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all. 

This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided 

before. This is the case of ABC, period. And it is an 

attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. 

And, therefore, I want to know, at least 

satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone 

through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments 

have all been made in front of the commission and 

they've been rejected. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: So, Justice Breyer, I'm 

not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the 

arguments have all been made in front of the 

commission --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying every one, 

but has the essence of these arguments. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: In fairness, I do think 

that -- that if one reads the commission's disposition 

of the -- the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance 

reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent 

under the 2001 guidance. ABC paid the fine that it was 

assessed and then, as it has -- as it can do, then 

invoked the Hobbs Act, went to the court of appeals to 

challenge it. And so, I do think -- I do actually think

that the issues have been considered by the agency and 

are before the Court. 

And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I 

think more directly to the vagueness point, that there 

really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the 

fleeting expletives in the -- in the Fox case because 

the Court said the last time the case was here that 

there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because 

there was no forfeiture or any other sanction. 

ABC is in a different position because they 

were sanctioned. And so, there is an issue with respect 

to the question of whether the commission's indecency 

standards can constitutionally be applied here and 

whether they're too vague. But I do think, and I do --

I would like to spend a minute on that question of 

whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC 

broadcast. 

Now, the commission's standards in the 2001 

guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test. 

First is a subject matter question: Is there a 

description or depiction of sexual or excretory 

activities or organs? And then there's a question of 

whether the depiction or description is patently 

offensive under community standards for broadcast 

informed by three factors: whether the expression is

explicit, whether the broadcast dwells on it, and 

whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating. 

Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to 

this broadcast that the nudity in the "NYPD Blue" 

episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria 

because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would 

be considered sexual organs for purposes of application 

of this -- of this standard. 

The commission said -- and this is at page 

137a of the appendix to the petition -- that it's 

impossible to believe that they didn't think that the 

naked display of buttocks would bring them within --

that weren't -- didn't have fair notice that the naked 

display of buttocks would bring them within this rule. 

I'm not sure anything more needs to be said about that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the broader point, 

General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if 

you're right that there are many non-vague applications 

of this commission policy, that there is some amount of 

uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of 

uncertainty --

GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't --

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because it turns out that 

nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as 

to some body parts, and sometimes it's not allowed; and

the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 

50 years; and the length of time doesn't seem to be 

what's indicative of anything; the kind of body part 

doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what's indicative 

of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: With respect, Justice 

Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of 

the situation. 

Moving to the second part of the analysis 

here, I think it's important to take a half a step back. 

The fact of the matter is -- and I think everybody, all 

of us, understand this in our experience -- that nudity 

on broadcast television is an exceedingly, exceedingly, 

rare thing at any time of the day and certainly between 

6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m. It is exceedingly rare, and all 

of us from our experience know that. And the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not so sure 

because the examples were given of -- I guess excerpts 

from "Private Ryan" and from "Schindler's List" have 

been on television. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's true, Justice 

Ginsburg. But, again, I think that's another issue 

about where the lens is focused. There have been 

thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasts, and 

the Respondents have identified four in which -- over

25 years, in which any nudity has been present. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They have their own 

guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainty true, 

Justice Scalia. And I do think, in Reno, this Court 

described the Carlin monologue at issue in Pacifica in 

the following way: It said that monologue was readily 

identifiable as indecent because it was a dramatic 

departure from the customary norms for the broadcast 

medium. I think the kind of nudity -- and I think if 

one just looks at the video here and sees it, I don’t -- I 

think it's hard to disagree with the proposition that 

that's a dramatic departure from what's the norm for 

broadcast television. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If they did an excerpt 

from "Hair," could they televise that? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it would raise 

serious questions. I think nudity is going to raise 

very serious questions, and I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the opera, 

in "The Makropulos Case," there's a scene where a woman 

is seen nude entering a bathtub. And suppose that were 

shown, that scene from the opera.

there's not going to be perfect clarity. We recognize 

that. But I do think with respect to this broadcast --

and that's the question before the Court, whether Fox --

excuse me -- whether ABC was on fair notice of whether 

this broadcast would bring them within the rule. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what you're saying 

is, is that there is a public value in having a 

particular segment of the media with different standards 

than other segments. And forget radio. Let's just talk 

about television. But -- you know, in the briefs, it 

says how much -- how many cable stations there are, and 

you, what do you call it, surf the -- you go through all 

the channels. And it's not apparent to many people 

which are broadcast and which are not. 

But you're saying that there's still a 

value, an importance, in having a higher standard or 

different standard for broadcast media on the 

television. Why is that, when there are so many other 

options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many 

viewers which of the two they're watching? Just because 

it's an important symbol for our society that we aspire 

to a culture that's not vulgar in -- in a very small 

segment? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Two points in response to 

that, Justice Kennedy: First, I think the Court's

previous decision in this case goes a long way to 

providing an answer, that yes, it does make a difference 

to preserve a safe haven where, if parents want to put 

their kids down in front of the television set at 

8:00 p.m., they know that there's a segment of what's 

available that -- where they're not going to have to 

worry about whether the kids are going to get bombarded 

with curse words or nudity. And then the reason --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But this goes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then there's -- and 

then there's -- and then there's the chip that's 

available. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, you ask 

your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off 

the chip. They're the only ones that know how to do it. 

(Laughter. ) 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, and that -- that 

does point out the problem with the -- with the V-chip. 

Of course, the V-chip is not new. It's been around for 

more than a decade, and the -- the broadcasters have 

tried to encourage uptake. The government has tried to 

encourage uptake. It hasn't taken.

that the chip technology works better if you have this 

differentiation between broadcast and cable media? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No, a different point. I 

think the -- I want to get to what I think is the 

fundamental point here, that whatever may be the case 

with respect to the ability of a viewer to differentiate 

whether something is a broadcast channel or a cable 

channel, the reality is that broadcasters are in a 

different position by virtue of the fact that they have 

a license from the government that comes with this 

enforceable public obligation that allows the government 

to create this safe haven, and that puts them in a 

different position. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a way, that's 

circular. That's what we're here to argue about. I'm 

asking --

GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is there a functional, 

a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Is there -- well, I'm 

sorry, Justice Kennedy. The V-chip works with both 

broadcast and -- and cable transmissions, to the extent 

it works. The -- what the briefs have pointed out --

and I would suggest in particular that the Court look at 

the brief from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which

does a very thorough job in explaining the many ways in 

which the V-chip has proven to be a deficient 

technology. A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and 

incompleteness of the codes, the labels that -- that the 

programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there 

in order for the V-chip to decide what gets through and 

what doesn't. 

And I would point out in this very case, for 

example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003 

Billboard Music Award broadcast with the Paris Hilton-

Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known 

from the code affixed for the V-chip purpose that that 

broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in 

them. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What will happen when --

when we get to the point where -- when there are only a 

handful of people in the entire country who are still 

receiving television programs via the airwaves? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I do think we're 

not there now, as we've said in our brief, but --

JUSTICE KAGAN: We're almost there, right --

10 percent? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: And I do -- but that I 

think -- that really makes what I think is one of the 

most fundamental points here, is that the broadcasters

resource which they got for free, and then they have a 

statutory benefit of must-carry, which gets them on 

cable systems automatically, and a further statutory 

benefit of preferred channel placement on -- on those --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sign -- sign me up as 

supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a 

symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of 

dress for the people that attend this Court and the 

people that attend other Federal courts. It's a 

symbolic matter. 

And if this is – if these are public airwaves, 

the government is entitled to insist upon a certain 

modicum of decency. I'm not sure it even has to relate 

to juveniles, to tell you the truth. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- and we certainly 

agree, Justice Scalia, with the point that was made in 

the Court's previous decision in this case, that -- for 

example, the words that are in the Fox broadcasts --

teachers don't use those words with students. You don't 

hear those words in churches or synagogues. There are

is -- I think that children -- that children are not 

going to be shocked by them the way they might have been 

a generation ago. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think

right on the mark with respect to this issue, which is 

it's a question of whether it's portrayed as

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS FOX TELEVISION 

STATIONS, INC., ET AL. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to respond initially to some of 

General Verrilli's general observations. First of all, 

he talks about indecency as somehow serving as the core 

of the overall understanding of the regulatory deal that 

was made here. And it's difficult for me to accept that 

notion when there was no effort whatsoever to enforce 

the -- the standard of indecency between 1927 and 1975. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these 

sorts of words or these sorts of images. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, maybe, maybe not. We

don't know. All we know is that for a period of 

50 years, nothing happened. So, the idea --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, we know. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, we can -- it 

was not the case from 1927 till whenever you -- what, 

1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on 

broadcast television or the various words we're dealing 

with here commonly appeared. So, it seems a bit much to 

say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period. 

There were no cases to be brought. 

MR. PHILLIPS: The only point I'm trying to 

make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about 

this as sort of the core understanding between the 

parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the 

process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're 

talking about. And, indeed, if you put it in context, 

this is a statute that prohibits obscenity, profanity, 

and indecency. And while the FCC spent a lot of time 

writing about profanity as somehow being offended by 

what went on in this omnibus order, the commission has 

completely abandoned that under these circumstances. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But how about this, 

Mr. Phillips: Look, you've been given a privilege, and 

that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway

to impose obligations on you. Not -- can't impose 

everything, but at least has a bit more leeway. And 

here we've had something that's very historically 

grounded. We've had this for decades and decades that 

the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated 

differently. 

It seems to work, and it -- it seems to be a 

good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the 

old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist 

anymore. 

So, why not just keep it as it is? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, Justice 

Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your 

question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which 

was you're not saying that we lose all of our First 

Amendment rights. So, clearly we retain our First 

Amendment rights. 

And, under those circumstances, it seems to 

me you've got this two ways: First of all, the idea 

that it, quote, "worked" -- it worked perfectly fine 

from all the way up until 2001, even I would say until 

2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach. 

And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004 and, as we 

sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands 

of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are

holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so 

that the whole system has come to a screeching halt 

because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these 

issues. 

So, to say that the system is working well, 

it seems to me, at least from the broadcasters' 

perspective, is to say -- is to suggest that's just not 

true. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you want us to 

overrule a decision of this Court, Pacifica. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Alito. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Now, as to radio, what --

what has changed? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not here --

JUSTICE ALITO: To justify that? Well, 

could we hold that the policy is -- is invalid as to --

on First Amendment grounds as to TV but not as to radio? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, Your Honor, 

because there are fundamentally different media, and 

there are different protections and the circumstances 

are different, and the Court has recognized that media 

have to be evaluated individually. But what has 

happened over the 30 years with respect to the broadcast 

side of television is a very fundamental change. Cable 

is now equally pervasive. Cable is now equally

accessible to TV, satellite equally accessible to TV. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- but that 

-- that cuts both ways. People who want to watch 

broadcasts where these words or expose their children to 

broadcasts where these words are used, where there is 

nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for 

that. All we're asking for, what the Government is 

asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not 

going to -- they're not going to hear the "S" word, the 

"F" word. They're not going to see nudity. So, the 

proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts 

against you. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me there 

are two answers to that: First of all, the notion that 

one medium operates in a certain way in the exercise of 

its First Amendment rights can be used as an -- as an 

explanation for taking away or for -- for restricting 

the First Amendment rights of another medium is flatly 

inconsistent with what this Court has said across the 

board in the First Amendment context. You don't balance 

off one speaker against another and give one favored 

status and give another unfavored status. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's your 

argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective 

to have a safe harbor.

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you can get a safe 

harbor, and, indeed, there are a number of safe harbors 

that are out there. First of all, there are a ton of 

cable networks that are aimed exclusively at children. 

And, you know, there are five, six, eight stations that, 

I guarantee you, you will see -- where you'll see none 

of that language. 

And, second of all, it's always available to 

the United States Government to decide to hold this --

to create its own license for the United States to be a 

broadcaster and to ensure that the broadcasts of the 

United States public network exclude anything they want 

to exclude because that's government speech and is in no 

way restricted by what the First Amendment would 

provide. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we rule in your 

favor on the First Amendment grounds, what will people 

who watch Fox be seeing between 6:00 a.m. and 

10:00 p.m.? Are they going to be seeing a lot of people 

parading around in the nude and a stream of expletives? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Not under the guidelines that 

the -- that Fox has used consistently from 10:00 p.m. 

until 6:00 a.m. and candidly that all of the other 

networks follow.

audiences that have to be responded to by the networks 

insist on some measure of restraint, not a measure 

of restraint --

JUSTICE ALITO: So, what will you put on 

that you are not able to put on now? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, some of the 

things that we could at least wonder about is "Saving 

Private Ryan," "Catch-22," perhaps the beginning of the 

Olympics. There's a whole slew of questions. I mean, 

the -- and if you go beyond that and you think about 

what speech has been chilled, the Tillman memorial 

service is not broadcast because of fear of what's going 

to be said there. Football games, basketball games, 

local news events --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, suppose we 

take that particular line. You didn't argue -- I mean, 

Fox didn't argue -- Fox was worried about the fleeting 

expletive policy in Golden Globe. I doubt in Golden 

Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised 

all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy. 

So, why -- here you've taken a much broader 

stance now, though you didn't before. I mean, do you 

want to say anything about what I think is the basic 

issue that Fox raises? We don't have to overrule 

Pacifica. What Fox was penalized for was two women on

seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary.

about small stations that cannot censor people because 

they don't know what they're going to say. All right.

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Are you abandoning that 

argument? 

MR. PHILLIPS: No, no, no, of course not. 

But you have to realize, Justice Breyer, that what -- I 

mean, the Second Circuit, because it didn't have 

available to it sort of what to do precisely with 

Pacifica, tended to focus on the question of vagueness. 

Vagueness was certainly an argument that we made there, 

but --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's an ABC argument 

primarily, but you made that argument in the Second 

Circuit. What I'm fishing with -- you don't have to 

comment more, but -- is, do we have to reach that 

argument? Except it's --

shock treatment that Justice Powell described in a 

separate opinion, and this doesn't come anywhere near 

that, and, therefore, this is beyond what the First 

Amendment provides, the Court could clearly hold that

should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of 

the "F" word, the "S" word, any -- any shots of any 

nudity in any movie, buttocks included. That would give 

you all of the notice that you need. Why don't you 

propose that? Boy, that's certain as can be. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, our basic argument 

would then -- I mean, obviously what you'd be taking 

away is the vagueness argument, but that would just 

bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core 

Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the --

happy if they want to try to adopt those kinds of 

standards and subject them to the strict scrutiny 

requirements that this Court applies to every other 

medium, because the truth is those requirements will not 

withstand scrutiny under those particular standards.

living on borrowed time. It's not going to be long 

before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track 

tapes.

satellite and by Internet. But the -- to the extent 

that they're making money from people who are using 

rabbit ears, that's -- that's disappearing. Do you

the First Amendment question says what can the FCC do 

under these circumstances? 

It seems to me there are probably four 

different ways you can go about it, all of which says 

what the FCC did here is wrong. You can say Pacifica is 

an exceedingly narrow decision. It goes to the outer 

limits of what the First Amendment allows the FCC to do.

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that was clearly not --

I mean, from Fox's perspective, it was not scripted to 

set it up that way. But, remember, the first -- the 

first expletive --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I mean, isn't it 

inevitable that this will happen? 

MR. PHILLIPS: It is inevitable that --

well, I think it's inevitable regardless that people are 

going to continue to use language that they would 

naturally use. So, yes, I do think you can expect on 

cable and any other forum in which you have humans 

speaking that this kind of language will expand.

I don't know that it -- and it will probably 

be the case that in some context, particularly live 

television, which is really what's placed in jeopardy by 

this, that you will have less live television because 

your concern is people will continue to use this 

language. 

On a lot of awards shows, I think it's 

candidly easier to go ahead and -- and bleep this. It's 

not always -- it's not foolproof, but the stations are 

committed to doing that. They've all got their 

standards. And that was applied in this particular 

case. So, while there may be some marginal increase in 

it, if you compare it to the use of this language beyond 

the broadcast context, it's the -- it is just the 

narrowest of slivers of increase, Justice Kennedy. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that there is a 

difference between what a person sees on broadcast 

channels and what a person sees on basic cable? Basic 

cable now? 

MR. PHILLIPS: You mean, can the average 

child understand the difference between the two? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: In -- no, in content. Is 

there a difference in content? Because basic cable 

channels are not restricted by these rules, and I'm just 

wondering whether you think that there's a difference.

Because I -- it has not been apparent to me that there 

is. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, in some -- I 

think it probably depends on which -- which channels you 

-- you look at, and even in the basic channels, but the 

-- there's the cartoon that's significantly more adult 

that's on the cable channels than the cartoons that you 

might see on the -- on the Fox Television. 

So, yes, I think there's probably a certain 

edgierness to it, but that said, it's still clear 

that -- that as long as you have advertising revenue 

that drives a significant amount of the decisionmaking 

here, you're going to have the kind of self-restraint 

that frankly ought to cause the Court to say we should 

no -- we no longer need to treat the broadcast medium as 

the weak sister of -- of the media. 

And, therefore, they ought to have the same 

protections that everybody else has, and that they will 

engage in the same restrained approach to these kinds of 

issues that newspapers do. I mean, the Post doesn't run 

the language of the case that's -- that's being argued 

before it. Cable does. All of those media do. Because 

there are natural restraints. You don't need the 

Federal Communications Commission any longer to ensure 

under these circumstances.

approach. All I'm suggesting is that there -- that, in 

general, most people who -- who rely upon advertising 

and have to play to a particular audience in order to

what your audience --

MR. PHILLIPS: At a minimum, the 

broadcasters will be. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It depends what 

audience you're -- you're trying to get and the 

demographic. If you're trying to get an audience that 

is older, maybe you will decide this is what is going to 

attract them. They don't want sanitized language. They 

want to hear the -- the -- all those other words. If 

your target is a much younger audience, maybe that will 

happen. But the idea that you're -- the problem is 

going to go away because you're going to be good as you 

can be, that seems an odd way to analyze First Amendment 

problems.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ABC, INC., ET AL. 

MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

When the issue is the content-based 

regulation of speech, it is the government, not the 

speaker, that must steer, quote, "far wide of the 

prohibited zone." That foundational principle is 

nowhere in evidence in the FCC's current enforcement 

regime, which not only intrudes into the prohibited zone 

but also enforces the indecency ban in a starkly 

inconsistent manner. 

A regime in which government officials 

decide years after the fact that 7 seconds of rear 

nudity in this particular episode of "NYPD Blue" is

indecent, but 40 seconds of nudity including full 

frontal nudity in "Catch-22" is not; that expletives in 

a documentary about blues musicians is indecent, but 

even more of those expletives in a fictional movie about 

World War II is not, is constitutionally intolerable. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: People understand --

what you're -- have demonstrated, I think, is that the 

context matters. People understand that, including 

children. When they hear a bad word when someone hits 

their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's 

different than having an adult stand in normal 

conversation and use the words. And it seems to me that 

your position is saying that the government cannot 

regulate with an understanding of what takes place in 

the real world. 

The government's effort is to try to 

understand the context. That's why you get a different 

rule in "Saving Private Ryan" than you get with Paris 

Hilton and Nicole Richie. And what your argument seems 

to be is they can't take context into account. 

MR. WAXMAN: On -- quite the contrary. This 

Court made clear, in particularly Justice Powell's 

concurrence in Pacifica, that context is all-important. 

And just look at this case. Despite -- and this goes 

directly to some of these questions about nudity.

Despite decades of denying complaints about televised 

nudity, the commission chose this case for the first 

time to sanction nudity on television in a serious drama 

that had been on for 10 years, that had featured over

JUSTICE BREYER: This wasn't -- I mean, I --

Awakening." It's about the sexual awakening of a child. 

You ran it, your client, after 10 o'clock on both 

coasts, and they choose to run it at 9 o'clock for some 

unknown reason in the Midwest. Maybe they thought -- I 

don't know, whatever. But the --

(Laughter.) 

MR. WAXMAN: It's not --

point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it 

1 hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the 

coast. 

MR. WAXMAN: Just --

not -- I'm not saying -- taking this point of view, but 

I'm saying why isn't that just time, manner, and

MR. WAXMAN: The -- this is not some sort of 

obscure, unknown reason. This show was run across the 

country in the last hour of prime time, which happens to 

be from 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. in the Midwest and Mountain 

Time zones. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because you wanted to make 

more money from it, I understand that. And maybe people 

would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the 

inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at 

this show is not like "Private Ryan." It's about sexual 

awakening. They are showing a part of a nude woman. 

The viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of 

the boy who's seeing her, and the whole thing was 

titillating. 

Now, they might be wrong. There are two 

sides to that argument. And so, I guess what you're 

arguing is -- if I were to say, is that a reasonable 

view? I guess I'd have to say it. But you have to 

say much -- you're telling me I have to say much more 

than that. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, number -- yes. Number 

one, it is not a reasonable view for reasons that I'll 

explain. It was not sexual awakening. This was the 

portrayal in the context of a story line about the --

the difficulties and embarrassments of blended families.

This was an exploration of one of the things that

shower. 

In any event, the commission for years had

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. WAXMAN: It is simply untrue -- it is 

simply untrue that this had never occurred before. 

"NYPD Blue" itself was in its 10th season. The very 

first episode, which caused a lot of media attention, 

included a nude scene of love making. It was the 

subject of any number of complaints.

case by case, in which, for the reasons, then I quote 

you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of 

the guideline to this case. In other words, what I'm 

driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: 

Does this case in front of us really call for the 

earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in 

the -- in the briefs? 

And that's what I'm trying to figure out, 

and that's why I am particularly worried about whether 

or not this whole big argument here was presented to the 

FCC about whether we have to reach that far. Now do you 

see where I was trying to get? 

MR. WAXMAN: I think so. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. WAXMAN: And if not, I -- I hope you'll 

tell me. First of all, the -- the -- both First 

Amendment and Fifth Amendment issues were fully argued 

in front of the commission, and the commission addressed 

them in its decision in the ABC case. 

We, of course, didn't ask the -- suggest 

to the commission that it should no longer apply 

Pacifica because the factual predicates for more relaxed 

scrutiny didn't apply, as we didn't in the Second 

Circuit, because only this Court can reconsider the 

application of that standard. So, that's an argument

we're making here. 

That argument is not necessary to resolving 

this case, either on First or Fifth Amendment grounds. 

This broadcast -- and particularly in light of the 

ubiquitous V-chip, this broadcast is not actionably 

indecent under Pacifica, number one. With respect to 

notice or the vagueness of the application to this show, 

clearly this was a shot out of the blue. 

The commission cannot identify -- I 

challenge the commission to identify a single decision 

of the commission issued before this was broadcast in 

2003 in which it had sanctioned any display of nudity, 

and I'm going all the way back to 1978. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: By "sanctioned," you mean 

punished as -- as opposed to "blessed" sanctioned? 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, sanctioned 

in the "ouch" sense. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How many displays -- how 

many displays of nudity were there that -- that went 

unsanctioned? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, for -- I don't -- I can't 

tell you, but I can tell you based on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, I mean, if there 

are very few, it's not a very powerful argument.

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- I think it's a 

powerful argument. Let me explain the ones that I know 

of. 1978, the commission's decision in WGBH, which 

complained about scenes of explicit nudity in "Monty 

Python's Flying Circus": Denied. "Catch-22," 

40 seconds of nudity, including 10 seconds of full 

frontal female nudity: Denied. 

The four or five decisions that we -- that 

we discuss on page 18 of our brief and that are appended 

to the merits brief of the ABC affiliates. I can't 

remember whether it's 12 or 16, but more than a dozen 

episodes of "NYPD Blue" itself that included displays, 

graphic displays, of nudity during the prior nine 

seasons -- complained about and not adjudicated. 

That is the backdrop against which the --

enforcement until Pacifica, I think it's only fair, as 

you pointed out yourself, to look at what the commission 

has been addressing. 

They're right now -- I mean, you know, I've 

cited the ones that are the subject of commission 

decisions. I haven't cited the -- I haven't attempted 

to hypothesize about all the other instances, but let's 

just look at what's at stake here because the issue, 

Justice Breyer, is not just notice to ABC in this case. 

The question is whether the standards -- the 

commission's standards as it's currently applying them 

are so vague and capacious that they not only permit 

arbitrary action, but they are engaging in arbitrary 

action. 

Right now, as -- as Mr. Phillips suggested, 

the commission has pending before it, which it has not 

denied for years, complaints about the opening episode 

of the last Olympics, which included a -- a statue very 

much like some of the statues that are here in this 

courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks. It -- it 

has refused to say that “Catch 22” -- its "Catch" – right 

over here, Justice Scalia.

wasn't us. In the "Saving Private Ryan" context, where 

the commission did say as a commission, not actionably 

indecent.

MR. WAXMAN: I don't know the pages. Let me 

just -- I can't remember the pages. Let me just outline 

what I think -- four different things that could 

ameliorate the vagueness of the current regime. 

First of all, the FCC could revert back to 

it's, quote, "emphatically narrow enforcement regime," 

which acknowledged, one, that it had to defer to 

reasonable judgments of the broadcasters, and not 

exercise the -- an editorial eye looking at camera 

angles, whether something was or wasn't necessary to the 

message. Number two --

let you get all four out. But on that, the reasonable 

deference to the broadcasters, your policy was not to 

allow people in the situation of Paris Hilton and Nicole 

Richie to use those words. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if they deferred 

to your reasonable judgment, your friend's reasonable 

judgment, they would sanction those. 

MR. WAXMAN: I'm not owning Nicole Richie, 

and I think the best answer to the Nicole Richie point 

is that there is a scienter requirement in the statute 

that, you know, would preclude the application to a 

good-faith effort. But let me just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Go on to 

number two.

MR. WAXMAN: I'm not -- I'm not being --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your time's -- I 

think you are.

before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was 

restricted to material that is not momentary exposure 

but is dwelled upon, and that, as Pacifica explained, 

was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic 

activity. 

The second thing they could do is make this 

three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a 

test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number 

of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way 

the commission wants to. 

Even if it wants to leave it as factors --

and this is number three -- it could at least identify 

what they are and apply them consistency -- consistently 

through adjudication that explains why one over-balances 

the other, which it certainly did not do in this case. 

And it also could clean up the actual form 

of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to 

sexually explicit or excretory activity.

Mr. Chief Justice. 

First with respect to the notion of 

self-restraint on the part of broadcasters, I think a 

little history is in order here. The commission started 

with the rule that came out of Pacifica. What it faced 

in the 1980s, with that being the outer bound of the 

commission's authority, was the explosion of the shock 

jock phenomenon, Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge 

and the rest of it, which didn't use any of the seven 

words in the Carlin monologue, but which was highly vile 

and lewd, and it required the commission to make a 

judgment. Now, that was all advertising-sponsored 

broadcast. And so, I do think the risk of a race to the 

bottom is real --

JUSTICE KAGAN: General --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and this history is 

showing it. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I think that the -- that the 

networks really are saying, well, even -- even if some 

regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that 

the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it 

complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go 

after and what not to go after; that it has not tied 

itself in any way to any kinds of standards. And it's, 

you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way

that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use 

dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and that there's a lot of 

room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what 

speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good. 

And that that's a serious First Amendment issue. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- well, I disagree. 

First, that's the lens problem again. We are talking 

about a tiny, tiny number of the broadcasts that occur 

in a month, much less a year, much less a decade. So, 

the idea that there's a significant First Amendment 

problem that encompasses a wide variety of broadcast 

expression I just don't think comports with the facts. 

Second, I do think if one looks at the 

corpus of decisions that the commission has made about 

what's indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with 

respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority 

of them, that it's clear which side of the line 

something fell on. Yes, there isn't perfect clarity. 

There are going to be some hard cases. But they really 

have identified what is, in the great scheme of things, 

a trivial number of hard cases. 

I don't think one can say that this is a 

situation like Reno in which there's effectively no

standard at all. In Reno, this Court distinguished the 

Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think 

we've identified them in our brief and those are valid. 

I do think there's a significant problem 

with thinking about Pacifica as the outer bound of the 

commission's authority under the First Amendment. Of course --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the Justices 

involved said this is a narrow decision, both Justice 

Stevens and Justice Powell. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, and, Justice 

Ginsburg, that's true, and the principles the commission 

continues to apply are narrow principles. This is 

not -- this is not something that covers a vast array of 

speech on broadcast. It's a tiny fraction. And so --

and I do think if you're talking about Pacifica as the 

outer bound, the consequences are the shock jocks are 

fine; the Super Bowl half-time episode with Janet 

Jackson is fine. 

You can have as many of these 7-second 

episodes of "NYPD Blue" as you want. That's all fine. 

In fact, anything that's -- anything that isn't at 

that extreme level is fine. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on the other side, 

you'd better be careful about calling certain people,

certain artists to be interviewed because, even though 

it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to 

say something they shouldn't say. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But I -- a couple answers 

there. One is the delaying bleeping technology, Justice 

Ginsburg, and the other one is that there is a scienter 

requirement under the commission's enforcement authority 

here. And so, in that situation, it seems highly 

unlikely you would have the requisite scienter that 

could lead to a forfeiture. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the third is you 

shouldn't interview these people. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Let me spend, if I could, 

a minute on the "NYPD Blue" broadcast. The -- ABC 

hinges a lot on the notion, Justice Breyer, that this is 

a non-sexualized episode. I mean, I guess one could 

make up one's own mind looking at the video. The 

commission decided that that was -- it was essentially 

voyeurism. The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 

sentence, please. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you. The little 

boy walks into the room at the very end of that -- of 

that segment of nudity, and I do think that fully 

vindicates the commission's judgment with respect to the
