 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in United States versus 

Resendiz-Ponce. 

Mr. Dreeben.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Neder versus United States, this Court 

held that the omission of an offense element from petit 

jury instructions can be harmless error, even though 

that omission violates the Sixth Amendment right to a 

jury trial. Our submission is that the same analysis 

applies to the omission of an offense element from a 

grand jury's indictment. Such an error violates the 

Fifth Amendment, but it is harmless when the petit jury, 

having been properly instructed on all of the elements 

of the offense, returns a verdict of guilty beyond a 

reasonable doubt.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure if this 

works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an 

opportunity for counsel to object. There isn't an 

opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment

comes down. Now, I guess you could move to quash.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice 

Kennedy. In fact, parties do move to dismiss 

indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of 

the offense. That happened here. The motion was 

erroneously denied by the trial judge. The trial judge, 

under Ninth Circuit law, under the assumption that the 

Ninth Circuit has properly interpreted the law, should 

have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the 

substantial step that was part of the attempt. And if 

the judge had done that, then the Government would have 

gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding 

indictment.

 Instead what the judge did was deny the 

motion, finding that the indictment itself was 

sufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the 

elements that the Ninth Circuit requires as part of this 

offense. And so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond 

a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve 

a substantial step towards the completion of the 

offense.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem that the 

motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on 

his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the 

trial? And we want to induce the court to look very

carefully at it at that point, because if the court is 

wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a 

result of it. And the way to induce the court to be 

very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not 

harmless error, and you've got to take this very 

seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in 

effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error 

analysis later.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all, Justice 

Souter, motions like this are typically made long in 

advance of trial, as this one was. Waiting until the 

day of trial is far from the optimum practice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm sure that's 

right. But that simply reinforces my point.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think what it 

reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at 

it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right 

without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand 

of automatic reversal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you concede that the 

error would always be harmless if you have a trial 

before a petit jury, and all of the elements are 

instructed to be found by the jury?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is 

our position.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't 

necessarily make sense. You can imagine a situation 

where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that 

supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the 

prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that 

evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but 

indict anyway without it.

 In other words, what's your response to the 

situation where there's no probable cause on an element 

at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is 

later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?

 MR. DREEBEN: My response, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is the same response that this Court gave in 

United States versus Mechanik, where it was confronted 

with an analogous problem. And that was in that case, a 

violation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to 

testify at the same time before the grand jury.

 And the Court was specifically confronted 

with the question: Was this harmless error because the 

petit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable 

doubt? And it answered that question yes. And en route 

to that answer, it said, we could logically be persuaded 

that what we're supposed to do is compare the evidence 

in front of the grand jury to the error and see whether 

the error was prejudicially consequential for the grand

jury's decision. But we're not going to do that, the 

Court explicitly said in Mechanik, because once there is 

a finding of beyond a reasonable doubt, the question of 

probable cause is shown a fortiori and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, you mean you can 

never decide this question until after the trial is 

completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a 

reasonable doubt?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia, the 

district court should decide this question in advance of 

trial when it's properly raised and, if the indictment 

is defective, dismiss it. And this Court has recognized 

that trial judges don't need incentives of an automatic 

reversal rule to get them to comply with the law.

 And I want to amend --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the U.S. Attorney in 

this case oppose the motion to quash the indictment?

 MR. DREEBEN: In this case?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. And the Ninth Circuit's 

ruling that this indictment was defective was really --

bolt out-of-the-blue might be too strong. But it was an 

extension of its prior precedents in a way that wasn't 

directly foreseeable. The United States Attorney's 

office had every reason to believe, based on language in

prior Ninth Circuit cases, that alleging an attempt to 

enter was adequate to allege the offense.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Dreeben, this touches on 

what troubles me about this. I wonder whether we can 

answer the generic question that you presented, whether 

the omission of an element of a criminal offense from 

the indictment can constitute harmless error, without 

considering the nature of the alleged defect here.

 I don't know how you can answer -- if you 

look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible 

to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to 

agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can 

answer those questions without reaching a conclusion 

about whether there was any defect in the indictment in 

the first place.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Alito --

JUSTICE ALITO: And it doesn't seem to me 

that there's any defect in this indictment. It charges 

-- it recites the language of the statute, it uses the 

word "attempt" which has a very well-settled meaning in 

the law. Any lawyer would understand exactly what is 

required for an attempt. It sets out the factual basis 

of the charge. So I don't know how you would get to 

the -- how you can answer the second question without 

getting into the first question.

MR. DREEBEN: We did not challenge in our 

certiorari petition, which this Court granted, the Ninth 

Circuit's holding that in order for an attempt to be 

accomplished there needs to be a substantial step, and 

in an indictment under section 1326, there needs to be 

an allegation of what that substantial step is.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have the same problem. 

It's such a difficult requirement to get a hold of. I 

mean, he drives the car, he walks, he breathes. I mean, 

all of these things enable him to get into the country. 

I just don't understand the basis for the rule.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it is common law --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: He wasn't forced to go 

over. He did it on his own. It seems to me that's --

MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's certainly the 

Government's position, Justice Kennedy. But it is well 

settled in the common law that attempts require a 

substantial step towards the completion. There are 

variations that different jurisdictions use. That's the 

Model Penal Code formulation. The Ninth Circuit I think 

has gone beyond where some other courts have gone, as 

Justice Alito was noting, by saying that the indictment 

needs to spell out the factual basis for that 

substantial step.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would that be here?

That he drove the car to the border? That he got out of 

the car? That he presented a document? What -- if you 

could do it over again, what would the indictment say?

 MR. DREEBEN: The indictment would have to 

say that he attempted to enter the United States and 

took a substantial step towards the completion of that 

crime, to wit he approached the border and came to the 

guard and presented false identifications to the guard 

and lied about his intended destination.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If you went back to the --

if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth 

century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws, 

they would say that where you use a legal term that has 

a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't 

need to spell out the definition of that, of that 

concept. It's enough to use the term. So what the 

Ninth Circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go 

back to something that's more demanding than would have 

been required in a nineteenth century indictment and 

frame that as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Alito, I'm not 

going to defend what the Ninth Circuit did here, but I 

will be clear about the following: There is a generic 

legal issue at stake in this case that we face in the 

Ninth Circuit and in other courts around the country

because indictments are not always written perfectly. 

And whether it's an element that the Ninth Circuit has 

improperly read into it or an element that a court has 

properly read into a statute, we do face the situation 

where --

JUSTICE BREYER: As to the element, I 

thought that what the Ninth Circuit talked about was 

overt act. They didn't use the words "overt act."

 MR. DREEBEN: They did, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. I thought 

that comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of 

attempt law. Then I thought it's unlikely -- but here 

you can correct me. The U.S. Code is filled with the 

word "attempt." Just opening it at random, there are 

attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are 

attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to 

rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there.

 Is it the Government's practice whenever 

they charge a violation of any of these provisions to 

not just use the word "attempt," but to use the words 

"substantial step"?

 MR. DREEBEN: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought the 

answer was no. And therefore, this isn't just a small 

error of a technical sort. The Ninth Circuit is

completely wrong and not even close. And therefore, if 

they're not even close, can the Government come up here 

where there's an obvious error and they decide, the 

Government, that it would like to have a declaration by 

this Court on a matter that they think is quite 

interesting and important to them in a lot of other 

cases where they can't win the cases easily?

 That's, I'm putting it a little pejoratively 

because I'm trying to get you to see what I'm driving 

at. It's like a hoked-up case. Why not? I'm using it 

pejoratively only so that you can see what I'm worried 

about.

 MR. DREEBEN: We didn't really have a lot of 

choice about it. I mean, the Ninth Circuit decided to 

read the statute this way and it reversed the 

conviction. There's not a circuit split under section 

1326. We have to bring thousands of indictments in the 

Ninth Circuit, so we're not exactly going to set up test 

cases to risk our convictions based on the Ninth 

Circuit's rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're making the 

concession only for purposes of this case. That is, in 

another case you would be free to say the word "attempt" 

is good enough; you don't have to spell out in the 

indictment a particular overt act.

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's not 

unusual for this Court to decide a case where the 

Government does not challenge the underlying 

constitutional ruling and make some remedial argument. 

Two very notable examples are United States versus Leon, 

where the Government did not challenge the underlying 

Fourth Amendment claim that was found to be valid by the 

lower court, but instead simply asked for a modification 

of the exclusionary rule; and another example is Rose 

versus Clark, which involves a fairly analogous issue to 

this one, whether it can be harmless error to fail to 

incorporate into the jury instructions the actual 

element and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable 

presumption. In that case the State did not challenge 

whether the instruction violated the Constitution. This 

Court didn't decide it. Instead, what it decided was 

the remedial question of harmless error, which is an 

important question and I submit doesn't change in 

character depending on the nature of the underlying 

error.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We've done it before, 

there's no doubt about it. But the better practice 

usually is to have a case in which the issue really 

presents the hard question. And you're asking us to 

make a ruling in this case that would govern failure to

allege an aggravating circumstance in a death case, for 

example, which has a different atmosphere to the whole 

case when you're facing that kind of an issue.

 MR. DREEBEN: It may have a different 

atmosphere, but I don't think that it has any different 

legal analysis behind it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: A judge's reaction to a 

case is often affected by just exactly what's involved. 

And here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim 

any particular prejudice out of the error in this 

particular case or, really, it's arguable that there's 

no defect in the indictment at all because it was 

adequate notice to the defendant of what he's charged 

with. This is much like a case in the State systems 

where you have notice pleading. It doesn't seem very 

prejudicial.

 But you put it in a different context, you 

might have a different reaction to the case.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think our fundamental 

submission here is that with respect to the probable 

cause determination, there is no prejudice because of 

the petit jury's verdict. With respect to notice, we 

would acknowledge that a defendant could argue that the 

defect in a grand jury indictment in a particular case 

could fail to give him adequate notice such that he

might have a case-specific claim of prejudice and be 

able to overturn the conviction. On the facts of this 

case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that would not 

be a very strong argument. There really is no reason to 

think that there was any notice problem with this very 

discrete transaction which was alleged in the indictment 

as occurring on a particular date in a particular place.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does this come up very 

often? I think the case -- the issue you want to raise, 

because I would think normally there's a motion before 

the trial, well before the jury is empanelled. The 

defendant says: I want you to dismiss this; the 

indictment's inadequate. And if that's even close, I 

would think normally the prosecutor would go back and 

say: Fine, I'll get a superseding indictment, and that 

would end the problem. And it seems to me so likely to 

happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling 

against the defendant and then it goes through a whole 

trial almost never happens.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think that 

an empirical perspective might be helpful here. And I 

think an empirical perspective, if you look around the 

circuits and you see the number of issues, cases, in 

which this issue is raised, it becomes clear that there 

are a large number of situations in which mistakes get

made.

 I mean, we're talking about a Federal system 

here in which 70 to 80,000 cases are indicted a year. 

Mistakes will happen, and they will happen both by the 

trial judge and by the prosecutor.

 And there will be situations in which the 

circuits change the law or the interpretation of the law 

after the decision in question. I think that this is a 

good example of that, where the Ninth Circuit extended 

its prior precedents to find that an indictment that 

didn't allege the overt act was inadequate.

 And then the Government is stuck, and the 

rule of automatic reversal, which the Court may appear 

to think in this case is particularly disproportionate 

since the indictment looks fine, functions identically 

even if there's a conceded violation that every member 

of the Court would say yes, there's a missing element 

here.

 The fundamental problem is that the grand 

jury sits to decide probable cause. It does not decide 

whether the defendant is actually guilty.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it sits to 

decide whether people should be indicted, and yes, 

they're supposed to determine whether there's probable 

cause, but historically a significant role for the grand

jury has been not to indict people even though the 

Government had the evidence to indict them.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I actually do not agree 

that there's any stronger evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that grand juries didn't indict when the Government had 

adequate evidence than there is historical evidence that 

petit juries did not convict when there's proof beyond a 

reasonable doubt. In both instances, you can point to 

historical instances in which grand juries and petit 

juries played a role of in effect nullifying when there 

was adequate evidence.

 But it's clear from the Neder decision that 

that history has not led to the conclusion that this 

Court cannot evaluate petit jury defects for 

harmlessness, and the same conclusion ought to be true a 

fortiori for the grand jury.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble with your a 

fortiori argument it seems to me is this: If we accept 

your argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on 

a motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the 

judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the 

motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial. 

And if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove 

the element, then it can either be thrown out because an 

element has not been proven or he can go back and revive

the motion to quash.

 If on the other hand the Government gets its 

act together at that point and does put in evidence on 

the element, it's going to be harmless error. And so 

the price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that 

someone will always be put to trial if there is any 

question about how the judge should rule on the motion 

to quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will 

grant the motion to quash and the Government can go back 

to the grand jury and get another indictment.

 It seems to me that something is seriously 

lost in that situation if we go your way.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter, 

experience doesn't show that, in fact, district courts 

don't grant these motions. They grant them, as Justice 

Breyer indicated, when the indictment is not sufficient.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sure they do grant 

them. But I'm concerned about the, we'll say, the 

doubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind. 

Under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always 

going to be to subject somebody to trial.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I do think we can assume 

that Article III judges are a hearty enough species so 

that they can make up their minds and they can rule. 

But to the extent that there is a risk here that judges

might reserve the motion, that is the same risk that the 

Court fessed up to and acknowledged in the Mechanik 

case, where in fact the judge did reserve the motion.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it seems to me that the 

prejudice to the defendant in the two -- as between the 

two situations simply is not comparable.

 In Mechanik you had a situation in which two 

witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting 

in were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence 

the other, et cetera. Here, we're talking about a 

situation in which it may very well be that the 

defendant should never be put to trial at all. And your 

rule says if there's any question about it, put him to 

trial, judge.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, given that this issue 

arises only when you have a petit jury verdict of guilty 

beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems overwhelmingly 

likely that any grand jury would have found probable 

cause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know -- do we have 

the grand jury transcripts, so do we know that, in fact, 

evidence was put before the grand jury that false 

identifications were presented at the border?

 MR. DREEBEN: The grand jury transcript is 

not in this record, Justice Ginsburg, and we do not

suggest that the Court adopt a rule in which it reviews 

the adequacy of the evidentiary showing before the grand 

jury. There are important values in grand jury secrecy. 

They will, of course, be compromised at the trial stage 

if witnesses testify and the testimony is turned over in 

that context.

 But more important than the practical aspect 

is exactly the logic that the Court used in Mechanik. 

The point of the grand jury indictment is to determine 

is there enough to take this person to trial. Once the 

person has been taken to trial and been found guilty 

beyond a reasonable doubt, we know that if the 

Government went back to the grand jury it would be able 

to get an indictment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How far would you go with 

the Mechanik logic? Suppose that someone is charged by 

information with a felony without the person's consent 

and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss 

the information and then the person is convicted. Would 

you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict 

that the fact that the person was charged with a felony 

by information calls for no remedy?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I would not go that far, 

Justice Alito. I would draw the same line that this 

Court drew in the Midland Asphalt case where it was

looking at a somewhat analogous problem of an 

interlocutory appeal and the same line that it drew in 

Neder itself. In Neder the Court said if the judge 

directs a verdict of guilty, that's an impermissible act 

and it cannot be rendered harmless no matter how 

overwhelming the evidence is.

 In the Midland Asphalt case, this Court 

dealt with whether the language of the Fifth Amendment 

created a right not to be tried. And it does say "No 

person shall be held to answer absent an indictment 

issued by a grand jury," and the Court said if you have 

a defect that causes an indictment not to be an 

indictment or, as in your hypothetical, Justice Alito, 

no indictment at all, or if you have a defect that 

causes the grand jury not to be a grand jury, those are 

the kind of fundamental errors that would give rise to a 

right not to be tried such that you could take an appeal 

before trial, an interlocutory appeal.

 And I would submit that the same kind of 

principle would apply here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's just a 

metaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an 

indictment? It's not some other standard of what's 

fundamentally unfair or, from the Sixth amendment, 

whether or not there's notice?

MR. DREEBEN: I'm borrowing the language 

from the Midland Asphalt opinion, but I think that it 

was a poetic way of putting the point that if you don't 

have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say poetic, I said 

metaphysical. When is an indictment not an indictment?

 MR. DREEBEN: When you don't have one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now why would there be any 

difference then? That's a question I was about to put 

to you. What if there is no indictment at all? Why 

couldn't you say the same thing? Well, you know, the 

only purpose of getting it is to see if there was 

probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a 

reasonable doubt.

 MR. DREEBEN: You could push the logic of 

that argument that far.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's pushing 

it, I think it's there.

 MR. DREEBEN: Just as in the Neder case, you 

could say that it would be harmless error if a judge 

directed a jury verdict when the evidence was 

overwhelming on all of the elements. But the Court did 

draw a distinction between those two situations. And I 

think that it's one that responds to a kind of common-

sense view of how fundamental an intrusion is there.

JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't an indictment have 

as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime 

he's being accused of committing? Isn't that -- so 

that's why I thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't 

it, or helpful to say that to the Ninth Circuit? And so 

an error is when it doesn't do that? And an error is 

when it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what 

crime is being committed, he's accused of. So suppose 

you had an indictment that really did that. Now he 

doesn't know what crime he's accused of. And then you 

go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into 

at what point did he work out what crime he was being 

accused of, rather hard to say.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, chances are he did know 

what crime he was accused of.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, of course the 

chances are. But there's a possibility he didn't.

 MR. DREEBEN: And we submit --

JUSTICE BREYER: So if he didn't and 

therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect, 

then what? Are you going to say we have to track 

down -- I mean what it's reminding me of is like trying 

to say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an 

adequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.

that, I hope, Justice Breyer. I mean, notice defects 

are very commonly alleged by defendants and courts know 

how to look for prejudice. They know how to say whether 

the defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare his 

defense or misled by the indictment in some fashion or 

another. And that's a very common case by case sort of 

prejudice inquiry that fits with the nature of the 

violation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- me until halfway through 

the trial that it was robbery I was being accused of 

because they left robbery out of the indictment.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, what you get are cases 

where there needs to be an effect on interstate commerce 

and it's not alleged and then the Government comes up 

with proof. I'm not saying that there is going to be a 

vast pool of cases in which defendants would validly be 

able to show prejudice from lack of notice; and that's 

because we do have many other means in the criminal 

justice system to alert the defendant to what he's 

facing.

 There's discovery, there's the opportunities 

for a bill of particulars to be filed. Those are the 

kinds of conventional harmless error inquiries that are 

appropriate when you have a claim that the indictment 

fails to give adequate notice. But what is not

appropriate is for the Ninth Circuit to impose a rule on 

the Government and on the system of justice that says we 

will automatically reverse, because there are important 

values at stake here whenever a rule of automatic 

reversal is contemplated. And this was true in the 

Mickens versus Taylor case where the Court rejected a 

rule of automatic reversal when a judge didn't ask a 

question in response to an obvious conflict --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still not sure of your 

test. It's whether or not it's fundamentally unfair, 

whether or not there's notice, which sounds like more 

Sixth Amendment than Fifth. Or whether it's not an 

indictment, a rose is a rose type of thing.

 MR. DREEBEN: There are two aspects to our 

rule, Justice Kennedy. The first is that to the extent 

that the claim of a defective indictment goes to the 

question of was there probable cause, that error and 

that constitutional value is not a basis for reversal 

once a petit jury has found guilt beyond a reasonable 

doubt on the same point.

 To the extent that the defect in the 

indictment goes to inadequate notice, a defendant can 

make such a claim post trial that the indictment 

prejudiced him because it was inadequately framed. But 

that should be done on a case-specific basis rather than

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. ATMORE L. BAGGOT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BAGGOT: Mr. Chief Justice, if it please 

the Court:

 The structure created by the Constitution of 

this country provides a single means of charging a 

person with a Federal criminal offense. The intention 

of the framers of the Constitution was that a group of 

ordinary citizens would take time away from their 

families, their businesses, and their other concerns for 

the purpose of deciding whether the requirements of the

Fifth Amendment have been met by a Government 

prosecutor, and in, in a few words, whether a trial 

should proceed. Or not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You could say the same 

thing about a petit jury. And in Neder we use the 

harmless error standard.

 MR. BAGGOT: Absolutely, but the proceedings 

before a grand jury are secret. We never know what 

happened inside a grand jury. It's a closed door 

proceeding. It is an independent body. It is not 

subject to any appeals or reviews by the trial judge. 

The only thing that we know what happened behind those 

closed doors was the document that emerges, which is the 

indictment which becomes public knowledge. Nothing else 

is known about what happened in that jury room.

 Now, I'll take a guess as to what happened. 

The Government told the grand jury that the overt act 

requirement was not necessary, or perhaps, I'll take 

another guess, they stated to the grand jury what they 

stated to the district judge, that the indictment does 

in fact state the overt act when plainly it doesn't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose we found 

out. Somebody told what happened, and it was a crime of 

bank robbery or it's an assault of a mailman, a postman. 

And you know, it turns out they didn't present one word

of evidence, not a word that says that this individual

There's complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a 

major element of the offense. And now, suppose we get 

finished with the trial. Plenty of evidence. 

Conviction. Can you go back and raise that?

JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I mean can you

 MR. BAGGOT: Oh, can you win.

 MR. BAGGOT: You can always raise it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you see, I'm saying 

is that error? Is that correctible error? I'm saying 

there is an absolute error. It is far worse than here. 

We know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever 

presented to the grand jury on a major element of the 

crime.

 MR. BAGGOT: You're assuming somehow the 

transcript has been disclosed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I assume we know that. 

Take that as a given. We know.

 MR. BAGGOT: The doors are open, they're not 

closed.

that, which is a major area because there's a harmless 

error is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same 

true here where the error is far more likely to be 

simply technical and make no difference given the 

adequacy of the evidence?

the grand jury did behind its closed doors, whether we 

open the doors or not.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's perfectly --

MR. BAGGOT: Sir?

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. What if it's 

perfectly clear that the error is simply a clerical 

error? Let's take a case where somebody is charged with 

possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. And 

before the grand jury, we look at the transcript, we see 

that the prosecutor introduced evidence of five 

judgments of convictions for felony offenses. And the 

jury is properly charged that they have to find that 

this individual was a convicted felon. And there's 

simply -- and then when the case is tried at, when the 

case is tried the defense even stipulates that the 

person is a convicted felon.

 But there's a clerical mistake in preparing 

the indictment. And it doesn't recite the fact that the 

defendant was previously convicted of a felony. It's 

your position that there must be a reversal there?

 MR. BAGGOT: Your Honor, if there is a 

clerical error, Rule 36 gives the trial judge the 

ability, and the power, and the authority to correct an 

error which is purely clerical. I refer you to the case 

of Contreras-Rojas, which was this exact defense.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, Rule 36 says the court 

may correct clerical errors at any situation. But that, 

your question presupposes that we know what happened in 

the grand jury room, that it should have been an 

indictment, they intended it to be in the indictment --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you distinguish 

the mail -- the letter carrier case that Justice Breyer 

posed, because there you said even though there was no 

evidence at all of what this person was, if the petit 

jury found it, that would not be subject to review. I 

don't think you answered Justice Breyer and he said if 

you concede that, the failure to introduce any evidence 

that this person was a letter carrier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would like to even 

sharpen Justice Breyer's hypothetical. Let's assume 

that the indictment did set forth what the overt act 

was. It did. But there was no evidence of that overt 

act introduced before the grand jury. What would the 

result of that be?

 MR. BAGGOT: My position is the conviction 

would stand, yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me to 

make a lot of sense.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, the grand jury is 

independent. There is no review from the grand jury. 

The petit jury is an independent institutional body. 

The function of the grand jury is not only to find 

probable cause, rightly or wrongly, but the function of 

the grand jury is also to select the charge. And 

specifically since your decision in Recuenco versus 

Washington that sentencing enhancements are to be 

treated the same way as basic elements of the offense to 

be charged also, the grand jury's role is going to be 

even better.

 My position is simply that there is no 

review whatsoever from the grand jury. If you're 

unhappy, you're a defendant, you're unhappy with what 

the grand jury did, you say there's no evidence, you go 

to trial, you get acquitted. That's the only review

there is of the grand jury and what they did. If 

there's an error the case must go back to the same grand 

jury or conceivably another grand jury. There's no 

jeopardy at that stage. There's no constitutional 

complications. And the Government is free to go back. 

Quite frankly, I'm very surprised the Government did not 

just go back and amend the indictment -- not amend it, 

but supersede the indictment and allege an overt act.

 The basic problem we have here is that there 

are so many acts committed by everybody which could be 

in furtherance of a crime. And the problem is going to 

trial that we don't know which act the Government was 

talking about. They told us in motion proceedings that 

the entry itself was the overt act. But the court of 

appeals ruled that that cannot be an overt act. So 

possibly Mr. Resendiz was entitled to judgment as a 

matter of law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can't you ask for a bill of 

particulars?

 MR. BAGGOT: I could have done that, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you would have 

had no problem.

 MR. BAGGOT: But bill of particulars are not 

favored motions. And what is to -- that would still be 

the Government speaking on behalf of the grand jury.

time you heard about that at trial?

 MR. BAGGOT: Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, I 

would submit that the prejudice to the defendant at the 

jury trial, the petit jury, was a slight prejudice. The 

real problem I feel was on appeal, that if the 

Government had alleged --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But were you, was there 

any element of surprise in this trial? Did you not know 

beforehand that the Government was going to present 

evidence of two false identifications?

 MR. BAGGOT: No, I knew that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there was no lack of 

notice; there was no surprise.

 MR. BAGGOT: In our court we have complete 

discovery. They copy the file for it and hand it to us. 

So we know everything they know. But what we did not 

know is what the Government would rely on as their overt 

act. They said it was the entry itself. The court of 

appeals ruled as a matter of law, rightly or wrongly, 

that that cannot be an overt act, because it simply --

places a judge as a reviewing authority over what a 

grand jury has done, regardless of the standard that's 

applied. And of course in -- it's a rare case when you 

even know what a grand jury did.

 MR. BAGGOT: There are, there certainly are 

scenarios under which they would have indicted him, yes, 

sir.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You think that the -- that 

the indictment had to specify which of the many things 

that he did, or the several things that he did when he 

approached the border constituted the overt act that the 

Ninth Circuit -- he walked up to the border and he did a 

number of things to try to get into the United States.

 MR. BAGGOT: Sure.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And you think that the 

indictment has to specify that walking up wasn't a 

substantial step, but presenting the documents might 

have been, whether it was walking up, presenting the 

documents, lying to the agent? You have to go into that 

level of detail in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment?

 MR. BAGGOT: Rule 7(c)(1) of the Rules of 

Procedure states that the indictment must state the 

essential facts. It need not be a memorandum of law 

just spelling out the elements of the crime in a general 

sense, but it must state the essential facts. In the 

Court's case of Hamling it says very clearly, the 

language of the statute must be accompanied by such

statement of facts and circumstances as will inform the 

accused of the specific offense coming under the general 

description which is charged.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a separate 

requirement. I don't know if it's constitutional or not 

constitutional, but I didn't think that requirement was 

at issue here.

 The requirement of stating the facts is not 

the requirement of setting out the elements of the law. 

At least that's my understanding. Now, you can correct 

me if I'm wrong.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, Your Honor, based upon 

your Hamling decision, I believe that's what the Court 

said, that there must be an allegation of facts under 

the decision in United States versus --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not denying that. 

I just didn't think that had anything to do with this 

case. I mean, I thought that the object of the 

indictment initially was to set forth what crime the 

person was accused of and inform him of that.

 You are saying, and then there is another 

requirement, which seems a little vague. It's been hard 

for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one 

you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule 

you have to have facts.

I don't know if those are the same. I 

thought they were two separate things.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, Your Honor, one of the 

functions of the grand jury indictment is to provide 

notice to the accused of the exact offense with which he 

is charged. Here, clearly we knew he was charged with 

1326, with attempting. What we did not know is which of 

the many, many acts that the Government suggested at 

various times, which of the many acts they proved at 

trial, would be the overt act. As I say, the appeal was 

unfair. It's not so much the trial was unfair. It was 

the appeal that was unfair.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Government have 

to pick one overt act and say that's it, when it 

introduces evidence of a whole string of them?

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, I don't see how we can 

really address it unless they tell us what they're 

talking about. And I would point out as of today the 

Government has still not identified a single act that is 

their overt act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can't you allege 

that the means by which it was done are unknown, but 

that it was by one or more of the following?

 MR. BAGGOT: Yes, you could. Many times in 

conspiracy indictments they will allege any of the

following overt acts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what I -- I 

tried to read some treatises on this, and the more I 

read, the more confused I got.

 I started out thinking, well, it's 

sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October 

14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of 

such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant 

walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by 

force or threat of force, take property belonging to 

someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be 

sufficient. And that you don't have to say, and in 

addition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did 

it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist. Can you 

give me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's 

relevant here?

 MR. BAGGOT: I don't think that's relevant 

because that's going into excessive detail. The 

requirement is that the essential fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: If it's excessive detail, 

the central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date 

at such and such a time he attempted to?

 MR. BAGGOT: Because he did many things in 

furtherance of the attempt according to the Government's 

proof, and we had a right to know, to have notice of the

accusation, what is the Government talking about?

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then why, if 

that's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said 

he attempted to and committed an overt act in -- that is 

a substantial step.  And then you're saying in addition, 

they have to list the particular facts.

 MR. BAGGOT: The essential facts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I couldn't find any case in 

this Court that said that. I mean, I found in Hamling a 

case that went the other way, a general statement. They 

said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have 

to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et 

cetera.

 MR. BAGGOT: But in the Russell case they 

said that you have to provide the essential facts, what 

was the nature of the committee hearing, what was the 

subject --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And 

then Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or 

isn't followed a lot.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you come back and you 

tell Justice Breyer, well, that's because we had no 

notice. But that's a different argument than the fact 

that there was no indictment. Notice can be cured by a 

bill of particulars, by the fact that you've had a

chance to contest the evidence at trial, that there was 

no error. That's a quite different rationale than 

saying that this is not an indictment.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, it's not an indictment 

because it did not allege the essential facts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that, it seems to me, 

is your argument, not lack of notice.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, it didn't provide a 

notice of what the essential facts was. Those are 

overlapping concepts, certainly, but we did not know 

what the facts --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question. 

Should the test for the missing element be different for 

the test for the wrong element? In other words, suppose 

the indictment alleged he walked up to the border and 

the evidence showed he rode a bicycle. There's a 

variance. Would that present a different legal issue 

than if they just leave the overt act entirely out?

 MR. BAGGOT: That presents a different legal 

issue because a variance means they alleged A, they 

proved B. Here they did not allege A. Nothing was 

alleged.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why should the test for 

judging the two be different?

 MR. BAGGOT: Between a variance --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Between a variance and an

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, when you have a variance 

the question is how much is the variance, how far off is 

the variance.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's clearly 

different. He rode a bicycle instead of walking.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, he's given notice that 

he's approaching the border with intent to commit this 

crime.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So here you've got notice 

he made an attempt, but you didn't tell us whether he 

rode the bicycle or he walked.

 MR. BAGGOT: But then the question becomes 

is it material, is the variance material, is it far off 

from what alleged? Here nothing was alleged.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: See, the problem I'm 

trying to think through is why should there be a 

different rule between those two situations. It seems 

to me they're equally likely to produce prejudice or 

lack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter 

of the Constitution.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, the prime variance case 

is Stirone versus United States in the 1960s, where the 

Court very simply said that where nothing is alleged

this cannot be treated as a simple variance.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why isn't your answer 

to Justice Stevens that in the case in which there is no 

allegation of an element at all there isn't a sufficient 

indictment to charge him for anything, whereas in the 

case of the variance on your theory, as I understand it, 

there is an indictment and the question is simply 

whether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced?

 MR. BAGGOT: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So why isn't the answer is 

in one case there's an indictment, and in the other case 

there isn't?

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, the extent is -- it's a 

question that can't be answered in the abstract. It's a 

question of how material the variance was.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but why isn't your 

answer to him that in the case in which there is a 

variance you have an indictment; in the case that you're 

talking about there is none? And the reason I press you 

on that is that I thought the essence of your case was 

that there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury 

function has not been performed and he is entitled to 

the grand jury function before he goes to trial.

your position, then I would have thought your answer to 

Justice Stevens was what I suggested. If that's not 

your answer to Justice Stevens, then I'm not sure that I 

understand your case.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, Your Honor, our case is 

simply that where a material element is omitted the 

grand jury -- something went wrong in the grand jury 

proceeding, and the only remedy for that is to return 

it, the case, to the grand jury and let them have a 

second go --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the result of what 

went wrong? How do you characterize the grand jury 

product in the case in which, as you put it, something 

goes wrong?

 MR. BAGGOT: Constitutionally deficient and 

did not fulfill the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: An insufficient -- in other 

words, there is no indictment charging a crime? Is 

that --

MR. BAGGOT: That's correct, Your Honor, no 

crime, and the reason for that -- I'll go one step 

further -- is because there's no way of knowing whether 

the Government --

I mean, the statute makes it a crime to intentionally 

attempt to enter the United States having previously 

been deported and all that. It doesn't say anything 

about presenting false identification. So why are those 

essential facts when they're not part of what the 

statute prohibits?

 MR. BAGGOT: Because that is -- there must 

be facts to show what the overt act was. Just providing 

a legal memorandum of what the elements of the offense 

are doesn't do any good. What the Constitution 

contemplates is that the essential facts be laid out.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose this indictment 

charged not an attempt to enter, but unlawful entry. 

Then the indictment would be sufficient, right? There 

wouldn't be any problem with it?

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, if it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It charged, not an 

attempt, but an unlawful entry. Anything missing from 

the indictment?

 MR. BAGGOT: No, because that's a general 

intent crime. There's no specific intent and no 

requirement that he perform any overt act.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the defendant could be 

convicted of an attempt under such an indictment, could 

he not?

MR. BAGGOT: Under such an indictment, under 

this case he could not, because he was under the 

constant surveillance of the INS at the time and in law 

that is not a legal indictment, not a legal reentry, an 

illegal reentry. It's one of those quirks in the law, 

and that's why they charged the attempt, to avoid these 

questions of whether he was under the constant control 

and surveillance of the immigration authorities, which 

he was. He never got by secondary. So that's why the 

charge was attempt as opposed to unlawful entry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But in that situation, you 

wouldn't know what the substantial step was, would you?

 MR. BAGGOT: No, and --

JUSTICE ALITO: The indictment wouldn't tell 

you what the substantial step was.

 MR. BAGGOT: And there wouldn't be any need 

either because it's not a specific intent crime and 

there's no requirement --

JUSTICE ALITO: If the defendant was 

convicted of the lesser included offense of attempt 

under an indictment charging the completed offense?

 MR. BAGGOT: Attempt is not a lesser 

included. The Congress has intended to make attempt on 

the same level as the substantive offense. That is the 

way the case law has been coming out. So whether he

enters, whether he attempts, or whether he's found in 

the United States are all on an equal par. It's not a 

lesser included.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand 

that. You're saying it's a separate offense, but a 

lesser included offense is a separate offense. It just 

happens to be embraced within some other offense.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, it has the same guideline 

punishment. It has the same treatment as the unlawful 

entry. And they're treated -- we have case law in our 

circuit that says, I think it is Corrales Beltran, that 

says the attempt is a substantive offense, even though 

it sounds contradictory.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean, if 

you're tried for illegal entry and the Government 

doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under 

supervision when you get in, the jury could not convict 

of attempt?

 MR. BAGGOT: If he was charged that way, 

they probably could, yes. There could be a two-count 

indictment or there could be alternatives. But that 

wasn't this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be okay, 

just charge with attempt without setting forth the overt 

acts for the attempt?

at such and such a time, he assaulted the postman, 

right? You also have to say what, that he waved his 

fist or that he had a knife? You have to say that in 

the indictment?

 MR. BAGGOT: No, I don't think so.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. All right. So I 

thought normally essential facts means simply the 

facts -- you can state the essential facts by writing 

the statute and normally that tells you. Now, is that 

true? One case that seems to go the other way is 

Russell.

 MR. BAGGOT: Normally, yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Normally, yes.

 MR. BAGGOT: That's correct. However, in 

this case there is a peculiar meaning to the word 

"attempt" that when Congress used the word "attempt" 

they meant to bring with that word its requirements 

under the common law.

word in the statute? "Attempt," people know what that

means.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, they do and they don't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And they also know what 

"assault" means. And if you tried, you could spell out 

"assault." They know what "robbery" means, but you 

could spell it out.

 So why does the Ninth Circuit think this one 

you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't 

have to?

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, that's why they had an en 

banc determination, because the judges were in disarray 

over that question. But at the time of this trial of 

the en banc decision in the Ninth Circuit, 

Gracidas-Ulibarry, had established concretely that the 

intent of the legislature was to incorporate the common 

law meaning of the word "attempt."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Baggot, could I come 

back to your answer to my earlier question. You said 

you could only be convicted of the lesser included 

offense if the lesser included offense is set forth 

explicitly in the indictment. Are you sure of that?

 MR. BAGGOT: No, sir.

law?

quite different. The intent of the legislature was that 

the attempt would itself be a substantive offense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As I said in my previous 

question, every lesser included offense is itself a 

substantive offense. That doesn't distinguish attempt 

from anything else. And my understanding is if you're 

charged with a greater offense, the lesser can be a 

subject of conviction even though it's not explicitly 

set forth in the indictment.

 MR. BAGGOT: Yes, that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if that is the case 

here, then it seems to me he could have been convicted 

of attempt without ever having had set forth in the 

indictment the overt act that you demand.

 MR. BAGGOT: Well, that's a good point. But 

under our -- all I can tell you, Justice Scalia, is that 

under our case law the attempt is considered a 

substantive offense. That's been the law --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But substantive offense 

is one thing. Lesser included, I think you said earlier 

it couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to 

the same punishment. So it is not lesser?

 MR. BAGGOT: Under this statute, under 1326, 

that's the ruling of our circuit.

what you will have is judges reviewing the decision of

elements, essential elements of offenses. That is 

challenging the independence of the grand jury, which is 

part of the structure set up by the Constitution, that

describe it as lesser included, but Rule 31 of the 

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does allow a trial 

judge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury 

when attempt is a violation of the substantive law.

 I should say that the Government's position 

is that there does not need to be a separate charge of 

attempt in the indictment in order to permit Rule 31 to 

operate, but there is a circuit split over whether 

lesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury 

unless they are included in the indictment.

 So we're not operating under a uniform rule 

that would always allow us to do that, and I'm not sure 

which way the Ninth Circuit goes on that, although I 

could hazard a guess.

 (Laughter.)

 The problem that we have here is that we are 

living under a rule of law in the Ninth Circuit and in 

at least one other circuit that forces the Government to 

pay a tremendous penalty when a mistake is made in an 

indictment, and it does happen. Justice Souter, I can 

assure you that judges dismiss plenty of indictments for 

failure to dismiss -- state elements, but they don't get 

them all.

tremendous cost that the Government pays by its choice 

to go to trial, as opposed to going back to the grand 

jury and making sure that it has an adequate indictment?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Government is often 

quite confident that it's correct. And I think if you 

put yourself in the position of the prosecutors in this 

case, you can see why that's true. But there are myriad 

rules and sub-rules of substantive law that this Court 

will never review, that require the Government to 

conform with various pleading obligations. They're all 

below the radar screen. But when you have a rule of 

automatic reversal like this, they jump up to 

prominence. And the reason that they do is because the 

entire criminal justice system, victims, witnesses, the 

judge, the prosecutors, the defense bar, jurors, 

everybody is being asked to go through a trial that was 

conducted on an error-free basis by hypothesis, simply 

because there was a mistake at the charging phase. And 

the petit jury's verdict we submit makes it clear that 

that mistake does not entitle the judicial system to say 

let's throw it all out and start again simply as a 

prophylactic mechanism.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you concede there was 

an error, is there anything to prevent us from saying we

that there was nothing wrong with the indictment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But can we do that in the 

face of your concession without having reargument?

 MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think this Court can do 

anything it chooses, regardless of the Government's 

concession.

 (Laughter.)

 But we're not conceding that the Ninth 

Circuit was correct. We simply didn't challenge it 

because the important question for us is the rule of law 

on harmless error. This pleading rule is something that 

we can comply with. It may be wrong, but it's 

something, like many wrong rules of law, we live with.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Dreeben. The case is submitted.

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you.

 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
