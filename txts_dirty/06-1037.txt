 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 06-1037, Kentucky Retirement Systems v. 

EEOC.

 Mr. Klausner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. KLAUSNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KLAUSNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Retirement eligibility in Kentucky is based 

on 20 years of service or age 55. Age is not the only 

determinant. And "age" is not a bad word. As Justice 

White said in McMann v. United Airlines, all retirement 

plans necessarily make distinctions based on age.

 Here it is age or service. And the EEOC's 

focus on age alone fails to appreciate that Kentucky is 

an integrated, consolidated retirement plan with the 

goal of providing benefits to all qualified workers. To 

say, as the EEOC does, that all younger workers will 

always fare better than all older workers is factually 

wrong, and it fails to appreciate the myriad factors 

that go into determining pension amounts.

 It's not age alone that determines the 

result. Age is a factor. It's not the factor. The

plan is not facially discriminatory, it's not arbitrary, 

and it doesn't violate --

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess the part that they 

are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I 

appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it 

correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if 

you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10. Is that right?

 MR. KLAUSNER: No, Mr. Chief Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: A worker who has been 

there, he's qualified, he has only worked for 10 years 

and now he's 55 years old. There is a chart in the SG's 

brief, and as I read that chart, he got amount "X". He 

started at 45, he ended up at 55, he gets "X". If he 

started at 35 and worked for 20 years, he would get much 

more than "X".

 MR. KLAUSNER: If the EEOC's chart were --

correct, that would be true, Your Honor, limited only to 

the amount of imputed service. The person who began 

younger in the example which Your Honor used would get 

more imputed service.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You would get "Y", because 

he worked for 20 years rather than 10; is that right? 

I'm not talking about a disabled person. I'm talking 

about anybody.

 MR. KLAUSNER: No, Your Honor. That's only

in the case of disability. In a normal requirement 

setting, one works a number of years and you get two 

and-a-half percent of your salary for each year that you 

worked.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So if a person works for 20 

years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is 

that right?

 MR. KLAUSNER: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now he is disabled. And 

when he's disabled, if he's disabled after working only 

10 and he is 45 years old, they pretend he had worked 

the full 20?

 MR. KLAUSNER: They impute -- yes, Your 

Honor. They impute the additional service to you.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now I understand it.

 Now, this individual says, I was working 

there after the age of 55, I only worked for 14 years, 

now I become disabled. If I become disabled before I 

was 55, let's say I had six years to go, they would give 

me six years extra. But because I was disabled after 

I'm 55, I get nothing extra. Nothing is imputed. Is 

that right?

 MR. KLAUSNER: It's only partially right, 

Mr. Justice. Justice Breyer, the reason that you get 

additional before age 55 is the same as the reason why

you get extra before you reach 20 years.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you for the 

reasons. I want to know if I'm factually right.

 MR. KLAUSNER: Your only partially --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where am I factually wrong?

 MR. KLAUSNER: The difference is that the 

imputed service comes before 55, because you're not 

eligible for after 55 or after 20 years you are eligible 

for benefits --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're giving me reasons. 

I'll ask you in a second for the reasons. I want to 

know if what I said is factually true?

 MR. KLAUSNER: If you were disabled before 

normal retirement, you receive imputed service.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And not after?

 MR. KLAUSNER: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now I'll say that I 

think is the discrimination of which he is complaining. 

And now what he would like to know is what possible 

reason is there for that difference? Now I'd like to 

hear what the reason is that justifies that difference.

 You give him six extra years when he retired 

after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and 

you don't give him even one extra year when everything 

else was the same but he retired after he was 55.

Now, explain to me what the reason is for 

that.

 MR. KLAUSNER: The reason for that, Justice 

Breyer, is as follows: The person who's 49 and gets 

disabled, assuming he does not have -- he or she doesn't 

have 20 years of service, can't retire. The person who 

is 55 in your example can leave tomorrow.

 Additionally, the person who begins work 

older starts out closer to retirement. We are not 

talking about two different groups of people. The plan 

favors the older worker by saying on the day you begin 

work, you're always closer to retiring than a younger 

person.

 The purpose of the imputed service is to try 

to replicate as closely as possible within some 

financial limits set by the -- by the General Assembly 

of Kentucky what you would have received had you made --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. He says now, what he 

says to that, I take it, is fine. He is 49 years old. 

He has six years to go to qualify for retirement, so let 

him retire. If you let him retire, and you gave him 14 

years of credit, you would be treating him just like 

you're treating me.

 But in addition to letting him retire, you 

give him six extra years of credit, which at two

and-a-half percent per year. Good, I'm glad you do 

that. Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half 

percent as well. Treat us alike.

 What's your response?

 MR. KLAUSNER: My response, Justice, is 

this. They start out un-alike. As I mentioned before, 

the person who was in 55 in your example, A, is already 

eligible for benefit. He doesn't have to wait to be 

disabled. He may leave tomorrow.

 The person who starts younger, particularly 

in a public safety retirement plan, spends more time in 

the line of fire than the person who starts older. The 

person who starts older takes advantage of the fact that 

in this retirement plan you can retire with as little as 

five years of service. Actually a person who is 55 is 

eligible for a benefit after only a month. In fact, 

Kentucky may be the only plan in the country that does 

that.

 But where they don't start out alike and 

where the EEOC's chart is based on fallacy is that the 

person who began older in work in your example was 

always closer to retirement, they needed less years.

 The purpose of the plan for disability 

purposes, which is not a separate plan, it's simply a 

means of getting one to normal retirement who is not

otherwise eligible.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This has been very 

helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question 

about the fairness of your opening statement. You began 

by saying something to the effect that this does not 

discriminate on the basis of age. It does. Age is the 

explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer 

Justice Breyer's question. And the Act does not 

prohibit the use of age in all circumstances to which it 

applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the 

use of age in some of the circumstances. And one of 

those circumstances is the hypothetical of the 

55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's 

statement and example.

 So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for 

you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis 

of age. Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing 

that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does 

make an explicit determination based on age as to some 

people.

 MR. KLAUSNER: Respectfully, Justice 

Kennedy, I think that's not entirely correct, for this 

reason. The plan makes the determination of eligible to 

retire on 20 years or age 55 with five years. In other 

words, it makes the determination not based on age but

on pension status, that is, eligibility to receive an 

unreduced normal retirement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying you're one 

step removed. You're making your determination on the 

basis of eligibility for retirement, which in turn is 

based on age. And you're saying that that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's sometimes based on 

age.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Huh?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's sometimes based on 

age, sometimes years of service.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And always based on 

age plus service.

 MR. KLAUSNER: Right. Yes, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, as I 

understand it, to Justice Breyer's question was, could 

be boiled down to this: The person whose disability 

benefit or total benefit following disability is 

calculated on the basis of age 55, is less likely to 

have worked or is likely to have worked less long than 

the person whose benefit is imputed and calculated on 

the basis of 20 years. And because the odds are that 

we'll say the person in the 55-year-old category has

worked less and endured less risk, it is, therefore, 

fair to impute less time on average to such a person, 

and therefore, give a lower benefit.

 You're saying there is a tradeoff. And the 

tradeoff is because the 55-year-old retiree may get a 

benefit after very little work and very little risk, it 

is therefore fair and not a discrimination that on the 

average the windfall is less for that person by the 

imputation than the windfall to the person who retires 

on the basis of age 20.

 Is that a fair statement of your argument?

 MR. KLAUSNER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. KLAUSNER: As I noted before, it's 

about retirement eligibility, not about age.

 In Hazen Paper you dealt with the question 

of an individual who was fired because they were about 

to meet the 10-year vesting requirement in a private 

sector plan. The person was also over the age of 40. 

The Court found that it wasn't an age discrimination 

case because it said that age was merely correlated with 

what the Court called pension status. I think pension 

status and retirement eligibility, which can occur at 20 

years or it can occur at age 55 with some service, is 

exactly the same. In --

JUSTICE ALITO: That would be a good 

argument if the sole basis for retirement under your 

system was years of service, but it's not just years of 

service, isn't that right?

 MR. KLAUSNER: That's correct, Justice. One 

needs some service, but one may retire at 55 or one may 

retire at 20 years.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You can't take your -- you 

couldn't take your statute and erase all the references 

to age and have the statute work, could you?

 MR. KLAUSNER: No. And I don't -- I don't 

think that pension statutes are required to eliminate 

any use of age at all.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Because the ADA expressly 

allows them to do that; isn't that right?

 MR. KLAUSNER: The ADA is designed to 

eliminate arbitrary age discrimination. That is where 

the design of the plan is motivated by a policy of the 

employer to discriminate, to provide less solely because 

of the individual's age.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- you're sticking 

in a word, "arbitrary," that appears nowhere in the body 

of the statute. You picked it up from the preamble, and 

that's -- and you're interpreting the statute with that. 

And it isn't customary for this Court to take words that

don't appear in the text of the statute and read them 

in, based on some statement of purpose or preamble.

 MR. KLAUSNER: Justice Ginsburg, I'm aware 

that the preamble alone doesn't direct, and I understand 

that the operative language is in 623(a). But I think 

that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd be in better shape if 

it was in legislative history and not in the preamble. 

We probably would take it into account.

 MR. KLAUSNER: I think, Justice, the 

legislative history is important for this reason. When 

Title VII was first written age was included and then it 

was taken out, and there was a reason why it was taken 

out: Because there is never a reason to discriminate on 

the basis of race, there is never a reason to 

discriminate on the basis of national origin or 

religion; but in government retirement plans, which are 

paid for life and in which the calculation is determined 

in part on age, on how long someone will live and how 

long they've worked and that interrelationship, I think 

Congress recognized age is qualitatively different.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the Congress 

recognized that what they were protecting was not age as 

such, but old age, where in the other case they say it's 

the racial criterion and whether it's -- or the sex

criterion, whether it's a man that's adversely affected 

or a woman it doesn't make any difference; Title VII 

applies to them both. But the Age Discrimination Act 

doesn't apply to younger workers. It doesn't say that 

you can't discriminate on the basis of age, so you can't 

prefer the older person over the younger person.

 MR. KLAUSNER: Justice Ginsburg, I 

understand this Court's holding in Cline was that the 

statute is intended to protect the relatively older as 

it relates to the relatively younger. But you also said 

in Cline that age is qualitatively different, because 

what gives age reason in terms of discrimination is when 

it's arbitrary. That is, when it is invidious, and 

that's the distinction between the Title VII cases that 

the Government relies on, and why I think Hazen Paper is 

important, because, as the Court said, unless you can 

show in a disparate treatment case that the policy is 

motivated by age, then I think that the -- the intent 

goes. And the -- one cannot draw from the face of the 

Kentucky statute -- and that's what this is; this was a 

challenge that said the statute discriminates on its 

face -- that the only inference that one can have is 

that the design of the plan is motivated to pay older 

people less.

of it that seems, that clearly does favor the younger 

retiree. And that's the -- what is it -- you're 

guaranteed, what was it, at least 25 percent of your 

final monthly salary. That's not under -- for a regular 

retiree; and also this 10 percent that you get added on 

for each child -- that's not part -- that's somebody who 

is disabled gets that, but not somebody who is already a 

retiree. Isn't that so?

 MR. KLAUSNER: That is correct, but Justice 

Ginsburg, that type of disability is not the disability 

which was at issue in this particular case. That is for 

a person who is disabled from any ability to work, 

period, in other words, the Social Security standard of 

disability. The disability at issue in this case was 

the inability to work as a public safety officer, in 

this case a police officer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I 

follow that answer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in 

understanding that your plan does not provide a 

disability benefit just as a disability benefit? The 

only time disability is relevant is when it determines 

whether or not a person will become eligible for the 

regular retirement benefit?

 MR. KLAUSNER: That's correct. This isn't,

for example, a stand-alone disability insurance policy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that for the old person 

who has already reached retirement age the fact that he 

doesn't get a disability benefit is common to everybody 

subject to the plan.

 MR. KLAUSNER: It is common subject to 

everyone in the plan without --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't that the answer to 

Justice Breyer's question?

 MR. KLAUSNER: And I -- you certainly said 

it better than I did, Justice Stevens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is there any 

reason -- I think what you're saying is we should view 

this as a retirement plan and there are a number of ways 

you can be eligible for retirement: Age plus years of 

service, but another way you can be eligible is 

disability.

 MR. KLAUSNER: Disability fills in -- it 

covers a gap. Disability is designed to cover you in 

most instances from the time you get five years of 

service -- and by the way, you're uncovered in this plan 

for disability for the first five years of employment 

except for a very limited, specific number of instances 

in which only total disability from all work applies.

EEOC talks about as having been discriminated against, 

if you were a younger worker for the first five years of 

employment you would have been not covered. A 55 -- for 

any benefit at all. A person who starts at 21 and gets 

disabled from work as a police officer or firefighter 

for the first five years of employment has no protection 

at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's take the one 

who gets over the five-year initial period. The 

disability pay when you no longer can be in the 

hazardous occupation, it will begin immediately, right? 

You don't wait until you get -- you're 55 to get it.

 MR. KLAUSNER: No, ma'am. That's the 

purpose of the imputed services. And it's 

essentially -- we say if during this gap of time before 

normal retirement, this risk that's covered, that if 

this disabling event occurs, we advance you to normal 

retirement immediately and try to replicate as closely 

as possible the benefit that one would have achieved had 

you worked to the closest --

right?

that you just said. What you do when the person is 

disabled and he is not yet 55 -- he hasn't qualified 

yet -- is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him 

you give him credit for years he hasn't worked. Now, 

the older person who is still working and is also 

disabled says: Fine, you let me retire, but you don't 

give me any extra years.

 Now that's the complaint, I think. So that 

if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to 

retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he 

is credited with 14 years; while the person who started 

at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years. 

He is given the 10 extra years. So the first person, 

older person, says: You gave him some extra years; you 

didn't have to give him those extra years in order to 

qualify him to retire. You could have just said you can 

retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me 

no extra years. Why not?

 MR. KLAUSNER: The answer to your question, 

Justice Breyer, is the person who has either 20 years or 

is 55 on the day they become disabled is already 

eligible to retire. The plan is a single plan that 

provides a benefit. If you start older, you have to 

work less to get there. By the same token, by starting 

closer to retirement you need less added to your balance

to bring you to normal retirement. In the example --

JUSTICE BREYER: You don't need anything to 

bring you to normal retirement. You could rewrite the 

plan and say when a person becomes disabled you get 

retirement, right at that moment. You could say that. 

And what the plaintiff is saying is, why don't you say 

that? Though it's a bit mean. But I think what he 

would probably like is you would extend the extra years 

to him.

 MR. KLAUSNER: There's reasons why that 

isn't done. Number one, to follow your example, Justice 

Breyer, for current employees, people hired before 2004, 

of which there were several hundred thousand, you'd have 

to lower the benefit to follow your example. The 

Kentucky Constitution forbids lowering the benefits. 

Actually, the Commonwealth, in response to the liability 

in this case, did change the disability benefit. For 

people hired after 2004, they slashed its economic value 

substantially, and now everybody just gets a certain 

amount of disability. It doesn't, however, accomplish 

the Commonwealth's goal of attracting and retaining 

employees to do hazardous duty jobs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the effect of 

this litigation is that policemen or firefighters who 

are injured and become disabled now get lower benefits

for disability?

 MR. KLAUSNER: Much lower. It's a 

substantial reduction. They just get a small piece of 

change.

 It's interesting, you know, in the Federal 

Civil Service Retirement System, the police officers, 

for example, who work in this Court, if they become 

disabled, they have imputed service to an age. It's a 

very similar system. In fact, all employees in both 

FERS, the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and the 

Civil Service Employees' Retirement System, both 

participate in a program where age is imputed to normal 

retirement. It's a common practice, as the Court can 

see from the amicus briefs. It's a common practice 

throughout the United States. I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: See, that's why I think the 

result in this case is just terrible. I think it takes 

disabled people and cuts their benefits with no benefit. 

I cannot believe for two minutes that Congress would 

have intended that result. But the reason I asked you 

the question was I want you to tell me how to get to 

that result under this statute.

 MR. KLAUSNER: You may get to this result in 

this way: If you determine that age is not the driver, 

that is, that because you have a plan that has normal

retirement based on service alone, a 38-year-old 

employee who gets disabled with 18 years of service gets 

two years of imputed service. The 45-year-old, in your 

example, who started at 35 would get 10 years.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I can't make that 

assumption or adopt that premise. Is there another 

basis on which to reach the result? I think this does 

explicitly discriminate based on age as to some people, 

and you're telling me you don't want me to do that. But 

Suppose I don't agree with you. Is there some other way 

to reach the result?

 MR. KLAUSNER: I think Your Honor you can 

reach the result in this way. The statute was 

challenged as being facially discriminatory, and I think 

under this Court's precedents for facial discrimination, 

one would have to say that the only reasonable inference 

in the statute, by its mere use of age, is that you say 

that it starts out presumptively discriminatory. What 

the Government has really argued here is an as-applied 

circumstance. They said the effect of the statute in 

certain cases, and in those circumstances the statute 

would stand on its face and if there is a circumstance 

in which someone effectively is discriminated, then you 

look to see are there reasonable factors other than age 

that effect -- that take effect in this instance?

Secondly, I think the Court can determine --

and I think this is the question that is the next step 

after Hazen, where you said that age correlated with 

pension status, in that case being vested for 10 years. 

The question is, if a plan has eligibility to retire as 

its motivation, that is, it is service regardless of age 

or age plus service, is it really motivated by age? And 

I think the answer to that question, Justice Kennedy, 

clearly is no.

 The one thing I would add is if you look at 

the statute in Betts, the Ohio case, which is the last 

time an age case on a public plan got to this Court, in 

the Ohio plan you couldn't get a disability because you 

were 60, but you could also retire in that plan just 

like Kentucky on years of service alone, but a 

years-of-service retiree in Ohio could get a disability.

 That's not true in Kentucky. Somebody who 

starts as a firefighter at 18 no longer has disability 

protection at 38 years old. A person who starts as a 

police officer at 45 retains disability coverage until 

they're 55. I think -- I think the language of the 

statute alone enables you to get there.

 And I think to get back to Justice 

Ginsburg's question -- and I don't believe I fully 

answered on this issue of the role of the word

"arbitrary" in the statute -- I think that that gives 

that word meaning, not just because it's in the 

preamble, but because it's in the legislative history, 

and the evil that Congress was trying to get to is what 

is it that we're trying to prevent? We're trying to 

create job opportunities for older workers, and what 

Congress said after Betts is you want to make sure 

benefit plans are covered. And I think Kentucky has 

accomplished both. It doesn't use a retirement age, as 

many employers do. Again, the Federal Government forces 

police officers and firefighters out of their jobs. 

Firefighters at 55, police officers at 57. Kentucky 

doesn't. The program doesn't discriminate on the basis 

of age.

 If there's no question, I'd like to reserve 

the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Stewart.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 In calculating the retirement benefits owed 

to disabled workers, Kentucky uses age as an explicit 

decisionmaking factor in a way that disadvantages older

employees. Although Kentucky may be able to establish 

on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask you this sort of 

basic question: Does it use age any differently than it 

uses years of service?

 MR. STEWART: It does in the sense that, 

with respect to disabled employees, two employees who 

have the same total years of actual service but who are 

of different ages may receive dramatically different 

benefits.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's because of the 

period necessary to qualify for retirement?

 MR. STEWART: It's -- let me direct your 

attention to the relevant provision of the Kentucky 

statute, and it's at page 7a and 8a of the blue brief. 

This is with respect to -- it's true that, for a normal 

retirement, an individual either has to be age 55 with 5 

years of service or have 20 years of service at whatever 

age. But if you look at the requirements for disability 

retirement in particular, the very bottom of the page, 

it says: "Any person may qualify to retire on 

disability subject to the following. The person shall 

have 60 months of service, 12 of which shall be current 

service credited under provisions of Kentucky law."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt you.

Is there -- is it your position there is a disability 

benefit that is different from the retirement benefit?

 MR. STEWART: They -- they are different in 

the sense that they are calculated differently. That 

is, if all Kentucky had done was say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought that all that 

disability did was determine -- help get a man who is 

disabled eligible for the retirement benefit.

 MR. STEWART: The program --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the only function 

it provides.

 MR. STEWART: I think that's incorrect. 

There are two distinct functions of -- there are two 

distinct differences between disability retirement and 

normal retirement: The first is that the eligibility 

criteria are different. In order to qualify for normal 

retirement, you have to be either 55 years old with 5 

years of service or have 20 years of service. For 

disability retirement, you become eligible if you are of 

any age and are forced to retire due to disability and 

have at least five years of service.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why does that matter? 

I mean, the exception in the statute is for -- for 

retirement, taking age into account for retirement, is 

narrowly crafted. It says that they can make any

decision about -- they can require the attainment of a 

minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or 

early retirement.

 Now, we have not read that to exclude adding 

an additional element to age, namely age plus years of 

service. We don't say that that disables you from the 

-- from that exemption. Why can't you add a third 

factor? Age, years of service, and disability.

 MR. STEWART: You can't. The first thing I 

would say about that exception is it refers specifically 

to a minimum age, and what that was intended to make 

clear was that to the extent that Kentucky allows 

55-year-olds to retire with only 5 years of service, but 

requires a 45-year-old to have 20 years of service, that 

minimum age would not violate the statute. Now, as a 

result of this Court's decision in Cline, that provision 

in a sense is superfluous because the younger worker 

wouldn't have an ADEA claim anyway. But the reference 

to a minimum age is intended to address that situation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And --

JUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me that what 

Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part, 

provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who 

becomes disabled below the age of 55. So what they want 

to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you

would have received if you had not been hurt on the job 

and therefore unable to work and had been able to work 

to the normal retirement age.

 Now, if that's correct, is that an 

illegitimate objective? And if it's not an illegitimate 

objective, is there any way that they can do that 

consistent with your understanding of the ADEA? Because 

when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather 

hard to see how many years you would add on projecting 

how long that person would continue to work beyond the 

age of retirement eligibility.

 MR. STEWART: It is certainly not 

illegitimate for Kentucky to say: We want to be more 

generous to people who are forced to retire due to 

disability than to people who choose to retire 

voluntarily when they are physically capable of 

continuing to work.

 And so if Kentucky wants to say, in the case 

of an individual who is forced to retire due to 

disability, we will add additional years in computing 

benefits to estimate the number of years this person 

would have worked had he or she not become disabled, 

that's fine as well.

 What they can't do, at least what they can't 

do without establishing one of the affirmative defenses,

is use age as a proxy, as the basis for deciding how 

many years would this person have worked if he or she 

had not become disabled because --

JUSTICE ALITO: So if they want to do that 

and they have a case of a police officer who works 

beyond 55 -- the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of 

service and then becomes disabled -- you say they have 

to give that person 10 years of credit.

 MR. STEWART: If they are going to give the 

45-year-old with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, 

they have to give the 55-year-old 10 years of service --

with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, again, 

unless they can establish the cost-justification 

defense.

 And part of the argument they are making is 

it would be unduly expensive to guarantee the 

55-year-old an additional 10 years of service, because 

it's much more likely that the 55-year-old will become 

disabled than it is with the 45-year-old.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But he is saying one thing 

more. He is saying it's also highly unlikely that the 

55-year-old has worked as long subject to risk at the 

point at which the calculation is made than is the case 

with the person who retires on the basis of 20 years. 

And so that there is a tradeoff. And, therefore, you

constantly analyze this as the kind of garden variety of 

discrimination based on age which Congress was aiming 

for.

 MR. STEWART: Well, to go back to the 

question you were asking Mr. Klausner, I think if we 

were looking at the class of voluntary retirees, it 

would be an accurate generalization to say that those 

above 55 were likely to have fewer years of service than 

the younger people. Because the only way that a younger 

person could qualify for normal retirement would be to 

amass 20 years of service; whereas, the older person 

could do it with fewer years.

 But if you are looking at people who want to 

continue working but who are prevented from doing so by 

reason of disability, there is no reason to assume that 

the older people are going to have spent less time in 

the line of fire than the younger people. And, in any 

event, the comparison that we are making --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just say that again. Just 

say the last thing again. I didn't follow you.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I didn't get it 

either.

 MR. STEWART: If we're looking at the class 

of people who -- including over 55-year-old and under 

55-year-old -- who want to continue working but who have

been prevented from doing so by reason of disability, 

there is no reason to think that the older people within 

that class, as a group, will have fewer years in the 

line of fire than the younger people. And, in any event 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I -- I think -- you 

mean in the future?

 MR. STEWART: No. No. Under their belt. 

Under their belt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under their belt. I see.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They are exactly the same 

people. The only thing that distinguishes the one 

class, those who voluntarily do and those who are 

disabled, is happenstance; and the happenstance is 

disability in the line of service.

 MR. STEWART: It's not just happenstance, 

because if you're guessing the likely tenure of service 

of people who take voluntary normal retirement before 

age 55, in a sense you are skewing the class, because 

the only people who can do that under Kentucky law are 

people with at least 20 years of service.

 So the voluntary retirees, the younger 

people, as a group, are likely to be -- have longer 

tenure. But that generalization doesn't hold true with 

respect to people who are forced to retire due to

disability.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me your 

argument boils down to the claim that people who have 

already reached -- become eligible for retirement by 

either age or period of service, the State has a duty to 

give them a chance to recover a disability benefit if 

they give a disability benefit to younger workers.

 MR. STEWART: No. Our point is that they 

should use the same computation methodology for both 

categories of employees.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The computation is for a 

different purpose in that -- in -- for the younger 

workers the purpose is to make them eligible for 

retirement. For the older workers, they are already 

eligible for retirement.

 MR. STEWART: I think that's incorrect, and 

that was really the point I was making by quoting from 

the Kentucky law on page 7a and 8a. The Kentucky 

provision that I quoted was the provision that 

establishes eligibility for disability retirement. And 

it says, as the criterion for eligibility, beyond, of 

course, the fact of disability, the person shall have 60 

months of service.

 So an individual under Kentucky law who is 

forced to retire due to disability and has at least five

years of service is eligible for disability retirement. 

The imputation of additional years of service is not 

necessary --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The term "eligibility for 

retirement," as used in that part of the statute, is 

referring to actually the same thing as retirement 

achieved by getting their -- getting credit for 

post-disability years.

 MR. STEWART: Exactly. Well, the purpose of 

defining the category of eligible persons is to make 

sure that they do get a retirement benefit even though 

they wouldn't satisfy the normal age and service 

requirements for ordinary retirement. And we have no 

problem with that.

 Kentucky can say we want to define a 

separate category of individuals who don't satisfy 

normal age and service rules but who should, 

nevertheless, be given a retirement benefit because they 

have been forced to retire due to disability. That's 

fine.

 And if they use the same computation 

methodology, namely, some factor of actual years of 

service times final compensation times a multiplier, as 

they do for normal retirement, that would be fine. Our

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's fine for 

them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for 

them to use any element of age in making that 

computation?

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though, under 

the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive 

requirement in determining retirement?

 MR. STEWART: Well, again, there is a an 

explicit exemption in the ADEA for a minimum retirement 

age. And so it wouldn't have violated -- even apart 

from this Court's decision in Cline, it wouldn't have 

violated the ADEA to say an individual who is 55 with 

five years of service can get retirement, even though a 

younger --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is wrong with using 

that as a benchmark? If you can fire a person when he 

is 55, why can't you use it as a benchmark as to how 

much you're going to give a disability person on 

pension?

 MR. STEWART: Well, again, I think the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The lesser or greater --

this would be an instance where greater includes lesser 

for the reason that this lesser business has no

who are disabled at a time when they are younger and 

probably have fairly good expenses, and everybody gets 

this kind of insurance.

 And this man who is the Plaintiff here had 

it, too, while he was there. So it's true you are 

really using in a minimal sense age, but you are doing 

it in a statute that permits you to do it because it's a 

lesser version of that.

 MR. STEWART: There are a couple of things 

I'd say. The first is that the Act is quite specific in 

saying that a State may establish a minimum -- may 

establish a retirement age with respect to its State 

police and firefighters, but it doesn't say the ADEA is 

inapplicable to police and firefighters who are over age 

55.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say it's 

inapplicable. I wasn't saying it's inapplicable. What 

I am worried about -- and this is a perfect example of 

people using absolutely mechanical rules, and 

particularly when you talk about pension systems, which, 

of course, age is relevant to a pension system, and what 

they do is find comparisons; and, before you know it, 

you are in the kind of a -- of a hamburger situation 

where it's so chopped up that perfectly worthwhile 

things are forbidden. And this would seem to be a

number 1 exhibit.

 MR. STEWART: There are several different 

answers I would give. The first is if the greater 

included the lesser, it would be permissible for 

Kentucky to say: We will keep the over 55-year-old 

people on the work force, but we'll pay them less 

because of their age.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, because what you are 

looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is 

somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent 

stereotypical thinking from being used to put older 

people at a disadvantage. And there is no indication 

that this is so in this case.

 MR. STEWART: I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's the response?

 MR. STEWART: I think that's incorrect, that 

is, the two justifications that have been given for the 

disparate treatment of older workers are, first, younger 

workers as a group are likely to need more of a boost; 

and, second, the younger disabled person probably would 

have worked longer if he had not become disabled. And 

so this replicates the situation that would have 

prevailed.

 I think, whether or not you want to think of 

those as stigmatizing stereotypes, it's quite clear that

neither of those generalizations could typically be used 

as a basis for age-based disparities.

 For instance, nobody would claim that an 

employer could pay the older workers less because they 

are likely to be less in need of financial assistance. 

And with respect to the initial --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The reason for that is that 

we accept the criterion at the outset that your pay 

bears some relationship to what you do.

 We are now in a situation in which the 

benefit does not bear a relationship to what you are 

doing or going to do.

 MR. STEWART: Well, on the whole, the 

benefit bears a close -- the retirement benefit bears a 

close relationship to what you have done. That is, the 

benefit is calculated on the basis of actual years of 

service, and the purpose clearly is, in part, to reward 

the employee for service to the employer.

 But with respect to -- and that's the way 

it's done with respect to the older disabled worker. 

His benefits are computed based on what years of service 

he has actually contributed to the employer. With 

respect to the younger people, it's not based on that 

alone. Rather, the State imputes additional years --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And with respect to that,

Mr. Stewart, the problem that Justice Breyer brought up, 

you -- if you would look to your brief, page 30, 

footnote 13, the question is, so we have this -- if we 

take your interpretation of the statute, how can we deal 

with a person in her 30s who becomes disabled when she 

is making a low salary and has only, say, 10 years of 

service? She is going to get a very low disability. 

And you say that's one thing that's all right.

 On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky 

do? One is give the younger workers only their actual 

years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is 

happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot 

less than they used to get. And then you say, oh, but 

there's another way, and that is to impute additional 

years of service on an age-neutral basis. And you're 

not specific about what would the age-neutral basis be.

 MR. STEWART: I guess there could be a range 

of alternatives. One alternative, for instance, would 

be for every disabled worker of whatever age impute an 

additional five years of service as something of a rough 

estimate of the number that person might have worked if 

he or she had not become disabled.

 Another possibility would be to impute years 

of service up to 10 or 20. Again, there would be 

probably an infinite number of ways it could be done as

long as age were not used as, as the basis.

 The other thing I wanted to say about --

JUSTICE ALITO: But if do you that, aren't 

you going to be -- you're going to be undercompensating 

the younger person who gets disabled and 

overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled 

who may not -- it may not be realistic to think that 

someone's going to continue to work as a police officer 

until 65. I don't know.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the other thing I would 

say about that justification, which rests on I think the 

valid statistical correlation between how old you are at 

the time that you're disabled and how much longer you 

would have worked. Again, whether or not -- I think you 

wouldn't think of that as an invidious stereotype. But 

again, it's not a generalization that could typically be 

used as a basis for age-specific decisions.

 For example, the Wirtz report makes clear 

that the paradigmatic pre-ADA practice that Congress 

wanted to get rid of was a limit of age 50 or age 45 and 

an employer saying: We're not going to hire anybody who 

is over that age. And certainly the employer could say 

justifiably as a group people above that age are likely 

to have fewer work years ahead of them than people below 

that age. And if that generalization could provide a

basis for an explicit age-based distinction, the Act 

would really be eviscerated.

 The other thing I wanted to respond to is 

the suggestion that, while we might be able to tease 

this out of the literal language of the statute, this is 

certainly an unintended consequence. It is not 

something that Congress would have wanted. I think, to 

the contrary, this is not identical but very similar to 

the type of disparity that was present in Betts. That 

is, in Betts the individual was over the age of normal 

retirement but had elected to keep working. She became 

disabled and was prevented from continuing to work. She 

was eligible for normal retirement benefits. She wanted 

to collect disability retirement benefits, because 

again, the reason for her retirement was disability. 

She was told that she couldn't do it. And the State's 

computation methodology for calculating disability 

retirement benefits was significantly more generous than 

the one that it offered for --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about this idea, which 

is -- would this wreck the statute? You say we're 

talking about age, which is not an immutable 

characteristic. Everybody goes through it. Everybody 

is younger, everybody is older. And therefore we take 

the word "discriminate" and the word "discriminate" in

this context, when considered in terms of pension 

requirements, which inevitably are age mixed to a 

considerable degree, means that if there are plausible 

justifications and no significant reason for thinking 

that it reflects stereotypical thinking, that it does 

not fall within the scope of the word "discriminate."

 MR. STEWART: I think, first, that would be 

contrary to the way that the word "discriminate" has 

been construed in Title VII.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I started out by saying, 

that's why I said that this is not an immutable 

characteristic, and it is -- that's why I put all the 

qualifications in there.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the court in Thurston 

has said the language of the ADEA should be construed 

similarly to that of Title VII because the basic 

anti-discrimination prohibition was drawn in haec verba 

from Title VII in the legislative history to the older 

workers's Benefit Protection Act when Congress amended 

the statute to cover fringe benefits, which the Court in 

Betts had held were not covered. Congress did that by 

enacting a new 29 U.S.C. 630(l) to say the term -- that 

the phrase "terms and conditions of employment" includes 

fringe benefits.

 And the legislative history explains that

Congress could have achieved the same result by adding a 

reference to fringe benefits in the basic 

anti-discrimination provision contained in 29 U.S.C. 

623(a), but the Congress chose not to do that because it 

wanted to maintain the similarity in wording between the 

ADEA's anti-discrimination provision and that of Title 

VII in order to reinforce the inference that the two 

were to be construed in pari materia.

 The other thing I would say with respect to 

your reference to age distinctions that are not based on 

stereotypes is again to return to what I was discussing 

earlier. The two justifications that have been offered 

are first, younger people are likely to have fewer 

financial resources, so they need more of a boost; the 

second is the younger worker probably would have worked 

longer if he hadn't become disabled and therefore this 

is replicating the situation that would have prevailed 

absent the disability.

 And again, my point is, whether or not you 

think of those as invidious stereotypes, they are 

plainly not generalizations that could typically be used 

to justify --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

right on that point. Supposing you have two different 

people retire, one -- that become disabled, rather --

one because he's five years short of the age eligibility 

and the other because he's five years short of years of 

service, so it would be a younger person, and both would 

have become eligible for retirement in five years after 

their disability. Are they treated the same way under 

the plan? And if they are, where is the discrimination?

 MR. STEWART: Well, the discrimination is if 

you imagine --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, first of all, tell 

me whether they're treated the same way under the plan.

 MR. STEWART: Well, it depends on other 

variables. For instance, if you have a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What other variables?

 MR. STEWART: As to the person who is five 

years away from qualifying by reason of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Years of service.

 MR. STEWART: -- years of service, if that 

person is younger than 50, then they'll be treated the 

same, because each of them will have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's a hypothesis.

 MR. STEWART: But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So then how is that 

discrimination on the basis of age?

 MR. STEWART: But it is a discrimination on 

the basis --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not even 

discrimination as far as I see it.

 MR. STEWART: Well, it wouldn't -- there 

wouldn't be any claim of disparate treatment with 

respect to those two individuals. But if you have an 

individual who is 55 years old with 15 years of service 

and 50 years old with 15 years of service, they are both 

equally close to the 20-year threshold for qualifying 

for normal retirement on the basis of years of service. 

Yet the 50-year-old gets 5 imputed years added and gets 

a significantly larger benefit than the 55-year-old.

 Their justification is, well, the 

55-year-old is already eligible for normal retirement 

and therefore, it's fair to treat him differently. And 

the point I was making with reference to the Kentucky 

code is the 50-year-old who is forced to retire due to 

disability is also eligible for retirement. It's called 

disability retirement.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that your 

claim boils down to an argument that the statute 

requires someone who is already qualified for retirement 

to get a disability benefit that the younger person 

would. It seems to me that's the basic difference.

 MR. STEWART: No, I don't think that's 

correct. If all the State did was to say disability

retirement benefits will be available to people who have 

at least five years of service and are forced to retire 

due to disability and we are excluding people who are 

above 55, in and of itself that's fine. If the only 

purpose of excluding the older workers is to make clear 

that they can't get both benefits simultaneously, there 

is no problem with that.

 Our problem is that, having defined the 

class of persons eligible for disability benefits to 

include only those who are under 55 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I see you talking about 

two benefits.

 MR. STEWART: -- they did use a more 

generous computation methodology.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There not two benefits. 

It's only one.

 MR. STEWART: It's only one benefit. And 

really, that's part of our point. It's only one 

benefit, so why would they say that people who are older 

will have their benefits computed using a different 

formula than people who are younger?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You prevent the 

State from taking into account the fact that younger 

disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that 

older disabled workers have. And it results -- if we

adopt your system where you can look only at years of 

service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to 

prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to 

older workers who become disabled.

 For example, if you have two workers, one 

who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service, 

say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would 

say, well, you can take those years of service into 

account. The older worker who begins at age 30 and is 

disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well, 

you can only look at years of service. You can't impute 

to both of them retirement age. So the 30-year-old who 

becomes disabled has to get less, fewer benefits than 

the 18-year-old who becomes disabled.

 MR. STEWART: Well, first, we are not 

preventing Kentucky from imputing additional years. We 

are simply saying the method of determining how many 

years will be imputed, absent an affirmative defense, 

can't be dependent on the employee's age.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Would it be the same as --

I mean it seems to me now -- I'm thinking the problem is 

we are going into the package; we are starting opening 

up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally 

gets.

do to the disabled person. We'll treat him just as if 

he retired at 55. He is only 35; and, moreover, at 55 

when you retire in our police force, we give you a big 

party and a gold watch. Well, we don't do that if you 

retire later on. Same kind of claim.

 Why not? Over 65 years old, he retired. 

Hey, you didn't give him the gold watch. Why did you 

give the other person the gold watch? You said the 

reason is we treat them all like we treat them when you 

retire at 55.

 MR. STEWART: I'm not quite sure if I 

understand the question, but I don't think that there is 

any --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's fair, that you don't 

understand.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STEWART: I don't think there would be 

anything wrong with Kentucky saying we are going -- in 

fact, this is what we are asking for. If Kentucky wants 

to say a younger person who is forced to retire due to 

disability will be treated as though he were 55 years 

old, that's fine. If they give him disability benefits 

and they calculate the benefits using actual years of 

service as they do for the other -- for the older 

employees, that there is no ADEA problem with that.

Our problem is that they say we are treating 

him as though he had worked additional years until he 

was 55 when he hasn't, and when the older employee isn't 

given that same opportunity.

 And, again, it is true that Kentucky's 

system is particularly generous to older employees who 

want to retire voluntarily. They can retire with as 

little as five years of service, even though the younger 

worker would have to have more. But the people on 

whose behalf the EEOC is suing have not derived any of 

that benefit. These were people who did not retire 

voluntarily. They were people who were eligible for 

retirement benefits, but chose to remain in the work 

force. And, essentially, they are being told, in 

estimating how many more years you would have worked, we 

are going to have an irrebuttable presumption that the 

answer is zero, even though their very circumstances, 

the fact that they continued to work after they could 

have retired, belie that assumption.

 And just a final point I wanted to make 

about Betts, is that the system here is not identical, 

but very similar to the system that was at issue there, 

in the sense that an older worker who was forced to 

retire due to disability got a lower benefit than she 

would have received if she had been younger with the

same years of service and the same disability.

 It couldn't be clearer that Congress wanted 

to overturn that decision. That was the impetus for the 

enactment of the OWBPA.

 So I think there is really -- it's not 

correct to suggest that, even if we win, this is somehow 

an unintended consequence of what Congress did. This is 

the very situation that Congress wanted to cover while 

providing an affirmative defense to employers who can 

satisfy it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, before you 

finish, that little piece that seems to be favoring the 

younger worker that you guaranteed at least -- what was 

it, 25 percent of your final monthly salary, and you get 

10 percent for each child -- now that does seem to be 

something that's -- that's not available for a regular 

retiree.

 MR. STEWART: It's not available for a 

regular retiree, and it's not available for a person who 

is eligible for normal retirement but becomes disabled 

and is forced to retire for that reason.

 If the only problem were that Kentucky made 

those benefits available to people who were forced to 

retire due to disability, that wouldn't be an ADEA 

violation, so long as they made those benefits available

to the older worker who was also forced to retire.

 But I take your point that those aspects of 

the statute introduce a further element of age 

discrimination without even the justification that 

Kentucky has proffered for the imputed years.

 With respect to the children, in particular, 

that seems to be the only other area in the plan in 

which Kentucky is directly targeting the people who are 

in greatest financial need, at least by one measure 

having dependent children, and yet the older workers are 

left out of that entirely.

a normal retirement benefit.  Age isn't the driver. 

Eligibility for retirement is the motivation.

 And while my brother says that Congress 

wanted to overturn Betts, what they wanted to overturn 

in Betts was the language in this Court's decision that 

cast doubt on whether pension plans were generally 

covered by the language of the Age Discrimination in 

Employment Act. And the Older Workers Benefits 

Protection Act, if one looks at the legislative history, 

was focused far less on what happened in a public 

employee retirement system. The real issue that 

Congress focused on, if one looks at the House and 

Senate reports, is they said there is a problem in 

private industry in the Rust Belt that normal retirement 

eligibility is being used to force people not to get 

some other benefit in some other stand-alone plan. 

That's not the issue here.

 And the plan in Betts is no more like 

Kentucky's plan than the Thurston plan. In Thurston, 

the pilot case, no pilot over 60, no matter how 

skillful, had bumping rights to be a flight engineer. 

In Kentucky, one with 20 years of service, regardless of 

age, is in the same posture as someone who is 55 with a 

minimum service.

in the Kentucky statute on pages 7a and -- page 7a in 

the appendix. Look also at 2a, which defines normal 

retirement to be 55 with 5 years of service, or 20 years 

of service regardless of age. The methodology for 

determining disability in this case is exactly the same. 

It's based on your proximity to normal retirement, not 

based on your age.

 One example was given. If a person is 45 

years old with 4 years of service and became disabled, 

that person would get nothing because they haven't met 

the five-year service requirement. But a 55-year-old 

with 4 years of service has a normal retirement benefit.

 It's about limited Government resources not 

being duplicated, and perhaps that's the reason why the 

EEOC adopted its regulation on December 26th 

coordinating retiree health care. The rationale they 

gave was we looked at all the -- all the ways to do 

this, and we couldn't come up with a reason to do it any 

other way.

 In the Sixth Circuit Federal argument, Judge 

Boggs noted in his dissent -- Chief Judge Boggs noted he 

asked the EEOC for a reason on how to fix this, and they 

couldn't give him one.

 What this case is about is about being fair 

to workers without regard to age. All the people who
