 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in the 

case of Pasquantino against the United States.

 Ms. Brill.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURA W. BRILL

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MS. BRILL: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court: 

There are five primary reasons why this 

prosecution is outside the scope of anything Congress has 

authorized. First, the government's interpretation of the 

wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule. 

Second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by 

allowing the Government to incarcerate petitioners for 57 

months for conduct that has never given rise to civil 

liability in this country. Third, this prosecution 

contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity 

in matters of international tax enforcement. Fourth, the 

Government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this 

prosecution without disregarding another act of Congress, 

the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the 

name specifies, mandatory. And, fifth, under this Court's 

decisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute 

applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into

relinquishing something that it holds as money or 

property. A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax 

claim is neither money nor property.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, can you look at the 

interest of the Government as one of not allowing U.S. 

territory to be used to carry out a smuggling scheme? I 

mean, why does it have to be viewed as one of trying to 

enforce some other nation's tax laws?

 MS. BRILL: Justice O'Connor, the government's 

interest in prosecuting somebody does not define the scope 

of what the statute at issue proscribes.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's a wire fraud statute 

dealing with the use of communications capacity in this 

country to carry out a scheme designed to enable smuggling 

of goods.

 MS. BRILL: Well, if the -- if the statute was 

not written as it is -- the statute, as written, uses the 

words "defraud" and the word -- the word "property," and 

both of those terms are terms that this Court has defined 

very narrowly. In Nader, it defined a "fraud" as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Brill, I thought your brief 

said that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is 

directed precisely against smugglers, but it only applies 

to those countries that have similar protection for us.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, Justice --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And Canada does not.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, Justice Scalia, that's exactly 

correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The existence of that 

statute would seem to suggest -- and a statute which is 

limited to countries that will do the same for us -- would 

seem to suggest that we don't want to do this for Canada.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, that's exactly -- that's 

exactly right, Your Honor. There --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's also limited to 

vessels. It's smuggling by water, not smuggling by --

MS. BRILL: By automobile.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- vehicles, as was done here, 

so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on 

land.

 MS. BRILL: Right. Yes, Your Honor, that's 

correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there something better about 

reciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land 

smuggling?

 MS. BRILL: I think it just evinces what 

Congress was concerned about most at the time, Justice 

Scalia, but it was -- it is certainly the case that in any 

-- any time that this country has endeavored to deal with 

matters of international tax enforcement, it has always

demanded reciprocity. It has done so through the 

smuggling statute, it has done so through the numerous tax 

treaties that the Second Circuit's RJR decision discusses 

at length.

 And one of the points the RJR decision makes is 

that, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking 

at the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was, 

at the same time, becoming concerned that this country had 

gone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with 

its tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of 

cutting back on the degree to which we would assist other 

countries in tax enforcement. 

And so the issue is to look at -- that the 

revenue rule must be used as a background principle of 

common law against which -- against which the revenue --

excuse me, against which the wire fraud statute is --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we don't view 

this case as involving some attempt to indirectly enforce 

Canada's tax laws -- suppose we don't view it with that 

lens -- then does that put it outside the so-called 

revenue --

MS. BRILL: Well, if it were not -- if it did 

not serve the function -- it doesn't matter what the 

government's intent is and what is in the mind of the 

prosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing

a foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would 

be outside; but there are numerous ways in which this 

prosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue 

rule. Certainly, it deters future violations. The 

sentence was based on the -- an estimate of the intended 

loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in 

Canada to determine what the amount was that was owed. 

And so the District Court became, essentially, part of the 

tax enforcement apparatus of the Government of Canada by 

performing that assessment in the first instance.

 And so anytime that we impose criminal or civil 

liability in a manner that affects the tax policies of 

another country, we are enforcing that rule. If we --

whether we're requiring compliance with the -- with the 

tax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance. 

All of those --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the rationale for the rule 

that enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to 

minimize the exposure to -- of our judges so that they --

the only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that --

that are paid to our own Government? I'm serious about 

that. Is that the rationale?

 MS. BRILL: Well, I think there's a certain 

amount of self-protection in some of the decision --

decisions, surely; but the real -- the underlying purpose

of the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign -- that 

taxes, in general, are a matter of policy. They're 

inherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or 

other kinds of commerce. They do not -- they do not 

assist in resolving disputes between private parties. And 

often they're imposed -- especially customs duties, are 

imposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts 

have said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve 

only the interest of the -- of the foreign sovereign, and 

there's a particular -- there's been a particular 

sensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws, 

potentially declaring them invalid under the foreign 

governments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution. 

And so revenue rules have historically been a categorical 

exclusion to general principles of comity through which we 

might otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign 

judgments.

 And the rule has come to be so entrenched, and 

has been so well established, that there's a whole body of 

background law in the tax treatise of our country, and of 

many other countries, that is based on our non-recognition 

and our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we did -- if we did 

enforce even a tax judgment of another country, there 

would be no U.S. law that would be violated. You're

talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes 

of another. But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign 

Relations now, that's put in terms of -- there's no 

requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or 

judgments of another; but neither is there any 

prohibition.

 MS. BRILL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the current 

restatement is worded in -- addresses judgment 

specifically. It does not -- it doesn't address un-

adjudicated tax codes. But there's always been a much 

greater suspicion, a much greater reluctance, to get into 

enforcing a claim brought by a foreign country, where that 

country's own processes have not been allowed to run their 

course and to have the initial determination.

 There -- the restate -- the second Restatement 

of Foreign Relations law, which is -- was -- came out in 

1965 and is closer to reflecting what the law was at the 

time Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, says, in 

Section 41, Comment L, "Under the -- under the foreign 

relations law of the United States, courts in the United 

States will generally refrain from taking action to give 

effect to the penal or revenue laws of other states, 

except as provided by international agreement." And so 

that -- that was a statement by the -- by the propounders 

of the -- of the Restatement of what they -- what they

believed the law was at the time.

 To the extent it's qualified, I think it's 

just to leave room for the fact that the Senate can 

promulgate treaties, or Congress can, by statute, command 

that courts recognize these laws. But it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't assert 

that this -- that it -- that this couldn't be done. 

You just --

MS. BRILL: Not that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- assert that we shouldn't 

interpret this statute to have done it.

 MS. BRILL: Exactly, Justice Scalia. If 

Congress had written a different wire fraud statute that 

had said, "You can't have a scheme to defraud the revenue, 

whether foreign or domestic," that would have been a clear 

statement abrogating the revenue rule. But we don't have 

any such clear statement, and the terms -- the terms 

"defraud" and the terms "property" have to be read with 

the background rule in mind.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you would come to that 

conclusion even if we had a reciprocal enforcement 

agreement. If this were Country X, where we did have a 

reciprocal enforcement agreement, you'd come to the same 

conclusion, no prosecution under this statute.

 MS. BRILL: Correct, Your Honor, because there 

wouldn't -- this statute wouldn't have been written to 

take that into account. This --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in a sense, the revenue 

position is irrelevant to your -- to your secondary or 

your -- or your independent argument on statutory 

construction. The revenue rule is irrelevant to it.

 MS. BRILL: As to just whether an unassessed tax 

claim --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MS. BRILL: -- is property, the revenue rule --

the revenue rule adds a boost to it, but there are two --

there are two dimensions to the property element. One is 

that, as I said -- and if a -- if a tax claim is not --

has not been subject to an assessment, that whatever 

interest the Government may have in that is not in the 

nature of property; it is simply in the nature of law-

enforcement power to collect. They -- some of these 

revenue rule cases talk about the power to --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So tax revenues are not 

property, in your view?

 MS. BRILL: Once a tax is collected, once the 

Government actually has money in its hands, and if there's 

a scheme to, let's say, obtain an illegal refund through a 

tax and -- that would be a scheme to deprive a government

body of money. But a scheme to merely evade paying a tax 

is not something that falls within the statute, separate 

and apart from the revenue rule. But the revenue rule --

as a result of the revenue rule, it is also the case that 

no state court would have recognized any property interest 

in a foreign sovereign, even if it had reached the point 

of a judgment. And so it works in both ways. The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, Ms. Brill, 

something that puzzled me about this case? It is a rather 

peculiar use of our wire fraud statute. Are there any 

proceedings going on in Canada? Has there been any 

attempt to extradite these people?

 MS. BRILL: Justice Ginsburg, there was an 

indictment that Canada issued against the Petitioners. It 

has charges under -- for smuggling, under Canadian law, 

which is Customs Act, Section 159. It charges unlawful 

possession of imported spirits under Excise Act 163(1)(b), 

disposing of goods illegally imported, in violation of 

Customs Act, Section 155. So Canada has its own process.

 There has -- there has not been, to my 

knowledge, any request by Canada for extradition, but the 

treaty between the United States and Canada does include 

revenue violations, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Presumably, if we punish this 

person this way, Canada wouldn't -- there's no double

jeopardy, right?

 MS. BRILL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So we'd be punishing this 

person for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would 

punish this person for violating Canadian law.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, I haven't looked in detail at 

the statute of limitations provisions, but that could be 

the effect. And we could be punishing them much more 

severely than Canada would be. They have their own means 

of balancing what they think the appropriate balance is 

for these things, and certainly the wire fraud statute, 57 

months in our --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think the Government 

has an interest in saying, "Look, if you're going to 

smuggle, have your scheme up there in Canada; don't use 

our wire systems for fraudulent purposes. We don't like 

that here."

 MS. BRILL: And if they want to pass a law that 

says that, because of the -- because there's a domestic --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they -- of course, they 

say that this covers it, and it seems to me that really 

the -- that turns on the definition of "property" --

MS. BRILL: Okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which is an arguable point.

wire fraud case, it was assault and battery? Supposing 

the Canadian revenue agent got inside of New York and one 

of your clients beat him up, would we have -- solely 

because he was mad at him for trying to interfere with his 

attempt to smuggle into Canada -- would we have to say 

that you can't do that, we have no jurisdiction over the 

assault and battery?

 MS. BRILL: No, Justice Stevens. It's -- the 

question is whether you're --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The only purpose would be just 

what the purpose is here, they're trying to facilitate the 

smuggling operation.

 MS. BRILL: Well, the assault and battery --

whatever the assault and battery provisions are, you would 

be bringing the prosecution solely for that purpose; it 

does not have any -- the effect of applying the assault 

and battery statute, if there was one --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is to interfere with Canadian's 

collection of their taxes. That's the only reason for it.

 MS. BRILL: Well, I think it -- in that case, it 

would be -- it would be far too attenuated to reach that 

conclusion. There could be -- the motive of a person --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that any more 

attenuated than a conspiracy carried out down here in 

Maryland using American assets to do the evil deed in

 MS. BRILL: Well, the motive of the person

the prosecution. It's whether they intended to do the 

improper touching and, in fact, carried it out.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't the motive 

irrelevant here? We don't want our facilities to be used 

for criminal activity.

 MS. BRILL: The question is whether --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Any more than in the -- in 

the hypothetical we don't want citizens beaten up on our 

soil.

 MS. BRILL: Justice Kennedy, the issue is 

whether -- is what Congress had in mind in enacting the 

wire fraud statute. And, in general, we presume that 

Congress had domestic concerns in mind, not that we have 

incorporated vast bodies of --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it used broad 

language, "Any scheme to defraud by means of wire 

communications in interstate or foreign commerce."

 MS. BRILL: The wire -- it is -- the wire 

communications may be an interstate or foreign commerce, 

the word "any" modifies "any scheme or artifice to 

defraud" --

people who defraud the United States Government in taxes?

 MS. BRILL: Your Honor, the government's 

position on that, I believe, is somewhat inconsistent. 

The tax -- the tax division and the Department of Justice 

U.S. Attorneys manual specifies that it is -- they believe 

it is the intent of Congress that tax matters will be 

dealt with through the internal revenue code, not through 

other means.

 There are -- there have been some prosecutions 

brought in the case of an illegal -- an illegal tax 

shelter, where there is truly an -- a private party who is 

defrauded into giving up money in connection with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't -- you don't know 

of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving 

the Federal Government of property.

 MS. BRILL: Well, the Henderson case, which we 

have cited in our reply brief, is one from the Southern 

District of New York, where Judge Weinfeld said, when 

faced with a mail fraud prosecution of that type, this is 

outside the scope of anything that Congress intended.

 The -- I would like to get back to the issue of 

money or property so that it -- to have it conceptually 

why an unassessed tax claim is not money or property. 

There is no allegation that -- in the indictment or 

anywhere -- that the petitioners took any money out of

Canada's treasury. So money is not an issue. At most, it 

was an effort to evade Canada's right to collect money, 

not any money it had --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You could say the same 

thing if it were a building fraud. Suppose there were 

contractors building a Canadian building for the Canadian 

Government and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and 

it was to deprive the Canadian Government of money? I 

think the statute would clearly apply.

 MS. BRILL: The statute only applies -- what 

McNally said is, any assistance a governmental body 

obtains from the statute must be in the capacity of 

property-holder. And so the -- a scheme to defraud 

somebody out of their -- out of a building, that's 

traditional property. There's not -- it is not the same 

thing.

 Let's have an -- let's take an example of an 

interference with prospective economic advantage. So 

there is a defendant who says to somebody else who's about 

to get a contract -- I know my competitor is about to get 

a contract, and I say, "Why don't you go out of town? 

There's a -- there's a much bigger contract that you can 

get if you fly to Michigan." And, meanwhile, I go in, and 

I usurp the contract and take it for my own purposes. 

Well, I've interfered with that person's prospective

economic advantage, and so there would be a tort, and the 

person could collect from me. But I have not taken any 

money or property from that person that was in his 

possession.

 And what McNally and Cleveland point us to is 

whether there was money or property in the hands of the --

of the victim. And Canada's interest -- until there has 

been an assessment, Canada's interest is purely that of a 

-- of a sovereign. It is -- it does not have a claim to 

any money that is in the bank account of somebody who owes 

it a debt.

 And the Johnston case, which we've cited in our 

reply brief, Your Honor, talks about -- this Court talked 

about a statute in which there was a boxing promoter who 

collected fees for the boxing match and also collected 

taxes at the same time. And the U.S. Government could not 

bring an embezzlement action against that person for not 

paying the taxes, because those taxes were not -- were not 

yet anything that qualified as governmental property.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Brill, in the Court of 

Appeals, they treated the argument that this was not 

property as entirely separate from the revenue rule 

question. And I thought your petition for cert was 

confined to the first question.

 MS. BRILL: Well, Your Honor -- no, Your Honor,

we talked about both in the petition for cert. And in 

the question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the question, itself, 

doesn't refer to the property issue. 

MS. BRILL: It talks about the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it -- was it phrased the 

same way it is in your brief, in the petition?

 MS. BRILL: Yes. Yes, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then the last part of it 

MS. BRILL: Right, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- obviously covers it.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, the last part talks about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, I see. I'm sorry, you're 

right. Yeah.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, okay.

 But to return -- to return to the revenue rule 

-- and thank you, Justice Stevens, for bringing me back to 

that -- the Government has acknowledged that there can be 

no restitution here. And that's in -- that's in the joint 

appendix, at page 106. They expressly waived it. They 

said that even if there was a foreign judgment that 

Canada was trying to bring here, that would be 

unenforceable. There could be no RICO actions, because 

that's unenforceable; and no proxy suits on behalf of a

foreign government. And so the only thing that they say 

is, beyond -- is not included -- the only act of 

enforcement which they say is not included is, somehow, 

criminal enforcement.

 And under Section 14 of the -- excuse me, under 

the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States 

Constitution, Congress has power to enforce that 

amendment, and it has done so both in enacting statutes 

for civil recovery, as well as criminal recovery --

criminal punishment, excuse me. And so it's -- the notion 

that somehow incarcerating someone is not -- is not 

punishment is not something that makes much sense in that 

context.

 The decisions of this Court have held that 

penalties are -- monetary penalties count as punishment, 

and also that injunctions are -- fall within the scope of 

the revenue rule. That's in the Wisconsin versus Pelican 

Insurance case, which actually addresses the penal -- the 

penal rule, which is the close corollary.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, when -- now 

that we're getting into money, one of the things that the 

sentencing court had to do was to find out how much of a 

loss there was, and that involved determining what taxes 

would be due under Canadian law. And did that increase 

the sentence? Did the -- did the sentence vary with the

amount of taxes that they -- we found due?

 MS. BRILL: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it very much 

did. The loss calculation was based on intended loss, and 

so they -- what the District Court judge did was estimated 

the number of cases of liquor that were intended to be 

brought into Canada, and applied that number to the amount 

of the tax that Canada, he believed, would have applied to 

that -- to that amount. And that ended up changing the 

sentence from six months to, in the case of the 

Pasquantino brothers, 57 months, and the -- and, in the 

case of Mr. Hilts, 21 months. So the bulk of the sentence 

was based on the Canadian tax law and our courts making 

that assessment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: A judge making that 

assessment.

 MS. BRILL: The judge made the sentence -- made 

the assessment at sentencing, yes. What the -- what the 

-- what the Government did in this case was to submit, 

very self-consciously, all of the issues of Canadian tax 

law to the jury. And the Assistant U.S. Attorney said 

this to the Fourth Circuit en banc panel several times, 

that they were presenting these matters of Canadian tax 

law as factual issues for the jury to find. But, 

ultimately, in sentencing, it was -- it was the court that 

ended up imposing and elevating that sentence.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 A prosecution for wire fraud based on defrauding 

a foreign government of taxes serves at least four 

distinct United States prosecutorial interests.

 The first is that the creation of schemes to 

defraud frequently spawns collateral criminal conduct in 

the United States above and beyond the fraudulent scheme 

itself. Here, for example, one of the defendants was 

charged in the indictment with using a gun in relation to 

the charged wire fraud scheme. 

Second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where? Using a gun where?

 MR. DREEBEN: In the United States, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why didn't you prosecute 

him for that?

 MR. DREEBEN: That crime depended upon the 

validity of the wire fraud charges, because the crime was 

use of a gun during in relation to this wire fraud

scheme.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that really doesn't get you 

anywhere, does it? I mean, if the United States says, "We 

don't want this gun offense to be prosecuted unless 

there's a wire fraud prosecution," that doesn't tell you 

anything as to whether there ought to be a wire fraud 

prosecution.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, what it tells you, Justice 

Souter, is why the United States has an interest in 

enforcing a law that facially is written to cover schemes 

to defraud that are carried out using the United States 

wires.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- but that's a 

reason for extending the statute to everything, to 

everything --

MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- reading "property" to mean 

anything at all. I mean, what you're saying is, the broader 

you read this statute, the more bad guys we're going to 

catch. I'll stipulate that. Of course it's true.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I'm starting 

from the proposition that the language of the wire fraud 

statute textually applies to this scheme, and Petitioner's 

argument is that, because of the common law revenue rule, 

the statute should be read to exclude schemes to defraud a

foreign government of tax revenue. And the fact that a 

foreign government is defrauded of tax revenue does not 

mean that the United States does not have an independent 

interest in rooting out that scheme and prosecuting it.

 In addition to the collateral criminal conduct 

that such schemes can spawn, the creation of such schemes 

indicates a criminal mind and a criminal group that can 

turn its techniques for used -- using to smuggle into 

Canada, also to smuggle back into the United States or to 

victimize other victims in the United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about evading a Cuban tax 

law that we think -- that many people would think is an 

unjust tax law? I mean, one of the things I'm worried 

about is that this gets us into foreign policy. Are you 

sure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of 

foreign countries through this fraud statute, no matter 

what those tax laws happen to be?

 MR. DREEBEN: The United States has 

prosecutorial discretion to determine when to invoke the 

statute and in what interests it should be served.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It may well, but when it comes 

here, this Court is going to have to decide -- we'll just 

approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not 

prosecute whatever you want?

 MR. DREEBEN: There is no provision in the

statute, Justice Scalia, for this Court to second-guess 

foreign-policy determinations that are made --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, not just foreign policy. 

The White Russians come here because they don't want to 

pay Lenin's taxes designed to equalize all individuals, in 

terms of property. Country A has a tax law that makes 

everybody a criminal because nobody really ever pays all 

the taxes. Country C has a set of laws that tax bibles. 

Country D has a -- I mean, you know, we can spin out the 

examples endlessly, and they're not farfetched.

 So take all the arguments from last week, called 

"any court arguments," cross- -- or two days ago -- just 

let's cross-reference them. The problem is complexity of 

tax law. The problem is many, many, many would be 

contrary to American policy. And the problem is, nobody 

really knows what they are; indeed, they don't even know 

what American tax law is, no single individual, I suspect. 

Let's put in Italy, France, Byelorussia, Belarus, Ukraine, 

Saudi Arabia, and 35,000 others. Everybody becomes a 

criminal. And then we say, "Don't worry, we'll only 

prosecute the real bad ones." That's the argument, I 

think, on the other side, and I'd like to hear your 

response.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I don't think 

there's any reason to assume that everyone becomes a

criminal. What this --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, only people who come over 

here because they don't want to pay taxes in those 

countries. Sometimes we would agree with them --

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, in order to 

violate the wire fraud statute, you have to use deception 

in order to deprive another --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they don't tell Lenin that 

they're coming --

MR. DREEBEN: Well, that wouldn't involve the 

use of the United States wires --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and they write to each 

other. They have a cousin, in Brooklyn, who forwards them 

the money to get out.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, if one stipulates 

that that violates the wire fraud statute or that there's 

enough conduct that does, the question still comes down to 

whether the United States chooses to prosecute that case. 

This is not a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The question comes down to 

whether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that 

way, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to 

read it that way. What about -- does Canada have an 

income tax?

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure of Canadian tax law.

deceptive Canadian income tax return?

 MR. DREEBEN: Not for using Canadian facilities 

to do so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, from this country. 

He's -- you know, he's a snow goose and is in Florida when 

he files his return.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: He files it electronically.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

 MR. DREEBEN: The wire fraud statute is 

applicable to schemes to defraud, generally speaking. The 

questions in this case are whether there is a common law 

rule that should be read to provide background.

 JUSTICE BREYER: One reason for it -- I just --

you don't seem to know completely about Canadian law. How 

much do you know about the tax law of Vietnam? Because 

Los Angeles is filled with Vietnamese refugees, many 

communities of such people in the United States. Do we 

know how many of them perhaps might owe taxes under the 

law of Vietnam, and maybe are talking to each other about 

whether they really want to pay it?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think this is a realistic

problem, Justice Breyer, that should require the Court not 

to read a statute whose language --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the wealth tax 

in France?

 MR. DREEBEN: There are a variety of taxing 

schemes all across the world. The question that the 

United States has to make when it determines whether to 

prosecute a wire fraud scheme is whether it's in interest 

-- in the interest --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, at the beginning 

of your argument, you said there were four federal 

interests you were going to identify. You've been able to 

identify one. You don't want them running around with guns. 

What are the other three?

 MR. DREEBEN: The other three are --

MR. DREEBEN: The second one, which I began to 

allude to before hearing some questions about -- foreign 

government. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Before you were asked a brief 

question.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- are that people who engage in 

schemes in this country are capable of then using the same 

techniques against victims in this country. The third 

reason is that the creation of international schemes to 

defraud, like the smuggling scheme in this case, poses

independent threats to the United States Government 

because international criminal organizations are 

particularly difficult for the United States to deal with. 

And the fourth reason is that it is an offense to a 

foreign government, the United States Executive Branch may 

conclude, to allow our soil and our wires to be used to 

perpetrate a smuggling scheme against a foreign government 

with the United States doing nothing about it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if we're concerned 

about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to 

go, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we 

negotiate treaties? I mean, one of the reasons why we go 

the treaty route are the kind of problems that Justice 

Breyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties. 

We want two things. We want to make sure that it's a 

basically fair system that we're dealing with. On the 

other hand, we want to say, "If we do anything with 

respect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get 

the same benefit from you with respect to ours."

 So never mind the revenue rule, isn't it 

pervasive that -- when it comes to enforcing tax claims, 

that the route that Congress has chosen to go, and the 

Executive, as well, has been the treaty route?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, those are tax 

treaties designed to mutually assist the countries to

collect taxes. This is a prosecution directed at fraud. 

The collection of taxes in a cooperative, reciprocal 

manner between governments implicates very different 

interests than the United States has when it seeks to 

combat people who have intended to devise, or have 

devised, a scheme to defraud in the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of --

MR. DREEBEN: -- United States.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- one of -- one of the last 

interests that you mentioned, about offending foreign 

governments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the 

one that -- the country that's been done out of taxes is 

Canada, not the United States. So, we should help Canada, 

if it's interested in collecting revenue from these people 

or trying them for a criminal offense, to do that. It --

I asked Ms. Brill, Have they been indicted in Canada? She 

said yes, but she said it's -- they had not -- there has 

not been a request for extradition. Is that -- is that --

MR. DREEBEN: That's my understanding, as well, 

Justice Ginsburg. And the pursuit of this prosecution by 

the United States reflects that when United States 

citizens engage in fraudulent conduct on our soil, our 

Government has a distinct interest, from Canada's 

interest, in pursuing the prosecution of this case.

on the books, this wire fraud statute? Pretty old

 MR. DREEBEN: 1952. And its antecedents are the 

mail fraud statute, which was enacted in 1872.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How many prosecutions like this 

have there been? When was the first one?

 MR. DREEBEN: This --

JUSTICE SCALIA: For, you know, using the mails 

or interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of 

taxes?

 MR. DREEBEN: This type of prosecution became 

more common in the 1980s when Canada greatly increased its 

taxes on importation of tobacco and alcohol.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: More common, or didn't exist at 

all before the 19- -- do you know of any case before --

before --

that?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, of course there were smugglers 

before then, but the statute, on its face, is broad. And 

the only justification -- the only two justifications for 

seeking to read it narrowly are, first, that there's a 

common law revenue rule that forms a backdrop for the 

construction of the statute. That is wrong, the 

Government submits, because there is no common law revenue 

rule that has ever been articulated that says one country 

cannot prosecute people in that country for defrauding a 

foreign government of tax --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the second reason?

 MR. DREEBEN: The second reason is the claim 

that to deprive a foreign government of money by not 

paying tax revenues is not common law fraud.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Well, and you have 

arguments against both of those two. Which arguments 

are at least -- at least -- arguable? What about a 

third rule, the rule of lenity?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If we -- if we are unsure, if 

it's a close question whether it's property, if it's a 

close question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of 

Canada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws 

of Canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the 

rule of lenity apply?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, if the Court concluded that 

the question was not susceptible of resolution by resort 

to the usual tools of statutory construction, then you 

would apply the rule of lenity. But it's our submission 

that neither of these two theories --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask this question? 

I think you have conceded, in a footnote -- and maybe 

you're -- almost conceded -- that if this were a RICO 

case, a civil RICO case, that the Congress enacted the 

RICO statute against this background rule and that perhaps 

the RICO case could not go forward. What if it were a 

federal RICO case and -- the same facts -- would the RICO 

statute be qualified by the revenue rule?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, it would not, Justice Stevens, 

and that's because of the precise distinction that I drew 

in response to Justice Scalia's question. This is a suit 

by the United States Government, as Plaintiff, not by a 

foreign government, as Plaintiff or prosecutor. The 

revenue rule essentially concerned with interests of 

sovereignty. One foreign government should not be able to 

come into our courts and enforce its sovereign power by 

using our courts to collect taxes from our citizens.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the other reasons 

underlying it, which is what I was trying to get at 

before? I see, literally, that the common law -- you

know, the enforcement rule, this is not literally 

enforcement. But what I was driving at with my questions 

is, even though literally it's not, the problems of 

complexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems 

of there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we 

might think are basically unfair, that those 

considerations apply here, just as they do with the 

enforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning 

people into criminals under threat of prosecution by the 

Federal Government is really very much equivalent to 

enforcing the foreign rule in a court. I mean, that's the 

whole thing spelled out. And I meant it seriously, though 

I used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home.

 What is your response to that?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, first of 

all, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that 

would defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to 

show specific intent to defraud if the law were not 

sufficiently clear for us to be able to meet that burden. 

This case illustrates the kind of prosecution that will be 

brought. There are taxes that are due upon the 

importation of alcohol. The Petitioners arranged, through 

the wires, to bring alcohol from Maryland up to New York, 

and then they got it across the border by not answering 

questions when asked by customs officials and by not going

to secondary inspection when they were asked. In order to 

bring a criminal prosecution that requires specific intent 

to defraud, the government is not going to be relying on 

obscure systems.

 As to the concern about the enforcement of tax 

systems that the United States may believe are -- is 

unfair, that is the prerogative of the Executive Branch to 

determine in deciding whether a prosecution should be 

brought in a particular case. This Court has repeatedly 

recognized that the Executive Branch is the preeminent 

branch in the area of foreign affairs --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: To go to one more aspect of 

the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress 

said that -- with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud 

and, I think, other things -- that restitution to the 

victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the 

government to decide restitution or not. Except here 

restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's 

taxes, so you have conceded no restitution. But it seems 

to me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud 

statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and 

that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to 

be the object of the scheme to defraud.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism 

doesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue

rule, as defined in the common law cases that can be 

pointed to as the background principle, has to do with a 

foreign government, or someone acting on its behalf, 

coming into this country's courts to enforce its tax 

rules. Here what you have is the United States Government 

determining that it is in the interest of the United 

States to bring a criminal prosecution.

 Now, in this case, the prosecutor did concede 

below that restitution was not appropriately ordered. 

That's not the position of the United States. The 

position of the United States is that restitution under 

the mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not 

infringe the revenue rule. But there are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, how could that be, 

because restitution is to the victim? The victim is 

Canada. You collect Congress -- or Canada's tax, and you 

give it to Canada. Is there any other kind of 

restitution?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg, 

but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it 

applies to efforts by the United States Government to 

secure punishment by -- for a criminal conviction.

 But, Justice Ginsburg, if the Court were to 

disagree with that and were to believe that restitution, 

even when it's been sought by the United States -- not by

a foreign government, in its own right, with the power to 

instigate a lawsuit -- but that even when the United 

States does it, that somehow falls within the parameters 

of the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that 

problem would be to interpret the restitution statute 

against the background of the revenue rule, not to 

interpret the wire fraud statute against the background of 

the revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the United 

States is wholly barred.

 The Petitioner's submission here is really 

rather extraordinary --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The restitution statute is not 

ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of 

ambiguities in it. And if I had to find my way out of the 

restitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to 

get out, rather than simply saying, "Well, though this 

restitution statute says this categorically, we will 

ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be 

enforcing the revenue laws of another country." There's 

nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another 

country, if we want to; this is just a question of 

statutory interpretation. Should this ambiguous statute 

be interpreted that way? If Congress said, "We're going 

to enforce Canada's tax laws," there's nothing wrong with 

that. But --

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have two statutes. One 

of them seems to be quite ambiguous. The other one is 

categorical, you get restitution in all cases. Now, how 

do I wiggle out of it?

 MR. DREEBEN: There's a difference --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Obviously, I wiggle out of 

it with the ambiguous statute.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- there's a difference, Justice 

Scalia, between an ambiguous statute and a broad statute. 

The wire fraud statute is unequivocally broad, and it has 

been so interpreted. It's not ambiguous on the question 

of whether it applies to schemes to defraud that may 

involve foreign victims; it says "any scheme to defraud." 

And I think, as Justice Kennedy's questions pointed out 

earlier, if there were a scheme to defraud a foreign 

business interest in Canada or a foreign governmental 

interest in Canada relating to some commercial venture, 

the wire fraud statute would apply, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about a 

scheme --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't told me -- you 

haven't told me how you get out of the restitution 

statute. There's no ambiguity there, and it is not a rule 

of law that you can't -- it's unconstitutional to enforce

the tax laws of Canada. Since it's entirely feasible, and 

since the text is categorical, how do you get out of the 

restitution statute?

 MR. DREEBEN: Here is how I get out of it, 

Justice Scalia. If you think, as I do not, that the 

revenue rule would bar restitution at the behest of the 

United States in a criminal prosecution, there is a 

background principle that says when there is an 

established rule of the common law, Congress legislates 

against that background, and unless it makes its intent 

clear and unequivocal to overcome that background rule of 

the common law, then the statute will not be interpreted 

to be in derogation of it. It was that principle that 

formed the basis for the government's view that Canada 

cannot come in under the RICO statute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that view is in --

somewhat in tension with your view that the common law 

revenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution. 

If you have to interpret the statute in light of the 

general rule that one country doesn't mess with another 

country's taxes, absent a treaty.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is 

no common law rule that one country doesn't mess with 

another country's taxes. What there are, are a set of 

cases that deal with specific problems in which foreign

taxes were at issue. And in all of the 20th century 

versions of this problem, what you had is a foreign 

government or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign 

government, coming into another country seeking to use 

that country's courts to enforce its own tax rules. And 

in that context, the justifications for saying that one 

country will not enforce another country's revenue laws 

have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host 

country.

 One country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to 

carry out its own governmental policies, is doing 

something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and 

there's no obligation of the United States to assist the 

foreign government in using its court system to achieve 

those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it, 

either. As Justice Scalia pointed out, it's not 

unconstitutional, if Congress wanted to allow it. But 

countries, historically, have not. And that principle 

does form an important backdrop --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have countries also -- just --

here, I don't know, in respect to the principle -- would 

it have been viewed as contrary to the principle if a 

country were to pass a law -- say, England were to pass a 

law saying it is a crime in England not to pay French 

taxes? I'm not saying they couldn't do it; I'm just

saying, would a law like that, saying it is a crime in

viewed as contrary to an abrogation of -- or a -- you 

know, whatever you call it -- a derogation from the common 

law revenue rule?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that that's essentially 

the same question in this case, with the one significant 

difference that here there is a domestic --

JUSTICE BREYER: But do you see why I want to 

characterize it? I mean, would you characterize -- my 

criminal statute's absolutely clear -- the clear is, it is 

a crime in England not to pay French taxes. Now, would 

you, or would scholars, or whoever, knew about the common 

law revenue rule, would they have said, "There is a 

derogation from the common law revenue rule," or would 

they have said, "It has nothing to do with it"?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't know what scholars 

would have said about it --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, what would you have said?

 MR. DREEBEN: This is what I would say 

about it. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.

principle that a statute of the United States will not be 

construed to be in derogation of a common law unless it's

clear that that's its purpose, the Court should be very 

careful in defining what the parameters of the common law 

are. The Court should not take a common law rule and 

treat it as some dynamic entity that has capability of 

growing a dimension that is not consistent with its 

purposes and that it had never assumed in any decided case 

as a means of telling Congress, "You can't do what you 

have done."

 So I would say, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We haven't told -- no, no, no, 

no, no, no, we're not telling Congress, "You can't do what 

you have done." We're saying, "Congress hasn't done 

this."

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the only reason you would 

say that Congress hasn't done it, Justice Scalia, is if 

you concluded that -- and I would ask Petitioners what 

their best citations are, because I have not been able to 

find them -- what cases indicate that a country cannot 

bring the kind of prosecution that the United States did 

here to vindicate its own independent sovereign --

JUSTICE BREYER: Nobody says they can't do it. 

That's why I asked you my question. My question is simply 

whether you would consider an absolutely clear law -- we 

will -- we -- it is a crime not to pay your French taxes. 

I'm asking whether you would consider that -- I'm not

saying they can't do it; I just want to know -- would it

 MR. DREEBEN: It would probably be in derogation 

of a more --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what --

MR. DREEBEN: -- fundamental principle.

 MR. DREEBEN: Not the revenue rule --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not the --

MR. DREEBEN: -- but a more fundamental 

principle that one country usually does not legislate with 

respect to extraterritorial acts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That would be another one, too.

 MR. DREEBEN: But if you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they -- I -- that's why 

I want to know --

MR. DREEBEN: But that's not applicable here, 

either, Justice Breyer, because the crime involves wire 

fraud in the United States.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but why isn't it applicable 

to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation 

to order restitution? And it seems to me that the 

restitution that would be ordered would be just as much in 

derogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out 

collection in Justice Breyer's example.

you said, "Okay, we'll assume that there would be some 

derogation," in Justice Breyer's example. I don't see why 

you don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the 

restitution aspect here.

 MR. DREEBEN: Because the derogation that I was 

talking about with respect to Justice Breyer is punishing 

conduct that occurs entirely extraterritorially. This is 

not conduct that occurs entirely --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but the revenue -- the 

revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-

extraterritorial enforcement. It has -- it has other 

rationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue 

rule is; the -- you know, the problems of policy; there 

are lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we 

certainly wouldn't want to enforce, and so on. It's not 

just extraterritoriality. And those -- those policies 

would be just as much implicated by the -- by the 

restitution as by the out-and-out enforcement in Justice 

Breyer's example.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter, I think that 

the policies underlying the revenue rule are narrower than

the ones that you have articulated; but, even more to the 

point, they are not justifications that found their way 

into any holdings that would lead a reasonable legislator 

in 1952, when the wire fraud statute was enacted, to 

conclude that this is a rule that I'm going to have to 

specifically --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, go on.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, you. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, perhaps 

there were no specific holdings, because it would have 

been regarded as, kind of, a bizarre derogation of the 

rule in the first place. Nobody had dreamed up this 

scheme earlier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I was about to say the same --

the same thing. You keep saying there are no cases that 

do this. Are there -- are there -- are there cases, 

before 1980, which do what you want to do -- that is, to 

use our fraud law, or something, to effectively enforce 

Canada's -- or some foreign country's tax law?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, but what I would say about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- the revenue rule is that it is

been growing. It originally started out as a principle 

that allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts 

that they believed were in furtherance of commerce. It 

gradually came under attack, because what it said is that 

the United States will not notice that a foreign country's 

laws have been violated in the formation of a contract, 

and so the contract will be enforced. Commentators 

recognized that that was contrary to principles of comity 

and recognition that each country does have a reciprocal 

interest in acknowledging each other's laws.

 In the 20th century, those contract cases 

completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left 

are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert 

its sovereign power inside the United States or inside a 

foreign country -- the United States, itself, tried it 

once in Canada -- to collect taxes. And countries said, 

"We're not going to do that. We're going to leave it to 

the treaty process." 

But the rationales that Justice Breyer and 

Justice Souter have articulated, about complexity of 

foreign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never 

been the driving force behind the revenue rule. It's been

say no, that's not in derogation for the reason that 

there's an independent local reason for doing it. It's 

not being done to -- whether it has that effect or not, 

it's not being done in order to collect the foreign tax.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's been your response 

throughout.

 MR. DREEBEN: That is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I --

MR. DREEBEN: What you have instead is a law of 

the United States that's enacted to serve perfectly valid 

interests that the United States Government has in rooting 

out fraud in this country and in dealing with schemes to 

defraud that are created here. And for the Court to say 

that, "We don't like these kinds of prosecutions, because 

we're concerned about really bad foreign tax systems, and 

we're concerned about complicated law, and we're concerned 

that some common law rule that had never actually assumed 

the scope that Petitioners ascribed to it, should be

interpretation of this statute" is not a principle that 

finds any support in the construction of federal --

mean, they do have that border, which is rather easy to 

cross -- about what we were going to do when they put the

of what specific law enforcement conversations occurred,

cooperation with Canada, as a close neighbor, and that the 

interests of the United States very much do favor our

 MS. BRILL: Sure. On the -- on the issue of the 

identity of the person bringing the claim, the contract 

cases, Holman and Boucher, stand for that proposition, and 

the Peter Buchanan case, which came down in 1950, just 

before the wire fraud statute was enacted -- this was in 

the Appellate Court in Ireland -- it says, "It is not a 

question whether the plaintiff is a foreign state or the 

representative of a foreign state or its revenue 

authority. In every case, the substance of a claim must 

be scrutinized. And if it then appears that it is really 

a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of 

a foreign revenue, it must be rejected." That's at 1955 

A.C. 529. 

And so with the -- with the Mandatory 

Restitution Act, this clearly is something to collect the 

debts of a foreign nation. And the sentencing scheme that 

Justice Ginsburg alluded to earlier, in which the 

sentences were enhanced based on the intended loss, 

demonstrate that this is an enforcement action.

 Stringam versus Dubois, which is an Alberta 

case from 1992, involving -- the plaintiff there was an 

executor of a probate estate, and the court said, "The 

identity of the plaintiff in the action is not vital if 

the action indirectly has the effect of enforcing revenue 

laws of a foreign country." That's at 135 A.C. at page

 And the way the revenue rule has been cited 

repeatedly is that it -- what it prevents is not just 

direct enforcement, but direct or indirect enforcement. 

And so it is -- the fact that there have not been criminal 

prosecutions, it clearly would have been in derogation of 

the common law for a -- for England to pass a statute 

saying it is criminal in England to break the laws of 

France.

 JUSTICE BREYER: See, he's saying it isn't, for 

the reason that, he says, that if England did it for 

independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted 

to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have 

been in derogation. Of course, it would have been legal, 

either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in 

derogation, for that reason.

 MS. BRILL: Right. Well, it clearly would have. 

There was no common law practice -- we have -- we have not 

found, in all the research -- and the Government has not 

found -- any example of a criminal prosecution -- not just 

in this country; anywhere in the world -- to -- deriving 

from the violation of a foreign government's tax. And so 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying, in effect, that 

derogation is an effects test, not an intent test.

 MS. BRILL: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Justice 

Souter.

 And the -- in terms of what the government's 

interests are, there were no deceptive acts in this 

country. The way the Government gets a material 

misstatement is by a failure to disclose at the Canadian 

border, which only -- even though they did not put in 

evidence of what the -- that Canada even had a law 

requiring disclosure, the only way there could have been 

any kind of material misstatement would be if Canadian law 

required it, not if -- not anything that happened in the 

United States.

 In Cleveland, the Court was very clear to point 

out -- one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in 

interpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud 

statute is because violations serve as a predicate for 

RICO actions and for money-laundering violations. And so 

what the government's position is, is that we should carve 

out this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud 

prosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a 

civil RICO action and even though we're going to have an 

ad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution 

Act. But what the Court said in Cleveland is, the way we 

should do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in 

the first place, not by -- of the wire fraud statute --

not by having ad-hoc exceptions.

 And the reference to prosecutorial discretion 

that there should be faith that the Government will only 

prosecute, I guess, what the Government regards as 

exceptional cases is not something that can provide any 

business involved in an international transaction with any 

-- with any comfort.

 And thank you very much.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. The case is 

submitted.
