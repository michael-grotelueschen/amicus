1  JUSTICE STEVENS: And we will now hear 
2 argument in McCreary County against the ACLU. 
3  Mr. Staver? 
4  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. STAVER 
5  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
6  MR. STAVER: Justice Stevens and may it 
7 please the Court. 
8  Before this Court is a setting of law in a 
9 courthouse and a display on law that contains the 

10 universally recognized symbol of law. Despite the 
11 fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of 
12 this otherwise secular display, the Sixth Circuit 
13 struck it down. The Court focused solely on the 
14 religious aspect of the Ten Commandments and that's 
15 aired by ignoring the overall context. 
16  The Ten Commandments is unlike most any 
17 other acknowledgment. It is in a category 
18 essentially all by itself. It is thematic in common 
19 places in courthouses while Nativity scenes and 
20 menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on 
21 public property. The Ten Commandments occurs quite 
22 frequently and has for more than a century in 
23 courthouses all over this nation. It is associated 
24 with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because 
25 the Ten Commandments has played an influential role 

3

1 in American law and government and our system of law 
2 in this country. 
3  The context in this case is clearly 
4 important. Yet the Sixth Circuit --
5  JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you there 
6 basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia 
7 made in the course of the last argument? The 
8 context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in 
9 the course of litigation over this and it started out 

10 with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 
11 2, the Ten Commandments had certain -- were 
12 surrounded by certain quotations of religious content 
13 from other texts. 
14  And finally, as I guess literally is true 
15 with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten 
16 to the present context. Isn't the problem that you 
17 have to face, as I've said before, what Justice 
18 Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going 
19 on. Everybody knows that the present context is 
20 simply litigation dressing and that the object for 
21 what is going on is the object that was revealed in 
22 the first place. 
23  What is your response to that? 
24  MR. STAVER: Several. The display in this 
25 case has three different phases. First it was the 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 stand-alone Ten Commandments. They were sued. They 
2 could have defended that but they chose instead to 
3 switch rather than fight because they wanted to try 
4 to comply with this Court's establishment clause 
5 jurisprudence, to try to figure out how to be able to 
6 display this particular document. They stepped, 
7 however, on a land mine admittedly with this second 
8 display. 
9  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they created the 

10 land mine basically. I mean --
11  MR. STAVER: They were trying to do the 
12 best that they could, trying to follow this ever 
13 bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially 
14 in the area of displays. Remember this was back in 
15 1999. 
16  At that time, there were less than a 
17 handful of reported decisions ever in this country on 
18 the Ten Commandments. The first was in 1973, Stone 
19 was in 1980 and there were a couple of others. There 
20 are only 30 reported cases in the country or so and 
21 23 of those happened from 1999 to the present so they 
22 didn't have really any guidance. They were trying to 
23 follow Lynch and Allegheny as best as they could but 
24 these are governmental officials. They're not 
25 jurists schooled in the law. And admittedly they 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 made a mistake. But what they have now is the 
2 foundation is display and as the District Court 
3 recognized, it is fundamentally different than any 
4 previous display. 
5  Like this Court's decision in the Sunday 
6 law cases, even though it may have started off for a 
7 religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to 
8 be retained for secular reasons. 
9  In this case --

10  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that the 
11 purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't 
12 matter? 
13  MR. STAVER: We're saying that in this 
14 case, the purpose is about the display of law. We 
15 also have an argument later on that this Court should 
16 reconsider the purpose in generally as it relates to 
17 the Lemon test. 
18  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but if we still 
19 have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is 
20 true. The current display includes the display of a 
21 lot of legal documents. But is there any reason for 
22 anyone to believe that that display of legal 
23 documents or anything else would be there for any 
24 other purpose than the display of the Ten 
25 Commandments, including the religious, the overtly 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 theistic part of the text? 
2  MR. STAVER: Yes, Your Honor. The 
3 District Court actually recognized that one of the 
4 omni intended effects of the history is to educate 
5 everyone of the difference between an acknowledgment 
6 and an establishment. And even if they had a 
7 religious purpose under the second display, that 
8 religious purpose has been buried and has been 
9 abandoned. 

10  They voluntarily accepted the --
11  JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not abandoning 
12 the position that you have a right to make this kind 
13 of religious display, are you? 
14  MR. STAVER: No, we're not. 
15  JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. 
16  MR. STAVER: And that's why we said that 
17 they could have defended the individual first display 
18 which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because 
19 it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law 
20 and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse. 
21 They could have defended when they were originally 
22 sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to 
23 modify the display. And when they modified the 
24 display, it had excerpted sections around it. 
25  JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there -- I 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 guess -- I don't want to tie you up too long but I 
2 mean given the history, isn't it still the case that 
3 there is no serious reason to believe that there is 
4 any object here other than the display of the Ten 
5 Commandments including the overtly theistic text and 
6 the rest of this is basically enabling context which 
7 does not affect the objective, the objective being 
8 the Ten Commandments and the religious text? 
9  MR. STAVER: Your Honor, they must be able 

10 to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that 
11 they had. Otherwise, that past case would be 
12 superimposed on the foundation's display forever and 
13 the question would be --
14  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, not forever but 
15 for now. This isn't a case in which they came up 
16 with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined 
17 and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, 
18 let's have a display of important documents in the 
19 history of law. This in fact is a continuous process 
20 and it is a continuous process within the context of 
21 litigation about the constitutionality of the 
22 display. It's not a -- the implication is not that 
23 you can never have a different display but that there 
24 is no reason to believe that the intent of this 
25 display has changed as the context has changed. 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1  What is your response to that? 
2  MR. STAVER: The intent has certainly 
3 broadened in this case and there is clearly no 
4 evidence in this record that this foundations display 
5 is solely purposed or intended to be a religious 
6 display. In fact, even the respondents of amici that 
7 wrote against us said that on the face of this 
8 display, it appears secular in nature. It does. 
9  In fact, the foundations display not only 

10 has numerous other documents of which the Ten 
11 Commandments is only one tenth of these many other 
12 document but it also has a foundations document that 
13 says what the purpose is about. There is only two 
14 places that talk about the purpose on the foundations 
15 display. 
16  On the document itself, which says it's a 
17 display about some documents that influenced American 
18 law and government, and the undisputed testimony that 
19 these are documents that reflect documents that have 
20 influenced American law and government. That's the 
21 record before this Court on the foundations display 
22 and that is fundamentally different --
23  JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we go back to the 
24 first display. If all that was there was the Ten 
25 Commandments, now, in your opinion, was that 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 constitutional? 
2  MR. STAVER: That is arguably 
3 constitutional --
4  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we take it along 
5 with the resolution of the counties? Do we look at 
6 everything? 
7  MR. STAVER: Your Honor, there was no 
8 resolution, Justice O'Connor, for the first display. 
9 It just went up. 

10  JUSTICE STEVENS: So just that first 
11 display, what was the purpose of that first one? 
12  MR. STAVER: The purpose of that first one 
13 is like it is in many courthouses around the country. 
14 Both courthouses have numerous documents of his 
15 historical nature along the walls,284 just in the 
16 curia alone. And in Pulaski, many, many documents, 
17 when they celebrated their 200th anniversary in 1999. 
18 So that was one of many documents that's there and 
19 that was a document of the Ten Commandments that was 
20 meant to show the historic nature of the Ten 
21 Commandments, how it has in fact influenced American 
22 law and government in the appropriate setting of a 
23 courthouse. 
24  JUSTICE STEVENS: The original one? 
25  MR. STAVER: The original one. 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE STEVENS: Was there anything there 
2 that said we're interested in history and what we're 
3 not interested in is having this on the wall as -- to 
4 encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage 
5 them to study religion and to understand that in 
6 their lives, religion should be important and this 
7 very solemn secular setting. Nonetheless, religion 
8 is important. Is there anything like that on the 
9 document itself? 

10  MR. STAVER: No, it was just the document 
11 itself in a frame on a wall amongst almost 300 other 
12 documents. 
13  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if its purpose were 
14 to demonstrate -- and I quote from one of our earlier 
15 opinions -- that we are a religious people whose 
16 institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. What if 
17 that were its purpose? Would that have made it bad? 
18  MR. STAVER: I don't believe so, Justice 
19 Scalia, because that in fact is an acknowledgement 
20 that is part of our history; like in Marsh versus 
21 Chambers. That's why this Court has authorized 
22 prayers before legislative sessions or suggested that 
23 the national motto is constitutional because indeed 
24 we are a religious people as this Court has said more 
25 than five times. We are a religious people. Our 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 institutions do presuppose the existence of a Supreme 
2 Being. 
3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it your position 
4 that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not 
5 agree with that message? 
6  MR. STAVER: That's correct, Your Honor. 
7  Justice Kennedy, it would not inflict any 
8 harm because in this case, it's a passive display in 
9 a courthouse in a hallway and you could simply walk 

10 past that and avert your eyes once you see this. It 
11 inflicts no harm, it does not --
12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Staver, what about 
13 all the distinctions that have been made between 
14 messages that are brief or I think the expression has 
15 been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in 
16 God we Trust, like God save the United States and 
17 this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document 
18 that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many 
19 words devoted to that topic. So it's not a brief 
20 reference. It's a powerful statement of the 
21 covenants that the Lord is making with his people. 
22  MR. STAVER: Justice Ginsburg, the Ten 
23 Commandments is a unique symbol in the area of 
24 acknowledgment because of its historic role in 
25 influencing our law and government. It is displayed 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 in this context for that unique role. It does have 
2 some statements in there about God but, frankly, very 
3 few when you look at the overall context. 
4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you read the first 
5 four commandments and could you say that? 
6  MR. STAVER: Sure. And those are 
7 definitely and decidedly religious. There is no 
8 question that the Ten Commandments is a religious 
9 document. There is also no question that it has 

10 influenced our American law. 
11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the Ten 
12 Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers 
13 you've heard at the beginning of congressional 
14 sessions? 
15  MR. STAVER: No, Justice Scalia. I think 
16 they're quite shorter. 
17  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know how much 
18 help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of 
19 the involvement of the government, is the government 
20 involved in religion when it posts the Ten 
21 Commandments alone? Yes, of course it is. 
22  Now, there could be a purpose to it, that 
23 they want to just show the history of law but it's 
24 all by itself and there is a lot more history than 
25 that and context may matter a lot. Not everybody 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself 
2 there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far. 
3  This is going too far. Why? Because it 
4 isn't really related to history, it's the only thing 
5 up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth. 
6  Now, suppose I go down that track because 
7 what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too 
8 far and what's not. But for present purposes, let's 
9 assume it's too far. 

10  Now, once they've gone too far there, the 
11 next thing that happens is they keep changing it but 
12 they change it pursuant to the resolution and it 
13 seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to 
14 surround what went too far with a number of other 
15 things that would somehow make it legal. 
16  Now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it 
17 wrong to end with? 
18  MR. STAVER: No, Justice Breyer, it is not 
19 wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to 
20 begin with the Sunday laws based upon the Sabbath 
21 commandment which was a commandment about worship and 
22 the end with the secular reason for keeping those 
23 particular laws as this Court has recognized in 
24 McGowan. And in this case, even if they started off 
25 with a decidedly and only religious purpose, which we 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 contend they did not, they did not end with one and 
2 they've got to, as governmental officials, be able to 
3 adjust their missteps whenever they step on a 
4 constitutional land mine that is sometimes blurry and 
5 confusing to them. 
6  That's what they tried to do in this case, 
7 the best efforts to try to follow this Court's 
8 decision when there was really no specific guidelines 
9 for them to be guiding their direction. 

10  The Ten Commandments that Justice Stevens, 
11 you had mentioned about the versions, the versions I 
12 don't believe, with all due respect, are relevant in 
13 this case or any other case regarding the Ten 
14 Commandments because if that were the case, you 
15 wouldn't be able to teach the Bible in an appropriate 
16 context because there are so many different versions 
17 and yet Stone and Schempp has indicated that you 
18 indeed can teach even the Biblical text with all of 
19 its multiple versions. 
20  JUSTICE SOUTER: But I assume if you were 
21 running a course in a school about the biblical text, 
22 you would explain the differences. You would 
23 indicate the difference between the Jewish, the 
24 Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and 
25 you're not doing that here. 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1  I would have thought your answer might be, 
2 well, if that really made a difference, we could have 
3 separate versions. But it's not comparable to school 
4 teaching. 
5  JUSTICE STEVENS: Justice Souter, it would 
6 in fact be somewhat comparable because if you're 
7 teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all 
8 the versions lined out. 
9  JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you think it was 

10 appropriate in a public school course that was 
11 otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on 
12 exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version 
13 of the Ten Commandments? 
14  MR. STAVER: We would believe that, in 
15 fact, in this case, I don't even think they thought 
16 about whether there were different versions but we 
17 certainly believe that they could have the text there 
18 and talk about the Ten Commandments. 
19  JUSTICE SOUTER: In a public school, 
20 wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual 
21 reasons if not the reasons of the establishment 
22 clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with 
23 differently in the standard Roman translation and the 
24 preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded 
25 as commandment number 1 are different in the 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 Christian versus Jewish and so on. 
2  Wouldn't that be an intellectually 
3 responsible requirement? 
4  MR. STAVER: That's in a school context 
5 which this is a courthouse context. 
6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. I thought you 
7 were equating the two together. 
8  MR. STAVER: Not one to one but I think 
9 the version issue, if there is a version that flunks 

10 the test, it would be this Court's south frieze. 
11 It's actually in Hebrew and it speaks only to Jewish 
12 people. But yet that's not sectarian such that it 
13 violates the establishment clause. That's the 
14 acknowledgment as opposed to an establishment. 
15 Justice Stevens, if you would like, I would like to 
16 reserve the remaining of my time. 
17  JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may do so. 
18  Mr. Clement, you're welcome to stand up 
19 for a second time. 
20  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 
21  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 
22  MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, 
23 and may it please the Court. The display of 
24 historical documents here, like the display in the 
25 Lynch against Donnelly case of the creche, may 

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 include a religious item without running afoul of the 
2 establishment clause. As in the --
3  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we have to consider 
4 the history of the display at all? 
5  MR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, we would 
6 urge you not to consider the history of the display. 
7 You in your concurring opinion in the Pinette case 
8 made the point that in the context of accommodations, 
9 the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot 

10 of sense and you urged the Court to drop it in that 
11 context. I think so too in the acknowledgment 
12 context. Certainly if you have a situation where you 
13 don't have -- I think in the acknowledgment context 
14 as well, a focus on purpose may not be that 
15 productive. But I would like to talk about the 
16 purpose --
17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you 
18 mean by the acknowledgment context. 
19  MR. CLEMENT: I think this Court has said 
20 that you can accommodate religions. They've also 
21 said that you can acknowledge the role that religion 
22 has played in our society and I think in both 
23 contexts, a focus on purpose is probably not a 
24 prudent exercise of judicial resources. But I would 
25 like to talk about the purpose here because I think 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 what you have here is a display of a document alone 
2 in the first instance that certainly was at least 
3 defensible and probably constitutional, yet the 
4 courts below got off on the wrong foot by saying that 
5 the first display was open defiance of this Court's 
6 decision in Stone against Graham and I think this 
7 Court's cases themselves suggest that the contextual 
8 differences between the school and the courtroom are 
9 enough to at least make the display not in open 

10 defiance. 
11  Now there was the second display and we 
12 are not here to defend the second display but that 
13 was the display that was in reaction to the lawsuit 
14 filed against the first display. Now, I don't know 
15 if that second display was the product of bad legal 
16 advice or simply frustration at the first lawsuit 
17 being filed but I don't think it should make a 
18 constitutional difference. 
19  In the Lynch against Donnelly case, Mayor 
20 Lynch, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit against him, 
21 had a rally at the site of the creche, a press 
22 conference, where he publicly vowed to fight to keep 
23 Christ in Christmas and then he led city workers in 
24 carols and said they should sing another one that 
25 apparently bothers people. 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1  Yet despite that adverse reaction to the 
2 litigation being filed against the city of Pawtucket, 
3 this Court upheld the display and although the 
4 dissent did focus on the mayor's crusade to keep 
5 Christ in Christmas, the majority and the concurring 
6 opinions did not. And I think that is the proper 
7 mode of analysis. 
8  Now, the second point I think is should 
9 these counties be faulted for trying to bring their 

10 practices in compliance with the Constitution? And I 
11 think the answer there is clearly not. And I was 
12 going to point this Court to the Marsh case that's 
13 been talked about quite a bit. 
14  One of the things that as Professor 
15 Chemerinsky said about the Marsh case that this Court 
16 emphasized in that case itself and in subsequent 
17 cases is the fact that the prayers there were 
18 non-sectarian in the sense that they did not directly 
19 invoke, say, Christ. But that actually is something 
20 of a change that took place after the litigation 
21 began. 
22  Prior to the litigation, there were 
23 explicit references to Christ as Justice Stevens 
24 pointed out in footnote 2 of his dissent in that 
25 case. But the state of Nebraska, after they had a 

20

1 lawsuit, decided let's make this an easier case for 
2 the Court, not a harder case, and they modified their 
3 conduct. 
4  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but at the end of 
5 the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what 
6 they were doing was praying. And here it seems to me 
7 that the change that you're arguing for as 
8 significant is only significant unless it is a change 
9 in the essential activity because there is no law and 

10 it would be crazy law from this Court that said you 
11 can engage in religious endorsement, promotions, et 
12 cetera, so long as you hide the ball well enough. 
13  What this Court basically has said is you 
14 can engage in secular objectives that incidentally 
15 involve religious figures or references, e.g., Moses 
16 up there. What you started with in this case or what 
17 the county started with was a pretty 
18 religious-looking exercise and the question is, did 
19 they go from a totally religious exercise to a 
20 secular exercise or did they go from an obviously 
21 religious exercise to an obscured religious exercise? 
22 And therefore, you can't make context a mere change 
23 in physical context dispositive because it ignores 
24 that distinction. And that distinction I think is 
25 what is driving or what is going to drive possibly in 

21

1 my mind the resolution of this case. 
2  What do you say to that? 
3  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Souter, I have two 
4 points in response. 
5  First of all, what I think would be a 
6 crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court 
7 to say that this display is a foundation to the law 
8 document, it's perfectly constitutional in every 
9 other county courthouse in Kentucky except for 

10 McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their 
11 prior conduct. 
12  The second point that I think is important 
13 in this context is that I think this Court's 
14 establishment clause jurisprudence is already 
15 difficult enough to apply without creating the First 
16 Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under 
17 section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 
18  JUSTICE STEVENS: Basically, and I think I 
19 understand you, you're saying, and I think you said 
20 it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have 
21 a -- try to move toward an objective criterion saying 
22 there are some ways you can display religious things 
23 and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to 
24 develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as 
25 distinct from an intent jurisprudence. 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1  That's your point, isn't it? 
2  MR. CLEMENT: That would be my point, 
3 Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that 
4 point, it is also not a particular productive 
5 jurisprudence to really treat different 
6 municipalities differently because the mayor in one 
7 case may have started with the creche and decided to 
8 add the wishing well or in the other case started the 
9 wishing well and added the creche. I don't think it 

10 makes any sense that if they end up in the same 
11 place, the constitutional rules could be the same. 
12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, you placed 
13 heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was 
14 undisguised and it was permitted to have since the 
15 beginning of our nation. 
16  Would it be equally compatible with the 
17 establishment clause if this Court opened its daily 
18 sessions with prayer? 
19  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not 
20 sure that I could the jurisprudence that said this 
21 Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but 
22 the Capitol can. Now, if there was any difference 
23 drawn at all, I would assume it would be a difference 
24 based on history. 
25  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure we don't 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 deal with it. I don't know who we're addressing when 
2 we say God save the United States and this Honorable 
3 Court. 
4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The kind of prayer that 
5 is used to open the legislative sessions which this 
6 Court has distinguished from in God we trust, God 
7 save the United States and this Honorable Court. 
8  MR. CLEMENT: And as I said, Justice 
9 Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in 

10 principle, it would have to be a difference based on 
11 history. But I don't think there is -- in this 
12 context, I think it is fair to say --
13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you what 
14 your view is of the compatibility of every federal 
15 Court in the country having over the bench a replica 
16 of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with 
17 prayer. 
18  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I suppose 
19 if the federal courts decided to do that, we would 
20 probably try to defend them on establishment clause 
21 grounds. I don't think, though, that -- I think that 
22 would obviously be a much tougher case than the 
23 posting of the Ten Commandments in the outer hallway 
24 along with a variety of other documents which I take 
25 it to be the first case here. And then the final 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 display that the Court has before it is actually the 
2 Ten Commandments in the context of the other secular 
3 historical documents. And I think that kind of 
4 display clearly is constitutional for the reasons 
5 that the display was constitutional in the Lynch 
6 case. 
7  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think we have to 
8 amend the Lemon test to reach your approach? 
9  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, this 

10 Court on a variety of occasions has chosen to simply 
11 put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending 
12 it. 
13  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think, then, we 
14 have to either put it aside or amend it? 
15  MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't, Justice 
16 O'Connor. 
17  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: To decide this case? 
18  MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't. I think it 
19 would be prudent, as I suggested at the outset, to 
20 make not necessarily a full amendment and eliminate 
21 the first purpose prong of Lemon but at least in the 
22 acknowledgment context as in the accommodation 
23 context we're not going to focus on that. 
24  But independent of that, I think many of 
25 these Court's cases that were decided even under 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 Lemon acknowledge the principles that municipalities 
2 should be rewarded, not punished, nor trying to 
3 change their conduct to try to get things right. 
4  In Abbington against Schempp, which I 
5 think in many respects is a precursor to Lemon 
6 because it talked at least about the purpose and 
7 effects test and I gather that's about all that's 
8 left of Lemon. In that case, this Court held out the 
9 promise that it might be permissible for the 

10 government to have some use of the Bible in school. 
11  Now, when it did that, it didn't except 
12 out Abbington township and said, but not for you, 
13 Abbington township, because you violated the purpose 
14 prong. 
15  The Sixth Circuit here has adopted a rule 
16 that once mistaken, always condemned and we don't 
17 think that has any proper place in this Court's 
18 establishment of jurisprudence. 
19  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Clement. 
20  Mr. Friedman? 
21  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. FRIEDMAN 
22  ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 
23  MR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Stevens and may it 
24 please the Court, three times in the course of a 
25 year, McCreary and Pulaski county posted Ten 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 Commandments displays. They variously describe the 
2 Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code of 
3 Kentucky, the central historic legal document of the 
4 State and, finally, as the moral background of the 
5 Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our 
6 legal system. 
7  In the course of the litigation, they 
8 announced that under current law, they announced to 
9 the curt that uncurrent law, America is a Christian 

10 nation and they acknowledge that the purpose of their 
11 second display was to demonstrate America's Christian 
12 heritage. In this context, it is our position that 
13 the current courthouse display reveals both a purpose 
14 and an effect to endorse religion. 
15  This Court has repeatedly and most 
16 recently in the Santa Fe case made clear that it is 
17 necessary to look at the content, the context and the 
18 history of a display in order to gauge whether or not 
19 there is a true secular purpose or whether or not an 
20 asserted secular purpose is a sham. We submit here 
21 that on this record, the District Court and 
22 particularly in the context of an appeal from a 
23 preliminary injunction, which we have here, that the 
24 District Court had ample evidence from which it could 
25 conclude that the asserted secular purpose of 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 McCreary and Pulaski counties was indeed a sham. 
2  The counties announced their purpose not 
3 only in the content of the display itself but in the 
4 resolution that the counties enacted, the identical 
5 resolutions that the counties enacted within weeks 
6 after the filing of this lawsuit. And in that 
7 resolution, the counties make clear that they relied 
8 on and cited approvingly the Kentucky legislature's 
9 reference to Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics. 

10  They made clear that they supported the 
11 fight of Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore 
12 against the ACLU. They made absolutely clear in 
13 their legal papers that they deemed this to be a 
14 Christian nation under current law and they made 
15 clear that they absolutely intended and believed they 
16 had the right to display the Ten Commandments. They 
17 did so not in a display of history. They asserted 
18 and they intended to do so because of the religious 
19 nature of the Ten Commandments. There can be no 
20 doubt that the Ten Commandments portrays a religious 
21 point of view and is profoundly religious. 
22  The Court said so in Stone. There is no 
23 serious question about that. The question then here 
24 is whether or not the counties, in their current 
25 display, have done anything to sufficiently 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 neutralize the endorsing message that is contained in 
2 this record. And we submit it has not done so. 
3  It now announces that the Ten Commandments 
4 are the foundation of our legal system, not just that 
5 religion is but that the Ten Commandments, a 
6 particular religious code, the word of God, it 
7 asserts is the foundation of our legal system. It 
8 asserts that the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word 
9 of God, provides the moral background of the 

10 Declaration of Independence. We think it's clear 
11 that the content of the Ten Commandments and the 
12 content of the Declaration of Independence deal with 
13 substantially different topics. 
14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a county 
15 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the 
16 same display was put on and the recitation was -- and 
17 it was a sincere recitation, that the government 
18 simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments 
19 has played an important role in the civic lives of 
20 our people. 
21  Then you have -- they're each up for five 
22 years and five years later, some school kids wander 
23 by one and they wander by the other. In your view, 
24 from what you're telling me, the Commandments are 
25 permitted in one location and not the other? I mean, 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 that's the necessary purport of your argument. You 
2 may not think that either of them are valid but on 
3 this prong of the argument, it seems to me that to 
4 differentiate, I just don't understand that. 
5  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think to an extent there 
6 is a differentiation because this Court has made 
7 clear that any assessment must depend on context. 
8 There is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context 
9 one must both look at the purpose and the effect. In 

10 gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation 
11 history, the social facts, the content and any 
12 changes. 
13  Here the District Court had not only the 
14 display itself but it had the announced purpose of 
15 the county. It therefore was in a unique position to 
16 gauge the purpose of the -- the true purpose of these 
17 counties. 
18  Moreover, it was in a unique position to 
19 gauge the effects that the reasonable observer in 
20 these small rural Kentucky counties, the reasonable 
21 observer assessment of this particular display. And 
22 the Court -- McCreary County is a county with only 
23 17,000 people. Whitley City, the county seat, which 
24 is not even incorporated, has 1,100 people. 
25  The District Court from its chambers in 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 London, Kentucky was well situated to gauge whether 
2 or not the reasonable observer, knowing the 
3 litigation history of this case and knowing the 
4 changes in the forum and the context of this display, 
5 would perceive this to be a neutral recitation of 
6 history or simply the third in a series of efforts by 
7 this county government to post the Ten Commandments 
8 because that is what it wanted to post. 
9  JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean forever? 

10 What I'm thinking -- let me spell it out. The key 
11 words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten 
12 Commandments, because it would lead to, in the 
13 circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, 
14 perhaps, and obey. In other words, their reaction to 
15 it would likely be a religious reaction. 
16  Now, here if you saw it just by itself, 
17 perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the 
18 effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred 
19 character of the law, which is fine for religious 
20 people to do but not necessarily fine for the State 
21 to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to 
22 meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a 
23 religious way. If that's the problem, that would 
24 exist here only because of the history or most likely 
25 because of the history. And if that is the problem, 

31 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 that would dissipate over time because it is the 
2 smallness of the audience and their familiarity with 
3 the history that would likely produce the similar 
4 religious reaction to the display. 
5  Now, what's your reaction? 
6  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it's a question of 
7 degree and while over time the importance of the 
8 purpose may diminish, the purpose does not fully 
9 diminish and the effect does not change 

10 substantially. It is a question of degree, it is a 
11 question of line drawing. 
12  Here there is not an effort to incorporate 
13 the Ten Commandments into a neutral display or a 
14 neutral course of study such as a compare and 
15 contrast of ancient moral codes or a comparative 
16 religion course such as many of us have taken and 
17 schools clearly can offer. 
18  It is not a neutral display of law givers 
19 like the frieze in this Court. It asserts the 
20 primacy of the Ten Commandments. It says the Ten 
21 Commandments are the moral background of the 
22 Declaration of Independence. It doesn't say there is 
23 some commonality between the Ten Commandments and 
24 some American laws. It talks not only about law. It 
25 talks about our system of government. It says the 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God is the 
2 moral foundation of the Declaration of Independence. 
3 That in itself is an endorsement of religion in this 
4 context and I don't think that can dissipate over 
5 time. 
6  JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it? It may be 
7 true. These pilgrims came for religious reasons. If 
8 all you have is a display of the origin of the law in 
9 the United States, what would be wrong with saying, 

10 this is a historical account? It's like teaching 
11 religion in the schools. Of course it stemmed from 
12 the religious beliefs of those who came to the 
13 United States. You don't mean it religiously. You 
14 mean it historically. 
15  MR. FRIEDMAN: It's the difference between 
16 acknowledgment and endorsement. Of course counties 
17 and other governments can acknowledge the role that 
18 religion played in history. That is very different 
19 from acknowledging religion as a general matter and 
20 asserting that a specific code that is central to 
21 specific religions is the one -- not only the one 
22 religious source but the one source, religious or 
23 moral, that provide -- religious or secular that 
24 provides the moral background of the Declaration of 
25 Independence. 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care it stands 
2 for that. As you heard, the code takes various forms 
3 for various religions. And I think all it stands for 
4 is the proposition that the moral order is ordained 
5 by God. That's all it stands for. And to say that 
6 that's the basis of the Declaration of Independence 
7 and of our institutions is entirely realistic. 
8  MR. FRIEDMAN: What this display says --
9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they're 

10 really saying that the particular commandments of the 
11 Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of 
12 Independence. That's idiotic. What the commandments 
13 stand for is the direction of human affairs by God. 
14 That's what it stands for. 
15  MR. FRIEDMAN: Whatever the merit of that 
16 statement, that is not what these counties have said. 
17 What these counties have said in their resolutions is 
18 that the Ten Commandments are the precedent legal 
19 code of Kentucky and the central historic legal 
20 document of the state. 
21  What they have said in this display 
22 itself, in the explanation of the display, that they 
23 are the moral background of the Declaration of 
24 Independence, to the exclusion of all others, in 
25 effect. When you say the, it doesn't say one of. It 

34 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 says it is the foundation of our legal system. It 
2 doesn't say it had an influence on some of our laws. 
3 It asserts the primacy, the actual text of this 
4 display asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments. 
5  JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's what it means, 
6 it's idiotic. I don't think anybody is going to 
7 interpret it that way. You can't get the Declaration 
8 of Independence out of the Ten Commandments. 
9  MR. FRIEDMAN: I would agree with that, 

10 Your Honor. 
11  JUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't think that's 
12 how somebody would normally read it. I think what 
13 they're saying is the principle of laws being 
14 ordained by God is the foundation of the laws of this 
15 state and the foundation of our legal system. 
16  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How long is that 
17 resolution going to guide our view of the future 
18 displays or even the present one? What about the 
19 membership of the board of supervisors is changed? 
20 How long do we look to that particular resolution? 
21  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think, Your Honor, it's 
22 an element that the District Court in the first 
23 instance must accept and gauge in determining whether 
24 or not the announced secular purpose is indeed a true 
25 purpose or is a sham.

1  Where we're talking about a close time 
2 period, here three displays in less than a year by 
3 the same officials of the same county trying to post 
4 the same document, this case becomes very close to 
5 the Santa Fe independent school district case where 
6 it's a moving target in direct response to pending 
7 litigation as an effort to try to get the same end 
8 result and changing the operative facts just slightly 
9 in the hope that eventually it will be right. 

10  JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question 
11 on that point? And I should know the answer. It 
12 must be in the briefs but I don't remember. I assume 
13 that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 
14 of the display was put up, is that correct? 
15  MR. FRIEDMAN: That is not correct, Your 
16 Honor. The resolution was enacted in early December 
17 1999, a couple of weeks after the display. It has 
18 never been rescinded. 
19  JUSTICE SOUTER: It is still on the books? 
20  MR. FRIEDMAN: It is still on the books. 
21 A point is made in the reply brief, it is not a 
22 binding resolution, it encourages the county judge 
23 executive to post the Ten Commandments as part of a 
24 historic display. It doesn't say post a display of 
25 documents and have a county judge choose to post the 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 Ten Commandments. 
2  The initial paragraph of the resolution 
3 makes clear that it encourages the county judge to 
4 post the Ten Commandments and then as part of a 
5 historic display. The county judge did that. The 
6 District Court enjoined that display. The county 
7 appealed that injunction and then, after getting new 
8 lawyers, dropped its appeal. 
9  Soon after that, the county posted a third 

10 display, again, the Ten Commandments with what it 
11 called historic documents, leaving aside how the 
12 Stars Spangled Banner or the national motto as a 
13 historic document. 
14  What it did is wrap the Ten Commandments 
15 in the three or four secular documents that we all 
16 clearly acknowledge as the root of the American 
17 system of government. It did so pursuant to the same 
18 resolution. There has never been another resolution, 
19 it has not been rescinded. The resolution is there. 
20 It cites Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics, it 
21 cites legislative allusions to Jesus Christ. 
22  I think the resolution, which is cited in 
23 the joint appendix of the docket number, makes it 
24 clear that the purpose of this county was to post the 
25 Ten Commandments and to do so because of the 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 religious nature of the Ten Commandments because of 
2 the primacy in its view of the Ten Commandments. 
3 That's what it focused on. That's what this 
4 litigation history has revealed throughout and that's 
5 what the District Court found at least at the 
6 preliminary injunction stage, which is where we still 
7 are. 
8  There has been no evidence taken in the 
9 case, no discovery taken in the case to suggest 

10 anything other than what the District Court found. 
11 And on this record, I submit that there can be no 
12 conclusion other than that the purpose of the county 
13 in posting the series of displays was to post the Ten 
14 Commandments because of their religious nature and 
15 the effect on the reasonable observer who knew what 
16 was going on, who was there to see what was 
17 transpiring in this small county was clear to the 
18 District Court. 
19  The District Court doesn't operate in a 
20 vacuum. And this Court has made clear that courts 
21 cannot turn a blind eye to a sham secular purpose. 
22 The District Court not only saw the displays, heard 
23 the arguments of counsel, saw the resolutions of the 
24 District Court, of the fiscal Court. The fiscal 
25 Court is the legislative branch of government in

1 Kentucky. The District Court also was there in the 
2 community and could see both the public reaction, the 
3 letters to the editor, the keep the Ten Commandments 
4 signs on yards throughout the county. 
5  JUSTICE STEVENS: Is all of that in the 
6 record? 
7  MR. FRIEDMAN: That is not in the record. 
8  JUSTICE STEVENS: Then I don't think we 
9 should talk about it. 

10  MR. FRIEDMAN: The District Court was well 
11 situated to understand the social fact, historical 
12 record and arguments of both the lawyers and the 
13 parties and the statements of the parties. 
14  JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Friedman, can you 
15 tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution 
16 appears? 
17  MR. FRIEDMAN: Joint Appendix page 1, 
18 number 5, and it's Exhibit 1 attached to it. And 
19 that's the one of the counties. 
20  The other one is -- and these are the 
21 docket entries. The document itself is not in the 
22 joint appendix. And the other county is joint 
23 appendix page 28, number 6. They're both Exhibit 1s 
24 attached to those documents. Those documents are the 
25 county's motions to dismiss in the District Court.

1  JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not printed? 
2  MR. FRIEDMAN: It is not in the appendix 
3 itself, no. The resolution is not in there. The 
4 citation to it from the index is there. 
5  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It is in the record 
6 which we have? 
7  MR. FRIEDMAN: It is in the record. It 
8 was submitted in fact by the petitioners in this 
9 case. They submitted the resolution in support of 

10 their arguments defending the second display, the 
11 display that surrounded the Ten Commandments with the 
12 religious text. They made clear in that brief that 
13 they were asserting their right to display the Ten 
14 Commandments as part of their argument that the 
15 purpose was to demonstrate America's Christian 
16 heritage. 
17  I submit that in that brief, in that 
18 resolution, in the repeated statements of the county 
19 officials and of their counsel, the District Court 
20 was well within its discretion to determine that the 
21 purpose here was religious, was not secular and that 
22 the effect, as viewed by the reasonable observer, was 
23 religious -- was to endorse religion, not secular. 
24  If there are additional questions, I would 
25 be happy to answer it.

1  JUSTICE STEVENS: The other question I 
2 have is assuming you didn't have any of this history 
3 and they started off with plan 3, would that have 
4 violated the establishment clause? 
5  MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, Your Honor, I think it 
6 would. It would be a closer question but in this 
7 context, what we have is the assertion that the Ten 
8 Commandments are the source, the moral background of 
9 the Declaration of Independence, the foundation of 

10 our legal system. It is not incorporating the Ten 
11 Commandments as part of a neutral course of study. 
12 It is not like having Moses along with 15 other or 15 
13 law givers. It is the assertion of the primacy of 
14 the Ten Commandments. 
15  JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand the 
16 difference. I mean it seems to me it would violate 
17 the establishment clause, it would equally do so if 
18 you said it's a major part of or even a part of. 
19  Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's 
20 the exclusive one. It may make it more wrong but 
21 we're not grading papers here. It seems to me that 
22 whether it violates the establishment clause depends 
23 upon whether you're endorsing -- whether you're 
24 proselytizing religion. 
25  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think that's correct, 

41

1 Your Honor. 
2  JUSTICE STEVENS: What does primacy have 
3 to do with it? 
4  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it makes it an 
5 easier case when it asserts this is the one rather 
6 than one of several or one of many. 
7  JUSTICE STEVENS: But your real position 
8 is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as 
9 they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that 

10 would be enough? 
11  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it depends on the 
12 content and context of the display. 
13  JUSTICE STEVENS: Exactly what we've got 
14 in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have 
15 the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying 
16 it's the sole source of the primacy. They say it's a 
17 source. 
18  Does that still violate the establishment 
19 clause? 
20  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it does, Your 
21 Honor. 
22  JUSTICE BREYER: Since you have a minute, 
23 give me your opinion to the right standard if 
24 hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp 
25 idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden 

42

1 by the establishment clause to recognize the 
2 religious nature of the people nor the religious 
3 origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy 
4 to go too far and it's easy in this area you are 
5 trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you 
6 hoped and really end up with something worse than if 
7 you stayed out in the first place. In other words, 
8 it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to 
9 offend people. 

10  Now, suppose you start with that. You're 
11 trying to define what is too far constitutionally 
12 speaking. What's your test? Of the many that have 
13 been in our opinions, which do you think works the 
14 best for that purpose or some other? 
15  MR. FRIEDMAN: I think the Court's 
16 endorsement test has stood the test of time and has 
17 worked well. It allows the District Courts that are 
18 most familiar with what is actually happening to look 
19 at both the purpose and the effect of a particular 
20 display. I don't think there can be an ironclad 
21 rule. There can be presumptions. There can be 
22 brighter line tests perhaps. But I think 
23 ultimately --
24  JUSTICE GINSBERG: Within reason outline 
25 an approach that would say a religious display is 

43

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 presumptively for -- is a presumptive endorsement. I 
2 think with the Baptist brief. Would you endorse that 
3 test? 
4  MR. FRIEDMAN: We think that test can work 
5 very well in a context like this where we're talking 
6 about the display of religious texts rather than just 
7 symbols. And the point I think is well worth 
8 considering, that we assume that when people post 
9 signs or displays, bumper stickers, buttons, that 

10 they endorse the content of that text and that the 
11 presumption then would place a burden on government 
12 to make sure that it is neutralizing the endorsing 
13 effect of displaying text. I think that is a very 
14 workable text in a context like this where we're 
15 talking about the posting of core religious texts. 
16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you explain why you 
17 distinguish text and symbolize them? You distinguish 
18 text from the crucifix and so on. Why? 
19  MR. FRIEDMAN: It does depend entirely on 
20 context, to be sure, but symbols are subject to 
21 alternative interpretation. Text is not. Or text 
22 rarely is. And text such as this, religious text, 
23 cannot be seen as anything other than the revealed 
24 Word of God. I mean, here we have 120 words in the 
25 first four Commandments, 142 in the first five 

44

1 Commandments of this display that is a profound, 
2 detailed explication of core religious content, core 
3 religious meaning. 
4  JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand the text 
5 part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols? 
6 For example, why not adopt it for the Moses? The 
7 burden would be on the government to show that it was 
8 not approving, endorsing, et cetera, and in this 
9 context, that would be pretty easy. Why not have the 

10 same test? 
11  MR. FRIEDMAN: There is no reason why it 
12 couldn't be applied just as well. My point was 
13 simply that it's even easier to do it when there is 
14 text. The Court doesn't need to go so far as to 
15 decide whether to apply it to both text and symbol, 
16 though it certainly could. 
17  It need only go so far as say when 
18 government posts religious texts, it must be presumed 
19 to endorse the content of that text. It's a little 
20 more difficult when you're talking about symbols, 
21 depending on what the symbols are. Some symbols are 
22 far more sectarian such as the Cross, such as the 
23 Star of David, than other symbols. At least when 
24 there is text involved, one presumes that the display 
25 of text is an endorsement of the content of that text 

45

1 unless the content and the context make clear that it 
2 is neutralizing. 
3  The examples are obvious. The display of 
4 religious art in a government owned art museum, the 
5 playing of religious music by a government symphony 
6 orchestra, the context of the orchestra, the context 
7 of the museum are sufficient to neutralize the 
8 religious message that is contained in the display 
9 itself. 

10  Here -- and the same thing I think would 
11 be said of a comparative religion course or a compare 
12 and contrast ancient moral code course. There there 
13 is not an endorsement of a particular code, a 
14 particular text but rather a neutral educational 
15 display about several alternative ones. 
16  That is different from taking one 
17 religious code, one revealed Word of God, placing it 
18 next to the revered documents that frame the American 
19 Republic and saying, these are all alike, these are 
20 worthy of equal reverence. That is simply wrapping 
21 the Ten Commandments in the flag and, with all due 
22 respect, that constitutes endorsement. 
23  Thank you. 
24  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Friedman. 
25  Mr. Staver, you have about three minutes

2  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. STAVER 
3  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
4  MR. STAVER: Justice Stevens, the argument 
5 before this Court was unlike anything that went down 
6 in the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals 
7 because never was a resolution ever mentioned. Never 
8 did the District Court or the Sixth Circuit ever 
9 discuss the resolution. It was not mentioned in this 

10 Court until this answer brief by respondents was 
11 filed. It is not part of the District Court's 
12 decision, it was not part of the Circuit Court of 
13 Appeals. The District Court said that what imprinted 
14 every action thereafter with defiance in a taint is 
15 the mere posting of the first display. There was no 
16 resolution for that display, none is needed. There 
17 is no resolution for the foundations display. 
18  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there a resolution, 
19 Counsel? 
20  MR. STAVER: For the second display, yes, 
21 Your Honor, there was. 
22  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And whatever is in the 
23 record is that resolution? 
24  MR. STAVER: It is that resolution but it 
25 is specific to the second display because it 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 specifically mentions what kind of documents are in 
2 that display. It is not a general display regarding 
3 posting of documents. 
4  In this case, when of the Court --
5  JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it correct that 
6 it was not amended when the third display was 
7 created? 
8  MR. STAVER: It was not amended because it 
9 was not -- it was relevant and fact-specific in the 

10 display itself. 
11  JUSTICE STEVENS: It is the last 
12 expression of the governing body's intent? 
13  MR. STAVER: No, Your Honor. What's the 
14 last expression is the foundations display which 
15 clearly a reasonable observer would see. And if 
16 there is any doubt regarding --
17  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there hasn't been a 
18 new resolution. 
19  MR. STAVER: There is not a new 
20 resolution. 
21  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And that one wasn't 
22 rescinded? 
23  MR. STAVER: That one died, Your Honor, 
24 with the Court's ruling. 
25  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It was adopted and it 

48 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 still is there, presumably? 
2  MR. STAVER: Presumably. There is nothing 
3 in the record that suggests what happened to it. 
4 Whether it was repealed or not. But it was specific 
5 factually only to that second display, not to the 
6 foundations display which the District Court found 
7 was fundamentally different. And if there is any 
8 doubt regarding the history of purpose, we would 
9 suggest, Justice O'Connor, your suggestion in the 

10 Wallace, that if there is any doubt regarding 
11 purpose, to look to the effects prong. And I think 
12 when you look to the effects prong, a reasonable 
13 observer will see that this is a constitutional 
14 display. 
15  This case is one in which the Sixth 
16 Circuit drew the most difficult hate, it imposed it 
17 in a subsequent action in the most difficult area of 
18 the establishment clause and clearly the public 
19 officials have substantially and fundamentally 
20 changed. They can't live under this taint forever. 
21 They tried but they could to correct their way. They 
22 tried what they could to display this in a 
23 constitutional manner so that anyone passing by would 
24 see this as one document among many others. In 
25 addition to the display itself, with all the other 

49 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 



1 hundreds of documents that are on the wall, this 

3  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So presumably these 

6  MR. STAVER: Yes, the preliminary 

2 display has a specific stated purpose. 

4 things are open if it goes on to the final hearing? 
5 The preliminary injunction stage? 

7 injunction. And the fact that the resolution is 
8 technically latent on the books, they are will repeal 
9 that, they repudiate that resolution. 

10  Thank you.

11  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. The case is 

12 submitted. 

13  CLERK OF Court: The honorable Court is 

14 now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.
