 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 07-1315, Knowles v. 

Mirzayance.

 Mr. Mercer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MERCER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Under the deferential review required by the 

ADPA, Mr. Mirzayance was not entitled to Federal habeas 

corpus relief on his ineffective counsel claim because 

the State court adjudication of that claim was not 

contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the 

clearly established Strickland test. And because the 

Strickland rule is a general one, the California Supreme 

Court had wide latitude in resolving that claim.

 In this case, the Ninth Circuit applied 

something different from Strickland, finding that Wager 

was duty-bound to present a State law affirmative 

defense because no other defenses were said to be 

available at that time and because it merely might have 

worked. But even the Ninth Circuit conceded that this 

Court has never announced such a test. And as in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: At some point during the 

oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it 

is the beginning inquiry: When there is an evidentiary 

hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals 

differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?

 MR. MERCER: Well, I think it depends on 

whether the Federal habeas court is doing a section 

2254(d) analysis. The fact is that section 2254(d), for 

example, doesn't speak to denying a claim on the merits, 

even if it's unexhausted. So, in theory, a Federal 

habeas court could perhaps accept new evidence that the 

State court never had before it in order to deny relief. 

But we cannot envision a situation where it would ever 

be efficacious to hold a hearing in light of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it --

MR. MERCER: -- a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me put it this way: 

We're the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, let's 

assume. What effect do we give to what the district 

court did, and how would that -- how would the case be 

different than if we were simply reviewing the same 

situation and it came from the State court? What's the 

difference?

 MR. MERCER: Well, there shouldn't be a 

difference.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We just pretend the 

hearing didn't happen?

 MR. MERCER: Well, I would say that in 

virtually every case it, in fact, is a meaningless 

distraction from what the State court did based on the 

record presented it, and here's why. Because if the 

State court made a reasonable adjudication of the merits 

of the claim based on the State court record, then even 

holding a hearing wouldn't make any difference because 

relief would still be precluded under 2254(d).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we look to the Federal 

court evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to 

determine whether what the State court did was 

reasonable? And you -- and you have -- you have thought 

about this, and obviously the problem is, since the 

California appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this 

is an artificial exercise, and you know the problem.

 MR. MERCER: Well, I think, again, the only 

question that matters is the 2254(d) question that says 

that relief shall not be granted unless that State court 

adjudication based on the State court record presented 

was unreasonable, and here is why.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess it could be 

-- it could be if we have an opinion that makes it clear 

that you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in --

in certain cases. And if the State court did not grant 

an evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that 

was contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't 

you?

 MR. MERCER: Perhaps, and -- and under 

extremely rare cases that may --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But unless -- unless there 

is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an 

evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an 

evidentiary hearing could show that the State court 

decision, which was legitimately held without an 

evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions. I 

don't see how you can do that.

 MR. MERCER: Well, I agree, Justice Scalia, 

and this Court said in Holland v. Jackson that the 

pertinent question is what the State court had in front 

of it. And the reason here is simple: That it is 

unfair to find that the State courts made an 

unreasonable application of law based on facts that they 

didn't have. So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did at any point -- did 

the State at any point challenge the correctness, the 

propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?

 MR. MERCER: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Mr. 

Mirzayance raised --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if so, is that before 

us?

 MR. MERCER: I don't think so. We -- we 

disagreed that there should have been an evidentiary 

hearing in the first place, and we argued that below. 

It's our position that there should not have been an 

evidentiary hearing in the first place.

 It's our position that, frankly, this was a 

straightforward, routine Strickland case that was 

uncomplicated, properly adjudicated by the district 

court when they first reached it in 2001 without a 

hearing, and that the Ninth Circuit has come at this 

matter with a -- a chestful of monkey wrenches in the 

sense that they should not have ordered the evidentiary 

hearing in the first place, and then when they did, they 

should not have disregarded the very factfinding that 

they ordered be done.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- so then -- so then 

we do look at the facts. I don't want to take up your 

or the Court's time on this any more, but I remain 

puzzled, I have to tell you, about what to do with this 

hearing. I went through it at great length. It's very 

careful factfinding, really.

 MR. MERCER: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I just don't know

how to fit that with the standard when I look at the --

the reasonableness of the -- of the State court 

decision.

 MR. MERCER: Well, I don't think it changed 

the standard because 2254 simply requires an 

adjudication on the merits, and we have that here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would you -- would 

you agree just as a general rule that unless we find --

unless there is some rule under which we can conclude 

that the State court should have held a hearing, that 

there is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary 

hearing?

 MR. MERCER: Yes, I would agree with that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be the general 

proposition.

 MR. MERCER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. MERCER: And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that -- would 

that principle have to be clearly established by one of 

our decisions?

 MR. MERCER: I think that question is 

unclear, Mr. Chief Justice, because this Court did 

recently say in Landrigan that the decision to hold an 

evidentiary hearing remains within the sound discretion

of the district court, but in the same sentence said 

that that discretion was circumscribed by the ADPA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why should we hold a 

hearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical 

situation that Justice Souter mentioned? Why shouldn't 

we just reverse the State courts for not having held an 

evidentiary hearing? Remand it to them, let them hold 

it, and let -- let them make the factual determination 

on the basis of that, after which we would -- we would 

apply the rather strict 2254 standard to -- to the 

result of that hearing?

 MR. MERCER: Well, if a petitioner or a 

State prisoner was somehow precluded from developing 

facts in the State court and should have had an 

evidentiary hearing under this Court's clearly 

established law, then that would be the correct 

solution.

 Here, however, we have a fully developed 

State court record.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand that. So 

your -- your answer to Justice Souter would -- would not 

be that -- that you can conduct a hearing if the State 

should have conducted a hearing? What you should do if 

the State should have conducted a hearing is send it 

back for the hearing.

MR. MERCER: That is correct. The point 

here under the ADPA -- and I think it is Congress's 

clear intent -- is that all of these claims are to be 

funneled through the State courts first. And Congress 

has entrusted the State courts to be the primary and 

first interpreters and enforcers of Federal 

constitutional law for State prisoners' claims. And as 

this Court has said many times, including in Sawyer v. 

Smith, they're co-equals to the Federal courts in doing 

so.

 So what should have happened in this case we 

contend is what the district court first did when 

confronted with the claim in 2001. And that is you 

assess the facts and claims as presented to the State 

court and then decide whether it would be reasonable to 

reject the claim under either prong of Strickland. And 

as this Court said in Strickland itself, the easiest and 

most direct way to answer that question is through the 

prejudice prong here.

 We have to remember the reality of this case 

that for an affirmative defense of insanity, or NGI 

under California law, Attorney Wager bore the burden of 

proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his 

client did not know the difference between right and 

wrong when he committed this crime.

And every bit of Mirzayance's own deeds and 

words show that he did. Before the killing itself, he 

closed the curtains and waited until he was alone with 

the victim before entering her room with a gun in his 

pocket and the silent weapon drawn. He struck with the 

silent weapon, delivering fatal blows, resorting to the 

gun only when she screamed and struggled, and then 

immediately collected the shell casings, turned off the 

lights, collected the knife, went back to his apartment 

where he showered, disposed of the bloody clothes, 

concocted a false alibi message on the machine -- excuse 

me -- and then, overcome with guilt at the wrongfulness 

of his conduct, he calls his friend and says: "I messed 

up big-time." And that's at page 120 of the State 

reporter's transcript.

 And then, further acknowledging both the 

legal and moral wrongfulness of his actions, he turns 

himself in to the police. He says: "I did a murder." 

When they asked him how he felt about it, he said: "I 

felt very guilty, very bad for what I've done. That's 

why I turned myself in."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Was -- was -- is all of 

this factual material in the -- in the documents 

submitted with the habeas, with the State habeas and the 

response to the State habeas?

MR. MERCER: All of this was in the State 

trial transcript, so, yes, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what did they do? 

Did they submit the trial transcript with the -- in --

with the response to the habeas petition at the State? 

In other words, how did it get in front of the State 

court, is all I want to know.

 MR. MERCER: It was a direct appeal to the 

California Court of Appeals with a concurrently filed 

habeas petition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Ah, okay.

 MR. MERCER: Yes, okay.

 So he was faced with that. And then on the 

flip side, there was not a shred of evidence that Mr. 

Mirzayance ever thought that doing what he did was 

legally or morally right. So given all that, given the 

extensive effort to cover his tracks and his own 

admissions about the wrongfulness of his conduct, it was 

not reasonably probable under Strickland for this jury 

to believe that he somehow did not know.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about getting another 

jury? That was -- one of the reasons that counsel gave 

why he, counsel, was withdrawing the NGI plea was the 

jury had just found -- rejected the second-degree murder 

charge and found that he had acted deliberately with

premeditation. But couldn't -- because the first jury 

had -- in the guilt phase, couldn't the attorney have 

requested a brand new jury to hear the NGI plea?

 MR. MERCER: Mr. Wager did not believe that 

he had grounds to do so in this case. And the district 

court first addressed that opinion at the petition 

appendix H in a footnote -- I believe it was footnote 

21, but I don't have that in front of me right now --

where the district court talked about the standards for 

getting a new jury and that under Penal Code, California 

Penal Code 1026, you had to show some cause to the trial 

court why this jury could not fairly address the claim. 

Wager felt that he had no basis to do that at this time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mercer -- Mr. Mercer, I 

guess we could resolve the case by saying if there was 

any error it was harmless, but we didn't take the case 

for that. That wouldn't be very helpful to the bar, 

would it? I mean, I thought that the important issue 

here is -- is the one you've been discussing, whether --

whether, in fact, you're bound to stick with the facts 

that were -- were adjudicated by the State.

 MR. MERCER: I agree with you, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So let's not do that, then. 

Let's -- let's decide something.

MR. MERCER: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Good.

 MR. MERCER: Well, I'm confident that, you 

know, as this Court addressed in Strickland itself, the 

claim fails for lack of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if the 

Profitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth 

Circuit case, applies in the Ninth, Ninth Circuit, and I 

would think it would, just as the magistrate judge 

thought that it would, then that would be -- present a 

very close case and it would probably require reversal 

of the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt 

rule applied? What is it, the "all or" -- not "all or 

nothing" --

MR. MERCER: "Nothing to lose."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: "Nothing to lose."

 MR. MERCER: Well, if -- we agree that 

nothing to lose, in fact, was what happened here, as in 

Profitt. The dissent recognized it, the District Court 

recognized it, and I think you're right that this case 

smacks of application of something like a "nothing to 

lose" type rule. And perhaps it's announced in Profitt, 

but it surely has not been clearly established by this 

Court in any decision, and that pre-AEDPA Profitt 

decision from the Fifth Circuit certainly did not compel

the California court or any other State court to apply a 

"nothing to lose" rule on Strickland performance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that --

the fundamental question is what level of generality you 

look to determine what law has been clearly established? 

Certainly Strickland is clearly established.

 MR. MERCER: Certainly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But as far as I can 

tell, the "nothing to lose" issue has not been addressed 

by us and is not clearly established. So why do we look 

at it at the latter level of generality as opposed to 

the former?

 MR. MERCER: Well, certainly this Court 

could indeed take a more narrow view of what is clearly 

established law. We agree that Strickland here covers 

the vast majority of ineffectiveness cases. But 

certainly, this Court has never squarely addressed such 

an issue before, and certainly, this Court has never 

announced that test to bind the States to resolve this 

claim.

 I think that the fallback position is, 

absent a clear answer from this Court, as stated in Van 

Patten, absent a clear answer, the State courts are left 

with a very general Strickland principle, and as this 

Court stated in Yarborough v. Alvarado, the more general

the rule, the more leeway the States have in deciding 

cases on a case-by-case basis.

 So certainly we feel that Wager's decision 

was patently reasonable under a traditional Strickland 

analysis. We're not asking for anything different. 

Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think -- I 

guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the 

"nothing to lose" question or we don't have to. It's 

the only -- the way we have to decide the case is to 

determine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on 

the "nothing to lose" question was clearly established 

by one of our cases.

 MR. MERCER: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. And I think this comes back to our original 

point, that the only dispositive question here that 

really matters is where -- when the State court 

adjudicates --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this 

question. Supposing we were convinced, and I'm not 

suggesting we should be on the record, but supposing we 

were convinced that only the dumbest, untrained lawyer 

in the world could have failed to advance this defense, 

and that therefore I would have no doubt about it as an 

original proposition that he was incompetent under

Strickland -- under the general Strickland standard. 

Would we be permitted to say that in the case, or would 

we have to say, well, this particular kind of attorney 

error has never been addressed before, and therefore, we 

can't look at it?

 MR. MERCER: Well, I think that because this 

Court has never even addressed conduct anything like 

this by an attorney --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that 

there's a whole host of counsel errors that could 

violate Strickland? But do you have to find one that we 

have addressed before before a Federal court can apply 

and say Strickland was violated?

 MR. MERCER: I don't think you need one on 

all fours, exact fact patterns. That would be 

unworkable. What you do need to do is give the courts a 

clear answer to the question, and generally --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be -- wouldn't it 

be a clear answer in this case to say this was a 

terrible lawyer, and therefore Strickland -- Strickland 

applies? Or could you say, we don't care how bad the 

lawyer was, Strickland -- we haven't adjudicated this 

precise set of facts before, so that's the end of the 

ball game?

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that what you're asking 

us to do?

 MR. MERCER: We're not asking you to say 

that a decision like this could never be unreasonable.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.

 MR. MERCER: Okay? We're asking that this 

Court continue its Strickland jurisprudence that says 

the Constitution makes one general requirement and, as 

stated in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, that requirement is that 

counsel make reasonable choices.

 So certainly, there could be a situation 

where counsel flipped a coin or made an arbitrary 

decision or made an unreasonable decision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it, then -- if we 

say that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we 

then remand or do we say on this record clearly it was 

reasonable? Obviously you want us to do the latter, I 

take it?

 MR. MERCER: Well, I don't frankly think 

this case necessarily should be remanded back to the 

Ninth Circuit. They've had it three times already. But 

I think that the writ needs to be denied under a 

traditional Strickland analysis, and --

don't we have to say that this was reasonable?

 MR. MERCER: No. I think what this Court 

simply needs to say is that it was not objectively 

unreasonable --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course.

 MR. MERCER: -- for the California courts to 

come out the other way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

why you keep talking about Strickland. We sent this 

case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration 

in light of Carey v. Musladin. In that case we said 

that the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the 

lack of holdings from this Court regarding the 

potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom 

conduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a 

much narrower focus on the level of generality than 

Strickland.

 I would have thought you would have said --

maybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a 

precedent from this Court rejecting the "nothing to 

lose" case, that that should be the end of it.

 MR. MERCER: Well, I did not make such an 

aggressive argument to this Court that a decision like 

this could never be unreasonable, but certainly there is 

no case from this Court that has announced such a

standard. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The issue is 

not whether it's unreasonable or not. The issue is 

whether it's an unreasonable application of -- of 

clearly established Supreme Court law.

 MR. MERCER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Reasonableness or 

unreasonableness is out of the question. You -- you 

first just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is 

it conceivably an unreasonable application of that. And 

the -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't 

decided the question of whether this is reasonable or 

unreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an 

unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's his argument, not 

the one you've been making.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. That seems 

to me --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You say the standard is 

Strickland.

 MR. MERCER: Well, what I say is that this 

Court has held that Strickland generally applies to 

almost all ineffective counsel cases. And certainly 

this Court has stated it applies in specific type issues 

of conduct. For example, counsel has a duty to conduct

a reasonable investigation; counsel has a duty to 

consult his client about filing an appeal. But Justice 

Scalia is absolutely right, this Court has never said 

anything remotely like the rule applied by the Ninth 

Circuit here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they didn't. But 

what we're going to discover, I suspect, when we 

actually dig into this record, which is pretty 

extensive, are two things. The first is the California 

Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the 

particular issue in front of us. They talked about a 

due process issue at the end of their paragraph, they 

have talked about things that are close to it, but they 

nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question 

of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel 

for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity 

defense. That's going to be our first problem.

 Then I looked to see, I got the record out 

to see, if he raised it, and he didn't. So we have the 

fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have 

the fact that of course the Supreme Court of California 

says just one word, "Denied."

 Then when we discover round two in the Ninth 

Circuit, we are going to discover some language which 

says: We are not relying on this rule, there is no such

rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last 

resort. Here's what they say. Instead of that we say, 

forget about that, we were wrong the first time, we 

assume. "Where the State court has provided an 

adjudication on the merits, that is, it did say denied, 

but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held 

an evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review 

of the record to determine the State court's final 

resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or 

unreasonable."

 So they say: We did conduct that record 

independent review. And our conclusion is that it was 

unreasonable, okay? Nothing to do with any special rule 

here or anything. We just think it was unreasonable.

 All right; now, what are we supposed to do 

with this?

 MR. MERCER: I think this Court needs to 

give full deference to the adjudication of the State 

courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is that deference 

going to be? I take it what it would be is that the 

person, the defendant, would have in his petition --

which we don't actually have -- would have said the 

facts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing, 

they would have to take those facts as being thus and

so.

 MR. MERCER: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And then we would have to 

say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they 

might have taken them most favorable to the defendant. 

Is that what we're supposed to do? Is it unreasonable 

of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of 

reading these facts as most possible favorable for the 

defendant? Is that what we should do?

 MR. MERCER: Correct, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. MERCER: And that's the situation and 

the circumstance outlined by the California Supreme 

Court in People v. Duvall, and it's a case and a 

procedure designed for judicial economy --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then we have to reach this 

hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the 

hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it 

for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the 

reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of 

the facts on the record before it.

 MR. MERCER: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So we have to reach a huge 

number of issues which we've never decided.

issue is not really properly before this Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then how are we 

supposed to do it? That's why I raised it.

 MR. MERCER: Based on the State court 

adjudication, a straightforward analysis under 2254(d) 

of the California Supreme Court's legal resolution of 

this claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We should treat the 

district court proceeding as though it had never 

happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never 

should have remanded it to the district court, and we 

just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the 

State supreme court in the district court. And then the 

district court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just 

applies the standard. So that the whole thing about 

clearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that 

should be out of the case.

 MR. MERCER: That is our primary contention, 

yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then if we get to that 

point, I think your argument is as follows. I'm not 

sure. I want you to tell me.

 If the State court adjudication was -- was 

contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might 

be the "total fool" rule, in other words no one but a

complete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press 

forward with this defense, then we can decide the case 

simply under Strickland, because Strickland 

unreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total 

fool case.

 But if we have something less egregious than 

the total fool case, then we've got to look for more 

precise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us 

into the Musladin or Musladin rule.

 MR. MERCER: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if we get to the 

Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any 

determination from this Court, any clearly established 

law from this Court, that would indicate that the State 

court's adjudication or determination was unreasonable 

here.

 MR. MERCER: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that your road map?

 MR. MERCER: Yes, it is.

 And if there are no further questions, I 

would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

MR. SEVILLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to begin by addressing the 

so-called "nothing to lose" rule, which is a fiction 

attributed to Profitt v. Waldron, which -- it does not 

say that in Profitt v. Waldron. It's a fiction 

attributed to the Ninth Circuit, because the Ninth 

Circuit not only did not say that; they rejected the 

idea that they were relying on a "nothing to lose" rule. 

The Ninth Circuit applied -- well, I might also add that 

in a case called Lowery v. Lewis, which is cited at the 

Petitioner's appendix for cert 94, the Ninth Circuit 

specifically and in no uncertain terms said it rejected 

a "nothing to lose" rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you reject it as 

well, I take it --

MR. SEVILLA: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS -- and concede it is 

an improper -- it is not a basis for ineffective 

assistance that somebody did not pursue a "nothing to 

lose" case argument?

 MR. SEVILLA: It -- essentially, because 

it's an irrelevant concern because the decision has to 

be made on whether counsel's decision, as he faced the 

trial facts, was objectively reasonable.

Now, in that calculus if there is nothing to 

lose by going forward, if there is a great benefit to 

achieve by going forward, if he's got a credible 

defense, as it was determined by the district court at 

the evidentiary hearing on insanity, then it's 

objectively unreasonable on the morning of trial on the 

way to court, to, out of a sense of despair or 

hopelessness, subjectively speaking, to decide that: 

I'm going to jettison this defense that's been prepared 

over the year. There was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I -- I don't 

under -- I didn't follow that answer. You're saying if 

he does have nothing to lose, it is objectively 

unreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?

 MR. SEVILLA: I'm saying that's one of the 

factors. I'm not saying that's the sole factor, 

because, as the case that I cited, Lowery, there was a 

motion to suppress which attorneys were making in this 

case. They all lost, and his -- the client in that case 

argued, well, there was nothing to lose in presenting 

this motion to suppress, and the Ninth Circuit said: 

That's not the rule; it's under the circumstances 

whether the performance is objectively unreasonable, so 

we need to take into consideration the compete --

competing factors.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to look 

at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess, 

and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in 

light of Strickland filtered through Yarborough?

 MR. SEVILLA: Correct. And in -- in that 

regard, the State has argued --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that precisely what we 

have to decide? Or wouldn't it be whether it would be 

unreasonable for the State court not to come to that 

conclusion, which is one step removed?

 MR. SEVILLA: It would be one step removed 

were it not for the fact that there was an evidentiary 

hearing which resolved facts that should have been 

resolved in the State court. Appellant filed a separate 

petition in the court of appeal in California, filed the 

same petition in the California Supreme Court, asked --

first argued up front that this was unreasonable 

performance under Strickland, and then said if the court 

disagrees, then it ought to be remanded to a referee for 

fact development.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the usual test 

that the State court has to be affirmed unless it's 

unreasonable application of Supreme Court law is altered 

when the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing 

that the Federal habeas court believes should have been

 MR. SEVILLA: And holds it. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you get that out of 

the statute? I don't understand it; it makes no --

MR. SEVILLA: Well, there's a hole in the 

statute, there's no question about it, under 2254(d)(1).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. SEVILLA: When you have the -- the 

statute requiring the application of, or nonapplication 

of law contrary to the United States Supreme Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. SEVILLA: -- or an unreasonable 

application thereof, what happens when that issue really 

cannot be decided without an evidentiary hearing under 

Strickland?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying --

the need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand 

it, was raised by you in the following way. You said to 

the California Supreme Court: There is on the face of 

the papers filed here a violation of Strickland and a --

or a misapplication of Strickland in -- in the way the 

California trial court came out; but if you do not find 

a facial violation of Strickland based on these papers, 

then you should remand for an evidentiary hearing. And 

it doesn't seem to me that that follows at all.

If there's no Strickland error, that seems 

to me a -- a -- an odd premise to say you ought to 

remand for a hearing. Aren't you under an obligation to 

specify factual issues that -- specifically that need to 

be developed, before you would make out a case for 

saying they were in error in not holding the evidentiary 

hearing?

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, we argued that because 

Mr. Wager, defense counsel, presented a declaration 

which was contradicted by other declarations as to the 

reason he gave up this defense, we argued it was 

objectively unreasonable if the court -- the State court 

took all of the intendants in favor of our declaration 

and Mr. Wager did not really address the reasons for 

giving up the defense, he just said, I felt it was 

hopeless.

 It took the evidentiary hearing to determine 

why he felt it was hopeless. So we argued that on the 

face of it it is Strickland error. If the court 

disagrees, then we're entitled to an evidentiary hearing 

to determine --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that you 

specified the evidentiary issues that you wanted to 

develop?

 MR. SEVILLA: What we specified is why his

rationale was unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, with that, I'm just 

asking you --

MR. SEVILLA: And we --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you -- I'm 

throwing you a softball.

 MR. SEVILLA: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying that that 

was, in effect, an adequate way to tell the California 

Supreme Court that these are the issues that we want to 

develop in an evidentiary hearing that aren't 

sufficiently developed in the documents? Is that your 

position?

 MR. SEVILLA: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But there is no hole in the 

statute. What it says to do, quite explicitly, is it 

says that you have to see whether the State court 

decision was unreasonable in light of the evidence 

presented in the State court. So it tells us what to 

do. It says, look at the evidence in the State court, 

and like any other instance where there is no hearing, 

every day of the week, judges refuse to give a hearing. 

Now, when they do that, they have to assume the facts in 

favor of the losing party. So the question is, assuming

the facts in favor of your client, was the decision that 

he loses unreasonable?

 MR. SEVILLA: We argued yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And you said yes. Is there 

any finding on that in the Federal court? No.

 MR. SEVILLA: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, that's --

that's why I don't know how to proceed because it seems 

to me to decide that question just as I said it. When I 

said it, I don't think what I said is clear in the law 

of this statute. There are two sides to it. We just 

had a case where there were many briefs on this 

question. So I'm slightly uncertain what to do.

 MR. SEVILLA: Was that Bell v. Kelly?

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a good one.

 MR. SEVILLA: I think it was, and the Court 

dismissed as improvidently granted, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What do you 

rely on for the proposition that if -- if you deny a 

hearing, all of the facts for which the hearing was 

demanded have to be assumed in favor of the party who 

asked for the hearing?

 MR. SEVILLA: That's California law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the law of the 

Federal Government, I would have thought.

MR. SEVILLA: That is --

 MR. SEVILLA: In order to deny relief, one 

has to -- the court has to presume the adequacy of the 

showing, or the truth of the showing made by the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but that can't be. 

What if I deny the hearing because there are ample facts 

that show what the situation was, and a hearing would in 

my view be absolutely redundant? And therefore all of 

the facts that support the other side have to be washed 

out simply because I've denied a hearing?

 MR. SEVILLA: No. We're not making any 

claim that there has to be a hearing in every Federal 

case when there is an argument that could be deemed on 

its face cumulative evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wasn't addressing that. 

I was addressing the proposition that when you deny a 

hearing, all of the facts for which you demanded the 

hearing have to be assumed in your favor. I -- it seems 

to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's my fault. I'm 

referring by shorthand to a Rule 56 summary judgment 

type standard. All those facts are assumed on your side 

in which they're material, and there has to be in the 

evidence a reasonable basis for dispute.

JUSTICE BREYER: That's my mistaken refusal

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, it's -- it also is 

California law, and I believe it is habeas corpus law, 

that when the petitioner files a petition and attaches 

declarations, in order to deny those, assuming that the 

truth of those declarations is presumed in order to 

evaluate the prima facie case -- for example, in this 

case, in Strickland, that if that can't be resolved 

without a hearing, the hearing should be held. And the 

court of appeal on the first go-around held exactly 

that. The court said there are competing reasons here 

why the defense counsel waived this defense on the 

morning --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, talking 

about -- in Strickland -- right here. In Strickland, we 

said that if a decision by counsel is made upon, quote, 

"thorough investigation," it is, quote, "virtually 

unchallengeable." Now, which of these facts in the 

Petitioner's brief is wrong: That Wager retained eight 

expert doctors to evaluate Mirzayance's mental health; 

he retained jury consultants; he conducted a mock trial 

in which he presented mental health defenses to two 

juries; he hired a private investigator to interview

friends and associates; he consulted with Mirzayance's 

parents and their attorneys; he discussed the case with 

a retained expert doctor after decision and his 

co-counsel?

 Now, that sounds like pretty thorough 

investigation of the defense you say he should have 

raised.

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, there are a couple of 

problems with -- all of that is true. I might quibble 

with one, but what -- Mr. Wager was operating under a 

fundamental misunderstanding of California law. All of 

that was ready to go, to present. He had a great not-

guilty-by-reason-of-insanity case supported by lay 

testimony, childhood history, and these psychiatric 

opinions of very formidable experts. But he had a 

fundamental error that was only revealed at the 

evidentiary hearing in the understanding of California 

law. He said -- and he said this six times at the 

evidentiary hearing -- he said that when a jury has 

found the defendant has maturely and meaningfully 

deliberated, that that means they found the equivalent 

of wrongfulness. That is absolutely wrong. He was 

quoting from a statute that was repealed in 1982, when 

California had a major revision of its statutes and 

moved mental health concepts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So all the points 

that your friend began with, which shows his conscious 

deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go 

about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition 

of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that 

under California law doesn't enter into a consideration 

of insanity?

 MR. SEVILLA: Surely it enters into the 

consideration, and every one of the experts considered 

precisely that evidence, which was for the most part 

after-the-fact evidence. And as the State's doctor --

and, again, this came out at the evidentiary hearing 

because it's certainly not discovered in the State 

doctor's report that was submitted. The State doctor, 

Dr. Anderson, stated at the trial in Federal court that, 

yes, he was aware of the consciousness-of-guilt evidence 

that came about mostly after the event, but that did not 

speak to his intent, his mental state at the time of the 

offense. And he stated, which was a great surprise in 

the Federal evidentiary hearing, that he believed Mr. 

Mirzayance was, because of the psychosis, feeling that 

he was justified --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that, 

but counsel here at the time retained eight expert 

doctors to evaluate his mental health. He conducted the

mock jury trial. He interviewed the parents. He hired 

an investigator to interview friends. What you're 

saying is, well, here's -- if he had hired a ninth 

expert, he might have come out differently. That sounds 

like a thorough investigation under Strickland.

 MR. SEVILLA: It was a thorough 

investigation. But this case -- this Court has said, in 

Terry Williams, counsel has a duty to investigate and 

proffer mitigation evidence in a capital case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So isn't that --

aren't you back to the "nothing to lose" argument? He 

conducted this investigation, which under Strickland we 

said makes the decision virtually unchallengeable, and 

you're saying, well, he has an obligation to proffer it.

 MR. SEVILLA: He had an obligation to 

proffer it because he was operating on a fundamental 

misunderstanding of California law.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You say that repeatedly, but 

what is there to show that he misunderstood, that he 

misunderstood California law, as opposed to making a 

practical calculation about how juries would look at 

this evidence, having found -- having heard the evidence 

of premeditation and having found premeditation, even 

though that doesn't decide the NGI issue, as a matter of 

law. As a practical matter, it makes it quite unlikely

that they're going to accept the NGI defense. Where --

and you say that repeatedly.

 MR. SEVILLA: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Where in the record does it 

show that he misunderstood the law, as opposed to making 

a practical evaluation of what the jury was likely to 

do?

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, I will -- I could rattle 

off page numbers from where he said that the jury 

finding of premeditation and deliberation was the 

functional equivalent of a finding of sanity. That is 

absolutely not true. Here's the quote --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: He didn't use the word 

"functional equivalent" in the portions I read. Maybe 

you can correct me if I'm wrong about that.

 MR. SEVILLA: He did not say "the functional 

equivalent." He said --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And he told the trial 

judge, "I've got an uphill" --

MR. SEVILLA: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- almost perpendicular. 

And he had -- each and every one of those experts in 

their affidavits, in their reports, had said that he 

didn't have deliberation or premeditation. They were 

getting ready for that. And he felt that this would be

devastating cross-examination material because the jury 

had already found the opposite -- they had already 

disbelieved the expert on this point.

 Now, it's true, it's true, that knowledge of 

wrongfulness is probably slightly more extensive than 

premeditation. But based on the defense that he was 

going to present -- he didn't know what he was doing at 

this time -- he had a very, very difficult obstacle to 

overcome.

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, that -- that's a 

challenge that faces every criminal defense attorney in 

-- a case when you have a -- a credible defense like 

this. There -- there are going to be challenges to that 

by vigorous, trained prosecutors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there something on 

the other side? You seem to present this as a case, but 

counsel did a careful job, and then he lost faith. He 

lost hope, and so he acted irrationally.

 But wasn't there on the other side 

consideration of the sentence that he was going to get, 

and might not a -- a lawyer perfectly rationally think: 

If I give up this defense, it is just going to waste 

everybody's time. The judge is going to give me the 

benefit of -- of having done that in the sentence, in 

giving a lower sentence, in giving -- making the

sentences on the multiple offenses concurrent rather 

than consecutive.

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, if there had been a 

tactical purpose such as that, that would have been an 

interesting fact to add to the calculus here, but he 

absolutely denied there was any benefit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe -- maybe he 

did, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have 

to judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice 

Ginsburg just said? In other words, our standard, the 

-- the standard -- No. 1, the standard for Strickland 

prejudice is -- is an objective -- I mean the standard 

for -- for -- of -- of performance is an objective 

standard. And the standard for prejudice has got to be 

an objective standard, too.

 And even though he said, I didn't do this 

for tactical reasons, if a -- if a sound lawyer would 

have entertained exactly the tactical reason that 

Justice Ginsburg just outlined, isn't that crucial to 

the determination of prejudice?

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, it -- it may well be if 

there was a --

that there could be any difference whatsoever at

sentencing. But he testified, well, what was going to 

happen to Mr. Mirzayance if he were to -- he was going 

to get 25 or 29 to life, which is exactly what happened. 

So there was no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: How did he know that?

 MR. SEVILLA: How did he know that? Because 

if you -- he had already been convicted of first-degree 

murder, which --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the judge hadn't 

sentenced him yet.

 MR. SEVILLA: Correct, but under California 

law there is a mandatory prison sentence for the use of 

a gun, so -- and the sentence for first-degree murder is 

25 to life.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you are saying the 

judge had no discretion whatsoever?

 MR. SEVILLA: That is correct. So, 

therefore --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty-five -- 25, 26, 27, 

28, he has 25 years worth of discretion, doesn't he?

 MR. SEVILLA: No, no. It's a minimum 

mandatory 25 to life.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But couldn't he also give 

life. He could also give the maximum, which was life, 

couldn't he, or am I wrong?

which is whether or not a case from this Court clearly 

establishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to 

go ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of 

Strickland. And what case is that?

 MR. SEVILLA: There is no case that this 

Court has so pronounced. And we are not arguing for

that standard, nor should we have to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I 

understood your responses to the various questions here 

to, in effect, be arguing for that standard. You are 

saying, look, he was going to get the same sentence 

anyway. You know, all -- all your answers sound to me 

like nothing to lose.

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, they're all part of the 

calculus of reasonable performance. Certainly, the fact 

that there is nothing to lose, that he is going to get 

an automatic 25-year minimum sentence, that he is -- on 

the other hand, he's got a credible defense for which 

there is absolutely no benefit in giving up, and -- and 

then he decides for reasons --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He made a 

determination -- he made a determination after a 

thorough investigation of the various points I went 

through with you earlier that it was not a credible 

defense. Now, maybe that was reasonable or 

unreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under 

Strickland we said it is virtually unchallengeable, and 

it doesn't seem to me to be objectively unreasonable in 

light of clearly established law from this Court.

Court has said that failure to fact-investigate can be a 

basis for objectively unreasonable performance. The 

same is true with failure to legally investigate what's 

the law governing your case.

 And he stated on six occasions that the fact 

that the jury, quote, "had already found Mirzayance 

guilty of first-degree murder," and, whether they knew 

it or not, under the facts of this case legally sane, 

well, then, the question is: Well, how do you make that 

determination? By the way, he said the equivalent of 

that six times during the year.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't -- I didn't take 

that to mean under California law, since the jury found 

the one, it has to find the other. He wasn't making 

that argument. He was saying any jury that found that 

this was done intentionally, that this was done, you 

know, with -- with planning, with -- with cover-up and 

what not, that jury is not going to find that he was 

crazy. That's all he was saying, and -- and that seems 

to me entirely reasonable.

 MR. SEVILLA: Well -- well, I -- that might 

be the case if he did not misunderstand California law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's hard for me to 

believe that he didn't. He -- he has tried a hundred 

cases. He had moot or mock -- mock trials where he was

asking the experts these questions with the co-counsel. 

And you want us to say that he didn't understand the 

law? And there is no -- there is no finding to that 

effect. There's no finding to that effect: That he did 

not understand the law by the magistrate.

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, the circuit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: By the magistrate, there 

was no finding to that effect.

 MR. SEVILLA: That's correct, because the 

magistrate did really not make a finding on prong one. 

The -- the magistrate misapprehended the intention of 

the circuit's first remand by thinking that it had 

mandated a nothing-to-lose rule. And if there was 

nothing to lose, it was prong one ineffectiveness, so 

there was no need to make a finding. So we're left 

without a finding.

 But the circuit on -- on its second and 

third opinion noted that his concept of premeditation 

and deliberation as having mental-health concepts was 

wrong because of the 1982 amendment to the statutes, 

which removed many of the mental-health concepts and --

and put them over into the insanity phase. And so when 

he said to the court at the hearing, Mr. Mirzayance --

after the jury found him maturely and meaningfully 

deliberated, that's language that was eliminated in --

in 1982, and that is the mental-health concept.

 And -- and this point is very important to 

this argument. When he was arguing to the jury, he said 

he can't premeditate and deliberate because he's 

mentally ill. He's mentally diseased. And he was cut 

off by the prosecutor and the court who gave an 

instruction that said -- 853 of the trial transcript, 

saying the fact that Mr. Mirzayance may have deliberated 

for irrational reasons brought on by mental disease is 

not a defense to this case. His reasons can be 

irrational in deliberating.

 And that should have tipped him off that 

this jury was precluded from taking the psychiatric 

testimony -- the psychological testimony of the one 

witness at the guilt phase and -- and deeming that a 

negation of any ability to win on a wrongfulness 

standard. And -- and I might also add --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they didn't -- they 

didn't strike the experts' testimony. The experts 

testified at some length, the -- the psychiatrist.

 MR. SEVILLA: He did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that was relevant to 

premeditation and deliberation, and the jury did 

consider what the mental health expert said.

 MR. SEVILLA: They did consider what he

said, but they were precluded from channeling that into 

a defense to premedication and deliberation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about -- what do 

you do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the 

California Court of Appeals' opinion? "None of the 

exculpatory evidence defendant recites, including 

evidence of his mental disorder, was reasonably likely 

to persuade a jury that defendant did not premeditate 

and deliberate the killing." And from that they 

conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, 

but for the errors, a different verdict would have been 

reached, i.e., that it does not satisfy the second part 

of Strickland.

 MR. SEVILLA: And -- and you were reading 

from the California Court of Appeals --

JUSTICE BREYER: I was just reading from the 

California court of Appeals. Because I look at that. I 

think when I go back and see what was the evidence in 

front of them, I am going to find all of these -- all of 

these things. Not the last part by the way, not -- not 

the part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or 

whatever this argument we are having. We won't find 

that, but we'll find everything else there.

 And so they're using that as the basis to 

say there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the

Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer 

to that finding on prejudice. Now, what's your response 

to that?

 MR. SEVILLA: Well, the California Court of 

Appeals did not have before them the evidence that came 

in by way of petition, which was all of the psychiatric 

opinions of the forensic psychiatrists who gave 

declarations saying that Mr. Mirzayance was insane at 

the time of the homicide. That is not within the court 

of appeal opinion because the court of appeal opinion is 

on the four corners of the record, and this was 

collateral to that.

 So any statement along those lines did not 

encompass the most powerful evidence that was presented, 

which would have been all of the psychiatric opinion 

testimony about his mental state at the time of the 

offense.

 And then, of course, we know that at the 

federal evidentiary hearing, this defense was found 

credible, and one of the state doctors came over to the 

defense side and testified that Mirzayance did not 

understand wrongfulness at the time of the homicide 

because of the psychosis. And this doctor made an 

error, and its clear from the record at the evidentiary 

hearing, he had an error in his understanding of the NGI

test in California. He thought if you met prong one you 

understood the nature and quality of the act, you were 

sane, and he never went to wrongfulness.

 But when he was asked by the State at this 

hearing, well, what about his ability to understand 

wrongfulness, and the doctor said he didn't understand 

wrongfulness.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Please correct me if I'm 

wrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't --

don't testify as to the ultimate standard. They testify 

as to the condition and -- and the symptoms of -- of the 

defendant, and then the jury makes that conclusion.

 MR. SEVILLA: In California in 1982, there 

was a statutory amendment which prohibited forensic 

experts from testifying to opinions at the guilt phase, 

so that -- on legal issues like premeditation, 

deliberation, so they could not, Dr. Satz could not 

testify at the guilt phase on premeditation and 

deliberation. At the insanity phase, they absolutely 

can testify as to whether he was sane or not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Had Wager ever 

represented a defendant who pled NGI?

 MR. SEVILLA: No. He testified this was his 

first NGI defense.

raised the issue about couldn't these -- in the 

prejudice calculus, couldn't these psychiatrists have 

been impeached with the fact that they found no 

premeditation and deliberation? Well, California 

statute under Penal Code section 28 prohibits their 

opinion on premeditation and deliberation at the guilt 

phase where the issue is premeditation and deliberation. 

So, I can't understand how a court would let in their 

opinions on premeditation and deliberation when there's 

a totally separate issue of insanity at the insanity 

phase.

 It's -- if it's irrelevant or prohibited at 

the guilt phase, where premeditation is the issue, it's 

surely going to be irrelevant at the NGI phase, where 

it's not an issue, and we have a totally different 

standard. As the courts of California have said, one 

can be guilty of first degree murder and be insane. 

That's -- that's clear.

 So, in this case, we have an attorney who, 

for whatever reasons, based on a subjective sense of 

hopelessness, gave up his client's only and best 

defense, a defense that was found credible at the 

federal evidentiary hearing. Once -- once that defense 

is found credible, that bespeaks of the unreasonableness 

of counsel giving it up. It's a credible defense, it's

the only defense available to him, and counsel gave it 

up for no tactical benefit.

 There was no upside to this. There was a 

clear downside to it, because it consigned his client to 

29 years to life as opposed to the possibility of 

treatment in a mental hospital, and potentially, upon 

the restoration of sanity, potential relief -- release 

if he could prove his restoration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Has he served his time so 

far in a regular institution?

 MR. SEVILLA: Yes, he has. He is in Mule 

Creek State Prison just south of Stockton, California, 

and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that the special -- he 

made a request for a particular prison. Is that the 

one?

 MR. SEVILLA: I don't think so. I don't 

believe -- I think at the sentencing hearing, the trial 

judge did not do anything special except sentence him to 

prison? Although both -- in terms of the bona fides of 

his disease, both the prosecutor and the judge at the 

time of the sentencing said he was clearly a mentally 

diseased person. So that -- this -- this bespeaks back 

to the credibility of the defense which was established

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MERCER: Just a couple of points I would 

like to make briefly to clarify a couple things.

 First off, there was no finding that 

Attorney Wager misunderstood California law or somehow 

was under the impression that a finding of first degree 

murder was legally precluded a finding of NGI. He 

argued at the State trial that there's no question that 

an insane person can deliberate, and surely while the 

jury's verdict was as devastating under the facts of 

this case, he didn't close up his books and go home.

 He told the trial judge, we need to reassess 

this, I need to decide who I'm going to call, I need to 

consult with my doctors and my co-counsel and decide 

what we're going to do.

 And as the district court found here, and as 

Wager stated in the State court declaration, there was 

no final decision made until the morning of trial when 

the parents expressed a profound reluctance to assist

their son. And this was, in fact, his first NGI 

defense, but as Mirzayance's family attorney stated in 

his State court declaration, Attorney Wager was a 

ten-year expert on mental health and sanity issues with 

the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. He had 

tried more than a hundred trials. He was the expert. 

He had done his homework here. He knew what he had to 

present. He did not make a rash decision. He consulted 

with co-counsel, and concluded reasonably under his 

professional valuation that the defense could not meet 

its affirmative burden of proof here.

 The second thing I would like to clarify on 

Justice Ginsburg's point, there was some sentencing 

discretion left here. It's correct that Wager in 

hindsight said, well, perhaps there was nothing to lose. 

But he argued to the sentencing judge the very fact that 

his client knew the wrongfulness of his actions and was 

so remorseful should entitle him to a lesser sentence on 

the weapons enhancement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What discretion did the 

judge have?

 MR. MERCER: The -- that the -- the 

sentencing judge could have imposed a high, middle or 

low-term for the weapons enhancement. The underlying 

sentence was 25 to life, my friend is correct, it's set

by statute. But he had discretion on sentence 

enhancement, and he was convinced that Mirzayance was 

remorseful, and gave him a mid-term instead of a 

high-term, despite the fact.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was also 

something about the revocation? There were three 

revocations involved, I thought, two years on each.

 MR. MERCER: I don't believe that's correct. 

I think it was a straightforward 25 years to life 

sentence plus a weapons enhancement of four years added 

on.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You keep saying 29 years. 

Is it 29 years or is that just a misprint --

MR. MERCER: It's -- the aggregate sentence 

is 25 -- excuse me. The aggregate sentence is 29 years 

to life. It's 25 years to life for the first degree 

murder, plus four years for the weapons enhancement in 

this term, a mid-term, because Wager successfully argued 

that his client was remorseful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would he have 

gotten in the high term?

 MR. MERCER: I believe that it was -- I 

believe that it was six years as opposed to four. It 

may have been eight as opposed to four. I don't know. 

That's not discussed in the State court record.

And finally, Mr. Mirzayance concedes that 

"nothing to lose" would be an inappropriate new rule by 

this Court. He no longer calls it that. He doesn't --

he disagrees with the dissent view on this. What he 

calls it is this: This is the rule, in his own 

description, at page 30 of his brief, how the Ninth 

Circuit granted relief here. Excuse me, I see my time 

is expired.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you --

MR. MERCER: That the decision fairly read 

states only that counsel has a duty to present 

substantial viable defense where there was an objective 

prospect for success and no strategic or other benefit 

abandoning it. This Court has never held such a rule to 

bind the states.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
