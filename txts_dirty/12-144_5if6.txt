3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry. 

Mr. Cooper? 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8  MR. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 and may it please the Court: 

New York's highest court, in a case similar 

11 to this one, remarked that until quite recently, it was 

12 an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived in 

13 any society in which marriage existed. Marriage --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cooper, we have 

jurisdictional and merits issues here. Maybe it'd be 

16 best if you could begin with the standing issue. 

17  MR. COOPER: I'd be happy to, 

18 Mr. Chief Justice. 

19  Your Honor, the official proponents of 

Proposition 8, the initiative, have standing to defend 

21 that measure before this Court as representatives of the 

22 people and the State of California to defend the 

23 validity of a measure that they brought forward. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have we ever granted 

standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?

1  MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, the Court has 


2 not done that, but the Court has never had before it a 


3 clear expression from a unanimous State's high court 


4 that --


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this is -- this 

6 is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are 

7 interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that 

8 all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's 

9 passed, they have no proprietary interest in it. It's 

law for them just as it is for everyone else. So how 

11 are they distinguishable from the California citizenry 

12 in general? 

13  MR. COOPER: They're distinguishable, Your 

14 Honor, because the Constitution of the State of 

California and its election code provide, according to 

16 the unanimous interpretation of the California Supreme 

17 Court, that the official proponents, in addition to the 

18 other official responsibilities and authorities that 

19 they have in the initiative process, that those official 

proponents also have the authority and the 

21 responsibility to defend the validity of that 

22 initiative --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess the attorney 

24 general of this State doesn't have any proprietary 

interest either, does he?

4  MR. COOPER: -- nor did --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because the law says he 

6 can defend it. 

7  MR. COOPER: That's right, Your Honor. Nor 

8 did the legislative leaders in the Karcher case have --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could the State --

MR. COOPER: -- any particular enforcement --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- could -- could the State 

12 assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of 

13 this kind? 

14  MR. COOPER: Justice Kagan, that would be 

a -- a very tough question. It's -- it's by no means 

16 the question before the Court because -- because it 

17 isn't any citizen. It's -- it is the -- it is the 

18 official proponents that have a specific and -- and 

19 carefully detailed --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I just -- if you would 

21 on the hypothetical: Could a State just assign to 

22 anybody the ability to do this? 

23  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, I think it very 

24 well might. It very well might be able to decide that 

any citizen could step forward and represent the

1 interests of the State and the people in that State --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would 

3 be -- I'm sorry, are you finished? 

4  MR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. That -- that 

6 may be true in terms of who they want to represent, 

7 but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in 

8 Federal court because that would leave the definition 

9 under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who 

can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each 

11 State. And I don't think we've ever allowed anything 

12 like that. 

13  MR. COOPER: But -- but, Your Honor, I guess 

14 the point I want to make is that there is no question 

the State has standing. The State itself has standing 

16 to represent its own interests in the validity of its 

17 own enactments. And if the State's public officials 

18 decline to do that, it is within the State's authority 

19 surely, I would submit, to identify, if not all -- any 

citizen or at least supporter of -- of the measure, 

21 certainly those, that that very clear and identifiable 

22 group of citizens --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Chief -- the 

24 Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper 

hypothetical to test your theory. But in this case the 

6

25

Official 

1 proponents, number one, must give their official 


2 address, they must pay money, and they must all act in 


3 unison under California law. So these five proponents 


4 were required at all times to act in unison, so that 


distinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for 


6 the -- so in that sense it's different from simply 


7 saying any citizen. 


8  MR. COOPER: But of course it is, and I 


9 think the key --


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But can you tell me --

11 that's a factual background with respect to their right 

12 to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does 

13 it create an injury to them separate from that of every 

14 other taxpayer to have laws enforced? 

MR. COOPER: Your Honor, the -- the question 

16 before the Court, I would submit, is not the injury to 

17 the individual proponents, it's the injury to the State. 

18 The -- the legislators in the Karcher case had no 

19 individual particularized injury, and yet this Court 

recognized they were proper representatives of the 

21 State's interests -- the State's injury --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At least one of the 

23 amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to 

24 think that the State is going to delegate to people who 

don't have a fiduciary duty to them. That it's going to

Official 

1 delegate the responsibility of representing the State to 

2 individuals who have their own views. They proposed the 

3 ballot initiative because it was their individual views, 

4 not necessarily that of the State. So --

MR. COOPER: Well --


6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- Justice Scalia 


7 proffered the question of the Attorney General. The 


8 Attorney General has no personal interest. 


9  MR. COOPER: True. No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He has a fiduciary 

11 obligation. 

12  MR. COOPER: The Attorney General, whether 

13 it's a fiduciary obligation or not, is in normal 

14 circumstances the representative of the State to defend 

the validity of the State's enactments when they are 

16 challenged in Federal court. But when that officer 

17 doesn't do so, the State surely has every authority and 

18 I would submit the responsibility to identify 

19 particularly in an initiative -- an initiative context. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't the fiduciary 

21 duty requirements before the State can designate a 

22 representative an important one? 

23  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, I would submit to 

24 you that I don't think there's anything in Article III 

or in any of this Court's decisions that suggest that a

25

Official 

1 representative of a State must be -- have a fiduciary 


2 duty, but I would also suggest --


3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, generally you 


4 don't need to specify it because generally the people 


who get to enforce the legislation of the government are 

6 people who are in government positions elected by the 

7 people. 

8  MR. COOPER: And Your Honor --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Here these individuals 

are not elected by the people or appointed by the 

11 people. 

12  MR. COOPER: And the California Supreme 

13 Court specifically addressed and rejected that specific 

14 argument. They said it is in the context when the 

public officials, the elected officials, the appointed 

16 officials, have declined, have declined to defend a 

17 statute. A statute that, by the way, excuse me, in this 

18 case a constitutional amendment, was brought forward by 

19 the initiative process. 

The Court said it is essential to the 

21 integrity, integrity of the initiative process in that 

22 State, which is a precious right of every citizen. The 

23 initiative process in that State, to ensure that when 

24 public officials -- and after all, the initiative 

process is designed to control those very public

Official 

1 officials, to take issues out of their hands. 


2  And if public officials could effectively 


3 veto an initiative by refusing to appeal it, then the 


4 initiative process would be invalidated. 


JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- historically, I 


6 think, 40 States, many States have what was called a 


7 public action. A public action is an action by any 


8 citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing 


9 that the law is enforced. 


MR. COOPER: In California --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the kind of 

12 action I think that this Court has interpreted the 

13 Constitution of the United States, case in controversy, 

14 to say that it does not lie in the Federal system. 

And of course, if that kind of action is the 

16 very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they 

17 really feel it's important that the law be enforced, 

18 they really want to vindicate the process, and these are 

19 people of special interests. They -- we found the five 

citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the 

21 interest in the law being enforced and the process for 

22 making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish 

23 it from a public action. 

24  But then you say, but also they are 

representing the State. At this point, the Dellinger

1 brief which takes the other side of it is making a 

2 strong argument, well, they aren't the State. They are 

3 really no more than a group of five people who feel 

4 really strongly that we should vindicate this public 

interest and have good reason for thinking it. 

6  So you have read all these arguments that 

7 it's not really the agent and so forth. What do you 

8 want to say about it? 

9  MR. COOPER: What I want to say, Your Honor, 

is that according to the California Supreme Court, the 

11 California Constitution says in terms that among the 

12 responsibilities of official proponents, in addition to 

13 the many other responsibilities that they step forward 

14 and they assume in the initiative process, among those 

responsibilities and authorities is to defend that 

16 initiative if the public officials, which the initiative 

17 process is designed to control, have refused to do it. 

18 It might as well say it in those terms, Your Honor. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you want 

to proceed to the merits, you should feel free to do so. 

21  MR. COOPER: Thank you very much, Your 

22 Honor. 

23  My -- my -- excuse me. As I was saying, the 

24 accepted truth -- excuse me. The accepted truth that --

that the New York high court observed is one that is

Official 

1 changing and changing rapidly in this country as people 

2 throughout the country engage in an earnest debate over 

3 whether the age-old definition of marriage should be 

4 changed to include same-sex couples. 

The question before this Court is whether 

6 the Constitution puts a stop to that ongoing democratic 

7 debate and answers this question for all 50 States. And 

8 it does so only if the Respondents are correct that no 

9 rational, thoughtful person of goodwill could possibly 

disagree with them, in good faith, on this agonizingly 

11 difficult issue. 

12  The issues, the constitutional issues that 

13 have been presented to the Court, are not of first 

14 impression here. In Baker against Nelson, this Court 

unanimously dismissed for want of a substantial Federal 

16 question. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cooper, Baker v. 

18 Nelson was 1971. The Supreme Court hadn't even decided 

19 that gender-based classifications get any kind of 

heightened scrutiny. 

21  MR. COOPER: That is --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the same-sex intimate 

23 conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971, 

24 so I don't think we can extract much from Baker against 

Nelson.

Official 

1  MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, certainly I
 

2 acknowledge the precedential limitations of a summary 


3 dismissal. But Baker against Nelson also came fairly 


4 fast on the heels of the Loving decision. And, Your 


Honor, I simply make the observation that it seems 

6 implausible in the extreme, frankly, for nine justices 

7 to have -- to have seen no substantial Federal question 

8 if it is true, as the Respondents maintain, that the 

9 traditional definition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar 

as it does not include same-sex couples, insofar as it is 

11 a gender definition, is irrational and can only be 

12 explained -- can only be explained, as a result of 

13 anti-gay malice and a bare desire to harm. That would 

14 have been --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you believe this can be 

16 treated as a gender-based classification? 

17  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, I --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a difficult question 

19 that I've been trying to wrestle with it. 

MR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor. And we do 

21 not. We do not think it is properly viewed as a 

22 gender-based classification. Virtually every appellate 

23 court, State and Federal, with one exception, Hawaii, in 

24 a superseded opinion, has agreed that it is not a 

gender-based classification, but I guess it is gender

1 -based in the sense that marriage itself is a gendered 


2 institution, a gendered term. And so in the same way
 

3 that fatherhood is gendered or motherhood is gendered, 


4 it's gendered in that sense. 


But we -- we agree that to the extent that 

6 the classification impacts, as it clearly does, same-sex 

7 couples, that -- that classification can be viewed as 

8 being one of sexual orientation rather than --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Outside of the --

outside of the marriage context, can you think of any 

11 other rational basis, reason for a State using sexual 

12 orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits 

13 or imposing burdens on them? Is there any other 

14 rational decision-making that the government could make? 

Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some 

16 sort, any other decision? 

17  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, I cannot. I do not 

18 have any -- anything to offer you in that regard. I 

19 think marriage is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that --

21 if that is true, then why aren't they a class? If 

22 they're a class that makes any other discrimination 

23 improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them 

24 as a class for this one benefit? Are you saying that the 

interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any 

14

5
10

25

Official 

1 other interest as they could have? 


2  MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, we certainly
 

3 are not. We -- we are saying the interest in marriage 


4 and the -- and the State's interest and society's 


interest in what we have framed as responsible pro --

6 procreation is -- is vital, but at bottom, with respect 

7 to those interests, our submission is that same-sex 

8 couples and opposite-sex couples are simply not 

9 similarly situated. 

But to come back to your precise question, I 

11 think, Justice Sotomayor, you're -- you're probing into 

12 whether or not sexual orientation ought to be viewed as 

13 a quasi-suspect or suspect class, and our position is 

14 that it does not qualify under this Court's standard 

and -- and traditional tests for identifying 

16 suspectedness. The -- the class itself is -- is quite 

17 amorphous. It defies consistent definition as -- as the 

18 Plaintiffs' own experts were -- were quite vivid on. 

19 It -- it does not -- it -- it does not qualify as an 

accident of birth, immutability in that -- in that 

21 sense. 

22  Again, the Plaintiffs --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- so what -- I 

24 don't quite understand it. If you're not dealing with 

this as a class question, then why would you say that

1 the government is not free to discriminate against them? 

2  MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I would think 

3 that -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different 

4 question whether or not the government can proceed 

arbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group 


6 of people, regardless of whether or not they qualify 


7 under this Court's traditional test for suspectedness. 


8 And -- and the hypothetical I understood you to be 


9 offering, I would submit would create -- it would --


unless there's something that -- that is not occurring 

11 to me immediately, an arbitrary and capricious 

12 distinction among similarly situated individuals, 

13 that -- that is not what we think is at the -- at the 

14 root of the traditional definition of marriage. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cooper, could I just 

16 understand your argument. As -- in reading the briefs, 

17 it seems as though your principal argument is that 

18 same-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly 

19 situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, 

same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal 

21 interest in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is 

22 that basically correct? 

23  MR. COOPER: I -- Your Honor, that's the 

24 essential thrust of our -- our position, yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Is -- is there -- so you

1 have sort of a reason for not including same-sex 

2 couples. Is there any reason that you have for 

3 excluding them? In other words, you're saying, well, if 

4 we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the 

State's interest. But do you go further and say that it 

6 harms any State interest? 

7  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, we -- we go further 

8 in -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very 

9 concerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless 

institution could well lead over time to harms to that 

11 institution and to the interests that society has 

12 always -- has -- has always used that institution to 

13 address. But, Your Honor, I --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, could you explain that 

a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up 

16 in your briefs. 

17  What harm you see happening and when and how 

18 and -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage 

19 or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and 

effect work? 

21  MR. COOPER: Once again, I -- I would 

22 reiterate that we don't believe that's the correct legal 

23 question before the Court, and that the correct question 

24 is whether or not redefining marriage to include 

same-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage

1 as a --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then are -- are you 

3 conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration 

4 to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples? So you're 

conceding that. 

6  MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, no. I'm not 

7 conceding that. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but, then it -- then 

9 it seems to me that you should have to address Justice 

Kagan's question. 

11  MR. COOPER: Thank you, Justice Kennedy. I 

12 have two points to make on them. 

13  The first one is this, the Plaintiffs' 

14 expert acknowledged that redefining marriage will have 

real-world consequences, and that it is impossible for 

16 anyone to foresee the future accurately enough to know 

17 exactly what those real-world consequences would be. 

18 And among those real-world consequences, Your Honor, we 

19 would suggest are adverse consequences. 

But consider the California voter, in 2008, 

21 in the ballot booth, with the question before her 

22 whether or not this age-old bedrock social institution 

23 should be fundamentally redefined, and knowing that 

24 there's no way that she or anyone else could possibly 

know what the long-term implications of a profound 

18

1 redefinition of a bedrock social institution would be. 

2 That is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be 

3 irrational for that voter to say, I believe that this 

4 experiment, which is now only fairly four years old, 

even in Massachusetts, the oldest State that is 

6 conducting it, to say, I think it better for California 

7 to hit the pause button and await additional information 

8 from the jurisdictions where this experiment is still 

9 maturing. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cooper, let me -- let 

11 me give you one -- one concrete thing. I don't know why 

12 you don't mention some concrete things. If you redefine 

13 marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you 

14 must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's --

there's considerable disagreement among -- among 

16 sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a 

17 child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is 

18 harmful to the child or not. Some States do not -- do 

19 not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: California -- no, 

21 California does. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we know the 

23 answer to that. Do you know the answer to that, whether 

24 it -- whether it harms or helps the child? 

MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor. And there's --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wouldn't be in 

7 California, Mr. Cooper, because that's not an issue, is

MR. COOPER: That's right, Your Honor. That 

11 is true. And -- but -- but, Your Honor, here's --

12 here's the point --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- it's true, but 

14 irrelevant. They're arguing for a nationwide rule which 

applies to States other than California, that every 

16 State must allow marriage by same-sex couples. And so 

17 even though States that believe it is harmful -- and I 

18 take no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it 

19 is certainly true that -- that there's no scientific 

answer to that question at this point in time. 

21  MR. COOPER: And -- and that, Your Honor, is 

22 the point I am trying to make, and it is the 

23 Respondents' responsibility to prove, under rational 

24 basis review, not only that -- that there clearly will 

be no harm, but that it's beyond debate that there will

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cooper, you are 

3 defending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to 

4 California only, not to all of the States. 

MR. COOPER: That's true, Your Honor. And 

6 if there were a way to -- to cabin the arguments that 

7 are being presented to you to California, then the 

8 concerns about redefining marriage in -- in California 

9 could be confined to California, but they cannot, Your 

Honor. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think there's --

12 there's substantial -- that there's substance to the 

13 point that sociological information is new. We have 

14 five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years 

of history or more. 

16  On the other hand, there is an immediate 

17 legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury, 

18 and that's the voice of these children. There are some 

19 40,000 children in California, according to the Red 

Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want 

21 their parents to have full recognition and full status. 

22 The voice of those children is important in this case, 

23 don't you think? 

24  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, I certainly would 

not dispute the importance of that consideration. That

1 consideration especially in the political process where 

2 this issue is being debated and will continue to be 

3 debated, certainly, in California. It's being debated 

4 elsewhere. But on that -- on that specific question, 

Your Honor, there -- there simply is no data. 

6  In fact, their expert agreed there is no 

7 data, no study, even, that would examine whether or not 

8 there is any incremental beneficial effect from marriage 

9 over and above the domestic partnership laws that were 

enacted by the State of California to recognize, 

11 support, and honor same-sex relationships and their 

12 families. There is simply no data at all that would --

13 that would permit one to draw -- draw that conclusion. 

14  I would recall, Justice Kennedy, the point 

made in Romer, that under a rational basis of review, 

16 the provision will be sustained even if it operates to 

17 the disadvantage of a group, if it is -- if it otherwise 

18 advances rationally a legitimate State interest. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cooper, we will 

afford you more time. You shouldn't worry about losing 

21 your rebuttal time, but please continue on.

1 or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and 

2 that distinguishes California. Now, let's look at 

3 California. What precisely is the way in which allowing 

4 gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of 

marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing 

6 sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry 

7 would not? 

8  I mean, there are lots of people who get 

9 married who can't have children. And so take a State 

that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the 

11 justification for saying no gay marriage? Certainly not 

12 the one you said, is it? 

13  MR. COOPER: You're --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Am I not clear? 

Look, you said that the problem is marriage 

16 as an institution that furthers procreation. 

17  MR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason there was 

19 adoption, but that doesn't apply to California. So 

imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just 

21 there, where you say that doesn't apply. Now, what 

22 happens to your argument about the institution of 

23 marriage as a tool towards procreation? Given the fact 

24 that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay, but 

can't have children get married all the time.

1  MR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor. The concern 

2 is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution 

3 will sever its abiding connection to its historic 

4 traditional procreative purposes and it will refocus, 

refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of 


6 marriage away from the raising of children and to the 


7 emotional needs and desires of adults -- of adult 


8 couples. 


9  Suppose, in turn --


JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose a State 

11 said -- Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said because we 

12 think that the focus of marriage really should be on 

13 procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses 

14 anymore to any couple where both people are over the age 

of 55. Would that be constitutional? 

16  MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, it would not be 

17 constitutional. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Because that's the same 

19 State interest, I would think, you know. If you are 

over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the 

21 government's interest in regulating procreation through 

22 marriage. So why is that different? 

23  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, even with respect 

24 to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that both 

couples -- both parties to the couple are infertile, and

4 couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and 

the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of 

6 children coming out of that marriage. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. COOPER: Your Honor, society's --

9 society's interest in responsible procreation isn't just 

with respect to the procreative capacities of the couple 

11 itself. The marital norm, which imposes the -- the 

12 obligations of fidelity and monogamy, Your Honor, 

13 advances the interests in responsible procreation by 

14 making it more likely that neither party, including the 

fertile party to that --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually, I'm not even --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose we could have a 

18 questionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in 

19 to get the marriage -- you know, are you fertile or are 

you not fertile? 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suspect this Court would 

23 hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, 

24 don't you think? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I just asked about

infertile. Again --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Strom Thurmond was -- was 

7 not the chairman of the Senate committee when Justice 

8 Kagan was confirmed. 

9  (Laughter.) 

MR. COOPER: Very few men -- very few men 

11 outlive their own fertility. So I just --

13 are over the age of 55 --

14  MR. COOPER: I --

JUSTICE KAGAN: A couple where both people 

16 are over the age of 55.

18 marital norm which imposes upon that couple the 

19 obligation of fidelity --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, where is 

21 that --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, maybe you 

23 can finish your answer to Justice Kagan.

1 make it less likely that either party to that -- to that 

2 marriage will engage in irresponsible, procreative 

3 conduct outside of that marriage. Outside of that 

4 marriage. That's the marital -- that's the marital 

norm. Society has an interest in seeing a 55-year-old 


6 couple that is -- just as it has an interest of seeing 


7 any heterosexual couple that intends to engage in a 


8 prolonged period of cohabitation to reserve that until 


9 they have made a marital commitment, a marital 


commitment. So that, should that union produce any 

11 offspring, it would be more likely that that child or 

12 children will be raised by the mother and father who 

13 brought them into the world. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cooper, we said that 

somebody who is locked up in prison and is not going 

16 to get out has a right to marry -- has a fundamental 

17 right to marry, no possibility of procreation. 

18  MR. COOPER: Your Honor is referring, I'm 

19 sure, to the Turner case, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

21  MR. COOPER: -- I think that, with due 

22 respect, Justice Ginsburg, way over-reads -- way

12 only fair to treat you the same. Perhaps you could 

13 address your jurisdictional argument? 

14  MR. OLSON: Yes. I think that our 

jurisdictional argument is, as we set forth in the 

16 brief, California cannot create Article III standing by 

17 designating whoever it wants to defend the State of 

18 California in connection with the ballot. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is not whoever it 

wants. These are five proponents of -- of the measure 

21 and if we were to accept your argument, it would give 

22 the State a one-way ratchet. The State could go in and 

23 make a defense, maybe a half-hearted defense of the 

24 statute, and -- and then when the statute is held 

invalid, simply -- simply leave. On the other hand,

1 if -- if the State loses, the State can appeal. 

2  So this is a one-way ratchet as it favors 

3 the State and allows governors and other constitutional 

4 officers in different States to thwart the initiative 

process. 

6  MR. OLSON: That's the -- that's the way the 

7 California Supreme Court saw it with respect to 

8 California law. The governor and the Attorney General 

9 of California are elected to act in the best interests 

of the State of California. They made a professional 

11 judgment given their obligations as officers of the 

12 State of California. 

13  The California Supreme Court has said that 

14 proponents -- and by the way, only four of the five are 

here. Dr. Tam withdrew from the case because of some --

16 many things he said during the election -- campaign. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Olson, is it your 

18 position that the only people who could defend a 

19 ballot -- a law that's adopted in California through the 

ballot initiative are the Attorney General and the 

21 governor, so that if the Attorney General and the 

22 governor don't like the ballot initiative, it will go 

23 undefended? Is that your position? 

24  MR. OLSON: I don't -- I don't think it's 

quite that limited. I think one of your colleagues

2 There could be an appointee of the State of California 

3 who had responsibility, fiduciary responsibility to the 

4 State of California and the citizens of California, to 

represent the State of California along --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- who would appoint 

7 him? The same governor that didn't want to defend the 

8 plebiscite? 

9  MR. OLSON: Well, that happens all the time. 

As you recall in the case of -- well, let's not spend 

11 too much time on independent counsel provisions, but --

attorney where there's a perceived conflict of 

16 interest --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose --

18  MR. OLSON: -- and that person would have a 

19 responsibility for the State and might have 

responsibility for the attorneys' fees. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there 

22 might be people out there with their own personal 

23 standing, someone who performs marriages and would like 

24 that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to 

perform same-sex marriages, or other people. We seem to

2 proponents here or the State. I'm not sure there aren't 

3 other people out there with individual personalized 

4 injury that would satisfy Article III. 

MR. OLSON: There might well be in -- in a 

6 different case. I don't know about this case. If there 

7 was, for example, this was an initiative measure that 

8 allocated certain resources of the State of California 

9 and the people -- maybe it was a binary system of people 

got resources and other people didn't get resources, 

11 there could be standing. Someone would show actual 

12 injury. 

13  The point, I guess, at the bottom of this is 

14 the Supreme Court -- this Court, decided in 

Raines v. Byrd that Congress couldn't specify members of 

16 Congress in that context even where the measure depleted 

17 or diminished powers of Congress --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, I think the 

19 bottom line --

JUSTICE ALITO: The States are not bound by 

21 the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies 

22 the Federal Constitution. You couldn't have a Federal 

23 initiative, for example. They're free of all that. 

24  So start from the proposition that a State 

has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State

1 law -- beyond dispute. The question then is, who 


2 represents the State?
 

3  Now, in a State that has initiative, the 


4 whole process would be defeated if the only people who 


could defend the statute are the elected public 

6 officials. The whole point -- you know this better than 

7 I do because you're from California -- the whole point 

8 of the initiative process was to allow the people to 

9 circumvent public officials about whom they were 

suspicious. 

11  So if you reject that proposition, what is 

12 left is the proposition that the State -- State law can 

13 choose some other person, some other group to defend the 

14 constitutionality of a State law. And the California 

Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this 

16 case are precisely those people. 

17  So how do you get around that? 

18  MR. OLSON: The only -- that's exactly what 

19 the California Supreme Court thought. The California 

Supreme Court thought that it could decide that the 

21 proponents, whoever they were, and this could be 

22 25 years after the election, it could be one of the 

23 proponents, it could be four of the proponents. They 

24 could have an interest other than the State because they 

have no fiduciary responsibility to the State. They may

3 appointed. They have no official responsibility to the 

4 State. 

And my only argument, and I know it's a 

6 close one because California thinks that this is the 

7 system. The California Supreme Court thought that this 

8 was a system that would be a default system. I'm 

9 suggesting from your decisions with respect to Article 

III that that takes more than that under --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, I think that 

12 you're not answering the fundamental fear. And so --

13 and -- and the amici brief that sets forth this test of 

14 fiduciary duty doesn't quite either. 

The assumption is that there are not 

16 executive officials who want to defend the law. They 

17 don't like it. No one's going to do that. So how do 

18 you get the law defended in that situation? 

19  MR. OLSON: I don't have an answer to that 

question unless there's an appointment process either 

21 built into the system where it's an officer of 

22 California or --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why -- why isn't this 

24 viewed as an appointment process that the in -- the 

ballot initiators have now become that body?

4 argument our opponents make. But it -- but it must be 


said that it happens all of the time. That Federal 

6 officials and State officials decide not to enforce a 

7 statute, to enforce a statute in certain ways. We don't 

8 then come in and decide that there's someone else ought 

9 to be in court for every particular --

JUSTICE BREYER: What the brief says is, of 

11 course, you can appoint people. It's not just that you 

12 appoint them, it's that the State's interest when it 

13 defends a law is the interest in executing the law of 

14 the State. So all you have to do is give a person that 

interest. But when a person has the interest of 

16 defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of 

17 the State of California, there can be all kinds of 

18 conflicts, all kinds of situations. 

19  That's what I got out of the brief. So give 

the person that interest. And that, they say, is what's 

21 missing here. And you'll say -- I mean, that's --

22 that's here, and you say it's missing here.

6 conflicts of interest. And as I said, you'd be -- could 

7 be incurring enormous legal fees, on behalf of the 

8 State, when the State hasn't decided to go that route. 

9 I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You should feel free 

11 to move on to the merits. 

12  MR. OLSON: Thank you, Your Honor. As I 

13 pointed out at the -- at the outset, this is a measure 

14 that walls off the institution of marriage, which is not 

society's right. It's an individual right that this 

16 Court again and again and again has said the right to 

17 get married, the right to have the relationship of 

18 marriage is a personal right. It's a part of the right 

19 of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of 

happiness. 

21  In the cases in which you've described the 

22 right to get married under the Constitution, you've 

23 described it as marriage, procreation, family, other 

24 things like that. So the procreation aspect, the 

responsibility or ability or interest in procreation is

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure, 

3 counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right 

4 to view this as excluding a particular group. When the 

institution of marriage developed historically, people 


6 didn't get around and say let's have this institution, 


7 but let's keep out homosexuals. The institution 


8 developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, 


9 didn't include homosexual couples. 


It is -- yes, you can say that it serves 

11 some of the other interests where it makes sense to 

12 include them, but not all the interests. And it seems 

13 to me, your friend argues on the other side, if you have 

14 an institution that pursues additional interests, you 

don't have to include everybody just because some other 

16 aspects of it can be applied to them. 

17  MR. OLSON: Well, there's a couple of 

18 answers to that, it seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice. In 

19 this case, that decision to exclude gays and lesbians 

was made by the State of California. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, that's only 

22 because Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California

7 Protection and Due Process Clauses of that California 

8 Constitution did not permit excluding gays and lesbians 

9 from the right to get married --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you've led me right

12 Supreme Court decides what the law is. That's what we 

13 decide, right? We don't prescribe law for the future. 

14 We -- we decide what the law is. I'm curious, when --

when did -- when did it become unconstitutional to 

16 exclude homosexual couples from marriage? 1791? 1868, 

17 when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted? 

18  Sometimes -- some time after Baker, where we 

19 said it didn't even raise a substantial Federal 

question? When -- when -- when did the law become this? 

21  MR. OLSON: When -- may I answer this in the

12 citizens, who are a class based upon their status as

characteristic of individuals that they cannot control, 

6 and that that --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. When did that 

8 happen? When did that happen?

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how am I supposed to 

12 know how to decide a case, then --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you can't give me a 

16 date when the Constitution changes? 

17  MR. OLSON: -- in -- the case that's before 

18 you today, California decided -- the citizens of 

19 California decided, after the California Supreme Court 

decided that individuals had a right to get married 

21 irrespective of their sexual orientation in California 

22 and then the Californians decided in Proposition 8, wait

the -- also would make the -- that distinguishes it in 

6 one respect. But what also -- also -- I would also make 

7 the argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that we are -- this --

8 marriage is a fundamental right and we are making a 

9 classification based upon a status of individuals, which 

this Court has repeatedly decided that gays and lesbians 

11 are defined by their status. There is no question about 

12 that. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: So it would be 

14 unconstitutional even in States that did not allow 

civil unions?

17 could write a narrower decision.

3 equal schools were permissible, a decision by this 

4 Court, when you decided that that was unconstitutional, 

when did that become unconstitutional? 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: 50 years ago, it was okay? 

7  MR. OLSON: I -- I can't answer that 

8 question and I don't think this Court has ever phrased 

9 the question in that way. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't either. That's the 

11 problem. That's exactly the problem. 

12  MR. OLSON: But what I have before you now, 

13 the case that's before you today is whether or not 

14 California can take a class of individuals based upon 

their characteristics, their distinguishing 

16 characteristics, remove from them the right of privacy, 

17 liberty, association, spirituality, and identity that --

18 that marriage gives them. 

19  It -- it is -- it is not an answer to say 

procreation or anything of that nature because 

21 procreation is not a part of the right to get married. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's really -- that's a 

23 broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the 

24 Court wants to reach it. The rationale of the Ninth 

Circuit was much more narrow. It basically said that

1 California, which has been more generous, more open to 

2 protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the 

3 Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being 

4 penalized for not going far enough. 

That's a very odd rationale on which to 

6 sustain this opinion. 

7  MR. OLSON: This Court has always looked 

8 into the context. In, for example, the New Orleans case 

9 involving the gambling casinos and advertising, you look 

at the context of what was permitted, what was not 

11 permitted, and does that rationalization for prohibiting 

12 in that case the advertising, in this case prohibiting 

13 the relationship of marriage, does it make any sense in 

14 the context of what exists? 

JUSTICE ALITO: Oh seriously, Mr. Olson, 

16 if California provides all the substantive benefits of 

17 marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you 

18 seriously arguing that if California -- if the State --

19 if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't 

provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this 

21 case would come out differently? 

22  MR. OLSON: No, I don't think it would come 

23 out differently because of the fundamental arguments 

24 we're making with respect to class-based distinctions 

with respect to a fundamental right. However, to the

1 extent that my opponent in the context of California, 


2 talks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of
 

3 rights of people to live together and that sort of 


4 thing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of 


California because California's already made a decision 

6 that gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable 

7 as parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're 

8 raising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on 

9 the other side specifically said and testified that they 

would be better off when their parents were allowed to 

11 get married. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think you can have 

13 it both ways. Either this case is the same, this would 

14 be the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma or it's 

different because it's California and California has 

16 provided all these --

17  MR. OLSON: I -- I think that it's not that 

18 we're arguing that those are inconsistent. If the -- if 

19 the fundamental thing is that denying gays and lesbians 

the right of marriage, which is fundamental under your 

21 decisions, that is unconstitutional. If it is -- if the 

22 State comes forth with certain arguments -- Utah might 

23 come forth with certain justifications. California 

24 might come forth with others. But the fact is that 

California can't make the arguments about adoption or

about -- it's just about the label in this case. 

6  MR. OLSON: The label is like --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same-sex couples 

8 have every other right, it's just about the label. 

9  MR. OLSON: The label "marriage" means 

something. Even our opponents --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. If you 

12 tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be 

13 their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, 

14 this is my friend, but it changes the definition of what 

it means to be a friend. 

16  And that's it seems to me what the -- what 

17 supporters of Proposition 8 are saying here. You're --

18 all you're interested in is the label and you insist on 

19 changing the definition of the label. 

MR. OLSON: It is like you were to say you 

21 can vote, you can travel, but you may not be a citizen. 

22 There are certain labels in this country that are very, 

23 very critical. You could have said in the Loving case,

interracial union. Everyone would know that that was

4 how do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary 

part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a 

6 fundamental right? That's -- you've emphasized that and 

7 you've said, well, it's because of the emotional 

8 commitment. Maybe it is the procreative aspect that 

9 makes it a fundamental right. 

MR. OLSON: But you have said that marriage 

11 is a fundamental right with respect to procreation and 

12 at the same level getting married, privacy -- you said 

13 that in the Zablocki case, you said that in the Lawrence 

14 case, and you said it in other cases, the Skinner case, 

for example. 

16  Marriage is put on a pro -- equal footing 

17 with procreational aspects. And your -- this Court is 

18 the one that has said over and over again that marriage 

19 means something to the individual. The privacy, 

intimacy, and that it is a matter of status and 

21 recognition in this --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom

accept that the State has probably an overbearing 

6 interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of 

7 age to marry, but what's left? 

8  MR. OLSON: Well, you've said -- you've said 

9 in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy 

issue, multiple marriages raises questions about 

11 exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to 

12 taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely 

13 different thing. And if you -- if a State prohibits 

14 polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. 

If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens 

16 from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise 

17 of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them 

18 as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as 

19 you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, 

you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them 

21 the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important, 

22 and vital in this society, and it has status and 

23 stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case. There's

6 it as the Ninth Circuit did --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem -- the problem 

8 with the case is that you're really asking, particularly 

9 because of the sociological evidence you cite, for us to 

go into uncharted waters, and you can play with that

17 all the way or 70 percent of the way, and you're doing 

18 so in a case where there's a substantial question on --

19 on standing. I just wonder if -- if the case was 

properly granted. 

21  MR. OLSON: Oh, the case was certainly 

22 properly granted, Your Honor. I mean, there was a full

6 the Romer case, that it could be decided on the narrower 

7 issue, but it certainly was an appropriate case to 

8 grant. And those issues that I've been describing are 

9 certainly fundamental to the case. And -- and I don't 

want to abuse the Court's indulgence, that what I -- you 

11 suggested that this is uncharted waters. It was 

12 uncharted waters when this Court, in 1967, in the Loving

14 on interracial marriages, which still existed in 16 

States, were unconstitutional.

4 we don't have a formal position. 

But we do think that with respect to 

6 standing, that at this point with the initiative process 

7 over, that Petitioners really have what is more in the 

8 nature of a generalized grievance and because they're 

9 not an agent of the State of California or don't have 

any other official tie to the State that would -- would 

11 result in any official control of their litigation, that 

12 the better conclusion is that there's not Article III 

13 standing here. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, tomorrow you're going 

to be making a standing argument that some parties think 

16 is rather tenuous, but today, you're -- you're very 

17 strong for Article III standing?

19 a -- we said this was a close question, and -- and our 

interests are, Justice Alito, in tomorrow's issues where 

21 we have briefed the matter thoroughly and will be 

22 prepared to discuss it with the Court tomorrow. 

23  With respect to the merits, two fundamental 

24 points lead to the conclusion that there's an equal 

protection violation here. First, every warning flag 

51

1 that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case. 

2 And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the 

3 Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply 

4 highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as 

though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of 

6 treating opticians less favorably than optometrists, 

7 when it really is the polar opposite of such a law. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, I could 

9 understand your argument if you were talking about the 

entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's 

11 only eight or nine States, the States that permit civil 

12 unions, and that's -- brings up a question that was 

13 asked before. So a State that has made considerable 

14 progress has to go all the way, but at least the 

government's position is, if it has done -- the State 

16 has done absolutely nothing at all, then it's -- it can 

17 do -- do as it will. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- that gets to my 

19 second point, Your Honor, which is that I do think the 

problem here with the arguments that Petitioners are 

21 advancing is that California's own laws do cut the legs 

22 out from under all of the justifications that 

23 Petitioners have offered in defense of Proposition 8. 

24 And I understand Your Honor's point and the point that 

Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this

1 Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the

3 forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the 

4 actual substance of California law. 

And here, with respect to California law, 

6 gay and lesbian couples do have the legal rights and 

7 benefits of marriage, full equality and adoption, full 

8 access to assistive reproduction, and therefore, the 

9 argument about the State's interests that -- that 

Petitioners advance have to be tested against that 

11 reality, and -- and they just don't measure up. None of 

12 the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: What is the one -- look, a 

17 State that does nothing for gay couples hurts them much 

18 more than a State that does something. And, of course, 

19 it's true that it does hurt their argument that they do 

quite a lot, but which are their good arguments, in your 

21 opinion? I mean, take a State that really does nothing 

22 whatsoever. 

23  They have no benefits, no nothing, no 

24 nothing. Okay? And moreover, if -- if you're right,

1 or -- you know, if a pact is enough, they won't get

3 because they're not married. So -- so a State that does 

4 nothing hurts them much more, and yet your brief seems 

to say it's more likely to be justified under the 

6 Constitution. 

7  I'd like to know with some specificity how 

8 that could be. 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, because you have to 

measure the -- under the standard of equal protection 

11 scrutiny that we think this Court's cases require. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: I know the principle, but 

13 I'm saying which are their good arguments, in your 

14 opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the 

State that does nothing, but not good enough to overcome 

16 California where they do a lot? 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we -- what we're --

18 what we're saying about that is that we're not prepared 

19 to close the door to an argument in another State where 

the State's interests haven't cut the legs out from 

21 under the arguments. And I think -- I suppose the 

22 caution rationale that Mr. Cooper identified with 

23 respect to the effects on children, if it came up in a 

24 different case with a different record, after all here, 

this case was litigated by Petitioners on the theory

1 that rational basis applied and they didn't need to show

3  Our view is that heightened scrutiny should 

4 apply and so I don't want to -- I don't want to kid 

about this, we understand, that would be a very heavy 

6 burden for a State to meet. All we're suggesting is 

7 that in a situation in which the -- the State interests 

8 aren't cut out from under it, as they -- as they are 

9 here, that that issue ought to remain open for a future 

case. And I -- and I think the caution rationale would 

11 be the one place where we might leave it open. But you 

12 can't leave it open in this case. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, there is an 

14 irony in that, which is the States that do more have 

less rights. 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well -- well, I 

17 understand that, Your Honor, but I do think that you 

18 have to think about the claim of right on the other side 

19 of the equation here. And in this situation, 

California -- the argument here that -- that gay and 

21 lesbian couples can be denied access to marriage on the 

22 ground of an interest in responsible procreation and 

23 child rearing just can't stand up given that the parents

full equality apart from --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: You want us to assess the 

2 effects of same-sex marriage, the potential effects 

3 on -- of same-sex marriage, the potential -- the effects 

4 of Proposition 8. But what is your response to the 

argument, which has already been mentioned about the 

6 need to be cautious in light of the newness of the --

7 the concept of -- of same-sex marriage? 

8  The one thing that the parties in this case 

9 seem to agree on is that marriage is very important. 

It's thought to be a fundamental building block of 

11 society and its preservation essential for the 

12 preservation of society. Traditional marriage has been 

13 around for thousands of years. Same-sex marriage is 

14 very new. I think it was first adopted in The 

Netherlands in 2000. So there isn't a lot of data about 

16 its effect. And it may turn out to be a -- a good 

17 thing. It may turn out not to be a good thing, as the 

18 supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe. 

19  But you want us to step in and render a 

decision based on an assessment of the effects of this 

21 institution, which is newer than cell phones or the 

22 Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the 

23 ability to see the future.

1 either acting through initiatives and referendums or 

2 through their elected public officials? 

3  GENERAL VERRILLI: I have four points I 

4 would like to make to that in response to that, 

Justice Alito, and I think they are all important. 

6  First, California did not, through 

7 Proposition 8, do what my friend Mr. Cooper said and 

8 push a pause button. They pushed a delete button. This 

9 is a permanent ban. It's in the Constitution. It's 

supposed to take this issue out from the legislative 

11 process. So that's the first point. 

12  Second --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just in response to 

14 that, of course the Constitution could be amended, 

and -- and I think I read that the California 

16 Constitution has been amended 500 times. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: But the --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: So it's not exactly like the 

19 U.S. Constitution. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But it does -- of course 

21 not. But it is -- but the aim of this is to take it out 

22 of the normal legislative process. 

23  The second point is that, with respect to 

24 concerns that Your Honor has raised, California has been 

anything but cautious. It has given equal parenting 

57

1 rights, equal adoption rights. Those rights are on the 

2 books in California now and so the interest of 

3 California is -- that Petitioners are articulating, with 

4 respect to Proposition 8, has to be measured in that 

light. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but the rest of the 

7 country has been cautious. 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- and that's why --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: And we're -- and you are 

asking us to impose this on the whole country, not just 

11 California. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, respectfully 

13 Justice Scalia, we are not. Our position is narrower 

14 than that. Our position -- the position we have taken, 

is about States, it applies to States that have, like 

16 California and perhaps other States, that have granted 

17 these rights short of marriage, but --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want to -- I 

19 want you to get back to Justice Alito's other points, 

but is it the position of the United States that 

21 same-sex marriage is not required throughout the 

22 country? 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: We are not -- we are not 

24 taking the position that it is required throughout the 

country. We think that that ought to be left open for a

1 future adjudication in other States that don't have the 

2 situation California has. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your position is 

4 only if a State allows civil unions does it become 

unconstitutional to forbid same-sex marriage, right? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I see my red light 

7 is on. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can go on. 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you. 

Our position is -- I would just take out a 

11 red pen and take the word "only" out of that sentence. 

12 When that is true, then the Equal Protection Clause 

13 forbids the exclusion of same-sex marriage and it's an 

14 open question otherwise. 

And if I could just get to the third reason, 

16 which I do think is quite significant. 

17  The -- the argument here about caution is an 

18 argument that, well, we need to wait. We understand 

19 that. We take it seriously. But waiting is not a 

neutral act. Waiting imposes real costs in the here and 

21 now. It denies to the -- to the parents who want to 

22 marry the ability to marry, and it denies to the 

23 children, ironically, the very thing that Petitioners 

24 focus on is at the heart of the marriage relationship. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are willing

1 to wait in the rest of the country. You saying it's got 

2 to happen right now in California, but you don't even 

3 have a position about whether it's required in the rest 

4 of the country. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: It -- if, with respect to 

6 a State that allows gay couples to have children and to 

7 have families and then denies the stabilizing effect --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's got to 

9 happen right away in those States where same-sex couples 

have every legal right that married couples do. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we think --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can wait in 

13 States where they have fewer legal rights. 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: What I said is it's an 

open question with respect to those States and the Court 

16 should wait and see what kind of a record a State could 

17 make. But in California you can't make the record to 

18 justify the exclusion. 

19  And the fourth point I would make on this, 

recognizing that these situations are not --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would the record be 

22 different elsewhere? 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, they might try to 

24 make a different record about the effects on children. 

But there isn't a record to that effect here.

1  And the fourth point I would make, and I do 

2 think this is significant, is that the principal 

3 argument in 1967, with respect to Loving and that the 

4 Commonwealth of Virginia advanced was, well, the social 

science is still uncertain about how biracial children 

6 will fare in this world, and so you ought to apply 

7 rational basis scrutiny and wait. And I think the Court 

8 recognized that there is a cost to waiting and that that 

9 has got to be part of the equal protection calculus. 

And so -- so I do think that's quite fundamental. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you a 

12 problem about --

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: Sure. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I -- it seems to 

me that your position that you are supporting is 

16 somewhat internally inconsistent. We see the argument 

17 made that there is no problem with extending marriage to 

18 same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex 

19 couples are doing just fine and there is no evidence 

that they are being harmed. 

21  And the other argument is Proposition 8 

22 harms children by not allowing same-sex couples to 

23 marriage. Which is it? 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I -- I think what 

Proposition 8 does is deny the long-term stabilizing

1 effect that marriage brings. That's -- that's the 

2 argument for -- for marriage, that --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you also tell me 

4 there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex 

couples. 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: California -- there are 

7 37,000 children in same-sex families in California now. 

8 Their parents cannot marry and that has effects on them 

9 in the here and now. 

A stabilizing effect is not there. When 

11 they go to school, they have to -- you know -- they 

12 don't have parents like everybody else's parents. 

13 That's a real effect, a real cost in the here and now. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the real cost right 

now would be you're asking me to write these words, "a 

16 State that has a pact has to say 'marriage,'" but I'm 

17 not telling you about States that don't. Well, I would 

18 guess there is a real-world effect there, too. That 

19 States that are considering pacts will all say, we won't 

do it, or not all, but some would. 

21  And that would have a real effect right now. 

22 And at the moment, I'm thinking it's much more harmful 

23 to the gay couple, the latter than the former. But you 

24 won't give me advice as the government as to how to deal 

with that.

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we -- we think 

2 that, as I started my argument, Your Honor, that all the 

3 warning flags for exacting equal protection scrutiny are 

4 present here. This is a group that has suffered a 

history of terrible discrimination. The Petitioners 

6 don't deny it. 

7  Petitioners said at the podium today that 

8 there is no justification for that discrimination in any 

9 realm other than the one posed in this case and the --

and so when those two factors are present, those are 

11 paradigm considerations for the application of 

12 heightened scrutiny, and so I don't want to suggest that 

13 in States that haven't taken those steps --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they are not the 

only ones. 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- that States that 

17 haven't taken this step, that they are going to have an 

18 easy time meeting heightened scrutiny, which I think has 

19 to apply --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose one of 

21 those States repeals its civil union laws? 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: It would be a different 

23 case. And all I'm saying is that the door ought to 

24 remain open to that case, not that it would be easy for 

the State to prevail in that case.

4  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

6  MR. COOPER: Thank you very much. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you might address why 

8 you think we should take and decide this case. 

9  MR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor, and that is 

the one thing on which I wholeheartedly agree with my 

11 friend Mr. Olson. This case was properly -- is now 

12 properly before the Court and was properly granted, even 

13 if, even if, Your Honor, one could defend the -- the 

14 specific judgment below for the Ninth Circuit, a defense 

that I haven't heard offered to this Court. Judicial 

16 redefinition of marriage even in -- even if it can be 

17 limited to California, is well worthy of this Court's 

18 attention, particularly, Your Honor, as it come from a 

19 single district court judge in a single jurisdiction. 

I would also like --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that begs 

22 your -- Mr. Olson doesn't really focus on this. If the 

23 issue is letting the States experiment and letting the 

24 society have more time to figure out its direction, why 

is taking a case now the answer?

4 to 1954. 

MR. COOPER: Your Honor, it is hard to --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And now we are only 

7 talking about, at most, four years. 

8  MR. COOPER: It is hard to imagine a case 

9 that would be better, or more thoroughly, I should say, 

at least, briefed and argued to this Court. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's too late for that, too 

12 late for that now, isn't it? I mean, we granted cert. 

13 I mean, that's essentially asking -- you know, why did 

14 we grant cert. We should let it percolate for 

another -- you know, we -- we have crossed that river, I 

16 think. 

17  MR. COOPER: And in this particular case, to 

18 not grant certiorari is to essentially bless a judicial 

19 decision that there -- that at least in the State of 

California, the people have no authority to step back, 

21 hit the pause button, and allow the experiments that are 

22 taking place in this country to further mature. That in 

23 fact, at least in California -- and it's impossible to 

24 limit this ruling, Your Honor, even to California, even 

the Solicitor General's argument, he says, applies to at

1 least eight States. 

2  It's impossible to limit these -- these 

3 propositions to any particular jurisdiction, so this 

4 Court would be making a very real decision with respect 

to same-sex marriage if it should simply decide to 

6 dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, 

7 Justice Kennedy. 

8  And let's -- let's just step back and just 

9 consider for a moment the Solicitor General's argument. 

He is basically submitting to the Court that essentially 

11 the one compromise that is not available to the States 

12 is the one that the State of California has undertaken. 

13 That is, to go as far as the people possibly can in --

14 in honoring and recognizing the families and the 

relationships of same-sex couples, while still 

16 preserving the existence of traditional marriage as an 

17 institution. That's the one thing that's off the table. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he was saying 

19 -- I thought he was saying, Mr. Cooper, that it's not 

before the Court today. And remember Loving against 

21 Virginia was preceded by the McLaughlin case. So first 

22 there was the question of no marriage, and then there 

23 was marriage. 

24  So in that sense I understood the Solicitor 

General to be telling us that case is not before the

6  MR. COOPER: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was cohabitation of 

8 people of different races. 

9  MR. COOPER: Certainly. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Court took that 

11 case and waited to reach the marriage case. 

12  MR. COOPER: It's -- yes, Your Honor. And 

13 well, forgive me, Your Honor. I'm not sure -- I'm not 

14 sure I'm following the Court's question. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I may -- my memory may be 

16 wrong, but I think the case was that people of different 

17 races were arrested and charged with the crime of 

18 interracial cohabitation. And the Court said that that 

19 was invalid. 

MR. COOPER: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Unlawful. 

22  MR. COOPER: Yes. Thank you, Your Honor. 

23 Forgive me. And -- you know, I'm glad that counsel for 

24 the Respondents mentioned the Loving case because what

1 patently obvious, is that the colors of the skin of the 

2 spouses is irrelevant to any legitimate purpose, no more 

3 so than their hair colors, any legitimate purpose of 

4 marriage, that interracial couples and same-race couples 

are similarly situated in every respect with respect to 

6 any legitimate purpose of marriage. 

7  That's what this question really boils down 

8 here, whether or not it can be said that for every 

9 legitimate purpose of marriage, are opposite-sex couples 

and same-sex couples indistinguishable? 

11 Indistinguishable. And with all due respect to counsel 

12 and to the Respondents, that is not a hard question. 

13  If, in fact, it is true, as the people of 

14 California believe that it still is true, that the 

natural procreative capacity of opposite-sex couples 

16 continues to pose vitally important benefits and risks 

17 to society and that's why marriage itself is the 

18 institution that society has always used to regulate 

19 those heterosexual, procreative -- procreative 

relationships. 

21  Counsel -- the Solicitor General has said 

22 that -- that the ban that the proposition erects in 

23 California is permanent. Well, it's -- certainly that 

24 is not the view of the Respondents and what we read
