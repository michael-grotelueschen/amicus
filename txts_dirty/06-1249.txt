 (10:06 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-1249, Wyeth v. Levine.

 Mr. Waxman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case concerns conflict pre-emption 

under the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented 

here is stark. Repeatedly over the years, the FDA 

approved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under 

all the conditions and methods of use described in the 

labeling, including what is referred to as "IV push" 

injection. Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk 

that the FDA had considered, determined that the precise 

labeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact 

rendered Phenergan "unreasonably dangerous." That --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just at the outset, I'll 

just make one comment. You argue that it's impossible 

for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same 

time the Federal label. As a textual matter, as a 

logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that. I 

think I could design a label that's completely

consistent and that meets the requirements that the 

Respondents wish to urge.

 Now, if you want to say that any alteration 

of the label violates Federal law, that's something 

else. But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as 

a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me make sure, because 

I do think we do agree, and I want to make sure that I'm 

understood, Justice Kennedy. I think what you've 

articulated is the test which is, is it possible for a 

regulated party to comply at the same time with both 

Federal law and State law? In other words, could they 

use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use 

the precise label that in approving the application in 

1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the 

label that the Vermont jury determined should be used, 

and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening 

and the closing a statement that you may not, should not 

use IV administration or IV push, in other words that 

you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate 

something --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --

MR. WAXMAN: -- that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't say -- it 

didn't say IV across the board. It said IV push is the

claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was 

aware of the IV use and a certain risk. But did it 

ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV 

administered the usual way by a drip bag?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg, 

and I want to cite you to the portions of the record 

that demonstrate that it did. But before I do so, I 

just want to underscore a point that I think is clear 

from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief, 

which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event. 

The question is what did the labeling say and upon what 

information was the labeling decision made.

 But as to your particular question, there 

are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record 

from multiple parties, including experts from both 

sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of 

administration and the risk, including IV push. Their 

experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the 

labeling requires. But most saliently, the labeling in 

this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic 

size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the 

petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint 

appendix, have four separate reference that, as we 

explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply 

to IV push.

There is a reference to the use of the Tubex 

system. That is a direct IV push system. There is a 

reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles. 

Again nothing to do with drip. There is a reference to 

a maximum rate of administration.  Drip is gravity. The 

testimony in the case was that an instruction that a 

particular rate of administration not be exceeded only 

referred to IV push. And finally, there are cautions on 

the label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to 

see if its bright or dark, which is only done in the 

context of a needle that is being used to push something 

into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case 

because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately.

 So the labeling plainly comprehended and 

warned about the specific risks of IV push 

administration, and that's not all. There is an 

advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to 

look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to 

Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is 

administered intravenously and it made specific 

recommendations, including recommendations that go 

directly to IV push.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How could the -- how could 

the FDA concluded that IV push was safe and effective 

when on the benefit side of this you don't have a

life-saving drug, you have a drug that relieves nausea, 

and on the risk side you have the risk of gangrene?

 MR. WAXMAN: I mean, there was testimony --

Justice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there 

is -- there was testimony in this very case about those 

very circumstances in which direct IV injection is 

indicated. And there is also test -- there is also 

evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the 

1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the 

context of talking about what warnings had to be 

provided. The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20 

medical journals that addressed this problem, and in 

footnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that 

specifically address the circumstances in which IV push 

administration is an important tool. The point here is, 

I think, that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't answer 

the question of was it -- the risk of gangrene and 

amputation is there. No matter what benefit there was, 

how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, this is 

labeling that is directed at medical professionals. It 

is labeling that is directed at physicians, who have to 

be able to determine what method, what pharmaceutical 

and what method of administration to use, given the

constellation of risks and benefits that a particular 

patient --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The FDA was never 

concerned with risks versus benefit?

 MR. WAXMAN: The FDA -- well, the FDA 

certainly is. And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is 

the FDA has to decide what information to provide to 

clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to 

use. And it -- what it did here is it provided ample, 

lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial 

injection and exposure of an irritant drug like 

Phenergan to arterial blood. It provided in the 

labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of 

methods of administration. It said intramuscular 

injection is the preferred method. It then said with 

respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any 

irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it 

into an IV infusion set that is known to be running 

properly, in other words where a line has already been 

established into the vein and the IV push occurs into 

the line that's already established.

 All that information was available to 

physicians and the FDA has to understand and does 

understand that in labeling to allow medical 

professionals to make their judgments, taking options

away from physicians is not always better. It may 

not -- it may not even often be better. What the FDA 

has to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on 

the table and what's off the table and in terms of 

what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is 

this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted? 

The testimony in this case and in the administrative 

record was yes, there are circumstances --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like you to 

address the distinction between the medical device area 

and the drug area because in the medical device area, of 

course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while 

here in contrast you don't.

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. I mean, I think, 

Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in 

which this is difference than the medical device area. 

But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case 

directly points the Court to the nature of the 

determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3 

drugs. It goes through the same preclearance process. 

As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice 

Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing 

time-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical 

devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and 

it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the

particular drug in light of the conditions and methods 

of administration prescribed in the labeling.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If that's true you 

would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a 

similar express pre-emption provision. And one reason 

perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was 

passed you had an established background of State 

actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you 

didn't.

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me address both the 

established background of State actions and then the 

pre-emption clause difference, if I may. The Respondent 

and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150 

years in which tort actions have been brought with 

respect to pharmaceuticals. Very few of those cases --

and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that 

the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is 

where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the 

information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling 

standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can 

reach a different conclusion about what is on the label. 

The most -- those cases I believe all post-date 

Cipollone. Many of them postdate Geier. And by my 

count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of 

the cases that have been decided and those issues --

that issue had never come up and never could have come 

up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was 

only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific, 

preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the 

FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of 

licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance 

safety against effectiveness.

 And so the -- the constellation of common 

law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are 

not seeking here a rule of field preemption. We are not 

seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that 

violates Federal law.

 What we are saying here is -- and this goes, 

I think, finally to your point about the express 

pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed 

pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a 

savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot 

affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the 

Federal Constitution.

 Now, members of this Court are concerned 

about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis 

of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is 

heartland. A jury was asked to look at the same 

information and conclude that the precise language that 

the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to

use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it required it 

because that is what the FDA had approved as a label. 

But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the 

company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any 

time and said, either based on experience or just our 

rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label 

ought to be changed to say "Don't use IV push." Wyeth 

could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't 

do it.

 And the -- the reason I raise this is 

because it could have done it at any time, where, going 

back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the 

conflict?

 MR. WAXMAN: The liability in this case was 

not predicated on the fact that Wyeth didn't go to the 

-- remember, the FDA had approved this label two years 

before Miss Levine was injured. In approving the label, 

it rejected stronger proposed language that Wyeth had 

presented. There was nothing that was -- Wyeth was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But as I understand it, 

Wyeth's argument is not this argument. Wyeth is not 

saying the reason there is a conflict here is that we 

tried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury, 

in effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't

allow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict 

between a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont 

rule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied.

 MR. WAXMAN: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, Wyeth's 

argument is: Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the 

standard of conflict. It doesn't matter whether we 

tried or could have tried or didn't try. You simply 

look at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury 

did; and if there is a -- if there is a difference 

between them, there is a conflict. Am I right about 

your argument?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, you are right. We -- we 

have both an impossibility form of conflict because, in 

the absence of any new information or new analyses of 

old information, we could not make the change in advance 

of getting approval. And we also have an -- an 

objects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption 

because the Vermont jury decided on the same information 

that the labeling that the FDA had approved and required 

was unreasonably unsafe.

 And we cannot have a world in which the very 

day after an intensive process -- the FDA says you may 

distribute this drug, but you must use this specific 

language -- either, A, manufacturers can just run in and

change the label and ask for permission down the road; 

or, B, that a State jury -- let's take the easier case 

-- a State legislature or 50 State legislatures can 

decide: Because you could have gone back and asked, we 

can impose an obligation on you that you must have done 

so or must have changed the labeling. That just is 

inconsistent with --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it -- is it strict 

liability or negligence? In other words, are they 

saying you must have done so, or are they saying because 

you could have done so and didn't you did not conform to 

the standard of care?

 MR. WAXMAN: Either a negligence theory or a 

strict-liability theory would be pre-empted.

 May I reserve the balance of my time.

conflict with the FDA's determination that Phenergan 

injection is safe and effective under the conditions of 

use recommended or suggested in the labeling.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, at the 

outset, would you clarify something that is central, I 

think, to this case? Some of the briefs tell us that 

this represents a change of policy on the part of the 

FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts 

were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's 

own efforts to protect consumers. They helped because 

they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that 

were either unknown or under- evaluated. Was that once 

the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?

 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA, to my 

knowledge, has never taken the position that -- that, as 

a general matter, a manufacturer may change a label 

without -- without the existence of new information that 

justifies a revision. The Respondents and the amici 

relied primarily on some snippets of rule-making 

proceedings and things like that in which FDA has 

referred to the existence of tort remedies. But we are 

not arguing for the proposition that tort remedies are 

-- are pre-empted as a general matter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But when -- when would 

there be a tort remedy? What -- what situation would

 MR. KNEEDLER: As Mr. Waxman mentioned, if 

-- if the State standard was the same as the Federal 

standard, there wouldn't be any conflict. And, for 

example, if -- and not to mention the fact if there was 

adulteration of -- of the product or if the -- if the 

product in the box was not the same --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they found out 

about new information which would, if properly 

considered, alter what the labeling ought to be? Would 

there be a tort remedy for the failure to bring that new 

information to the attention of --

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the position we are 

arguing for here would not cover that situation, but --

but there could be a further situation of pre-emption, 

if I could just explain why. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean if you failed to 

provide the FDA the new information that you think 

negates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still 

couldn't be sued?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. If you -- if you failed 

to provide it altogether, there would not be a -- a 

pre-emption defense if there were -- if your 

failure-to-warn claim was based on the new information 

that you didn't furnish.

I was -- I was going to identify the 

situation where -- and this has come up in the anti-

depressant drug situation, for example, where there is 

evolving information. There has been a rule- making 

petition, in fact several over the years, to the FDA to 

change the labeling to warn against -- to warn about the 

possibility of suicidal ideation. And FDA has 

rejected that even though it's -- it's new information 

arising after the drug was approved. If the information 

is brought to the FDA's attention and FDA rejects the 

proposed change, then you would you have conflict 

pre-emption again. But if the information was never 

brought to the FDA's attention in the first place, then 

-- then there would -- it would be not inconsistent with 

Federal law to have a tort suit based on that. If it's 

-- if it's been proposed and rejected, then you're back 

with a conflict.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if you 

brought it to the FDA's attention and the FDA just 

hasn't acted on it? You would be authorized to change 

the label on your own.

 MR. KNEEDLER: You would be authorized, but 

if FDA then rejects -- rejects the labeling --

interim, you could -- could you be subject to a State

tort suit for not changing the label when -- when you 

had the power to do so?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- if -- if FDA has taken 

no action at all, then I think you -- you could be. I 

this it's very likely that FDA would have acted by the 

-- by the time that -- I mean, I suppose there could be 

a window in there before it was approved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is that -- why is 

that likely, considering the huge number of drugs? I 

mean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that 

have this approval. Is the FDA really monitoring every 

one of those to see if there is some new information 

that should change the label?

 MR. KNEEDLER: If I could make two points 

about that: The first is, as I said, we are not arguing 

that there is pre-emption in a situation where there is 

new information that is not brought to FDA's attention.

 But the second point is that in the 2007 

amendments to the Act, Congress recognized the 

difficulties with this and gave FDA important new 

enforcement tools and resources to go after the problem 

of things that arise after a drug is improved --

approved, that has given FDA the authority to direct a 

change in the label, which it did not have before.

 It has given the FDA the authority to order

new clinical studies, and it has ordered FDA to set up a 

data system where it will get electronic notification of 

-- of adverse events.

 I -- I should point out in the -- in the one 

year since these amendments were passed, FDA has, I -- I 

think, in 21 instances ordered clinical trials. In four 

instances it has ordered a revision of labeling. It has 

hired 430 new employees in the Center for Drug 

Evaluation and Research to address the post-marketing 

situation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't -- why isn't the 

fact that some certain number of people are getting 

gangrene, why isn't that new information?

 MR. KNEEDLER: The risk -- the way FDA --

and this is set forth in the changes being affected

JUSTICE BREYER: That was all passed long 

after the events here took place, I think.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but --

JUSTICE BREYER: So at the time, you read 

the regulation, I think a person would think that he was 

free drug manufacturer if he learned something new to 

strengthen -- strengthens the contraindication, put it 

in.

when it promulgated this regulation, it's been FDA's 

long-standing interpretation that only new information 

would justify a change.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't that be new?

 MR. KNEEDLER: New information means new 

information about a risk that is greater in severity or 

frequency. If you have --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you get a certain number 

of cases.

 MR. KNEEDLER: There is no claim -- there is 

no claim here that either of those -- in the record in 

this case, that either of those was true.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's because nobody 

brought up this new information point. So if nobody 

brought up the new information point at the trial and if 

the burden is on the manufacturer to show that it's 

pre-empted, isn't that the manufacturer's fault, because 

if you simply read the regulation, you wouldn't find any 

of all this complicated stuff about certain kinds of new 

information.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's a legal question not a 

factual. And it was argued to the Vermont --

Supreme Court, and I don't think -- I don't think that

Respondent -- Respondent has noted that it wasn't 

raised, but I don't think it's argued that it's waived. 

And I think for the Court to fully address this 

situation, I think it would be good to take into account 

FDA's -- certainly going forward that is the regulatory 

regime --

JUSTICE BREYER: But we are not making an 

advisory opinion. We are deciding this case. And this 

case here you say new information of a certain kind 

would be okay, nobody argued it. You read the reg, and 

it doesn't seem to make all these distinctions end of 

case. Since the manufacturer has the burden of going 

into this, which apparently it didn't do. So, now we 

have decided this case, and we go on to the next one.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. If I could make just 

one further --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to 

that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: If I could make one further 

point about that. And that is the -- this act sets up a 

prior approval situation. In other words, Congress 

wanted the FDA to look at the drug in advance, 

balance -- against benefits as this Court said in 

Rutherford, and -- Brown & Williamson, strike a balance 

and approve it.

It would be fundamentally inconsistent with 

a prior approval system to have a regime in which the 

very next day State law could require the manufacturer 

to change the very labeling that FDA has struck a 

balance --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand what 

we're talking about here. The new information was not 

brought up by either side --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- showing increased 

frequency or increased severity?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right?

 And supposedly, it was burden of the drug 

company to show --

MR. KNEEDLER: No. The drug company says 

it's pre-empted, and the only escape hatch from the 

preemption is new information.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree with -- you 

agree with Mr. Waxman that the FDA specifically 

addressed the risks and benefits of IV push as opposed 

to the risks of arterial exposures?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It specifically addressed in 

the labeling that the FDA approved, and I think that's 

all that needs to be looked at in -- it's just as in

Riegle, where the preemption turns on that device, in 

that case, and the labeling that was presented. Here 

the preemption turns on the labeling and the drug that 

was presented. And FDA regulations prohibit the change 

unless there is new information.

 If I could make one other point about 

Riegle. Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed 

preemption provision. But the reason why this Court 

found preemption in Riegle under that provision is very 

instructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the 

premarket approval process in the two situations are 

essentially the same.

 And what you had on the one hand was Federal 

action having the force of law like under the file rate 

doctrine or some administrative determination having the 

force of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a 

legal prohibition against changing that without new 

information. And on the state side, you have a rule of 

law under the common law of torts imposing a different 

obligation. Those are squarely termed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about 

changing but you can supplement without changing the 

label.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No -- no, you cannot. Any --

any change in the wording of -- of the label is a change

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 I'd like to start with regulation 201.80, 

which is set forth in an addendum to our brief at 19-A. 

The second sentence of which reads: "The labeling shall 

be revised -- this is after an applicant, a sponsor has 

obtained approval of the drug label -- "it shall be 

revised to include a warning as soon as there is 

reasonable evidence of an association of a serious risk 

with a drug. A causal relationship need not have been 

proved."

 The testimony at trial established that 

Wyeth knew or should have known from at least the '70s 

that there was a significance issue concerning IV push

risks.

 And, Justice Alito, in answer to your 

question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Those -- those 

risks were set forth on the labeling approved by the 

FDA. Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to 

include a warning as soon, as soon as there is 

reasonable evidence of an association of a serious 

hazard that the FDA has not considered. And that is not 

already addressed on the labeling. I mean to read it 

as -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered 

by the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out 

of it.

 MR. FREDERICK: FDA never considered any 

comparative risks of IV push versus IV drip. The 

evidence on this was clear. Wyeth had a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

various portions of the label in the record that 

Mr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the 

FDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks?

 MR. FREDERICK: What the evidence showed was 

that FDA certainly was aware that there are different 

forms of intravenous administration of drugs, but it 

never considered that the risk of IV push so greatly 

increased the risks of a catastrophic injury --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they have to. 

When they determine that it's safe to use it under those 

circumstances that necessarily includes a consideration 

of the risk. People can say it's safe for you to walk 

down the sidewalk. That doesn't mean there is no risk 

that you get hit by lightning or something else. It 

just means in evaluating them together, they determine 

that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a 

physician determines that that's the indicated method.

 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, here 

there was no way FDA could have made this determination 

because the risks of IV push are so catastrophic 

compared to the benefit which the testimony at trial 

showed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're just 

contradicting the label. The fact is they could not 

have approved that label unless they made that 

determination.

 Now, if you're telling me the FDA acted 

irresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA.

 MR. FREDERICK: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the labeling made it 

very clear that the preferred method of administering 

this medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that 

there were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push.

Moreover, your client didn't follow the 

labeling or your client's physician didn't follow the 

labeling prescription for IV push, did he?

 MR. FREDERICK: The testimony at trial 

showed that the doctor acted with a standard of care 

that was not negligent, and that was based on expert 

testimony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. Wait, wait. He 

administered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in 

excess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could 

safely be used for IV push.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the testimony at trial 

showed that that had no bearing on her injury, 

because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Had no bearing. Are you 

serious?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. It did. The testimony 

at trial from Dr. Green disputed that point. Both 

courts below rejected that notion.

 But the idea that a label is set in stone 

for all time misunderstands the way the process works. 

When FDA approves a drug with a drug label, it does so 

on the basis of small clinical trials with very few, 

sometimes as few as a thousand or a couple of thousand 

people. And when the drug is marketed and goes to lots

and lots of people that are not healthy, that are in 

different conditions, new problems arise. That's why 

the general -- the GAO found that over 51 percent of 

drugs have adverse drug events not known.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You established that there 

were new problems? I mean, if there were new problems, 

then -- then they could have simply supplemented the 

labeling. But did you establish that there were 

problems that had not been considered already by the 

FDA?

 I mean, the labeling says, you know, that 

this is dangerous to use -- use IV push. It made it 

very clear that it's dangerous.

 MR. FREDERICK: That was not our burden and 

that was not how the testimony came in at trial. But as 

the amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani, et al. at pages 54 

establishes had Wyeth been a reasonably prudent 

manufacturer over the years, it would have known that 

the risks of IV push so far outweigh any bearing 

negligible benefits, that it would have offered a 

stronger instruction, it would have moved to revise its 

label either with FDA approval or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It proposed a more 

restrictive label to the FDA, didn't it? And the FDA 

said, no, you use this label. In other words, it's --

what you're saying was not its call. It was the call of 

the FDA.

 MR. FREDERICK: Footnote one of the Vermont 

Supreme Court's opinion disputes that point, because it 

says the label was different. And if you compare what 

was submitted to FDA versus what FDA looked at, there 

was no reference to IV push risks creating the risk of 

catastrophic harm versus negligible, Justice Scalia.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your -- I 

thought your theory was that this type of administration 

of the drug should not be allowed. The label should not 

say here are the risks, here are the benefits. You --

your jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling 

that physicians should have this available.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, as the jury was 

instructed, Mr. Chief Justice, and the evidence came in 

at trial, it was -- it was somewhat larger than that in 

the sense that a State failure to warn claim doesn't 

prescribe particular wording. It simply says that the 

existing wording is inadequate. And if the case comes 

to this Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it simply says 

that if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't 

have to pay $10 million whenever it comes wrong. That's 

having the effect, as our case has established, imposing

a limitation on the label.

 MR. FREDERICK: But the label itself is not 

set in stone, Mr. Chief Justice. Manufacturers change 

their labels all the time as new drug risks come in. 

And the regulations provide that the manufacturer is 

responsible not only for the label, but for monitoring 

post-market information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your case depends 

upon us determining that the risk at issue here that was 

presented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did 

not consider?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. It's not dependent on 

that at all, Mr. Chief Justice. It is dependent on a 

finding that the manufacturer had a duty of due care and 

it didn't live up to that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it referred to new 

drug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you 

are saying manufacturers change it all the time as new 

drug risks become apparent?

 MR. FREDERICK: The testimony --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What you mean is whether or 

not new drug risks become apparent, they have to change, 

right?

know it? And here, the testimony at trial showed that 

an antinausea drug called Vistrol -- this is at page 79 

of the joint appendix -- caused amputations in two 

cases. Pfizer voluntarily removed IV push injection for 

that drug. This was information in Wyeth's files; Wyeth 

knew this from the 1970s; and yet it did nothing to 

change the Phenergan label.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose --

JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to the 

obligation in this case, may I go back to an earlier 

question that Justice Scalia asked you? And I -- I --

if you responded to this particular point, I didn't get 

it.

 He said that he understood that Wyeth had in 

fact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to 

strengthen the warning against IV push, and that request 

was -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created 

the conflict. What is your response to -- to the 

factual basis for that -- for that comment?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the FDA itself said in 

the Solicitor General's brief at page 25 that it was 

deemed to be a nonsubstantive change. These were 

changes that were being made --

least to -- to beef up the warning against using IV 

push? And if so, did the -- did the FDA reject it and 

say no, you can't do that.

 MR. FREDERICK: It was a different label and 

it was a different strength of warning, but it didn't 

have to do with the relative risks and benefits of IV 

push versus IV drip.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What would it --

MR. FREDERICK: That was the crucial point.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What would it have said?

 MR. FREDERICK: This is set out at footnote 

1 of the Vermont Supreme Court opinion, which is set out 

in the joint -- in the petition appendix at pages 4a to 

5a, and it goes on for two pages. But essentially what 

the -- what the comparison was was talking about the 

preferability of injecting it through the tubing of an 

intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning 

satisfactorily, which would suggest to most medical 

practitioners and was it the case in the trial testimony 

given by Dr. Green below, that that would suggest an IV 

drip, not IV push.

 When FDA then rejected it for -- for 

nonsubstantive reasons, it went back to the prior 

verbiage which is set out at 5a, which simply says if 

you put this drug in an artery the concentration can be

such that it will -- it will cause harm.

 But our point is that these kinds of risks 

come to light frequently with drugs that are on the 

market and the need to revise these labels is the duty 

of the manufacturer. Section 314. --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you also, to be 

clear on it, as I understand it, you do not accept the 

position that the FDA puts forward, that the obligation 

depends upon the accrual of new information.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, how you --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Any information, new or 

old, as I understand it, on your argument raises this 

obligation to -- to act.

 MR. FREDERICK: I think that the dispute is 

-- is what constitutes new information, because we don't 

take issue with the notion that new information can be 

new analysis of prior submitted data; and what the 

amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani et al. Points out is that 

there was a lot of unpublished information about the 

harms of Phenergan that was known to Wyeth or should 

have been known to Wyeth in the '80s and '90s that would 

have justified a change under the CEE regulations.

should be contraindicated and concluded it should not be

and prescribed the label that now appears on the drug; 

and then, as some of the other arguments have 

referenced, the very day after the FDA made that ruling, 

Ms. Levine was injured. Would you still -- would she 

still have a claim in your view, a non-pre-empted claim?

 MR. FREDERICK: That be pre-empted. And the 

reason it would be pre-empted is because the FDA would 

have considered and rejected on the basis of the same 

information or similar information the very duty that 

underlies the State claim.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So your argument is -- is 

predicated on the existence of new information. If 

there was no new information, then the claim is 

pre-empted?

 MR. FREDERICK: No, it's -- well, it is 

not -- I think there are two things to keep analytically 

clear. One is can the manufacturer come forward with a 

label change on the basis of -- of information that is 

assessing the risk or reassessing the risk, and under 

the -- under the regulations it's absolutely clear it 

can do that before FDA has approved it. It is subject 

to FDA disapproval.

doctors the information that enables them to make 

individualized risk determinations.

safety if you believe that the name of this game is

calls -- that the label is misbranded unless its 

labeling bears adequate directions for use and such 

adequate warnings against use in those pathological 

conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous 

to health or against unsafe dosage or methods or 

duration of administration or application.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that applies even if 

it's approved by the FDA?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. It's misbranded. And 

in the 1979 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying FDA approval 

doesn't -- doesn't give you any protection at all?

 MR. FREDERICK: It -- it provides you a 

basis for marketing your --- your product.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but -- but the 

marketing may be a misbranding?

 MR. FREDERICK: In -- the FDA itself said so 

in 1979 in 44 Federal Register, which we cite in our 

brief, that even an original label may be misbranded if 

the drug manufacturer subsequently learns that it was 

not adequate for the safe use of the drug.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well then, gee, then all of 

the qualifications you were making earlier about whether 

it's new information or a new assessment, that's 

irrelevant.

 MR. FREDERICK: No, it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying whenever it's 

unsafe, whatever the FDA has approved, you have a 

lawsuit.

 MR. FREDERICK: No. What I'm saying is that 

the information developed after the original label is 

approved, and it is not a floor and a ceiling --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there was nothing 

about new information in what you just said. You said 

it's misbranded if it's not safe, new information or 

not.

 MR. FREDERICK: And that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that -- is 

that your position?

 MR. FREDERICK: Our position is that the 

duty is on the manufacturer to make a safe label, and if 

the label is --

Scalia's point, as I understand your answer to an 

earlier question, on the day that the FDA approves the 

label, if there is no further information indicating

danger, then any liability that is based upon what the 

-- the kind of information that the FDA knew would be 

pre-empted. The only time -- you're saying pre-emption 

does not occur when there is -- forget the word "new" 

for a moment -- when there is further information, 

information in addition to what the FDA was told, 

whether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday; 

and if there is liability predicated on further 

information beyond what the FDA was told, then there is 

not pre-emption.

 Is that a fair statement of your position?

 MR. FREDERICK: That's fair, but let me just 

make clear that our test would require the FDA to 

consider and reject the specific basis on which the 

State law --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's a fair statement 

then you have to retract your -- your earlier assertion 

that whenever it's not safe it's misbranded. I mean --

MR. FREDERICK: I'm not going to retract 

that, Justice Scalia.

it's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just 

responded to Justice Souter?

information, which Congress has said for public safety 

reasons -- we are not doing a balancing here; we are 

doing this for public safety --

And if the label is not adequate for public 

safety it is a misbranded drug.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but if -- if the 

so-called misbranding is determined to be misbranding, 

based upon information which was given to the FDA, as I 

understand your position, you would admit that there was 

pre-emption.

 MR. FREDERICK: I -- I think there is 

pre-emption, but that does not mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So there --

MR. FREDERICK: Maybe there is no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, there is 

that one exception at least to the broad statement that 

you gave in answer to Justice Scalia?

 MR. FREDERICK: Let me try to untangle it 

this way. The fact that there is pre-emption and you 

cannot bring as State law failure-to-warn claim doesn't 

mean that the drug isn't misbranded under the Federal 

standard the FDA --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- but the 

misbranding is of no consequence to liability.

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, I think 

you're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption 

it may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery 

in a State tort suit.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. The -- the 

point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So misbranding under 

those circumstances is a purely theoretical concept.

 MR. FREDERICK: In that very hypothetical, 

yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. FREDERICK: But the point is that the 

failure is that the failure-to-warn claim tracks the 

misbranding provision; and if you look at the jury 

instructions in this case, the wording is very close to 

the wording of the misbranding provision in terms of the 

adequacy of the warning that must be provided.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick --

MR. FREDERICK: All State law is doing is 

providing a remedy that is absent from Federal law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I'd like to 

put the misbranding point to one side and just 

concentrate on pre-emption. And I understood you to 

agree with Justice Alito that there is a hypothetical 

case in which there would be pre-emption, and would you

tell me what particular fact distinguishes your case 

from his hypothetical?

 MR. FREDERICK: The fact is there was no 

consideration and rejection of a stronger IV push 

warning. There was no consideration by the FDA of IV 

push as a means of administration distinct from other 

intravenous forms that would lead to a different kind of 

risk-benefit balancing. So with the -- in the case 

where there would be pre-emption, FDA would be asked, we 

-- we want to put a stronger warning as against this --

FDA says: We don't think there is scientific evidence. 

Do not put that warning on the label.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So now, your friends 

on the other side said there was specific consideration 

of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and 

that that is laid forth in the labeling. So, as I 

understood your answer to be, all we have to do is 

simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA 

considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to 

general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we 

determine that they did not, then they lose.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the Vermont Supreme 

Court was quite emphatic about this, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't know 

if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it. I

mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm 

more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and 

they either address IV push separately or they don't.

 MR. FREDERICK: And you search in the joint 

appendix in vain for communications between Wyeth and 

FDA communicating about the particular risks of IV push.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- can you turn to 

the references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made? 

They said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely 

from IV drip bags.

 MR. FREDERICK: I will acknowledge that the 

references in some instances suggest IV push. There is 

no doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of 

intravenous administration, but our point is a starker 

one, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test 

of deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push 

versus IV drip. And it's that point that is crucial, 

because the catastrophic risks of IV push are so 

dramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety 

determination to allow this drug with its risks when 

there are corresponding benefits that create exactly the 

same kind of treatment of care for the patient.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is your argument that 

they couldn't have considered these comparative risks, 

because if they had, they would have come out

differently; because they didn't come out differently, 

we have to infer that they didn't consider it?

 MR. FREDERICK: It's two things: One, they 

didn't consider it and that's clearly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --

MR. FREDERICK: Second,

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from your analysis 

that they couldn't have or they would have come out 

differently, how did we know that they didn't consider 

it?

 MR. FREDERICK: There are communications 

that went back and forth between the company. These are 

set out in the joint appendix. They make no reference 

to IV push risks as distinct from --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And do these -- when you 

say "communications," do you mean starting with the 

original application for approval of the label?

 MR. FREDERICK: The original application 

actually is not known. It wasn't in Wyeth's files. 

This drug was approved in 1955. We don't know where the 

original label was, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, you are saying all the 

correspondence that we do know about, that is extant, 

fails to mention comparative risk.

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the label doesn't. I 

mean, the label ask discusses the high risk from IV push 

and sets forth particular cautions for that -- for that 

specific means of administration.

 MR. FREDERICK: It does not, Justice Scalia. 

The label says -- it's talking about intravenous 

administration. It does not distinguish between IV drip 

and IV push. And Dr. Matthew testified at trial that, 

based on the label, he would not have been able to make 

a treatment determination to distinguish between the 

two, and that had he had that information, he clearly 

would have given this drug to Diana Levine through the 

intravenous drip method. The label simply didn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we conclude that new 

information is the criterion for deciding this case, if 

we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset 

allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if 

there's new information, then the label has to be 

changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this 

verdict be sustained?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, I think it can be 

sustained on the basis of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Vermont court's 

opinion?

Vermont Supreme Court's opinion totally, because it does 

go into the area that you're talking about, Justice 

Kennedy, but if I could refer the Court to trial record 

testimony, which is set out in the joint appendix and 

more elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes 

clear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these 

comparative risks. It should have had a basis for 

changing its label or proposing to FDA a different 

label, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the 

Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care. 

And we think the judgment on that basis could be 

sustained.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: When did 

the duty on the part of Wyeth to have a different label 

arise, in your view?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think it probably arose in 

the early '70s when a -- when there was a published --

or there was an incident --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Did it arise before or 

after submitting the original drug application?

 MR. FREDERICK: A strong argument can be 

made that it would have been before the 1970s 

application when they were reformatting. These are old 

drugs. We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would 

have suggested that the original label determination in

1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the 

1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old 

drug to comply with new standards, it should have known 

and it certainly should have known by the 1990s when 

several amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan, 

which were in Wyeth's files. The people who analyzed 

these records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew 

or should have known by the 1990s. And that was clear 

by the testimony of experts that -- that showed the 

comparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the 

basis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that 

were nonpublished. They appeared to have been reported 

to FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the 

synthesis, to connect the dots between these very 

terrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to 

bring about a labeling change or a modification that 

would have saved lives. And that is a failure on the 

part of the manufacturer not to comply with its 

standards of due care and with the regulations which 

require health risk information to be the basis of 

modifications to the labeling.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that boil down to a 

claim that there was new information that was available 

between the original approval and the time of the 

lawsuit?

MR. FREDERICK: Well, by "original 

approval," do you mean 1955 or do you mean in 1998 and 

2000?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Either one. But is your 

theory really a theory based on new information or new 

judgment about old information?

 MR. FREDERICK: It would be on the basis, I 

think, of both. I think we would be able to establish 

that there was a justification on the basis of 

information before the reformatted labeling took place, 

and that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the 

basis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred 

with Phenergan in 1965.

 And the -- the important point here is that 

on the basis of new information, if you are going to 

conclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I 

would urge you to consider two things: One is that the 

burden of showing absence of new information is going to 

fall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a 

pre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued 

in the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is 

permitted. So, if there is information in the drug 

manufacturer's files that would be relevant to a 

determination of the breach of duty by the drug 

manufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done

before discovery can be done, there would be no way to 

get that information.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to put the burden on 

the manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10 

States have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption 

and inconsistent also with the instructions the jury 

received in this case, that you can consider the FDA 

label. So, I think, to me, what you say there is not 

borne out by what happened in this case or by those 

other States' --

MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me -- let me 

address that question because your question goes to the 

regulatory compliance defense and that is not a 

pre-emption defense. It is a defense based on State law 

that the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because 

it complied with the applicable regulations. In that --

under that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is 

going to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments 

to the trial court about whether or not that compliance 

negated or did not negate negligence. But pre-emption 

is a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at 

the outset of the lawsuit before information is 

obtained. And notably, before 2000, FDA did not have 

subpoena power of drug manufacturers. It did not have 

the power to force labeling changes. It didn't even

have the power to force drug manufacturers to make 

post-marketing studies.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The --the part I'm trying 

to figure out is this: Suppose it was before trial. I 

don't care, before or after. The plaintiff comes in 

with a claim. All right. Manufacturer: That's 

pre-empted. The claim is that you should have told the 

FDA and added something to your label. 

Manufacturer: That's preempted. Plaintiff: Well, you 

haven't read this reg here. The reg here which has been 

in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add 

something. I mean you can go and add something to show 

a contra indication, and that's the end of it.

 Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess, 

without the horrible things happening that Justice 

Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know. 

But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new 

information. I take it that's in 1982. That's the 

first time that happened.

 Now, if I'm right about that, what happens 

when no one says a word about that? Of course, if the 

manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe 

the plaintiff would have said: And it was new. It was 

new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word. Are you 

following what I'm saying?

MR. FREDERICK: I'm not totally, Justice 

Breyer, I confess, but let me try to address it this 

way.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm wondering still 

what happens. I believe what happened here is that in 

the argument in the lower courts, in the trial court, 

nobody said anything about the FDA's claim that the 

information necessary to just go ahead and change the 

label had to be new. Am I right about that?

 MR. FREDERICK: You are absolutely right 

about that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what I'm trying to 

figure out -- and I don't know if "burden of proof" is 

the right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who 

wins? If they had said a word about it, you need new 

information, maybe the manufacturer -- the plaintiff 

could have shown that the manufacturer had new 

information.

 MR. FREDERICK: I think the duty is always 

going to be on the manufacturer, Justice Breyer. The 

regulations at 314.80(b) establish that the -- that the 

manufacturer has the responsibility to do post-

marketing analysis and post-marketing surveys to 

determine the continuing safety of its drugs. If the 

manufacturer doesn't do that, it isn't complying with

the Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on 

them.

 And so in the case where there is silence, I 

would respectfully submit the manufacturer is not 

complying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there 

is current information about all of the side- effect 

risks of its drugs.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I want to make -- I do want to go to -- make a 

preliminary point about all the talk about misbranding 

here. The statute has two criminal prohibitions. One 

is misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive 

penalty. If the FDA subsequently finds that something 

is false or misleading, it CAN come after you for 

misbranding. But this case involves the criminal 

prohibition against distributing drugs for which there 

is not an approved, effective application. And that's 

what's at stake here.

 Now, the notion that there was any -- any 

misunderstanding in the trial court about whether there

was new information or whether there was -- there were 

incidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't 

evaluate the risk, is just flat wrong. The plaintiff 

tried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew 

about this risk. Wyeth knew about this risk for 

decades.

 That is what is so wrong. That is why he 

stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question. 

You decide this question. And there was never, ever a 

suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there 

have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single 

adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every 

analysis that it did to the FDA's attention.

 And what the record does show is that after 

-- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug 

application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the 

Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug 

Application, that did have more extensive, stronger 

warnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are 

all in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug 

applications, each one asking for more language, more 

warnings, about direct IV injection. It's not called 

"push." It's IV injection versus drip, which is a 

gravity method. And, in fact, Mr. Frederick 

says: Well, you know, in this case there could have

been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't 

really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it 

didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate 

something that the FDA-labeling required.

 That is exactly the opposite of what the 

trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing. 

What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it 

didn't say: Do not use by intravenous administration.

 With respect to whether or not the warning 

-- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987 

and is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it 

an original, but there is a typewritten version that 

actually has the text in the type size that one can 

actually read. At the summary-judgment stage that the 

pre-emption issue was decided -- may I finish my answer?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 MR. WAXMAN: Summary judgment was decided at 

the -- pre-emption was decided at summary judgment 

before trial. So there was no evidence about what was 

new or wasn't new. In Ms. Levine's motion for summary 

judgment, she uses the word "new" information about 

labeling change. And, with respect to the proposed 1987 

language, the '88 change that we asked for, she said --
