 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll next hear Case 

06-531, Sole versus Wyner.

 Ms. Seitz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA A. SEITZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. SEITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The court of appeals held that plaintiffs 

who obtain a preliminary injunction are prevailing 

parties entitled to fees, even though the district court 

concluded that the State's nudity ban does not violate 

the Constitution, that plaintiffs were not entitled to 

any permanent relief, and that final judgment should be 

entered against the plaintiffs.

 This Court's cases have found plaintiffs to 

be prevailing parties in only two situations, when they 

win judgment on the merits or enter into a consent 

decree. And this Court has declined to confer 

prevailing party status based on interim rulings in 

ongoing litigation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious 

to get your reaction to one of the points made by 

opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort

of two different pieces of litigation at issue here, 

that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the 

preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the 

final decision was a facial challenge. Is there 

anything to that?

 MS. SEITZ: No, I don't think there is. In 

the preliminary injunction, the district court predicted 

that it would find the nudity ban significantly 

infringed free expression and that the State had less 

restrictive alternatives. That's at page 18a and 19a. 

In the summary judgment decision, the court held that 

the nudity plan's effect on free impression was de 

minimis and it had, that the State had no less 

restrictive alternative. So in both instances the 

underlying legal claim was that as applied to nude 

expression the nudity ban was unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do we make of what I 

understand was the court's post hoc statement that what 

was -- the reason for issuing the temporary injunction 

was the perception that there was a content basis at 

work? And what do we make of it in light of the fact --

I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong. 

what do we make of that in light of the fact that I 

believe it is in the record that I forget the 

appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've

let you do this in the past, but this is political or 

this looks political, which suggests that there was a 

content basis going on?

 What do we make of the court's statement and 

the record statement by the official in deciding whether 

there really was in effect a separate kind of order 

involved in the preliminary injunction from the order 

that was denied at the end of the case?

 MS. SEITZ: There's a factual answer to that 

and a legal answer, and I'll start with the legal 

answer, which is that the preliminary injunction itself 

states that it is assuming content --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I know that. I know 

that.

 MS. SEITZ: And as a legal matter --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Because that's why I asked, 

what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?

 MS. SEITZ: I think we, as the court of 

appeals did, have to disregard those statements because 

under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 

the preliminary injunction itself is the operative 

document, and the bases that it states for the issuance 

of the preliminary injunction are the bases that must 

govern both on judicial review of the injunction and as 

a matter of notice to the parties of the operative

effect and basis for the injunction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that so when there is 

some evidence in the record that a content basis 

actually was the criterion?

 MS. SEITZ: And that's the factual part of 

my response, which is that this testimony that was 

relied on which we quote in full in our reply brief, was 

testimony by the State, a State official who did not 

make the decision so was not actually aware of why the 

decision was made, and was testimony only to the effect 

that the demonstration envisioned on February 14th might 

be different than her previous plays, because more 

people might be expected.

 Now the court drew from that telephonic 

testimony a possibility that the reason for the State's 

denial on February 14 was the content; but in fact, 

although the court didn't recognize it, it also had 

before it a decision by the State in 2000 denying her 

permission to put on her play based on its decision to 

enforce its nudity ban against her at that time.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now the 2001 order was it 

-- was it? She applied, I think it was in --

MS. SEITZ: She wrote a letter in 2000 

requesting permission to perform her play --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

MS. SEITZ: Under the same terms that she 

had under the stipulated settlement from 1998. The 

State denied her request in a letter indicating that the 

nudity ban would be enforced against the play.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the factual answer in 

effect is there isn't enough fact to support the 

distinction?

 MS. SEITZ: And -- and I guess there's in 

addition a legal elaboration on that factual record, 

which was this was all occurring in a preliminary 

injunction hearing that took place 24 hours before the 

demonstration, telephonic testimony of an ill-prepared 

State witness. It was never followed up, even though 

that claim remained live through summary judgment, 

because the plaintiffs continued to have a claim against 

an individual defendant for damages.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. But when you got to 

the summary judgment stage, the particular peace 

demonstration performance was -- was behind them. So 

they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected 

to be reinjected into the case.

 MS. SEITZ: The challenge continued because 

there was a claim for individual damages from the park 

manager. So in order to determine that individual claim 

for damages, of course, the plaintiffs could have put in

evidence that, in fact, rather than just as a 

preliminary prediction, the injunction was issued to 

prevent content-based discrimination.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it wasn't moot after the 

demonstration.

 MS. SEITZ: That was not mooted out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's one of the 

things that concerns me. I mean in many of these cases 

you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the 

preliminary injunction and the event takes place. I 

would not want to get to a situation where people feel 

the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to 

ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees. So how do 

you protect against that?

 MS. SEITZ: We -- the purpose of the 

attorney's fees provision is to encourage and reward 

meritorious litigation. And at the point at which you 

only have a preliminary injunction, no matter how long 

that preliminary injunction has been in effect, what you 

have is a prediction of success on the merits, a 

balancing of equitable factors that determine interim 

fairness, but you do not have a decision that the 

defendant has violated the Constitution or any Federal 

law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in, but in many cases

the case will become moot after a period of time and the 

Chief Justice and I have the same concern. The question 

is directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for 

the -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?

 MS. SEITZ: There are significant 

consequences to a finding of liability. And to 

conferring preliminary -- or fees for preliminary 

injunction when you do not have a final determination of 

violation by the State, you're essentially ordering the 

State and local governments who have not been judged 

violators of law or had a full or fair opportunity to 

defend as a matter of law --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're asking about 

what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you 

is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys 

fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to 

continue the litigation when it's for all practical 

purposes of no real importance to the parties, other 

than to just establish attorney's fees. And that seems 

a waste of resources.

 MS. SEITZ: And but the -- the situation --

that situation will also obtain if you confer attorney's 

fees and prevailing party status on a plaintiff who only 

has a preliminary injunction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do we have to judge

all preliminary and judgments alike? I mean, in some 

cases, the preliminary injunction is the thing. For 

example, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had 

said yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge 

but we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration, 

and we got it; so we're -- that's enough. We're not 

going to fight on.

 MS. SEITZ: The fact that a plaintiff gets 

his or her way temporarily based on a preliminary 

junction does not mean that the defendant has violated 

that plaintiff's constitutional rights or that that 

would be the resolution of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Who -- who -- where does it 

say you have to have done that? My statute here says in 

any action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or 

whatever was such an action. It says the court in its 

discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys' 

fee. Well, did they prevail fail or not? They got what 

they wanted. And it was such an action. Doesn't say 

anything about whether you have been declared horrible 

or wonderful or violator or not a violator. It says did 

they get what they want in the action? Answer, yes. 

End of matter.

 Now what's wrong with reading it that way?

 MS. SEITZ: To prevail you must prevail on a

legal claim.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, they got the legal 

claim. The legal claim is we want to have our 

demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it 

and therefore issue an order. You said no, don't issue 

the order, because they don't. And therefore, they won.

 MS. SEITZ: Respectfully, that's not a legal 

claim.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is not?

 MS. SEITZ: The underlying legal claim is 

that the State's denial of the permit was 

unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. But what about the 

legal claim we are under the law entitled to a 

preliminary injunction.

 MS. SEITZ: That is a type of relief you are 

seeking but it's based on an underlying legal claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not a determination, 

is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?

 MS. SEITZ: It is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is just a determination 

that we don't know at this point enough to say that you 

don't have a right.

 MS. SEITZ: It is a product of an equitable 

balancing that determines interim fairness --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well I thought, where it 

say that in the statute that you have to have that 

particular kind of a claim?

 MS. SEITZ: I think this Court's cases have 

interpreted the word prevail and prevailing parties to 

mean you must prevail on the merits of a legal claim. 

The only instance in which that is not true is in a 

consent decree scenario and in a consent decree what you 

have is a defendant assuming legal responsibility for 

providing relief on the merits that resolves a claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what do you do in 

a situation of mootness where there's -- you know, 

they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that 

they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a 

preliminary one, but the case has become moot. Are they 

automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that 

case?

 MS. SEITZ: A claim that is never resolved 

cannot be the basis of prevailing party status. And 

that's what your hypothetical poses. And I also think 

it's not correct to say there is no point in continuing 

with litigation in that setting. In a private attorney 

general setting, there is a value to having at the end 

of litigation a decision --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may be a

pint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the 

locality governments -- I mean if you ask them the 

question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees 

where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the 

case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face 

individual officer liability to prevent the case from 

becoming moot? Or would you rather face ongoing 

litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot 

because there's too much invested in the fees -- they 

might choose the former.

 MS. SEITZ: Well in this case, of course, 

the State officials decided to defend the 

constitutionality of their nudity ban to the end. It 

was important to them.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the plaintiffs 

decided to challenge it to the end. But I'm suggesting 

that if they know they might -- it might result in a 

loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was 

a particular demonstration, others might pursue it 

differently.

 MS. SEITZ: There are significant 

countervailing considerations, and one is that under the 

rule you're proposing, state and local governments would 

be fearful about enforcing perfectly valid laws in 

emergency situations for fear of being penalized with

fees. Then they have no fair chance --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you are saying the 

Chief Justice is proposing a rule. I think he was 

asking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing. 

And we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic 

good sense to insist that every preliminary injunction 

be carried through to a final adjudication for 

attorney's fees. And we are asking is there some midway 

ground. And you, you've so far -- you can structure the 

argument the way you want, but you so far are -- in 

effect telling me absolutely not.

 MS. SEITZ: I -- I think that because of the 

rule I distill from this Court's case which is that you 

can't prevail on a claim that's not decided, it's hard 

for me to see what the middle ground would be. We do of 

course have the alternative ground for decision in this 

case which is that a claim, a preliminary junction 

that's issued in ongoing litigation whose prediction on 

the merits is later essentially proven to be false by 

subsequent litigation, can't be the basis for prevailing 

party --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what do you think, when 

this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as 

horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was 

riding in the South, and a group of civil rights

demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have 

their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the 

judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the 

whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow. 

Tomorrow. Right now. So -- and we don't really care 

that much about the end of it, but we'll -- we'll go 

ahead and litigate it if you want. Now they get their 

injunction. They have the demonstration; it's over. I 

would have thought if there was a situation for which 

1983 was written, it's that one.

 MS. SEITZ: And if in fact it is clear that 

there is no issue law in that setting.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, there is. The other 

side has a lot of arguments. And they each have 

arguments. There are plenty of issues of law.

 MS. SEITZ: Then you just articulated why 

that plaintiff should not be considered a prevailing 

party without taking the position that that is capable 

of repetition, but evading review situation, arguing 

that in effect the judgment is based totally on law and 

converting it essentially to a judgment on the merits, 

or otherwise coming to a final judgment on a claim, so 

that the plaintiff would have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should a 

plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we

got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be --

this is a one-time only demonstration. We're not going 

to repeat this.

 Why force litigation, especially when we can 

say in this case, you lost on the merits? The judge 

made a prediction. Turned out that -- that that was 

wrong.

 MS. SEITZ: To -- to impose attorney's fees 

on a defendant, it's not simply about what the plaintiff 

gets, whether the plaintiff gets what he wants, but it 

is also about what the justification is for forcing the 

state and local government to pay fees.

 And the purpose of the Civil Rights Act is 

to impose such fees against violators of civil rights 

and for the benefit of victims of similar rights 

violation, and not simply on those whom it is predicted 

will have a substantial likelihood of success on the 

merits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you get a case that 

involves a student. And -- and something like the 

DeFunis case. The student is admitted to the law school 

event. They have much controversy over this affirmative 

action program. The student graduates. And -- but the 

student has prevailed up until that time.

 MS. SEITZ: I don't believe the student has

prevailed within the meaning of Section 19(a). The 

student has been predicted to be likely to prevail and 

has received an interim fairness -- an interim 

adjustment based on considerations of fairness.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But can't fight on 

because first, the student had gotten everything that he 

wanted and the case is moot. The student has graduated.

 MS. SEITZ: In that situation, I think the 

benefit is capable of repetition for debating review or 

of utilizing the class action --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: On if you had a class 

action. He had a single action, and he's graduated.

 MS. SEITZ: But there are tools a plaintiff 

can use to prevent this kind of case from becoming moot 

where there is an important need to have an issue 

decided.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Apart from the class 

action, what -- what else is there?

 MS. SEITZ: 65(a)(3) which allows 

consolidation of a merits determination.

time?

 I mean this is an extraordinary benefit 

we're talking about here, getting -- getting your 

attorney's fees paid. I -- it doesn't seem to me that 

we're casting this, this person into the underworld.

 MS. SEITZ: And there's no basis for 

awarding fees against the innocent state and local 

government not determined to have committed a violation.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,

 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 This Court has held repeatedly that 

liability for attorney's fees and liability for 

violation of Federal law go hand in hand. A preliminary 

injunction does not determine that there has been a 

violation of Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you on the all 

or nothing team this morning?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- can a 

preliminary injunction never be the basis for an award 

of attorney's fees?

 MS. MILLETT: I won't say never in this 

narrow circumstance. And that is when, when a 

preliminary injunction results in a definitive and 

determinative ruling of law such as Thornburgh versus 

Obstetricians -- College of Obstetricians and 

Gynecologists, or the steel mill seizure case from this 

Court. It came up on a preliminary injunction but this 

Court made a dispositive and controlling ruling of 

constitutional law. And assuming that that declaration 

is then followed up by a change in behavior by the 

defendant compelled as result of the ruling, that would 

be enough. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How can that 

be, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive 

question of law? Does that happen?

 MS. MILLETT: Well it happened -- it 

happened in this Court and -- and -- and there were 

dissenters. But there -- it happened in this Court's 

case in the Thornburgh case. It came up on a 

preliminary junction. This Court determined there were 

no disputed questions of fact and it was only a contest 

of law what the Court said is that when they have done

that we can make dispositive ruling of law. But I think 

that's an unusual situation and what's critical is that 

when --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it wasn't the issuance 

of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was 

the appeal to this Court where we -- we resolved a 

question of law.

 MS. MILLETT: This Court resolved a question 

of law on the merits. The debate in that opinion 

between the majority and the dissents was that the --

the dissent said majority should only decide whether it 

was an abuse of discretion to issue the preliminary 

injunction.

 And, I mean -- it, it, it can become sort of 

the same thing if an error in law is necessarily an 

abuse of discretion, but when -- when a superior court's 

made a definitive --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the law in respect 

to this, which is right on the point you're arguing, 

that two parties have this kind of suit and the 

government party -- they settle it, and giving 

everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at 

the end they say: We don't admit we violated the law. 

Can you get attorney's fees there or not.

 MS. MILLE TT: If it's a consent decree.

JUSTICE BREYER: It's a consent decree, but 

no admission of a violation of law.

 MS. MILLE TT: No, that's right. This 

Court, while repeatedly stating, including unanimously 

just two years ago, that the central justification for 

attorney's fees is that the defendant is a violator of 

Federal law, has found that it will also permit 

attorney's fees in the consent decree situation, but 

that's because there you have a defendant who is not 

fighting and continuing to resist any form of final 

relief, has instead agreed to provide final relief that 

runs to a plaintiff, in favor of a plaintiff, and that 

advances the purpose of Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have never 

understood why that's an issue. Can't the parties -- it 

seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the 

theory. Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's 

fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree 

and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?

 MS. MILLETT: I think, I think that in 

reality certainly a party can say, I'm not entering into 

a consent decree if we're not going to resolve 

attorney's fees now or if we're going to have a fight 

over them. So they certainly have that power because 

it's largely a contract, although one enforced by

courts. I'm only trying to be candid with this Court's 

precedent, which is also recognized in Mayer versus 

Gagne. For some reason, maybe they reserved the 

question there to be disputed in court whether you'd be 

responsible for attorney's fees.

 But I do think That's much more of a side 

show because that can all be dealt with through the 

contract elements of the consent agree. And really what 

you're talking about when a court is coercively imposing 

attorney's fees on a defendant is that the defendant has 

a right to not pay those unless they have been found to 

be a violator of Federal law or have agreed to through 

contract to deal with that issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but the argument is 

undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule. 

Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want 

to promote settlements? We don't want litigation to go 

on and on and on simply because somebody wants to 

establish a right to attorney's fees. And doesn't that 

same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary 

injunction and that's all the person wants. By the same 

reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we 

accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient 

determination of rights to justify fees because we don't 

want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue

of substance involved, but is just litigating for the 

sake of establishing a right to fees later?

 MS. MILLETT: I have three answers to that. 

First of all, there are two parties here. The defendant 

has a right not to be assessed attorney's fees, which 

are a form of final relief not interim relief, without a 

final decision that they violated on the merits.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the only attorney's 

fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees 

attributable to the preliminary injunction.

 MS. MILLETT: That's right, but they have a 

right not to pay anything if they haven't done anything 

wrong.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They have been found 

subject to a preliminary injunction. The playing field 

is no longer even.

 MS. MILLETT: They haven't been found to be 

-- there may be a Presumption or a substantial 

likelihood they're going to lose, but that doesn't 

always come out. And there's not even always a 

substantial likelihood --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The point is you wouldn't 

mind putting that on a resume, that you have been 

subjected to a preliminary injunction.

 MS. MILLETT: No --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't violated any 

Federal law.

 MS. MILLETT: This is a case in point.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it does mean, it does 

mean that somebody with a burden to establish an 

entitlement to the injunction has carried the burden.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, the test is the 

prevailing party, not the substantially likely to 

prevail party. And the other reason --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then let's not have it in 

the settlement case.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, again settlements can be 

dealt with through the settlement, as part of the 

settlement process. But I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are voluntary, these 

settlements, aren't they? So you could at least say 

that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's 

fees for settling gets what he asked for, right? It's 

voluntary.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, that's what I tried to 

explain to Justice Breyer.

the way the statute is written.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would this case be 

different if the defendant had consented to the entry of 

a preliminary injunction?

 MS. MILLETT: No, I don't think so, and I 

don't think courts as a matter of judicial economy want 

to tell the government every time we agree not to 

oppose, to stay the removal of an alien, that we somehow 

would get a bill.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if this had been, if 

they had entered into a consent decree covering just the 

one event on the front burner, that would have been?

 MS. MILLETT: A consent decree is a final 

resolution of a claim that legally obligates the 

defendant, final relief that runs in favor of the 

plaintiff.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they consented to 

the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that 

be equally binding?

 MS. MILLETT: Because it is not a final 

resolution. Preliminary injunctions are important. 

They're of value to the parties. But there's a 

trade-off in getting it. The reason courts can give 

them is they aren't committed to final relief. They 

aren't committed to final obligation, and they can

decide when --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they were able to go 

ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the 

litigation, and they would have been able to do it the 

same way if they had a consent decree instead of having 

the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition 

to the preliminary.

 MS. MILLETT: The defendant who'S been fully 

vindicated at the end of the case shouldn't have to 

write checks to two attorneys instead of just their own. 

There's a fundamental fairness element here.

 But also on the judicial economy --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But then why isn't the 

attorney -- if there were a consent decree -- I don't 

understand the difference.

 MS. MILLETT: Because the defendant's in the 

control of the fairness issue in the consent decree and 

is not in this situation.

 But the other situation, concern, is concern 

about judicial economy. And there's arguments in the 

amicus briefs on the other side that preliminary 

injunctions are common. But remember, this is -- the 

central justification is that the plaintiff is a private 

attorney general who doesn't just do what they want to 

do, but either resolves the issue of law or obtains

enduring changes in defendant's behavior that are of 

utility to the community at large. Contrary to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have when election 

season comes many, many requests for injunctions, and 

after the election is over the case just goes away. 

Nobody is interested.

 MS. MILLETT: That is not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your position, all 

of these matters must be contested until final judgment 

before attorney's fees are available.

 MS. MILLETT: That is not the United States 

Government's experience when it's been involved in a lot 

of voting cases. Lots of them get fought until the end, 

and this Court's decision in Brown versus Choate 

recognizes these are capable of repetition, yet evading 

review. Now, if the private plaintiff doesn't want to 

do the work of a private attorney general, that's their 

choice. No one says you have to stay. It's just, if 

you want attorney's fees, you have to accept a 

preliminary injunction for what it is. It's very 

beneficial, but it is not a resolution on the merits 

that obligates the defendant to provide a form of final 

relief, not interim relief, to you.

 And this Court itself has expressed 

significant concerns about having voting cases being run

up on preliminary injunctions at the last minute and the 

impact that can have on voting, and we shouldn't 

encourage that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, did I 

hear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change 

in the defendant's behavior? Is that your standard?

 MS. MILLETT: Enduring more in -- not in the 

transient sense of preliminary injunction. Obviously, 

things change on the outside world. But in the form of 

final relief and permanent relief, and that's what this 

Court's cases have said time and again. Not only must 

the defendant be a violator of Federal law, but in 

Ferrari, in Texas Teachers versus Darwin, in Hanrahan 

and Hewitt, the Court has made clear that it is final, a 

resolution of a dispute, a final judgment, the settling 

of a problem that makes someone a prevailing party. And 

"prevailing party," as this Court explained in 

Buckhannon, is a term of art. As we say on pages 11 to 

12 of our brief, "That term of art, as defined in the 

relevant dictionaries at the time, was not just that you 

won something, but that you won at the end of the suit."

 And that's a question of basic fundamental 

fairness to plaintiffs. Remember, there's going to be 

countervailing judicial economy concerns. If you tell 

governmental entities that they're going to have to

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GALANTER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondents went into Federal court because 

State officials told them their protest would be illegal 

and they left Federal court with a preliminary 

injunction that prohibited State interference with their 

protest.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. They left 

Federal court having lost on the permanent injunction.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, 20-some 

months later they lost on another component of their 

case, where they were seeking permanent relief to enjoin 

the facial applicability of the regulations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their legal, their 

legal claim was that these regulations were invalid 

under the First Amendment. And they lost on that legal

claim.

 MR. GALANTER: At the end of the case, Your 

Honor, yes. But at the preliminary injunction stage, 

one -- their claim for relief was a violation of the 

First Amendment and there was evidence at the 

preliminary injunction stage that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they succeeded 

in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get 

attorney's fees for that, because they were successful 

at the filing complaint stage.

 MR. GALANTER: That's true, Your Honor. But 

what they obtained on February 13, 2003, was the relief 

they sought.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they got a TRO 

instead of a preliminary injunction?

 MR. GALANTER: We're not suggesting that 

TROs --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know you aren't. Why 

not?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, there are structural 

differences between the two.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What are the two? I mean, 

they prevailed. They have a TRO here, something of 

value.

that exists in a preliminary injunction. And I think 

the distinction --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's just prevails. If 

you think "prevails" means you come out of there with 

anything that's worth something that has a contempt 

citation behind it, I don't see why a TRO wouldn't 

qualify.

 MR. GALANTER: We're not suggesting that as 

the basic rule. What we are suggesting is that if you 

obtain a preliminary injunction, in part because 

Congress recognized the difference between TROs and 

preliminary injunctions and placed preliminary 

injunctions and permanent injunctions together as the 

kinds of orders that had --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if you get a 

preliminary injunction and then at the permanent 

injunction stage the basis for the preliminary 

injunction is reversed. Let's say the preliminary 

injunction here was based on the ground that the 

decision was content-based, a factual decision, and at 

the permanent injunction stage the court finds that it 

was not content-based.

 MR. GALANTER: Then we would not be 

prevailing. But I have to point out the district court 

in this case expressed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though you got what 

you wanted? You got to put on the show.

 I thought that at the end of the line, the 

judge said your First Amendment rights have not been 

violated, the nudity ordnance can be enforced. If you 

had come back again, say the next week, and said, we 

want to do another peace symbol, after the court has 

ruled on the permanent junction and you lost, you 

certainly couldn't prevail when you're coming back with 

another as-applied, when the court has said this 

ordnance is good and doesn't violate the First 

Amendment.

 That's correct. But if there were an 

intervening fact, if they permitted a performance of 

"Hair" and then said, but we'll enforce the nudity 

prohibition against your protest, then we would be able 

to come back.

 The final judgment in this case does not 

preclude future as-applied challenges, either 

content-based or arbitrary, and the district court 

recognized that when it made very clear that it did not 

reverse or repudiate its preliminary injunction ruling 

simply because we lost the permanent junction.

put on a demonstration that would be like the plays, 

that would be hidden from public view because you have a 

curtain or whatever around it. And then the judge said, 

oh no, that's not what they wanted, they didn't want it 

to be hidden from you view, they wanted people to see 

their demonstration, so if that's what they want to do, 

they don't have any First Amendment protection.

 MR. GALANTER: That is what was at the end. 

I would just point out that at the preliminary 

injunction stage, you have to remember Ms. Weyer had 

been permitted to put on her play, not hiding it, 

several years before. There was testimony suggesting 

that one of the differences in the result, the refusal 

to allow the anti-war protest, was because it was an 

anti-war protest. And the district court makes it 

clear, in our brief in opposition appendix at page 4a. 

He says: "The court did not revisit or reverse its 

earlier decision regarding the same legal issue.

 But I think all this just goes to the point 

for that this case presents some interesting issues, but 

that the per se rule that the Petitioners press, that 

you can never get --

because your interest is in getting fees in this case.

you won at the end of the line. Certainly you would be

 MR. GALANTER: We would obviously be a 

prevailing party. But under Hens ley --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though you lost on 

the preliminary injunction?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes. Under Hensley versus 

Eckert, this Court has made clear you can win on some 

claims, lose in others.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would get 

attorney's fees for the preliminary injunction work, 

even though you lost on that?

 MR. GALANTER: We would get attorney's fees 

for the reasonable work that ended up leading to the 

success. District courts have for decades now parsed 

through these legal records, subject to review by the 

court of appeals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That parsing, is there 

any doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout, 

that you would get your fees for your entire 

representation?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, there is doubt, Your 

Honor. The court does look for whether these fees are 

reasonable.

not get -- would the judge say you don't get a penny for 

the effort you made to achieve the preliminary 

injunction because you lost, you lost it, even though in 

hindsight I could see that that was the wrong decision, 

you should have had it?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, under 

Hensley you look to see whether they're related or 

unrelated claims. This Court has adopted --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're obviously 

related. It's the same thing. I need -- I have a short 

time to answer the preliminary injunction. The judge 

said: You haven't shown probability of success on the 

merits, or denies it. You win. I thought that there 

wasn't any doubt that you could get your fees for the 

successful result from the time you filed the complaint 

until the final judgment.

 MR. GALANTER: We would hope a court would 

find that an as-applied challenge and a facial challenge 

were sufficiently related that we'd be entitled to fees 

for both. But what I have to stress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though you lost on the 

preliminary injunction? The fees that you reasonably 

expended in seeking a preliminary injunction, even 

though you lost, you'd be able to charge to the other 

side?

would get the money we did for writing the complaint. 

And one of our counts for the complaint here was exactly 

for the preliminary injunction that we obtained.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your 

approach, just as there are problems from the judicial 

economy perspective with your friend's approach, but 

doesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth 

and nail on the preliminary injunction because they're 

running the risk if they lose there, they're going to 

pay fees even if they prevail later? As opposed to, as 

is often the case, they might say, you know, we consent 

to the entry of the preliminary injunction or we 

don't -- you know, we're going to save our energy. 

Doesn't it require them to fight every possible stage, 

including appeal and so on?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, two things, Your Honor. 

As I think I made clear to Justice Alito, if the 

decision is reversed or repudiated by the district 

court, there would now -- we would not be prevailing 

parties. We would simply have gotten this benefit. But 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean, 

if the decision on what? On the preliminary injunction?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes.

district -- how is it repudiated? What do you envision?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, in the hypothetical 

where the same facts, the same law, and the district 

court says I was wrong, that would be the kind of 

repudiation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In a later case, you mean?

 MR. GALANTER: In the course of the 

proceedings in the same case, Your Honor. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he doesn't 

have to say he's wrong. What often happens is as it is 

here, he say's I've got 24 hours, I don't have a brief 

from the other side, I kind of make the best guess I 

can. And then later on after an adversary presentation 

and an evidentiary hearing, he issues a different 

ruling. As here, he doesn't have to say I was wrong on 

my 24-hour off-the-cuff guess. It's just that I'm 

better informed. Is that repudiation or not?

 MR. GALANTER: No, Your Honor, it's not. 

And here, in fact he said the opposite. He said I 

wasn't wrong, these were based on different legal 

theories. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- can you -- I 

thought what he said was -- I thought they wanted a 

demonstration that was going to be secure from public 

view, and instead I understand now that's not -- that

wasn't what they wanted from the start.

 So on the premise on which I was operating, 

I was right, that they were going to do it just like the 

plays. But what they really planned to do, and did do, 

I was wrong because those facts were not before me.  Had 

those facts been before me, they would have lost on the 

preliminary injunction.

 MR. GALANTER: I don't believe that that's 

the fairest reading of the district court's subsequent 

orders in this case. What the district court made clear 

was that his as-applied holding, that the plays and the 

war protests were being treated differently. Remember 

that it's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but assume the 

district court thought he was right at the preliminary 

injunction, and ruled otherwise at the permanent 

junction. But what if the court of appeals when it 

reviews the fee application, thinks he was wrong both 

times?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, we would 

suggest that the person in the best position to 

understand what the district court was doing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the district court.

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But maybe the court of

appeals is in the best position to determine whether 

they made an error of law or not.

 MR. GALANTER: Yes. And obviously they 

review errors of law, questions of law --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if they think he made 

an error of law, what should they do?

 MR. GALANTER: If he had made an error of 

law in the preliminary injunction ruling that, on 

de novo review, and reversed, then --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, there's no reverse. 

It's too late. They've had the demonstration so it's 

all over. But in reviewing the fee application, the 

court of appeals concludes that the district judge --

the decision represented an incorrect premise of law and 

therefore, he did make an error. Would that control or 

would the district judge's view of the validity of his 

own decision control?

 MR. GALANTER: We would suggest the latter, 

Your Honor, in part to avoid the fees on fees litigation 

problems. I mean, other than the per se rule of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, to avoid 

fees on fees, we do something that's wrong?

 MR. GALANTER: No, Your Honor. It's not 

wrong. It's consistent with the text and the policies

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that it -- am I 

wrong about that? I thought that if, A, he goes in, he 

gets a preliminary injunction, he says the law is da, 

da, da, the judge says you're right, that's what it is, 

preliminary injunction. And now it's continued up on 

appeal, the appellate court says you're wrong about the 

law. You got it, you had the event, but you're 

absolutely wrong, the law did not support you. I 

thought under those circumstances you were not 

prevailing and you couldn't get it. Is that the law or 

not?

 MR. GALANTER: It is the law, Your Honor. 

What I'm suggesting, though, is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the hypothetical 

was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment 

on the merits; and at that point -- okay -- at that 

point, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction 

was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from 

the preliminary injunction.

 MR. GALANTER: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Assume you win on the 

merits.

the fee issue.

if I may, I agree with Justice Breyer's hypothetical 

that if you're appealing the merits and the court of 

appeals says something which shows that the -- the 

preliminary injunction should not have been issued, 

we're not a prevailing party. I agree with 

Justice Scalia that if you're appealing from the 

preliminary injunction and the court of appeals 

reverses, then you're not the prevailing party. But 

Justice Stevens, what I would suggest to you and to 

Justice Kennedy was, we shouldn't be adjudicating 

whether the preliminary injunction was correctly entered 

at the fees stage. If there is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for 

that? Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a 

person has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally 

unsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they 

appeal that and the court of appeals determines it's 

legally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it, 

I'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee 

in those circumstances, but maybe there is. What is it?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, I mean, the courts of 

appeals have adopted different standards. I can't point 

to one --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case you can 

think of that under those circumstances let's him have

the attorney's fees?

 MR. GALANTER: I can't point to one.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I would be surprised.

 MR. GALANTER: But the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The other thing that I 

wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party? 

And the reason I ask that is because when I look through 

the record it seems to me your clients are very 

interesting. They have their point of view. And their 

point of view, one of their points of view was that the 

state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a 

skimpy swimming suit. No. Well, you can have the 

demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're 

going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want 

to see you don't have to see you. And there your client 

said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth. At least 

we didn't in the past. And then looking at that I 

thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a 

preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to 

call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up 

the cloth. It was pretty clear the State would, and it 

should have been pretty clear that they were going to 

ignore it, which they did.

 And why is this any different than having 

won an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but

in your swimming suit? In other words, they didn't want 

this. They didn't want what they got. Now, what's the 

response to that?

 MR. GALANTER: They did get what they 

wanted. They wanted to be nude. They wanted to make 

sure they weren't escorted off the beach or arrested. 

And that's exactly what happened. They had an order 

that protected that.

 Now, the screen was there, and there's 

material disputes of fact about what they were told 

about the screen by whom. But the court's order did not 

say stay behind the screen. They were not in violation 

of the court order.

 But I think this goes to the more general 

point, how can you tell when someone prevails, and this 

Court has already established that. You obtain some 

relief through a court award that materially changes the 

relationship.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did the court order 

provide for a screen?

 MR. GALANTER: The court order that -- no. 

The court order said that the State was not prohibited 

from using the means it had in the past. So it 

clarified what the State was not prohibited from doing. 

It did not impose any requirement on the plaintiffs.

JUSTICE SCALIA: That included a screen.

 MR. GALANTER: It did, Your Honor, but it 

didn't order the screen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But your people didn't want 

a screen.

 MR. GALANTER: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they didn't get what 

they asked for.

 MR. GALANTER: They didn't get removed from 

the beach or arrested for being nude either, Your Honor, 

so they did get what they wanted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only because, 

I guess the other side didn't take the action that they 

could have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply 

the screen.

 MR. GALANTER: Your Honor, when you obtain 

the court award, just as if you obtain a court award to 

get on a ballot or to hold a parade, or to wear a tee 

shirt, I mean, you get that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did they conduct the 

demonstration with a screen or without a screen?

 MR. GALANTER: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did they conduct the 

demonstration with or without a screen?

 MR. GALANTER: They did not use the screen.

JUSTICE SCALIA: And since they didn't use 

the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting 

them; is that correct?

 MR. GALANTER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they did not get what 

they asked for. Mainly a prohibition against the state 

interfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted, 

which was one without a screen. You say they didn't get 

that.

 MR. GALANTER: They didn't get that, but 

they got something more than they had when they went in, 

which was, they got the right to be naked on the beach, 

which would have otherwise subjected them to arrest. 

And, I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The state had no problem 

with that. In the past the State had let them do that, 

as long as they had the screen.

 MR. GALANTER: It wouldn't let them do that 

this time even with the screen. It sent them a letter 

saying you may not appear on the beach nude. And I 

mean, obviously, at some times you don't get --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the State 

prevailed to some extent as well. They prevailed to the 

extent of getting in the order that they can do what

they had done, which is erect a screen.

 MR. GALANTER: They -- yes. They 

narrowed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they're entitled 

to some -- I mean, if -- this is not a reciprocal 

switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question 

of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your 

opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as 

well.

 MR. GALANTER: With respect, even if we had 

sought and obtained a permanent injunction that allowed 

us to protest but not behind the screen, we'd be a 

prevailing party, although the defendants by their 

successful advocacy would have narrowed the scope of the 

injunction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this. Is 

it correct that an underlying principle of law that 

justified your claim for relief and your actual relief 

was that there's some First Amendment right to 

demonstrate in the nude?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor, that was an 

underlying part of that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what is the support in 

our cases for that proposition, if any?

cases in Barnes, the nude dancing cases suggest that 

expressive activity combined with nudity is protected by 

the First Amendment. Judge Calabrese in the Second 

Circuit wrote an extensive opinion in a case called 

Tunic versus Zapper, where he surveys this Court's 

cases, and finds that occasionally there may be for 

artistic or political reasons a right to be nude as part 

of more expressive conduct. But I'd like to maybe --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was also a --

that was the demonstration or the show arrangement under 

the -- was it the Brooklyn Bridge or the Williamsburg 

Bridge?

 MR. GALANTER: It was on the streets of New 

York, Your Honor, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At 6 a.m.

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor. But to take 

this back just one step, to the notion that we either 

not need something that's sort of enduring or merits 

based in order to obtain relief. Maher versus Gagne 

suggested, a court doesn't need to resolve the merits in 

order for a party to be prevailing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But see, it's so 

extraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay 

for his attorney. We don't even do that -- we don't 

even do that for guilty people when they -- when the

other side wins. So they have violated the law. We 

still don't make them pay the other side's attorney's 

fees. Now you want us to pay your client's attorney's 

fees even though you're not dealing with a guilty party, 

because ultimately the court found no, there really, 

this person didn't violate the law.

 That is -- you know, that's double 

indemnity. I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary 

departure from our usual practice, which is that each 

side pays his own. It's one thing to say well, if 

you're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil 

rights cases, we'll make you pay the other side. But 

it's another thing to say if you're -- if you're not a 

bad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky 

enough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll 

make you pay for the other side. It just grates 

that that -- it ain't fair.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not just a question 

of weaker, but what Congress intended when they wrote a 

statute authorizing these fees.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that Congress 

doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair. And if 

there are various interpretations, one of which is not 

grossly unfair, that's the one we should --

literal language very definitely.

 MR. GALANTER: Speaking of the language, we 

have here when Congress enacted in 1970 -- in 1998 -- in 

1976, just two years before this Court had interpreted 

another civil rights attorney's fees statute. In that 

one, however, Congress had actually required a final 

order before attorney's fees would be awarded.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, before you leave 

that, I wonder if -- there's one other thing floating 

around in my mind. I might as well bring it up. The 

word is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground 

that it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things, 

at least you have to really be prevailing, is there a 

good faith element in that? That is to say, if your 

clients when they went in to get this order and they got 

it, and at that time they had no intention of following 

what they had to do. Rather, they had every intention 

of going out and tearing down the curtain. Does that 

enter into the determination of whether they are really 

a prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's 

fees, if you're bringing the ethical element into it?

 MR. GALANTER: I think, Your Honor, that --

well, first of all, the preliminary injunction itself 

was an equitable remedy. Unclean hands could have gone 

into that question, and yes, in determining the amount

of fees, again, equity can be considered. The good 

faith of the parties, just as the complete bad faith of 

a plaintiff, this Court has held, permits fees to be 

awarded for the defendants.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can't go into 

court with the objective of just getting preliminary 

relief, can you? I mean, you have to have an underlying 

claim of illegality and, that seeks permanent relief, 

right?

 MR. GALANTER: That's true, Your Honor. 

Although you can go into court knowing that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Knowing that --

MR. GALANTER: -- you're only going to be 

getting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- preliminary 

injunction.

 MR. GALANTER: And everyone here -- excuse 

me. And everyone here knew that absent an appeal, this 

was the final word on the February 14th --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the February 

14th, but your client sought further relief.

 MR. GALANTER: Yes. But it also sought it 

as a discrete claim for relief in the complaint, this 

very injunction.

phrase is "attorney's fees as part of costs". So, do 

you get costs for up to the preliminary injunction?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor. The 

district court in this case awarded us costs and also 

awarded the other side costs. And that's actually --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would split the 

costs?

 MR. GALANTER: He found we were both 

prevailing parties in the case. And that's also 

consistent with this Court's decision in Hensley, which 

says you look at a case and the unrelated claims; you 

can find that the plaintiffs are prevailing parties on 

some, the defendants are prevailing parties on others, 

and order cross awards of attorney's fees.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So this defendant, having 

succeeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't 

get costs for the whole case; is that what you're 

telling me?

 MR. GALANTER: They were awarded -- they 

sought and were awarded all their costs for the entire 

case, or they sought their costs for the entire case. 

It was reduced by the district court as a matter of 

equity. But they -- not because -- not parsing it out 

among various parties to the case.

costs for the entire case?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, they were, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And attorney's fees under 

the statute are to be awarded as part of costs?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you're not entitled 

to costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how 

do you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute 

puts them together? Because attorney's fees are part of 

costs.

 MR. GALANTER: That's correct. And there 

are many cases where both parties end up getting awarded 

costs. Hensley was one that suggested it was possible.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this wasn't --

MR. GALANTER: No.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This was one that the 

state got all of its costs from your client?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes. And our client got 

costs from the state. There were counter awards --

cross awards of cost, which is not unusual in civil 

litigation with multiple claims.

 But more importantly, I think, when we go 

back and we look at the purposes, not only do we have 

the language here, we also have the recognition, I think 

as I was mentioning to the Chief Justice, that there's

going to be a lot of situations where core 1983 rights, 

core constitutional rights are at stake where you know 

you're not going to be able to obtain a permanent 

injunction. You may even, as my friends on the other 

side say, ask that the two be consolidated.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if that's not the case, 

but the plaintiff after getting a preliminary injunction 

just voluntarily dismisses the case? Do they still get 

costs for the preliminary injunction?

 MR. GALANTER: Oh, I think the answer is 

yes. And I think that that's actually something that 

should be encouraged. In this case, the preliminary 

junction was relatively cheap, as litigation goes. To 

encourage them to continue, particularly since the core 

relief they sought had become moot. Yes, there was 

additional relief they sought, or it could, in a 

hypothetical could seek. But absent an appeal, that 

part of the case is over and there's no real need to 

continue to litigate it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you were 

asked this question and your answer may have just 

slipped by me. Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why 

would you not be entitled to fees on that?

 MR. GALANTER: We think that Congress's 

distinction as far as putting preliminary injunctions

and permanent injunctions in one category and TROs in 

another for purposes of appealability, reflect kind of a 

congressional judgment about which is -- which mechanism 

is intended to alter the kind of substantial rights. 

And absent the rights to appeal, absent the 

adversariness, the heavier focus on irreparable 

injuries, unlike at the preliminary injunction stage, 

those are all things that we think make TROs generally 

ineligible to affect prevailing party status.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because the TRO case, 

characteristically the other side isn't heard, so you 

haven't prevailed.

 MR. GALANTER: That is one way to view it, 

Your Honor. Without the adversariness at the hearing, 

there really was no one to prevail over. Whereas 

here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I thought you 

prevailed in the sense that you secured relief. That's 

how you articulated it up to this point.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, this Court has 

certainly described some relief as the threshold of 

prevailing. I'm simply suggesting that there may be 

other kinds of orders, as this Court suggested in 

Hanrahan versus Hampden, that are just not sufficiently 

-- they don't have a sufficient change in the legal

relationship between the parties to warrant prevailing 

party status, even though they do benefit the 

plaintiffs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you surely wouldn't 

say that the fact that the other side never shows up 

means that you can't get your attorney's fees.

 MR. GALANTER: No, Your Honor. What I'm 

suggesting --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're a prevailing 

party whether there's an adversary on the other side or 

not.

 MR. GALANTER: What I'm saying is that the 

TRO anticipates that, which is in part why we're not 

suggesting TROs are --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But in this very 

case, if you had gotten a TRO instead of a preliminary 

injunction, you'd have exactly the same practical 

situation.

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor, but we were 

-- we did have a preliminary injunction. The State 

therefore did have a right to appeal, and a lot of other 

consequences flow from the fact that there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State did make a 

point, that they were kind of -- this was short notice 

and they were doing the best they could on short notice.

I mean, they showed up but only sort of.

 MR. GALANTER: With three attorneys, Your 

Honor. And yes -- and we both have our stories about 

why there was short notice. Ours is they only told us a 

week before they weren't going to allow her to protest 

nude. And so we moved as quickly as we could. And this 

is what often happens in election cases, demonstrations, 

parades, religious exercise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the regulations 

told you weren't allowed to protest nude.

 MR. GALANTER: Your Honor, those same 

regulations had been in effect the four previous times 

she had protested nude. And it was consistent with the 

stipulation they had entered into that her nudity was 

protected by the First Amendment. So again, she was 

certainly entitled to negotiate as she tried to do with 

the State. She was told one week before that she 

wouldn't be allowed to do this. She went to court. She 

got the very relief that she sought and she was able to 

protest in the nude.

 Now in the other cases, you're going to get 

someone who just finds they were denied the right to 

register or to get on the ballot, and that's going to be 

disposed of immediately. It won't be capable of 

repetition by evading review because the person is now

registered, the election is now over. Maybe that 

candidate won't run again. So we have a whole core of 

First Amendment cases that will be affected if 

Petitioner's per se rule that preliminary injunction is 

never enough goes into play, because then States have 

the unfortunate incentive of pushing the decisions very 

close to the actual event deadline so that even if they 

lose in court, they won't have to pay attorney's fees.

 And I would add that in terms of the broader 

notion, here we have a midlevel state official sending a 

letter to an individual saying we don't think you have 

any First Amendment rights, and if you come, you'll be 

violating a law that's subject to criminal arrest, if 

you come and you're naked, you're going to be subject to 

criminal arrest. Absent Section 1998, it would be 

incredibly difficult for persons in Ms. Wyner's 

situation to find attorneys.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Ms. Seitz, you have three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY VIRGINIA A. SEITZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Seitz, would you 

clarify that point about costs? Did your client have to 

pay costs?

MS. SEITZ: The plaintiffs were awarded 

costs incurred on the preliminary injunction. My client 

was awarded a right to costs on the remainder of the 

litigation. Those costs were reduced to mirror the 

precise costs that the plaintiff was awarded on 

preliminary injunction, so in the end no one received 

any costs. But costs were allocated for plaintiffs for 

the preliminary injunction, and defendants for the 

remainder of the case.

 I just want to make one point about the 

timing. The time prior to the 2003 demonstration, in 

2000 she wrote a letter requesting the right to protest 

nude and received a denial letter in response, similar 

to the one she received in 2003. So she was on notice 

as of 2000 that we were enforcing the nudity ban against 

her activities.

 Second, I want to say that the district 

court itself characterized its holding on summary 

judgment, quote, "as plaintiffs are unable to show 

actual success on the merits," page 34a of the appendix. 

So there's no doubt that what even the court understood 

its own holding to be was that the prediction in the 

preliminary injunction had failed to materialize when 

the court considered the full case on the merits.

 And finally, I want to say that awarding

fees, conferring fees for a plaintiff for obtaining a 

preliminary injunction essentially requires the State 

treasury to pay its opponents when, in fact, the State 

has done nothing but enforce a valid law. And we know 

that in this case because the case ended up getting 

litigated to conclusion. But simply because we don't 

know that in other cases involving preliminary 

injunctions doesn't mean it isn't true, and that's why 

it's fundamentally unfair to impose fees on State 

defendants and local governments that haven't had a full 

and fair opportunity to defend their legal position.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
