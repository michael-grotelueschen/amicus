 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 

next in No. 03-9877, Jon Cutter v. Reginald Wilkinson.

 Mr. Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 When the government acts to remove government-

imposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate 

the Establishment Clause. Rather, as this Court put the 

point in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases 

those kind of burdens, it follows the best of our 

traditions. 

The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized 

Persons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on 

restrictions by having institutions and prison officials 

examine burdens on religious exercise and remove 

unjustified, substantial burdens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But, you know, when 

you say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens 

imposed by the Federal Government. It eases burdens 

imposed by State governments.

 MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but I think that -- that that doesn't make any 

substantial difference, in part, I think because if you 

think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's 

Spending Clause legislation. And spending legislation 

often takes the form of giving the States an incentive to 

take action on their own. And in this sense, I think you 

can understand this legislation as giving the States an 

opportunity to remove their own burdens on religious 

exercise. And that's precisely how it works in practice. 

The relevant action that a State takes is State action in 

removing its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on 

the States. 

And I think that's consistent with the analysis 

of this Court in the Dole case where the Federal 

Government, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have 

the direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the 

drinking age, but it could give the option to the States 

to exercise their power to do it. So I do think in the 

end, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to 

the State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government. 

It is also true that the standard that's imposed 

by RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by 

the Federal Constitution itself. But I don't think 

providing for greater accommodation of religious exercise

than the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment 

Clause problem. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But in -- in the City 

of Boerne, didn't we say that Congress couldn't come in 

and simply rewrite some part of the Constitution to make 

it read differently than we had?

 MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but 

I don't think this case poses the same problems as City of 

Boerne. First of all, this really isn't an effort to 

rewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that RFRA 

was. Congress in this legislation targeted two areas 

where there were particular problems with respect to 

religious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a 

different standard. 

Now, as I say, that standard is higher, but so 

are the standards of over half of the States which also 

apply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of 

State constitutional law or State law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, RFRA didn't involve a --

a limitation to situations in which Federal funds were 

involved, and as I understand this statute does.

 MR. CLEMENT: That is also true. I mean, there 

-- there is -- to be sure there is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: More than also. I -- that 

seems to me the principal difference between this and

RFRA.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I take your point, Justice 

Scalia. I would -- I would clarify that there is the 

potential for applications to the statute under the 

Commerce Clause. We don't think that's really 

appropriately presented here. We also think that with 

respect to State prisons in all their applications, they 

will be Spending Clause applications. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- what you're saying 

is academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal 

spending hook. It says it has the other commerce peg. I 

take it you -- you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that 

every State in fact gets Federal funds for their prison 

systems. 

MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Ginsburg, 

and I think the fact that there may be more than one hook 

for this legislation in certain applications shouldn't 

make any constitutional difference. And I think here it 

is Spending Clause legislation as it applies to the State 

of Ohio. I think that's conceded. They -- they take 

issue with whether it's valid. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Clement, it seems to 

me the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction, 

if we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause. The 

fact that Federal money is involved, why does that make

your burden any less in defending the -- the statute under 

the Establishment Clause?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I don't 

think the fact that there's money involved makes it harder 

or easier from a Spending Clause perspective. I think 

from the perspective of why this case is different from 

Boerne, the fact that it's Spending Clause and Commerce 

Clause and not section 5 legislation makes a big 

difference. But I certainly don't want to leave you with 

the impression that there's anything constitutionally 

problematic because there's Federal money involved 

because, of course, this Court has upheld Federal Spending 

Clause legislation in religion areas in cases like 

Zobrest, Mergens, Agostini, Mitchell against Helms. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you -- do you think the 

Establishment Clause issue in this case would be the same 

as the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we 

-- if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue 

in that case?

 MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't, Justice Stevens. Or 

another way of answering that is I would say that even 

though you thought there was an Establishment Clause 

problem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need 

to find one here. And part of that is because this is 

more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as

-- as it comes to this Court in this application, with the 

exercise of religion in prisons. And I think that's an 

area like the military where the Government is necessarily 

going to be involved with religion in a way that it 

otherwise wouldn't be. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And yet, it -- it provides an 

unusual framework or incentive, if you will, in the prison 

context to get religion. If you can find some religious 

group that espouses drinking beer every day or other 

alcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana 

or no telling what or having certain clothing or other 

things that would alter the conditions of the prison 

environment, there's a real incentive here to get 

religion. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And the --

MR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Federal Government seems 

to be trying to provide those incentives. Is that a 

problem? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't 

think upon analysis it is, and I think there's a couple of 

reasons why that's so. 

First of all, this is not an absolute 

entitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every

day. It is a balancing test, and I think things like 

getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison 

walls would not satisfy the test. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the -- the language of 

the statute is pretty strong: unless the government 

demonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive 

means and in furtherance of a compelling legislative 

interest. It puts quite a burden on the State.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, it does, Justice O'Connor, 

but just to take a step back, I mean, applying that same 

standard in the Smith case, you yourself thought that a 

general law banning marijuana use outside or -- or peyote 

use outside --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, I think it was.

 MR. CLEMENT: -- peyote outside of prison would 

be justified even under that standard. I would think, a 

fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls.

 I want to make another point about the 

incentives, though, which I think is important. Every 

State in the Union provides some degree of accommodation 

for religion, and in many States it's majoritarian 

religions that are accommodated. Now, if there's going to 

be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in 

order to take advantage of things offered for religion 

that aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA

has the virtue of making sure that all religions are 

accommodated neutrally. So if there's any incentive, it's 

an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to 

between sects -- sects of religions, and I think that's 

the way you would have without RLUIPA involved.

 The other point I want to make is although there 

may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that 

would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many 

of the reported cases involve things that I don't think 

people are necessarily lining up to do. I mean, there are 

a number of lower court cases dealing with the 

availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means 

as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get 

cold food rather than hot food. And I don't think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about garb that is said 

to be associated with the religion but also is used as a 

cue for gang membership? Let's say a beard. This 

religion requires me to wear a beard.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think --

and we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief 

that suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns 

about using prison -- religious symbols or other religious 

items as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the 

-- that there have been cases where the courts, even 

applying the heightened standard or RLUIPA or RFRA, have

deferred to the government officials.

 I also think, though, it's worth noting how the 

Federal Government and the Bureau of Prisons has dealt 

with the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to 

beards, would be used for gang identification or gang 

signification. Ohio, I take it, takes the position that 

if you have a medallion that could be used for those 

purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all. 

The Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position 

that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it 

inside your shirt. So it can't be used for prison 

signification purposes or gang identification purposes. 

And I think that shows the kind of reasonable 

accommodation that RLUIPA or RFRA, as it applies to the 

Federal Bureau of Prisons --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about a religion 

that it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races 

are to be separated and the person says, the accommodation 

I want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my 

race?

 MR. CLEMENT: I think in a case like that -- I 

mean, obviously, this Court's recent decision in Johnson 

would suggest that -- that the prison officials are in a 

difficult position there and I think they could not accede 

to that request. And I think complying with the Equal

Protection Clause in that context would itself be a 

compelling interest under the statute. And I think this 

Court in Widmar against Vincent, for example, suggested 

that avoiding Establishment Clause problems is a 

sufficient compelling interest. I would think equally 

avoiding the Equal Protection Clause violation in that 

context would also be a compelling interest, and I don't 

think there would be a least restrictive alternative. And 

so I think that the statute -- there would be no statutory 

violation in refusing that particular accommodation.

 I think there -- these show that there are ways 

to administer this statute in a way that's respectful of 

the decisions of local prison officials but also does make 

sure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these 

claims for religious exercise. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it -- does the statute 

require the prison officials to evaluate the bona fides of 

the particular religion that's espoused? Isn't one of the 

groups here a Satanist group? So the religion -- the bona 

fides of the group have to be reviewed by the prison 

authorities. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, no more so 

than under the Free -- the Free Exercise Clause itself. I 

mean -- and as this case, of course, comes to this Court, 

the substantiality of the religious beliefs and that they

are actually held by these individuals has been stipulated 

to. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We don't have to decide it 

here, but it's looming. And when it goes back, if it 

does, that will have to be resolved in this and in every 

case.

 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice O'Connor, 

but that's true under the Free Exercise Clause as well. 

So even the Sixth Circuit, that obviously had some 

problems with the statute, understood that on that score 

there's no more entanglement with religion under RLUIPA 

than there is under the Free Exercise Clause itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Haven't we said in at 

least one of our cases that the government can't favor 

religion over irreligion?

 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, 

but this Court has been clear in the context of 

legislative accommodations of religion in particular to 

make clear that that preference of religion over 

irreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide 

legislative accommodations of religion without providing 

benefits for secular organizations as well. That was the 

clear holding of this Court in Amos. 

And I think that although this Court has 

expressed concerns about religious accommodations when

there's no guarantee that the religious accommodation will 

be provided to other sects -- take, for example, the 

Kiryas Joel case. This Court has been quite clear that 

there is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion 

over irreligion in providing legislative accommodations 

for religion. 

And as I said, in -- in Zorach against Clauson, 

this Court noted that that's not just the absence of a 

constitutional problem, but there's really a 

constitutional virtue in the legislature acting to 

accommodate religion. The Court made basically the same 

point in Smith in saying that even though the Free 

Exercise Clause did not require the special accommodation 

or exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and 

in doing so, they would be furthering constitutional 

values.

 If I could say a few words about the Spending 

Clause claim that is brought by Ohio in this case. They 

suggest that there's a difficulty with this legislation 

under the Spending Clause. Now, the court below --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is that before us on 

the questions presented?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it is not in the 

questions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think 

it would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because

it would be an alternative ground to support the judgment 

below. That said, this Court doesn't have to reach it and 

its practice in recent cases has been when there's one 

constitutional claim that is -- that the Court has ruled 

on below, it doesn't necessarily reach the other -- the 

other constitutional claims. The Court did that in cases 

like Oakland Cannabis and the Pierce County case.

 And we would urge the same course here because, 

although the courts have divided on this Establishment 

Clause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending 

Clause issue. All the courts that have reached it have 

upheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation. 

And I think that reflects the fact that there is 

a clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the 

Federal conditions that are being imposed. If the Federal 

Government is going to provide money, over $1 million to 

Ohio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal 

Government can insist that kosher meals are among the 

available options. And so too if the -- if the Federal 

Government is going to provide monies for Ohio to build 

prisons, they can ensure that those prisons are safe and 

are operated consistent with Federal policy such that 

there's not discrimination on the basis of race or 

religion.

 The last issue in the case, of course, is the

Commerce Clause issue, and on that issue, no court below 

reached the issue. And we think this Court's recent 

admonition in the Sabri case that facial challenges are 

best when infrequent, applies with particular force here 

because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't understand, 

Mr. Clement, how your second point strengthens your first 

point. That is to say, if we disagree with your first 

point, namely that the institutionalized persons 

provisions are consistent with the Establishment Clause, 

we think that they contradict the Establishment Clause, 

they couldn't possibly be saved by your second point. Can 

you require as a -- as a condition of -- under the 

Spending Clause that a State violate the Establishment 

Clause?

 MR. CLEMENT: No, of course not, Justice Scalia, 

and I must have misspoke. My point is they raise three 

arguments that are all alternative arguments to support 

the judgment below. My burden is to defeat all three of 

them to show -- if the Court reaches them. So I have to 

show that there's no Establishment Clause violation, which 

we -- we've certainly made that argument in the brief and 

here today, and that there's no Spending Clause violation, 

and that there's no Commerce Clause violation.

 The -- in this case the Commerce Clause claim

has a completely abstract quality, and indeed, the only 

temptation to reach the issue at all would be that the --

since RLUIPA has a jurisdictional element, the resolution 

of the Commerce Clause is so clear that it might be 

tempting to reach it. But I think the better course would 

be for this Court to allow that issue to be sorted out in 

the --in the lower courts. 

If there are no further questions, I would 

reserve time for rebuttal.

Clement.

 Mr. Goldberger, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID GOLDBERGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GOLDBERGER: Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, 

and may it please the Court:

 This case comes before the Court on a motion to 

dismiss, and the facts, the underlying facts, involving 

the motion to dismiss are in dispute, and it's a serious 

dispute. And those should be reserved for -- for the 

court below, in particular the claims that our clients' 

religions are affiliated with gang activities, but there 

are serious disputes about that. There is a Wicca 

chaplain that's been hired by the Department of 

Corrections in Wisconsin. Two of my former students, who

are upstanding members of the bar in every respect, are 

Asatrus, so that these are matters that should be 

preserved for the court below.

 This Court has made -- asked many questions 

about the accommodation of religion, and the suggestion 

is, well, isn't there favoritism? Doesn't it encourage 

favoritism one way or the other? But the answer to each 

of those questions is the same with respect to the current 

accommodations already provided by the Ohio Department of 

Corrections with respect to mainstream religions, and in 

fact, we believe on remand, we will be able to show that 

there is a preference for accommodating mainstream 

religions as opposed to non-mainstream religions.

 Similarly, there has -- there are -- there have 

been questions by this Court that -- that the standard 

imposed on the State of Ohio by RLUIPA is this 

particularly difficult or tortuous standard. In fact, 

under State law in Humphrey v. Lane, which is cited in our 

brief, the State of Ohio Supreme Court has already imposed 

a similar standard with regard to the religious 

accommodation claims of prison guards. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is Satanism a non-mainstream 

religion?

 MR. GOLDBERGER: With all due respect, Your 

Honor, I understand that there is some uncomfortable

feeling about the nature of my clients' religion. As the 

Court will note in a -- a footnote in our brief, it has 

been reported in the press that there is an adherent in 

the Royal Navy of Satanism, and the Royal Navy has agreed 

that if he's killed in the line of duty that there will be 

religious rights at the end consistent with his religion 

and, in fact, it amounts to a recognition of his religion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does this have to do with 

it? The Royal Navy you say?

 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, I --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Our Royal Navy? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GOLDBERGER: The answer is yes then. It is 

a non-mainstream religion.

 And I think that it's important for us to assure 

that religious groups of all stripes are -- are 

accommodated in the -- in the context --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent? And I asked 

the -- the racist -- the religion that says God wanted the 

races to be separated and the accommodation is do not cell 

me with someone of another race.

 MR. GOLDBERGER: I believe that there is -- it 

-- the statute is pretty clear that if there is a -- if 

it's compelling or requiring the State of Ohio to engage

in an unconstitutional activity -- and that would be a 

segregation of the races -- that there's a compelling 

justification -- or a compelling governmental interest in 

not complying with the statute or saying that the statute 

does not apply under these circumstances. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about racist literature 

but it's under the aegis of a religious organization? And 

that -- suppose the prison does not permit, say, a member 

of the Aryan Nation to get that racist literature -- to 

get racist literature but --

MR. GOLDBERGER: To the extent that there is 

bona fide religious literature that is racist, there are 

-- we believe that the Constitution permits Congress or 

any legislative body to accommodate religion in isolation 

from other religious right --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, when you --

MR. GOLDBERGER: -- fundamental rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When you use the term 

bona fide, you're introducing a new kind of factor. Do 

courts evaluate the bona fides of someone claiming a 

religion?

 MR. GOLDBERGER: I believe they -- as a matter 

of course, prison officials have to determine whether 

there's a good faith request for religious accommodation 

or whether the person is trying to seek something under --

as a ruse. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it we've done that in 

the conscientious objector cases, United States v. Seeger 

and Gillette.

 MR. GOLDBERGER: That's correct. 

But to let me finish my -- my answer to Justice 

Ginsburg, if -- if this Court is of the view -- or members 

of this Court are of the view that it would be content 

discrimination, for example, although we believe that you 

can accommodate one fundamental right separately from the 

other fundamental rights, then of course, if there were a 

First Amendment violation, that too would be a compelling 

governmental interest in justifying refusal to apply 

RLUIPA. So that there is no serious problem here. And in 

fact, there is no reported case that any racist literature 

has ever been permitted in -- into the prisons that we've 

been able to find. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the content 

discrimination, I take it, would be raised by someone who 

wants to get this for political or psychological 

reasons --

MR. GOLDBERGER: That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you would say, I'm not 

challenging the right of the -- as a member of this 

religious sect. I just say, me too.

 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, as I say, to the extent 

that that's right, if there were content discrimination 

along those lines and -- and the Court said that there 

could not be -- it was the Court's view that it could not 

be accommodated for religion only, then of course the --

then there would be a compelling governmental interest in 

avoiding content discrimination. In terms of whether or 

not there's a compelling justification of dealing with 

inflammatory literature, I don't think that's in dispute 

in this case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it 

underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is -- is the 

concern that this accommodation is unequal because there 

are other First Amendment rights that are not given the --

that are not given the same precedence.

 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, first of all --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that was at least an 

underlying concern of her question, and I think it's a 

legitimate concern.

 MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, as -- as I read Amos, 

Amos says that the accommodation of religion need not 

come --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in Amos, the Court 

was just -- the -- the government was just saying that one 

of its own statutes could be accommodated. This is

something different. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, it's not -- I'm not sure 

that it's different for constitutional purposes, that if 

there is a differential accommodation which the Court 

concludes violates the First Amendment rights of someone 

else because there's content discrimination, I'm not --

there is no reason to treat the source of the 

accommodation as dispositive. It's whether -- it is the 

presence of the accommodation and whether it's broad 

enough or narrow enough. 

On the other hand, the -- we -- we do want to 

make clear that there are numerous accommodations that 

involve First Amendment rights that do not overlap with --

with religious exercise or accommodation of religious 

exercise. To the extent that there is political 

gatherings, they're not entitled under the First Amendment 

to the -- they're not accommodated in the same way that 

religious congregations in prison are accommodated. And 

this Court so far has found there to be no constitutional 

violation for that distinction. And to the extent that 

there's a compelling governmental interest, there is 

little doubt that the -- that the prison officials can 

simply say no. This -- we will not accommodate it. We're 

not required to accommodate it under the statute.

 The -- it is important to note, that the --

these same accommodations are routinely granted to 

mainstream religions and that they do not shift burdens to 

third parties. There's been substantial argument that 

there is a substantial shifting of burdens to third 

parties. In fact, where third party claims have been made 

by the State of Ohio was that basically that the cost of 

security is increased because now it takes more -- or the 

cost of prison administration is increased because it 

takes more time to take care of these claims and requests 

for accommodation than there would be if they didn't have 

to attend to these --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm sorry. You've lost 

me. I don't know what you mean about shifting burdens to 

third parties. What --

MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, the argument is that 

when, for example, a religious accommodation forces -- and 

-- and -- the third parties to chip in, as they had to do 

in Caldor, for example, private third parties, that that 

renders the accommodation unconstitutional. And the State 

has been arguing that the lifting of burdens on the 

religious exercise of our clients makes it harder for 

their prison guards --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 

Goldberger.

 Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court:

 In prison's unique environment, RLUIPA violates 

the Constitution. It directly and impermissibly advances 

religion and it would have to be -- have to be --

perceived by objective observers as endorsement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this -- this 

question because it -- it -- I think it goes to the -- the 

heart of what I think is the problem in this case. If we 

are going to recognize a sphere of accommodation, which we 

have done previously, I think we have to recognize that 

the -- that the object of accommodating and the effect of 

accommodating is, in one sense, to benefit -- I mean, in 

an obvious sense, is to benefit religion. By recognizing 

a sphere of accommodation, in effect, I think the Court 

has said there is a sphere in which religion can be 

benefitted that does not rise necessarily to the level of 

government proselytization or -- or government 

endorsement. And it seems to me that the argument that 

you're making is that if the government endorses at all, 

it's immediately in -- in the -- the realm of 

establishment. Am I -- am I missing something in your 

argument?

 MR. COLE: Well, I think you are, Your Honor, 

and if our brief came across that way, I -- I think it 

overstates the line that we're asking this Court to draw. 

The Court has recognized, in talking about accommodations, 

that of course accommodations by their very nature benefit 

religion. That's part of an accommodation and could be 

said to have the effect. But the Court has said then we 

must draw lines. That is, the Court has recognized that 

you can't just say, oh, it's an accommodation which means 

that's fine, it's always going to be fine if it's an 

accommodation. In fact, Justice O'Connor said we need to 

draw lines because otherwise everything will just become, 

oh, that's an accommodation. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. And -- and why is 

the line violated here?

 MR. COLE: The line is violated here, Your 

Honor, because of the unique incentives and burdens that 

arise in the prison context. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what the statute 

appears to be doing is to try to go back to the pre-

Employment Division v. Smith case standard under the Free 

Exercise Clause, which did allow for accommodation of 

religion. And that appears to be what this statute is 

designed to do.

 MR. COLE: But in -- in prison's unique

environment, Your Honor, where there are so many 

deprivations of liberty and then to say the one -- one way 

you can get out from under the thumb of all these prison 

regulations is to claim religion, and that's going to give 

you a powerful weapon not again to --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But -- but before Employment 

Division v. Smith, wouldn't we have had the same question 

arise in the prison context, and we would have dealt with 

it under the then-standards.

 MR. COLE: But -- but the Court has -- has 

always articulated that the rules -- well, in Turner and 

O'Lone, the Court articulated that the rules are different 

in prison, citing to the intractable problems of prison 

administration and the -- and the problems of 

subjecting --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But had the Court ever said 

that the Free Exercise Clause couldn't be applied in the 

prison context?

 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor. Going -- going back 

to the Beto case, the Court said free exercise applies in 

prison, but in O'Lone, the Court said it applies in prison 

but the standard what we're going to use is one that's 

very similar to -- to rational basis. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Then I think you're 

saying that in order to exceed what free exercise requires

in a prison necessarily forces you into establishment. 

And I think you're saying the reason it does so is that 

there are so many incentives on the part of prisoners to 

claim religion, that that's the only way you can sort of 

keep the genie in the bottle. Isn't that the -- the 

essence of your argument? 

MR. COLE: We're not asking for that bright line 

rule, Your Honor. It could well be the case that 

providing kosher meals, for instance, whether that's 

required by the Free Exercise Clause or not, it might go 

marginally beyond what free exercise requires. That's an 

accommodation that would be perfectly legitimate. But to 

have a rule that says anytime you bring any request of any 

kind for an accommodation from any rule, it's going to be 

treated differently and better because it's religion --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- but -- but that is 

not what the rule says. Number one, as -- as your brother 

on the other side pointed out, there's got to be some 

determination made as a threshold matter as to whether 

this is even a religious claim or -- or whether it's just 

gaming the system. So there's nothing automatic.

 Number two, if there are, as -- as there 

frequently will be, in the prison context important 

governmental interests which can only be served by denying 

the -- the request, the request can be denied. And it

seems to me that if these are not sufficient recognitions 

of the -- of the prison context, then I don't know what 

kind of a rule we can have that would satisfy you except 

to say if it isn't absolutely required by free exercise, 

it is establishment.

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I don't think we 

need to go that far. I -- I think we could look at given 

types of accommodations and say if a legislative 

determination is made that this type of accommodation with 

respect to this type of request is appropriate, based on a 

balancing of all the factors to consider in that 

particular case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you --

MR. COLE: -- that might not slide --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean specific 

accommodations like you can have kosher foods, you can 

wear a religious medal, you can have a tattoo? I mean, 

you're -- you're asking the legislature to be that 

specific. 

MR. COLE: Well, a narrow, targeted -- I guess 

the point is, Your Honor, a narrow, targeted accommodation 

would be different in our view than this broad, wonder bus 

approach to accommodation. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it would also be rather a 

discriminatory one, wouldn't it? I mean, one -- one point

that we have got to be concerned about, whether we're 

dealing with accommodation or whether we're dealing with 

-- with flat-out establishment, is distinction among 

religions. And I think you're saying if they do 

distinguish among religions, we don't have this problem, 

but I think that lands you from the frying pan into the 

fire.

 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor, I -- I don't believe 

so because I think if, for instance, the legislature said, 

you -- you shall, absent some compelling need, provide 

prisoners with a diet that meets their religious 

requirements, that would not discriminate among religions. 

It would be narrowly tailored to some perceived problem 

that might exist. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: A guy comes along in a 

different religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got 

to -- we got to wear medals. No statute that says medals 

are okay. It -- it -- you know, I realize the level of 

generality in your example is higher. The -- the 

discrimination is not quite so blatant, but it's a pretty 

tough job to come up with -- would be a tough job to come 

up with statutes without picking and choosing among 

religious demands.

 MR. COLE: And, Your Honor, we believe that in 

prison's unique environment, to the extent you go beyond

the Free Exercise Clause, it raises special problems and 

special concerns that need to be dealt with --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't they --

MR. COLE: -- on a case by case basis. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But why can't they be dealt 

with under the statute as it is written, saying that if 

you -- if it is a bona fide request, and you, the prison, 

determine that in fact you -- you have a compelling State 

interest that cannot be served in any other way, you can 

say no? Why is that insufficient and -- and why does that 

-- why is that, therefore, the reason that -- that jumps 

us into an Establishment Clause violation every time?

 MR. COLE: It's insufficient, Your Honor, 

because it doesn't change the underlying fact that the 

request itself, whatever the ultimate outcome on the 

request is, the request itself gets treated differently 

and better merely because it's religious. This is a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you saying that --

that a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a 

prisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a --

a kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights, 

recognizing privacy rights, et cetera?

 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor. I'm -- I'm not 

suggesting that. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then it's got to single out

religion.

 MR. COLE: And -- and as the Court noted in 

Amos, these type of statutes are necessarily going to 

single out religion, but that doesn't shield them from 

Establishment Clause scrutiny just because they take the 

form of being directed at religion and providing a benefit 

that's -- that's labeled as an accommodation.

 I mean, for instance, Congress could say, look, 

we think it's difficult for State prisoners to practice 

their religious beliefs when they can't go to church. So 

absent some compelling State interest and least 

restrictive alternatives, the prisons need to arrange to 

release prisoners once a week to go to the church or 

synagogue of their choice. Well, that would provide an 

awfully powerful incentive inside prison walls for 

prisoners to -- to claim religion. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure it woul --

JUSTICE BREYER: So maybe that's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if you did it under the 

statute, you would clearly have a reason for saying no. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cole, are you sure that 

this statute doesn't go beyond pre-Smith -- our pre-Smith 

law? I'm not aware that our pre-Smith law would have 

defined religious exercise as broadly as this statute 

defines it. I guess this is something Mr. Clement ought

to speak to as well. It says, the term religious exercise 

includes any exercise of religion whether or not compelled 

by or central to a system of religious belief.

 MR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor. That is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did our prior Smith cases go 

that far? I'm not aware that --

MR. COLE: No, they did not, Your Honor, and I 

think that's an important as well, that once someone has 

an -- a bona fide religion and -- and prison officials can 

challenge whether this is in fact a religious set of 

beliefs. But if they have a religious set of beliefs and 

if they are sincere, then you can't challenge this 

particular request as not being mandated by the religion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't even have to say my 

-- my religion requires me not to eat this food. They 

just say, you know, I'm --

MR. COLE: For religious reasons, I would prefer 

to do this. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What is your argument in 

response to Justice Souter? You said it is not the 

following. It is not that the State has to list, along 

with these religious matters, the Second Amendment, the 

First Amendment, et cetera. It's not that. You then seem 

to say that the argument is that a person who files a

piece of paper and claims to be religious, that they have 

to consider it, and it's impelled only by religion. I 

suppose the same thing is true of a church that applies 

for a tax exemption. So I don't think that you could say 

that automatically that fact that they're going to give 

the church a tax exemption or that they're going to give 

the religious person some special consideration, that that 

in and of itself violates the Establishment Clause. Very 

well. What does?

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I wish I could draw 

a brighter line rule --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. But I just need to know 

where you're going --

MR. COLE: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- generally. I don't need a 

bright line rule. I'm just trying to find out what it is 

about this that violates the clause if it isn't the first 

thing or the second thing that I mentioned.

 MR. COLE: It's the magnitude by which Congress 

has enhanced the religious right. That is, we compare 

what the Constitution requires State prison officials to 

do and we say, how far has Congress moved the ball. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, in respect to that, 

we have two points. One was Justice O'Connor's I think, 

which is that Congress is not enlarging it, but for my

second qualification, beyond what it would have been if 

Smith had never been decided. And the second is Justice 

Scalia's point, which is but there is one respect in which 

Congress did enlarge it, namely, that the right doesn't 

have -- the belief doesn't have to be central. It could 

be -- well, he just read that. 

So is your whole argument then pinned on that 

latter point? And if it is not, again, what is it?

 MR. COLE: Well, our argument is pinned on this 

Court's decisions in Turner and O'Lone, which we see as 

establishing the baseline for what type -- for what the 

Constitution requires in terms of free exercise in prison, 

and then we use that baseline and compare the standard 

imposed there to the standard Congress is seeking to 

impose through RLUIPA and compare the magnitude of the 

two, understanding, as this Court has said in Lemon, that 

lines of demarcation are difficult to perceive. It's 

difficult to say exactly where that line should be. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying if Turner had 

come up prior to Smith, the Court would have said that 

Turner trumps pre-Smith law, and you don't have to follow 

pre-Smith law in the prison.

 MR. COLE: I -- I believe so, Your Honor, given 

prison's unique environment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I understand --

 MR. COLE: I believe Turner and O'Lone are 

prison cases that talk about what the Constitution means 

in prison, understanding that in prison there need to be 

changes to what we would otherwise see as the inmates' 

constitutional rights if they were not in prison. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I -- I understand the 

argument now, which has been helpful. Very well. 

From the prison's point of view, why is it so 

burdensome since you would have thought security is a 

compelling interest, prison administration is a compelling 

interest, so that really all we have to do is think about 

this and look to see whether there isn't some reasonable 

way of accommodating the request? 

MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the 

burdens in the prison environment are twofold. First, 

RLUIPA forces prison officials to change the balance they 

would otherwise strike between safety and accommodation, 

and by changing that balance, changing the margin of 

safety, if you will, they're now imposing risks on the 

other inmates that are in prison. And these aren't 

merely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think you may 

exaggerate what it takes to establish a compelling State 

interest. I mean, we -- this -- this Court held in the --

in the pre-Smith days that it was a compelling State

interest to -- to prevent members of the Air Force from 

wearing yarmulkes. I mean, if that's a compelling State 

interest, I think it's pretty easy to get most anything 

declared a -- a compelling State interest under this 

statute, don't you think?

 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. And compelling 

State interest doesn't present a problem to the State of 

Ohio or to the other States that are operating under this 

statute. What it -- what presents the problem is the 

least restrictive alternative part of that which subjects 

State prison officials in their day-to-day judgments 

regarding prison operations to a strict scrutiny analysis 

on the back end. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that goes beyond pre-Smith 

too, doesn't it? Least restrictive alternative.

 MR. COLE: The -- the least restrictive 

alternative, which is what puts the teeth in RLUIPA and 

what's -- what creates the problem --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We now have some experience 

in the Federal system where the same standards apply under 

RFRA. And you are positing this terrible disturbance of 

prison administration in the -- what is it -- 6 years that 

-- that RFRA has been in force for Federal prisons. Have 

there been -- has there been this terrible disruption? 

Have there been -- have the accommodations required so

much of the prison administrators?

 MR. COLE: Well, the United States claims no, 

Your Honor, of course. But when we look back at the 

experience of the States with RFRA, before it was declared 

unconstitutional, we presented substantial evidence in the 

-- in the joint appendix with regard to the way in which 

there was an explosion of demands for accommodations by 

prisoners from previously unheard of religions. There was 

an expansion -- an explosion of claims of conversion 

within --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now that some of 

that has gotten sorted out through the experience of the 

Bureau of Prisons on the Federal side, one would expect 

there would be less of those far-out claims. The -- you 

would expect when a statute is new, that there might be 

some claims that we would recognize as frivolous after 

there's been experience under it.

 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor, but the 

difficulty that doesn't seem to go away with the least 

restrictive alternative test is -- is the possibility, as 

this Court noted in Turner, that every judgment every day 

is subject to some court somewhere finding that there was 

a less restrictive way of achieving the goal. And -- and 

we see that --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is true. Now there you're

in the dilemma. I mean, you're putting yourself there in 

the same position that virtually every official is in in 

the United States but for judges who have -- who have to 

worry about the court of appeals. But anyway, the --

the --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: You see -- now, the answer to 

that argument in your case, you're in a vice. They put 

you in a -- in a kind of pincers because where you have a 

good argument, they say, well, that doesn't violate the 

statute, and where your claim is weak, they say, well, it 

shouldn't be a -- it should violate the statute. And the 

difficulty with being in pincers like that is you can't 

win. And the virtue of it is you shouldn't win. All 

right. So -- so how do you get out of this -- of the --

of that kind of an argument? 

MR. COLE: Well, that's not particularly 

encouraging, Your Honor, but --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but -- your point. 

MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and I guess 

all I can do is go back and compare the accommodation if 

that's what this is that's at issue here with that that 

was at issue in Amos to say these employers don't need to 

comply with this one Federal statute and this one set of

obligations. And I asked, well, okay, so an employer. Is 

that going to make IBM switch from being a computer 

manufacturer to being a religious services provider 

because, boy, if we do that, we can get out from 

underneath title VII's nondiscrimination mandate? I don't 

think so. 

But if I look in prison and I say, what is going 

to be the effect on the ground with respect to people 

claiming religion or converting to religion if I tell them 

there's going to be a different regulatory regime that 

applies to you --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why hasn't that been the 

effect on the Federal ground.

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, I -- I don't know that it 

hasn't. I mean, I'm -- I'm surprised in a sense to hear 

that claim because in brief period in which RFRA did apply 

to State prisons, there was an explosion of these demands. 

And -- and I would direct the Court to, I believe it's, 

204, 210, 211, and 212 in the joint appendix to see some 

of the ways in which there's been this impact. I'd 

also --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'll -- I'll grant you that, 

but it seems to -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg responded to 

that by saying that these things get sorted out. At the 

beginning you get all sorts of loony claims. As time goes

by, you get fewer of them. And -- and if -- if they 

weren't getting few of them, I would have expected the 

United States to make a different representation. 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, I don't know that the 

fact that -- that strict scrutiny might become -- what 

that means, what that's going to require. And arguably, 

this is a slightly different strict scrutiny than other 

strict scrutinies because of some of the legislative 

history, to the extent one -- one wants to look at that.

 And -- and that's, I guess, the problem. As we 

flesh that out, during that entire time, we're saying it's 

all right to burden other inmates in prisons. It's all 

right to burden prison officials. It's all right for 

Congress not to burden Federal prison officials, but for 

Congress to burden State prison officials with this new 

set of obligations. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I don't know what that's 

got to -- you know, you may or may not have an argument 

there, but I don't know what it's got to do with the 

meaning of the Establishment Clause.

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And they're not burdening you 

anyway -- anyway. Just don't take the money.

 MR. COLE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It comes with the money.

 MR. COLE: I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want the burden? 

Don't take the money. I mean, they -- they do that all 

the time. 

MR. COLE: I'm not sure I agree with that, Your 

Honor, for -- for a couple of reasons. First, this also 

purports to be Commerce Clause legislation, in which case 

it would be a mandate upon the States whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What we have before us in this 

case is -- is a case covered by the -- the Spending 

Clause. So we don't have to grapple with the Commerce 

Clause for now. 

MR. COLE: But -- but secondly, Your Honor, with 

respect to the Spending Clause issue, this Court has said 

in Dole that there needs to be relatedness between the 

spending, that if there's going to be strings attached, 

they actually have to be attached to the Federal money in 

some meaningful way. And here, Congress is relying on 

spending, most of which has absolutely nothing to do --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the Sixth Circuit 

didn't pass on the Spending -- Spending Clause issue.

 MR. COLE: No, they did not, Your Honor, but 

we --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And it isn't raised by 

your opponent's petition.

 MR. COLE: That's -- that's true, Your Honor, 

but it is available to the Court as an alternate ground of 

affirmance of -- of the decision below. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, if we're looking 

for that. 

MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was one question 

brought up about Ohio's own practice. But you -- you say 

we have no obligation to relieve burdens. If we did, we 

would violate the Establishment Clause. The point was 

made that Ohio pays for chaplains, but it doesn't pay for, 

say, psychologists to come in for agnostics. So aren't 

you right there violating the Establishment Clause on your 

own theory?

 MR. COLE: I don't believe so, Your Honor, 

because our theory isn't that anytime you go beyond what 

free exercise requires, you're immediately into an 

Establishment Clause violation. We recognize that there 

is a play in the joints. And providing chaplains, given 

the -- the rich history and tradition of doing so in 

prisons, seems to fall very comfortably within that play 

in the joints. 

The question is when have we gone too far. When 

has our accommodation slid over, as the dissent put it in 

Texas Monthly, into a -- or an impermissible incentive to

practice religion? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr. 

Cole? I am troubled also, as you point out, about the 

least restrictive language in the statute. But as I try 

and apply it to this particular case, weren't most of the 

allegations that the petitioners made is that they were 

treated differently from other mainstream religions and 

that the accommodation would have been, well, treat them 

the same, which would have been the least restrictive 

alternative? It wouldn't have created all the problems 

you describe. And they say they don't -- can't have group 

meetings. They -- if they were treated exactly the same, 

would that -- that would satisfy the least restrictive 

alternative part of the statute, wouldn't it? And why 

would that be such a burden?

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, first, I'm not sure that 

their claim is that, oh, we're being treated differently 

and worse. Their claim was we want to get together for 

congregate religious services or, in Mr. Hampton's case --

he was a Wicca -- he wanted certain objects, including a 

quartz crystal that he would be able to keep in his cell.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't mainstream religion 

adherents have certain objects they'd like to keep in 

their cell?

 MR. COLE: They -- they may well, Your Honor,

and -- and the point is in each of those cases, prison 

officials look at the object and say what's the potential 

for harm here. Should we let them have it in their cell? 

There's a -- there's a practice in Ohio prisons of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The mainstream person, if 

there's a potential for harm, they wouldn't let them keep 

it in the -- in the cell, would they?

 MR. COLE: That's right, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And in other words, is it 

really -- although the language in the statute seems to go 

farther, is there anything really at stake here beyond 

saying treat us the same as you treat mainstream --

members of mainstream religions?

 MR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And what is the best example 

of that? 

MR. COLE: There's a -- a request for a prisoner 

who wants the grooming regulations changed with respect to 

him. He's a prisoner who's got a history of contraband 

violations. He's involved in a -- in a prison betting 

pool and carries -- tries to carry betting slips and 

secret them on his person. And so if he could violate the 

grooming regulations, the concern is he might use that to 

hide contraband. There are prisoners that want to wear 

their hair in a certain way to signify gang affiliation,

and instead, they claim, well, I need this for religious

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you want us to say that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me that would 

be a compelling interest to say you can't do that.

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, again, I'm -- I'm sure 

there's a compelling interest. The question is the least 

restrictive alternative. Are we going to be able to meet 

every Federal judges' view of is this the least 

restrictive way we could go about achieving this 

compelling interest? There's no doubt that prison 

security is going to be recognized as a compelling State 

interest, but the difficulty is the least restrictive 

alternative test. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose you're 

saying you want us to make the holding that -- one of the 

holdings you'd be satisfied with is that while some 

accommodation is -- is appropriate, this is extreme 

accommodation. What's your best case for that? 

I -- I just can't remember a case in which we've 

tried to ask whether every form a request for 

accommodation has to be acknowledged. Is -- is this the 

only case that you've come across? 

MR. COLE: Frankly, Your Honor, other than RFRA,

it's the only time Congress has gone this far. And so to 

say that there's a lack of case law on this is more to 

suggest that there's been settled understandings that we 

can't go this far rather than --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess what I'm asking 

is what's the closest analogy you can --

MR. COLE: In our brief we -- we looked at Lee 

v. Weisman in what the Court called subtle and indirect

coercion to religion when it was merely standing for a --

a invocation during graduation once a year. And we 

contrast that with what's going on here and the constant 

pressure day after day, if you want this set of benefits, 

get religion. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What about the American Indian 

who didn't -- or was it -- I think it was an American 

Indian. But -- who didn't want to be known -- it was a 

woman and she didn't want to known as a number. She 

wanted a name. That was a religious basis. And Social 

Security -- I think the Court hold -- didn't have to give 

her that.

 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So that to me stood for the 

proposition that administrative considerations play an 

important role in deciding whether you've hit upon the 

least restrictive alternative. And as long as that was

the law, then you're okay. And that was a Supreme Court 

case I think. I may be misremembering. 

MR. COLE: Again, Your Honor, it's not that we 

couldn't potentially win these cases under least 

restrictive alternative. The question is by changing the 

standard to that, changing the standard to one in which 

these prison officials -- I mean, Congress is, in a sense, 

asking Federal judges to sit as overseers of religious 

life in the prisons across the 50 States. And given what 

this Court said in Turner, given what this Court said in 

O'Lone about the intractable problems that prison 

officials face, it just seems an inappropriate task and 

one that, if motivated with the desire of increasing 

religiosity in prison, seems to cross the Establishment --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're asking us --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it -- why is it worse 

for -- for judges to be overseers of religious life in 

prison than it is for wardens to be overseers of religious 

life in prison? I mean, somebody has to say what the 

lines are, what will -- what will be accommodated and what 

won't. 

MR. COLE: Right, and it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that someone is going to be 

a government official. I have no reason to believe that 

wardens are -- are better at it than judges except with

respect to, you know, security and administrative 

convenience, which we will honor under this statute.

 MR. COLE: Except, Your Honor, this Court noted 

in Turner, I believe it was, that the need for judicial 

deference is particularly strong when you're dealing with 

situations that create ripple effects in prison. And it's 

difficult for Federal judges to know. They don't have 

prison management experience. They don't have 20 years on 

the ground like most prison wardens do to say this -- this 

accommodation will work and this one won't. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I think that means that 

they will give great deference to what the -- what the 

wardens of the prisons say is a compelling interest of --

of the penal system. 

MR. COLE: If they will, it's not in the face of 

the statute, Your Honor. I mean, it's not in the face of 

the statute. It says compelling State interest and least 

restrictive alternative. 

I would just like to note --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you give me an 

example? Because most of the things I think of is either 

you can have kosher food or you cannot. Either you can 

wear a yarmulke or you're not. There's not other --

another alternative. Most of these things are yes and no.

we'll give you something lesser?

 MR. COLE: Well, I believe Mr. Clement noted 

that -- that there was a case that held that, okay, you 

can't wear the medallion on the outside of your shirt, you 

can wear it on the inside of your shirt. So that would be 

a less restrictive alternative for not allowing you to use 

the medallion, I guess, as a gang identifier. Now, it 

doesn't really deal with the problem that as soon as the 

guard is not looking, again it can be pulled outside the 

shirt and can be used as a gang identifier. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe if the warden 

says that, the court would say, fine, you don't have to 

accommodate.

 MR. COLE: Maybe, Your Honor, but -- but the 

question is, is it permissible for Congress to create 

incentives for prisoners to say, yes, I'm religious 

because I want these other benefits? Can Congress really 

say, boy, we'd like you to be religious, and the way we're 

going to provide that incentive is by giving you a better 

shot at getting out from the rules in prison? It's not a 

guaranteed shot from getting out, but it's a better shot 

at getting out from the rules that apply to everybody else 

in prison and to get that, you have to become religious. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Better shot than -- better shot 

than what? Better shot than the -- than the Free Exercise

Clause alone would allow?

 MR. COLE: Better shot than --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And aren't you arguing that in 

the prison context, once you get beyond the free exercise 

line, you are into establishment?

 MR. COLE: Well, and Your Honor, I was not 

careful there. I should say much better shot. I mean, 

again, it's this point that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But how do we administer 

it? How does anyone administer that -- that kind of a 

test?

 MR. COLE: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It can -- it can be better but 

not much better?

 MR. COLE: I think by comparing to what's gone 

before. In fact, the Court has adopted a version of that 

approach already. In Caldor, the Court said if it's 

unqualified and imposes a burden on others, that's going 

to violate the Establishment Clause. 

I see my time is up, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It is. Thank you, Mr. 

Cole.

 MR. COLE: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Clement, you have 

4 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Just a few points in rebuttal. 

First of all, I'd like to note the anomaly that 

much of the argument of General Cole would be an argument 

for why the State constitutional provision that gives 

higher protection for freedom of conscience in Ohio is 

itself unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why don't you address the 

ways in which this act goes beyond our former free 

exercise --

MR. CLEMENT: I'd be happy to do that, Justice 

O'Connor. I think that there's been an exaggeration of 

how far it goes beyond. Now, I want to be clear about one 

thing, which is this Court, even before Smith and O'Lone, 

said that there was going to be deference to prison 

officials and a Turner standard would apply. So to the 

extent that there's a little less deference here than 

under the O'Lone standard, that is a modification.

 The centrality requirement, though, is not 

something that can be charged to RLUIPA or to RFRA because 

even before the Smith case, this Court in Ling and 

Hernandez was moving away from centrality and --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Also not compelled -- not 

compelled -- by religion. You just say, you know, I -- I 

want to give up everything except candy for Lent, and the 

-- the prison has to accommodate you. Right?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not compelled. I -- you 

know, I could do something else. But I had thought that 

our prior religion cases did -- did, indeed, require some 

religious compulsion than just I -- you know, I'd like to 

do this as a religious matter. 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I don't think this 

Court has ever in its accommodations cases held that the 

government can only accommodate those things that are 

central. I don't know for sure, but I rather doubt that 

employing co-religionists in a gymnasium is central to the 

practice of any faith. Yet, in Amos, this Court upheld 

that as a valid accommodation. 

And I do think the centrality requirement --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- the LDS.

 MR. CLEMENT: What's that? 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I said you may 

underestimate the LDS. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: I may, Mr. Chief Justice. But 

again -- but -- but to the extent I do, I think those are

questions that are best to be kept out of the courts, 

which is why even before Smith this Court moved away from 

centrality. It's why even Justice O'Connor, who otherwise 

was in disagreement in Smith, also agreed that we should 

get rid of the centrality requirement. 

And if you look at some of the cases that are 

actually decided under RLUIPA, the cases involve things 

like Muslim prayer oil and they -- the cases -- the 

Seventh Circuit, for example, allows it. Now, we don't 

want the courts getting into --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you're right. I think 

I was thinking of free exercise cases rather than 

establishment cases.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that's right, 

and I think there is not that centrality requirement for 

accommodations. 

I do want to make the point, though, that --

that Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this 

heightened review with a lot of these, you know, least 

restrictive alternative tests and the like. Nobody thinks 

Ohio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution. 

That's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison 

context, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than 

an inmate. That -- those are the facts of Humphrey 

against Lane.

 It's also true that many of Ohio's arguments 

would suggest their own accommodations of some religions 

would give too much of an incentive for religious exercise 

and the like. And I think that's a defect as well. 

I don't think -- and I agree with Justice Souter 

in this regard -- that narrower accommodations actually 

raise more constitutional problems than broader 

accommodations. I think that this Court, for example, in 

Caldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly 

high level of generality, but yet this Court said and 

Justice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well, 

that's a preference for Sabbatarian religions. And I 

think you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board 

test. 

Justice Kennedy, you made a point about whether 

this is extreme in the degree that it accommodates 

religion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the --

than the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across 

the board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of 

State actions. So in that sense, the fact that it 

accommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader 

standard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a 

constitutional defect. 

The last point I wanted to make is on the racist 

literature hypothetical, and I think it is in large

measure just a hypothetical. As footnote 2 in our brief 

points out, prisons have been generally successful in 

keeping racist literature out even when it's supported as 

a claim for religious-based racist literature. The only 

cases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is 

when the -- the prison's own policy had exceptions in it 

that made very little sense. 

And in this case, for example, if you look at 

joint appendix page 118, there's an allegation that with 

-- with one piece of literature that was described as 

racist, that some prisoners were allowed to have it while 

others were not allowed to have that same kind of 

literature. Now, I don't know whether those claims are in 

fact true, but that's the kind of claim that should be 

able to go forward in a case like this. 

With all respect, I think the Sixth Circuit here 

made a mistake, ignored this Court's precedents, and 

should be reversed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 

Clement. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
