CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Oregon versus Guzek. 

Ms. Williams. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MS. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The eight amendment requires that a 

sentencing jury in a capital case must consider 

mitigation, which this Court consistently has defined 

as related to a defendant's background, character, or 

the circumstances of the offense. The Oregon Supreme 

Court in this case has broadly construed circumstances 

of the offense to include evidence that is inconsistent 

with the defendant's guilt. That holding is not 

constitutionally compelled and does not further the 

purpose of having the sentencing jury consider 

mitigation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Can you --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can you --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- possible that the 

Supreme Court of Oregon misapprehended some of the

facts in this case? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Justice O'Connor, it is 

possible that the Supreme Court was not aware that 

defendant's mother had testified in the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right. 

MS. WILLIAMS: -- guilt phase, and that's 

because defendant did not raise that issue in the trial 

court, did not move to have her alibi testimony 

admitted under the State statute that would have caused 

the Court to address her prior --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- testimony. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- need to vacate the 

judgment and remand for that, or --

MS. WILLIAMS: No --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do we just go ahead and 

MS. WILLIAMS: No, Justice O'Connor, I don't 

believe that there needs to be any change in the 

posture of the case in order -- in order for the Court 

to address the Federal issue, and that's because the 

significance of the Oregon Supreme Court ruling doesn't 

turn on whether someone's testimony was admitted in the 

guilt phase, or not. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, under Oregon law, is

it possible that some of the mother's testimony would 

be otherwise admissible at the penalty stage? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Under Oregon law, under the 

majority's holding in this case and the way they dealt 

with the grandfather's prior testimony, on remand 

defendant could have the mother's transcript from the 

guilt phase read, but what would be different about it 

under the Oregon Supreme Court holding, and what we're 

asking the Court to address, is what they can do with 

that alibi testimony, no matter what form it comes in. 

And that's the significant part of the Supreme Court 

holding. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- may -- I want 

you, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well. And 

perhaps the Respondent is the one to answer this 

question. Do you understand that they, on remand, if 

they prevail in this case, would want to introduce the 

mother's live testimony? 

MS. WILLIAMS: I am not sure. Under the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're not sure --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- Oregon Supreme --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- all right. 

MS. WILLIAMS: -- Court holding, they would 

certainly be free to introduce her live testimony. 

It's very clear from the Oregon Supreme Court decision

that any alibi evidence comes in, and that's not 

limited to evidence that was presented in the guilt 

phase, or even witnesses who had been in the guilt 

phase. And -- but coming back to what the court's 

holding focuses on is how that alibi evidence can be 

used in the remanded proceeding. And not only does it 

come in, and the primary statute on -- that they dealt 

with for the grandfather's testimony is really a 

statute that deals with admissibility of evidence --

prevents the parties from having to go through making 

foundations and other showings in order to get evidence 

admitted. But, under the Oregon Supreme Court holding, 

defense counsel can argue, based on that evidence, that 

the jury should consider the possibility that defendant 

is innocent, as a mitigating factor in determining the 

sentence. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't you under --

look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce 

one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in 

that transcript. Imagine that's the circumstance. If 

that's the circumstance, then I should think there is 

no doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the 

transcript are admissible. And I believe that under 

Oregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary 

case, a death-eligible person does have the right to

argue in the sentencing proceeding. Think back over 

that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts 

as to whether this man is guilty or not. Am I right --

am I right on the first part? Am I right on the second 

part? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Breyer, you are 

correct on the first part, but not on the second part, 

and that's because Oregon Supreme Court unanimously has 

construed Oregon's law on mitigation to say that what 

the Oregon Legislature intended was to have as 

mitigation only those pieces that are required by the 

eighth amendment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. In other words, 

prior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there 

was a death case -- maybe there weren't very many, but 

where there was one, under Oregon law -- we have the 

trial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the 

lawyer had no right to argue, under Oregon law. Think 

back about your certainty as to whether this individual 

is guilty. 

MS. WILLIAMS: That would be correct, Your 

Honor, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. 

MS. WILLIAMS: -- unless the eighth amendment

 JUSTICE BREYER: And did the court say, here 

-- the Oregon court, in this case -- one, You can 

introduce evidence, which it seems to have been 

mistaken about, about not being there, but that, 

second, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to 

argue the residual doubt? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor. And that's 

most clear, from the dissent, as characterizing the 

question that the Court is addressing. And the Oregon 

Supreme Court opinion is in the -- excuse me -- the 

appendix to the cert petition. And at page 68 

of the appendix from the dissent, Justice Gillette 

writes, "The issue in this case is whether under the 

emphasized wording of that statutorily required jury 

instruction," referring to the mitigation question, 

"defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the 

evidence that he proffered. The majority says he was. 

I disagree." 

JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. "Consider the evidence" 

is different from "making an argument about the 

evidence." And what I didn't see in the -- Oregon's 

majority opinion, is a statement that not only can this 

evidence be introduced -- because, after all, in a 

normal case, the jury's heard it --

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's the same jury. But I 

didn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question 

about what kind of argument the defense had the right 

to make at the sentencing trial in respect to the 

residual doubt that they might have from what they just 

heard. Can you point, in that opinion, to where they 

made that statement that you just said they made about 

the argument? 

MS. WILLIAMS: About the argument. Where I 

read -- no, I cannot point to specific language in the 

majority opinion that says "and defense counsel gets to 

make an argument based on this, and the jury must 

consider that." That comes from this Court's case law 

of how mitigating evidence must be treated once it is -

-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- required to be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to hold that. 

You want us to say that a defense counsel can be 

admonished by the judge not to make the argument that, 

"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final penalty. My 

client claims he's innocent. If, in 20 years, it turns 

out that there is evidence exonerating him, it will be 

too late. I want you to consider that and give him 

life." You can't make that argument.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, I -- our 

position is that the eighth amendment does not require 

that as a mitigating factor, that that is not one of 

the circumstances of the offense, certainly not -- it 

doesn't go to the defendant's character or background. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Williams, I don't -- I 

don't understand all of this discussion about what the 

-- whether the State law would have produced the same 

result, or not. We have never held, have we, that, 

where a State Supreme Court opinion clearly rests on a 

Federal ground, a Federal constitutional ground, we do 

not have jurisdiction if there is a possible State 

ground that would have left it -- led to the same 

result? Have we ever held that? 

MS. WILLIAMS: No, Justice Scalia. In fact -

-

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said just the 

opposite, haven't we? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't the thrust 

of my question, of course. The thrust of my question 

is that if, in fact, this evidence from the mother 

comes in under State law, it comes in under State law, 

because -- I have the cite; you know the --

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- section I'm referring to. 

If it comes in under State law, and they're not trying 

to prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon 

Supreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and 

not about what arguments to be made, I don't see what 

reason we would have to reach an issue that isn't in 

the case. 

MS. WILLIAMS: And, Justice Breyer, I think 

the primary reason that the State is concerned with it 

is because of the broad holding that the Oregon Supreme 

Court has announced under -- about what eight amendment 

requires. When you combine that with what this Court 

has said about what that means when evidence is 

mitigating evidence, then I think a necessary corollary 

of the Oregon Supreme Court holding is that defense 

counsel does get to make that argument, and that the 

jury must --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- be permitted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reason that the 

defendant couldn't introduce other evidence in his 

resentencing trial, is there? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Under the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if he has 

other -- he says, "I have other witnesses that go to

the residual-doubt question," and I would -- you know, 

on retrial, if he prevails here, presumably he would be 

entitled to put in that evidence, as well. 

MS. WILLIAMS: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. The Oregon Supreme Court's conclusion is very 

broad, that any alibi evidence comes in, and, as the 

dissent notes, that it also would not be limited simply 

to alibi evidence, but any evidence that is 

inconsistent with the guilt verdict in this case that 

would form a basis for arguing that doubt about the 

defendant's guilt should be a factor that the jury 

considers in responding to the mitigation question that 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me --

case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- ask you --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- if your opponent 

acknowledges that -- or stipulates, in effect, that 

he's not going to put anything in except what's already 

in the transcript? Then do we have a case?

MS. WILLIAMS: It's about the right to argue 

and what the jury is told to do with that. And it's 

also that the State is going to have to live with this 

decision in other capital cases, and other capital 

defendants --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But our --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- may not be willing to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- jurisdiction is limited 

to reviewing a final judgment in this case. 

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: We can't give an advisory 

opinion which would tell you what to do in other cases, 

which -- if that's all it does. 

MS. WILLIAMS: But I do not believe that a 

party can force the Court into that position by 

stipulating that, although the State Supreme Court 

holding permits it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But would they're --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- to do much more --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- they would be giving up 

the right that you claim you don't want them to have. 

MS. WILLIAMS: But they would give it up in a 

way that would basically lock the State into a box. We

get --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but not for this case. 

MS. WILLIAMS: -- review. Not for this case 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MS. WILLIAMS: -- that's correct. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's why I'm concerned 

that perhaps we're being confronted with a request for 

an advisory opinion. I don't know. Maybe they haven't 

categorically agreed to what -- they may be going --

willing to say that they aren't going to put anything 

else in. I don't really know that yet. 

MS. WILLIAMS: But I think their stipulation 

would have to have two parts -- one, that they wouldn't 

put anything else in that wasn't presented in the guilt 

phase; and, two, that they wouldn't argue that, based 

on that evidence, the jury should consider doubts about 

the defendant's guilt in deciding what the appropriate 

sentence is. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: We may -- we may not have 

held they have a constitutional right to make that 

argument, but do you -- do you think that State --

that you did -- you don't think they could even make 

the argument as a matter of State procedure or anything 

at all? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Not on the mitigation 

question, Your Honor. And that's because of the way 

the Oregon Supreme Court has construed the mitigation 

question, and has construed it to mean that only that 

which the eighth amendment requires is to be presented 

to the jury. The Legislature adopted that provision in 

response to this Court's mitigation case law, and 

that's what they were intending to implement, and 

nothing more than that. I think States are free to do 

more, but Oregon has not, as a matter of how the Oregon 

Supreme Court has --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is --

MS. WILLIAMS: -- construed the statute --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about Oregon revised 

stat 163.150? It says, "In a capital sentencing 

proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all 

evidence previously offered and received may be 

considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing." 

Now, that's Oregon law. It's long been there. What 

possible reason could Oregon have for having that 

provision, which is, "Jury, you shall consider all the 

evidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the

trial"? What reason could that be? How is it supposed 

to be relevant, "all evidence," unless it's relevant to 

the question of whether there is doubt? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Breyer, I'd point you 

to the -- an earlier part of that same section of the 

statute that says, "Evidence may -- in the sentencing 

proceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter 

that the court deems relevant to sentence." And their 

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's a different 

provision. I'm now thinking of the "normal case," 

where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the 

sentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law, 

"Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously 

heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes 

of what sentence they should impose." I just wonder 

what that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless 

the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's 

really -- "I'm completely certain he's guilty." 

MS. WILLIAMS: There -- it does serve a 

different purpose, Your Honor, and that is that -- when 

you read the entire section, what it -- what it does 

is, it says that, first of all, parties may present 

additional evidence, if it's relevant. The -- they 

cannot present repetitive, or cumulative, evidence that

had been presented earlier. And then, the court's 

supposed to inform that jury that what had come in the 

guilt phase may be considered in the penalty phase. 

And so -- and we've had the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if that 

provision weren't there, the court would have to 

decide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which 

pieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant 

to the penalty, and not to the guilt. Whereas, by just 

allowing everything in, but just telling the jury, "You 

only consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and 

not to the guilt," we -- the court does not have to 

enter into that item-by-item discrimination. 

MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, what it does 

is, it allows the jury to know that just because 

something hasn't been re-presented to them in the 

penalty phase, but came in, in the guilt phase, it's 

open for their consideration. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Without any clue --

MS. WILLIAMS: What it doesn't do --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- without any clue 

whether there's a relevance test? I mean, here we're 

talking about alibi evidence. If the determination of 

guilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty 

stage. That's why I found that statute so puzzling,

"Everything from the guilt phase comes in, you can 

consider," but it doesn't sort out, doesn't even tell 

them, relevance. 

MS. WILLIAMS: And, Justice Ginsburg, other 

jury instructions will inform the jury how to use what 

evidence. And this does not mean that evidence that 

has been presented is relevant for any purpose that 

anybody wants to put it to in the guilt phase. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't the basis on 

which the court decided this case, is it? 

MS. WILLIAMS: No, sir. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What we're saying here is 

that this is a possible basis on which the Oregon 

Supreme Court might have decided this case. They did 

not decide it on that case -- on that ground. They 

decided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt, 

not because of that provision of the statute, but 

because of the eighth amendment. And --

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I wasn't suggesting 

anything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was 

just curious about this statute that tells the jury, 

"You can consider everything," and gives them no

guidance, because some of it might be quite 

inappropriate for them to consider. 

MS. WILLIAMS: And the guidance does come 

from the other instructions that tell the jury what the 

specific questions are that they must answer in the 

penalty phase, and what they take into account in 

answering those questions. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What has our constitutional 

law regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to 

consider all mitigating factors -- the requirement that 

they have to be allowed to be take into account of that 

-- what guidance has that provided? Has our 

constitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating 

factor? 

MS. WILLIAMS: In -- it has. And I believe 

that in Franklin versus Lynaugh, this Court came very 

close to deciding this question, that residual doubt is 

not one of those mitigating factors. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Apart from that, apart from 

the fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we 

specified what factors the jury can take into account 

by way of mitigation? 

MS. WILLIAMS: There are some factors that 

the Court has described as being required as

appropriate for mitigation. So, age, the mental state

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that if a 

State listed specific factors that could be taken into 

account, and no others, that there would be 

considerable doubt whether this Court would allow such 

a statute to stand? 

MS. WILLIAMS: I think certainly with respect 

to the background and character of the defendant, but 

the question here would be a fairly limited restriction 

to say that circumstances of the offense presume that 

the offense has occurred and that the defendant is 

guilty; and so, evidence inconsistent with that guilt 

is not a circumstance of the offense. 

And I'd like to reserve time for rebuttal.

Williams.

relitigating his guilt at sentencing. Contrary to the 

reasoning --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any view 

on whether this question is properly before us, given 

the Oregon statutes? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Mr. Chief Justice, our view 

is that this Court certainly could reach the 

constitutional question presented. And, indeed, there 

are good reasons that this Court should. 

The Oregon Supreme Court squarely confronted, 

and resolved, the Federal constitutional question, and 

it is ripe for this Court's review. It is true, as 

Justice O'Connor suggested at the outset, that the 

Oregon Supreme Court appears to have been laboring 

under a factual misimpression -- namely, that 

Respondent's mother did not testify at the initial 

trial. That having been said, it appears to be clear 

that Respondent was seeking -- and is still seeking, 

even before this Court -- to introduce the live 

testimony of his mother. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

MR. SHANMUGAM: And the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But, based on what you have 

just said, which was my understanding, too, assuming 

the Oregon Supreme Court made the assumption that the

mother's testimony had not been admitted at prior 

trial, the only thing that the Oregon Supreme Court was 

ruling on was the admissibility of new testimony, and 

the use to which new testimony could be put, right? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is correct, 

Justice Souter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the --

MR. SHANMUGAM: I do think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if the other side says, 

"We totally give up any claim to introduce new 

testimony," then don't we have a jurisdictional 

problem? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that we would 

agree with the State of Oregon that a necessary 

implication of the Oregon Supreme Court's holding, 

albeit unstated, was that a defendant is 

constitutionally entitled to argue residual doubt, as 

well as to present evidence of residual doubt. Were 

that not true, the failure to admit the evidence would, 

in some sense, be harmless, since it is true, certainly 

to some extent, that the mere presentation of the 

evidence might lead to the jury taking it into account 

even absent an argument or instruction to that effect. 

But, as a practical matter, this Court has never 

distinguished, in its consideration of mitigating

factors, between the presentation of argument or 

evidence and obtaining --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, we --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- an instruction --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- have not, but it's 

possible for, it seems to me -- for all we know, it's 

possible that Oregon could say, "Look, we have a 

statute that says everything that was introduced at 

trial may be considered. That may be a good thing or a 

bad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they 

may consider it. But when the question comes, What new 

evidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing --

the sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict 

that only to evidence which, in our view, is required 

by the eighth amendment." 

So, if that is, then -- we don't -- I don't 

know whether the Oregon Supreme Court took that view, 

or not. But if it did take that view, and, in this 

case, the Respondents say, "We no longer want to 

introduce any new evidence," then we would not have a 

case left, it seems to me. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is 

true, to some extent, Justice Souter, but I do think 

that -- at least with regard to the question of what 

factors are relevant to the ultimate determination,

that is governed by a quite different statutory 

provision. And the Oregon Supreme Court construed that 

provision to limit the mitigating factors that the jury 

can take into account to those that are mandated by the 

eighth amendment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that --

MR. SHANMUGAM: And I would further note --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on that substantive 

point, it does seem -- I assume a Governor could take 

this into account in clemency? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, certainly. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose the Governors 

can do more than juries can. But, still, it seems odd 

to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close 

case. It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of 

course. It goes at least to whether or not the 

defendant is obdurate in not accepting guilt. He says, 

"I didn't do it." 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, acceptance of 

responsibility may present different issues, but we 

would submit that the fundamental problem with the 

constitutional rule that the Oregon Supreme Court did 

expressly adopt is that it would effectively allow 

jurors, at their discretion, to apply what is a higher 

standard of proof at capital sentencing than the

reasonable-doubt standard, which, after all, is the 

standard that applies in all other criminal contexts. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, the evidence goes 

to explain why the defendant is taking the position 

that he does. He said, "I wasn't there." Now, it's 

true, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was -

-

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the jury did --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at least it explains his 

attitude, his demeanor, his refusal to accept 

responsibility. There's a reason for that. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the jury did determine, 

at the guilt phase, that the defendant was guilty 

beyond a reasonable doubt. And the fundamental point 

of the reasonable-doubt standard is that it is the 

highest standard of law -- of proof known to the law, 

short of absolute certainty. And I think, turning to 

this Court's case law in the mitigation area, this 

Court has, time and time again, limited mitigating 

evidence to evidence concerning the character or record 

of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense. 

And the reason for that, I think, is that the very 

concept of mitigating evidence really does presuppose 

that the defendant has committed the crime in the first 

place. To put it another way, mitigating evidence is

evidence that suggests that a defendant who has 

committed the crime is somehow less deserving of the 

death penalty. And going back to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would follow from 

that, that if a State wanted to exclude the defense 

evidence on alibi from a sentencing jury's 

consideration -- let's assume it's a new -- a new 

sentencing jury -- they could do that. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe that that 

would be permissible. And I think, going back to the 

joint opinion in Woodson versus North Carolina, which 

was really where this constitutional requirement of 

mitigation was first recognized, this Court did not 

suggest in any way that, to the extent that 

individualized consideration at sentencing is mandated, 

a jury is entitled to consider any and all factors that 

it might think is relevant. Instead, the Court really 

recognized a category of mitigating factors that is 

limited to factors that are traditionally taken into 

account at sentencing -- namely, the character or 

record of the defendant and the circumstances --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that's true --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- of the offense. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with respect to putting 

in new evidence. I understand your point. But there -

- as a realistic matter, do you think it's possible to 

prevent a juror from deciding, "I thought it was really 

a closer case than beyond a reasonable doubt; and so, 

I'm a little hesitant about the death penalty"? 

There's no way to prevent that --

MR. SHANMUGAM: I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- from happening. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- as a practical matter, it 

may be very difficult to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- prevent it. I'm not sure 

that it is necessarily desirable for jurors to do that. 

And there is some suggestion, in the empirical 

evidence, that what actually goes on in the jury room 

is that jurors with some level of doubt about a 

defendant's guilt will actually negotiate with other 

jurors to ensure that a defendant is convicted, but 

ends up not being sentenced to death. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's -- used on the 

other side and as a policy model, the model penal code, 

I think, says it's okay. It -- not really that it's 

okay. It should be considered. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, the model 

penal code does say that. It was adopted, I think, in 

1962. And I think that it is telling that, in the

years since 1962, since this Court recognized that the 

death penalty was constitutional again in the 1970s, no 

State has expressly adopted a statute that permits 

consideration of residual doubt in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are a number of 

States that do --

MR. SHANMUGAM: To be sure, there are courts 

in several States -- I think we identified seven in our 

brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- that have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- position is --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- recognized --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it's up to the 

States, I take it, but it's not compelled by the eighth 

amendment. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: That's exactly right, Justice 

Ginsburg, just as it would be up to the States, at 

their discretion, to decide to simply adopt a higher 

standard of proof across the board in capital cases. A 

State could certainly decide to adopt an absolute-

certainty standard. But I think my point is simply 

that no State has expressly permitted consideration of 

residual doubts. Courts have construed statutes in

some States to permit it, typically because those State 

statutes contain broad language either with regard to 

the definition of "mitigating factors" or with regard 

to the discretion the jury has in making the ultimate 

sentencing determination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you think -- you think 

the Oregon Supreme Court might well come out that way, 

if it wished, although not resting on the eighth 

amendment? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Might come out that way with 

regard to the right of a defendant to, say, argue 

residual doubt? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there's no indication 

of that on the face of the opinion. And I think that, 

in some sense, it would be quite difficult for the 

Oregon Supreme Court to do that, having construed the 

statute that governs the determination that the jury 

actually makes at sentencing, to limit the factors that 

the jury can consider to those that this Court has 

recognized are constitutionally mandated under the 

eighth amendment. So, as a practical matter, I think 

the Oregon Supreme Court's reasoning in this case 

really forecloses that interpretation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WOLF 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

MR. WOLF: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

Associate Justices, may it please the Court: 

Hopefully, I can simplify this matter for the 

Court. As is set forth in our brief, and in our motion 

that was recently filed, Mr. Guzek does disclaim any 

reliance on the eighth amendment of the United States 

Constitution as a basis for admitting, at his retrial -

-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

doesn't matter. I mean, the question is what the 

Oregon Supreme Court did, and it's quite clear that it 

based its decision on the eighth amendment, not these 

various provisions of Oregon evidence law. 

MR. WOLF: Well, with all due respect, Mr. 

Chief Justice, if Mr. Guzek does not intend to rely 

upon the eighth amendment, I think that this would moot 

the case and that the -- this Court could then vacate 

that portion of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion.

eighth amendment case in the Supreme Court, you win on 

the eighth amendment, then you leave the courthouse and 

say, "Well, I don't want it anymore," and you think 

that moots the case? 

MR. WOLF: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's still a 

decision, binding in this case, giving you the right to 

admit any evidence on residual doubt in the retrial. 

MR. WOLF: Well, I respectfully disagree. In 

-- because, in fact, we didn't really argue, in the 

Oregon Supreme Court, that we were entitled, 

necessarily, under the eighth amendment. Our argument 

was primarily under the statute, that this statute says 

any evidence which came in should be admitted in the 

retrial. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't 

question, or doubt, that the State Supreme Court 

decision was based on the eighth amendment. 

MR. WOLF: That's correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we vacate it and the 

case is remanded on that ground, I assume it's still 

open for you to point out to the Oregon Supreme Court 

that they were in error about the -- about the status 

of the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it

handle the matter, rather than your --

MR. WOLF: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as you express it, 

"mooting the case"? 

MR. WOLF: Well, that -- we believe that we 

are entitled to present it under State law, and we 

think that is the resolution. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that -- there 

would still remain -- whether you mooted the case, or 

whether we vacated and then it was left to the Oregon 

Supreme Court whether to let this evidence in -- there 

would still remain the question of what kind of an 

instruction the jury can be given regarding the 

consideration of this evidence for purposes not of 

determining whether a guilty person should not be given 

the death penalty, but, rather, for purpose of 

considering whether the guilt is clear enough. I mean, 

that's -- that issue would still remain, wouldn't it? 

MR. WOLF: Well, not necessarily. I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it? 

MR. WOLF: Well, I think, under Oregon law, 

we are entitled to put on -- well, first we have to 

distinguish between these unitary juries and these 

retrial juries, because, of course, the retrial jury

has not heard the evidence from the guilt/innocence 

phase, from the original trial. And in the event that 

a retrial jury is hearing -- they're hearing this 

evidence for the first time, and the State should not 

be permitted to just put on the evidence that they 

think helps aggravate the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand, but what 

are you -- what are you going to argue to that jury? 

Are you going to argue to that jury, you know, that, 

"Yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of 

his guilt was really not all that clear, and you should 

take that into" -- don't you want to make that argument? 

MR. WOLF: Well, that's a potential argument. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Oregon Supreme Court 

says you can make that argument, because the eighth 

amendment requires you to be able to make that 

argument.

 MR. WOLF: But we think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what the State says is, 

"No, the eighth amendment requires no such thing." So, 

the issue hasn't gone away. It's still here. It's 

here in this very case.

make it, under Oregon law, in a -- regardless of 

whether we're entitled to make it under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. You're entitled 

to get the evidence in, under Oregon law, but the 

question of how that evidence can properly be used by 

the jury has been decided by the Oregon Supreme Court 

only on the basis of the eighth amendment, not on the 

basis of any Oregon statute. 

MR. WOLF: I disagree, Justice Scalia, 

because the court has said that this evidence, 

regardless -- with respect to the grandfather --

regardless of its substance, is to be admitted. And if 

it's to be admitted, it is to be considered. The 

statute with --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But considered --

MR. WOLF: -- which Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- for what? That's the 

problem. I mean, here is someone who's been found 

guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 

MR. WOLF: Correct. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And I don't see how it's 

relevant to go in at sentencing and say, "Oh, but there 

are all these doubts." I mean, by finding "beyond a 

reasonable doubt," there isn't a reasonable doubt left.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You -- I don't see how 

that's open to argument. You can say, "Consider the 

evidence that shows he's a good person underneath it 

all," or, "There -- he has some moral values that ought 

to be respected," or something like that, or, "He's 

capable of doing good things." But I don't see how you 

can argue doubt. 

MR. WOLF: Well, first of all, we never did 

argue doubt. The words "residual doubt" never occurred 

in this -- in the trial court, they never appeared 

before the Oregon Supreme Court. Lingering residual 

doubt was never argued. But in the hypothetical case, 

the defendant is entitled, and the statute instructs 

the jury, to consider the evidence from both phases of 

the trial for all -- for the sentencing purposes. And 

the Oregon statute is sui generis in the sense that we 

have a statute that has four questions the jury must 

answer beyond a reasonable -- the first three must be 

answered beyond a reasonable doubt. And these are 

factual questions related to the crime. Did the 

defendant act deliberately? So, in essence, what we 

have is -- a case which is charged as an aggravated 

murder does not make the defendant death-eligible at 

that point. The defendant is not death-eligible until 

he is first convicted of aggravated murder beyond a

reasonable doubt, and then, in the penalty phase, he is 

found to have committed the act deliberately, he is 

found to have -- the victim should not have -- did not 

provoke him, and his response was unreasonable to that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: In the penalty phase. 


MR. WOLF: Correct. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: In the penalty phase? 


MR. WOLF: It has not --


JUSTICE SCALIA: Hasn't that already been found 


in the guilt phase? 

MR. WOLF: No. No, Your Honor. Those are 

penalty phase --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You --

MR. WOLF: -- questions. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can be found guilty of 

murder when you didn't intend to kill? 

MR. WOLF: No, you must be found guilty of 

intentional murder. But, in the penalty phase, the 

very first question in our statute, which appears in 

the appendix of the State's brief, is whether the 

conducts of the defendant that caused the death of the 

deceased was committed deliberately and with the 

reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased, 

or another, would result. So, it's additional mental 

state, a factual determination, that goes beyond

whether you intentionally caused death. That--

JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to be very strange, 

because I think our cases require -- require that for 

death eligibility, and --

MR. WOLF: Well, I don't disagree with you, 

Your Honor, and -- however, our petition in this matter 

was not granted. But the -- this -- that is the -- the 

point is that our statute is very unique. I don't know 

of any other --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I have two questions, if I 

may. One -- of course, that wouldn't -- the alibi 

evidence would already have been rejected, whether 

there was deliberateness or not, so that would not 

support putting in the alibi evidence. But the second 

question I have -- I wanted to be sure we're clear on -

- do you intend, on the future hearing, to introduce 

anything other than the transcript of the prior 

proceeding? Do you intend to introduce live witnesses 

under -- as you may, perhaps, be able to, under Oregon 

law? 

MR. WOLF: Well, first of all --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I got the 

impression, from your motion to dismiss the writ as 

improvidently granted, that you did not. But I don't 

see anything unequivocally establishing that in the

MR. WOLF: The statute --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, there definitely is a

MR. WOLF: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you intend to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then there was really no 

basis for your motion to dismiss the writ as 

improvidently granted, if that's true. 

MR. WOLF: Well, perhaps not as improvidently 

granted, but if there is -- if the evidence comes in, 

under Oregon law, and we are disavowing any reliance on 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: But under --

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- Oregon law, what is not 

clear is -- you want to put the mother on the stand. 

MR. WOLF: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, do you want to go into 

anything at all that wasn't raised at the trial? 

MR. WOLF: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that --

MR. WOLF: -- for us to go into anything that 

wasn't raised in the original trial, that would have to 

be otherwise relevant. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. So --

MR. WOLF: And so, for example, if --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that's why I want to know 

that. That's what's ambiguous. 

MR. WOLF: -- if mom --

JUSTICE BREYER: Look, you only get to go 

into something if it was not otherwise -- if it is 

otherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to. 

The reason they think it is relevant is because of a 

constitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court. 

So, if you want to go into something, we have to decide 

whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant. If you 

want to ask the same thing, that's just a question of 

whether you have to have a transcript or a live 

witness. And I don't know that that's a question that

depends on their constitutional holding. So, I want to 

know, Do you want to go into things that are not there 

in the original trial, yes or no? 

MR. WOLF: Well, no. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that 

answer, in light of the previous discussion about the 

deliberate -- deliberately. 

MR. WOLF: Well, the deliberateness, Your 

Honor -- to this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Oregon courts take 

the position that, in the sentencing phase, the 

"deliberately" requirement must be judged just by what 

was in -- introduced in the guilt phase? 

MR. WOLF: No, it -- it's -- additional 

evidence can be put on. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you told us additional 

evidence on deliberation can be put in the -- in the 

sentencing phase. But then you're saying that you're 

not going to do that. 

MR. WOLF: Well, I guess it depends on the 

nature of -- if it is to impeach the codefendant's 

testimony, if that's deemed to be additional --

you. 

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that doesn't mean you 

can't say yes or no. You can decide right now. So, 

decide. And I'm -- I will be bound by the answer, as I 

think we all are. And if your answer is, "Yes, I want 

to go into otherwise relevant things," I'd like to know 

that. And if the answer is no, I want to know that, 

too. 

MR. WOLF: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would pass, if I were you. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. WOLF: Well, I didn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, if you pass -- if you 

pass, I will think you do. And as long as you do, I 

think we have to decide whether it is, or is not, 

otherwise relevant. I'm being totally open and honest 

with you. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. WOLF: Well, as a matter of Oregon law, 

we think we can -- we could put mom on, she could 

testify verbatim from her original trial, and she could

be asked, or she could say, "And I love my son. Please 

don't kill him." 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm not being tricky 

about it. I want to know if we have to go to the words 

"otherwise relevant" in the Oregon statute --

"otherwise relevant," particularly in respect to this 

question of residual doubt. 

MR. WOLF: Well, the -- it -- I'd ask --

JUSTICE BREYER: I really would like an 

answer, if possible. 

MR. WOLF: Well, it -- the answer, Your 

Honor, is, I'd ask the Court to look to page 3 of our 

brief, where the statute is set forth, and look 

carefully at the way that statute is worded, which 

says, "Either party may recall any witness who 

testified at the prior trial or sentencing proceeding 

and may present additional relevant evidence." 

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. And they said that 

relevance is -- of residual doubt is relevant. And the 

reason that it's relevant is because the Constitution 

of the United States requires the jury to hear it. 

MR. WOLF: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: That is what I am focusing 

on, and I want to know if you want to go into 

"otherwise relevant," for that reason.

 MR. WOLF: Well, with all respect, the Oregon 

Supreme Court did not say residual doubt was 

admissible. And residual doubt was never argued to the 

trial court, to the Oregon Supreme Court; and, 

therefore, whether or not it can come in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It said that your 

alibi defense, that had been rejected by the prior 

jury, was relevant under the eighth amendment. 

MR. WOLF: It did say that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

MR. WOLF: But it's relevant to this idea of 

deliberation. For example, if the defendant -- the 

codefendants have testified that the -- Mr. Guzek is 

the mastermind of this, and that he helped plan this. 

If the alibi goes to whether or not he was present for 

all of those events that relate to this issue --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That --

MR. WOLF: -- of deliberation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that brings up a 

question I have. Particularly under the resentencing 

provision, it looks like the sentencing trial is going 

to be just a rerun of the guilt trial, because your 

main evidence that you want to put in is alibi 

evidence, "I didn't do it." So, you're going to say, 

"Here's" -- the mother is going to say, "I -- he was at

home." And then, presumably, the State gets to put on 

all of its witnesses, saying, "No, here are the people 

who saw him do it," and blah, blah, blah. And so, it's 

just the same trial all over again. 

MR. WOLF: It could be. But it could be a 

different trial, such as we would propose in this case 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They used to have --

MR. WOLF: -- in the sense that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- two trials. I mean, you 

know, that's the whole problem here. Your client has 

been tried as to whether he committed the offense, and 

found guilty, and now you --

MR. WOLF: Right. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: -- now you want to 


relitigate the same matter. I don't --

MR. WOLF: Not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --

MR. WOLF: -- not that the same matter. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And on the basis that the 

Constitution requires you to be able to relitigate the 

same matter two times in the same criminal proceeding, 

that doesn't seem, to me, right. 

MR. WOLF: Well, but the -- but the factual -

- there are factual determinations to be made in the

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, let's go to the 

constitutional --

MR. WOLF: Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- issue. Now, let's 

imagine we have a trial. And at the trial, we have a 

lot of evidence about the alibi. 

MR. WOLF: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And what the State Court 

says, "This is our law. When a person is" -- now go to 

the sentencing phase, the jury has heard it --

MR. WOLF: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? So, they take it into 

account. And, moreover, we tell them they have to 

consider it. 

MR. WOLF: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? That's a State law. 

Now, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle, 

and now we go back just to the sentencing? Here's what 

we do. We introduce the transcript. And, moreover, we 

introduce some live witnesses to say what they said 

before, but nothing else. 

Now, you're saying there is a constitutional 

right to present an additional witness on the matter

that has already been litigated to go into things that 

were not there in the trial before. 

MR. WOLF: Well, if --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, my goodness, if you had 

real evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the 

first time? And if, in fact, you -- it's not such good 

evidence, and so forth, why does the State have to 

waste its time to hear some more about the alibi that 

you didn't put in the first time? I mean, you know, 

that's what you're saying the Constitution protects. 

I'm being a little skeptical. I want to know what your 

answer is. 

MR. WOLF: Well, we did put it in the first 

time in this case, and we don't necessarily need to 

rely on the eighth amendment, we believe, to put it in, 

if --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm agreeing with you --

MR. WOLF: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- insofar as you have a 

right to put in what you've put in the first time. 

MR. WOLF: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you on that 

one. But you said you wanted to do something else. 

You wouldn't say, "We don't want to do something else."

MR. WOLF: If --

JUSTICE BREYER: And, in the "more" part, 

where does the Constitution protect you? I'm willing 

to, at least hypothetically, go with you on the 

protection for what they already heard. 

MR. WOLF: The Constitution protects us in 

the sense that it allows us to rebut and respond and 

reply to evidence offered by the State in aggravation 

of a sentence of death. And if they're offering 

evidence that he is -- he acted deliberately, we have a 

right to respond to that. We don't have to sit there 

with our hands tied behind our back. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And your --

MR. WOLF: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- response is that he 

wasn't there. It's one thing to say, "It was 

intentional, but you didn't prove deliberate." The 

other thing is to say, "He wasn't there. He didn't 

commit the crime in the first place." Those are two 

quite different things. 

MR. WOLF: Well, but it's also a question of, 

"How much of it was he there for?" -- as in Green. Was 

he there when he -- was he there for the planning

stage? Because the jury is to consider all of the 

evidence. So, if he --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- well, I guess 

it -- I guess it depends on what you mean by an 

"alibi." If all you mean by an "alibi" is that, for 

part of the offense, he was somewhere -- I thought an 

alibi meant, "I am not guilty, because I was not 

there." That's what I thought an alibi was --

MR. WOLF: I think "alibi" means, "I was 

somewhere else at the time of the offense." But if 

what the jury --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it sounds --

MR. WOLF: -- has considered --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- like you're trying to 

relitigate that question at the sentencing hearing. 

And, certainly, the eighth amendment does not require 

that. 

MR. WOLF: No. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, to the extent the 

Oregon Supreme Court thought that, and rested its 

holding on that, we ought to reject it out of hand. 

MR. WOLF: Well, but our statute requires the 

jury, in the sentencing phase, to make these additional 

factual determinations about the offense.

court, on remand, but it ought to be straightened out 

that the eighth amendment does not require relitigation 

of where the defendant was at the time of the murder. 

That was the basis for the "beyond a reasonable doubt" 

finding of guilt. 

MR. WOLF: Of guilt, but not necessarily of 

the -- but if the evidence of deliberation occurred at 

other events in the chain of events, than the alibi is 

relevant to the sentencing question the jury must 

decide. It's also relevant to -- perhaps, to 

provocation. So, there are factual determinations that 

the sentencing jury has to make. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you put it -- make it 

concrete for this case? Because I don't see that there 

would be -- I mean, if the action is intentional, and 

the question was whether it was deliberate, what 

planning here would have gone on in some different 

timeframe? 

MR. WOLF: Well, there was -- there was a 

timeframe of -- there was evidence that they -- the 

codefendants testified that the -- the three of them 

planned to do another burglary of a different house, 

and then -- the codefendants' timeframes are rather 

fuzzy, but then they went back, at some point, to the 

defendant's father -- house to obtain weapons, and then

went on to the ultimate victim's house. So, to the 

extent that this deliberation includes events that 

occurred before the actual homicide, it's relevant to 

this deliberation question. 

And, additionally, the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't -- I still 

don't understand. You say that there was -- there had 

to be proof for conviction and guilt -- of guilt of 

intentional conduct. And this is a simple story that's 

told: they wanted to go to one house, too many lights 

on in that house; they were frustrated, they wanted to 

go someplace else, so they came upon the aunt and uncle 

of the defendant's former girlfriend. 

MR. WOLF: Well, it was a much longer 

timeframe than that. There was testimony that they 

went back to town, and went to the father's house and 

obtained weapons before they went to the house where 

the homicides occurred. 

The other issue is that there has been 

subsequent evidence, since the first trial. These 

codefendants have recanted certain statements. They 

have recanted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to put that 

in? 

MR. WOLF: Yes. We believe that that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then what was 

all the discussion about the mother's having -- then, 

when you go back, you can put on anything, whether it 

was presented before, or not, right? Because the 

eighth amendment requires that, according to the Oregon 

Supreme Court. 

MR. WOLF: Well, whether it's required under 

the eighth amendment, or not, is for you to decide, 

obviously, but we think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

MR. WOLF: -- that it's whether or not Oregon 

law also requires it. And we believe, under Oregon 

law, we're entitled to put this on, we're entitled to 

rebut this. For example, Justice Kennedy was talking

about a scenario -- and, in this very case, the joint 

appendix, at page 92, the prosecutor in this case --

this is an excerpt from the trial -- was trying to get 

in evidence that the defendant was being manipulative. 

And, at this point, the alibi evidence had been 

excluded. And so, the fact that the defendant was not 

taking responsibility, perhaps was being deemed as 

manipulating people by trying to get them to come 

forward to say, "I wasn't there," then alibi is 

relevant to respond -- to rebut and respond to that 

kind of an argument. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whatever Oregon law might 

say, or not say, it appears that this Supreme -- Oregon 

Supreme Court was acting under what it thought was the 

compulsion of the eighth amendment. If it's wrong 

about that, you can make your argument about what 

Oregon law should be, without any eighth amendment 

constraint. 

MR. WOLF: Correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does seem that this 

court was operating on the assumption that the eighth 

amendment required it to let in this alibi and other 

evidence. 

MR. WOLF: And we think -- we agree that the 

Oregon Supreme Court went farther than it needed to in

this case in order to decide the issue, because, under 

Oregon law, mom testified --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, you know, we're being 

asked to decide whether Oregon Supreme Court correctly 

interpreted the Federal Constitution. And you seem to 

be making most of your argument to the effect, "Well, 

we don't really need that holding. We can prevail on 

Oregon law." 

MR. WOLF: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But are you going to make 

any argument in support of the decision made by the 

Oregon Supreme Court? 

MR. WOLF: No, not as long as the State of 

Oregon agrees that this statute operates in an 

evenhanded fashion. In other words, if they get to 

recall witnesses who originally testified, or present 

transcript testimony, then we should have the same 

right. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- so odd. It -- almost 

as though we should appoint some amicus here, Counsel, 

to argue in support of the merits. 

MR. WOLF: Well --

be doing that. 

MR. WOLF: Well, Your Honor, on the merits, 

we --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's very strange. 

MR. WOLF: Well, we think that the -- that 

the Oregon Supreme Court decision was correct in -- on 

the -- on the eighth amendment. And we think it's --

but it's -- not necessarily for the reasons stated by 

the Oregon Supreme Court. And the fact is that if the 

Oregon Supreme Court held that we have a right to -- we 

believe that we have a right to respond to any evidence 

they offer on aggravation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about --

for example, the single most important feature leading 

juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the 

studies, is their residual doubt. Every juror who 

hears sentencing matters directly after a trial 

automatically takes that into account. Therefore, 

those who are resentenced and have a new jury should 

have the same kind of right. Otherwise, it's cruel and 

unusual. 

Now, I made that argument. You didn't 

make it. But it seems to me that there are several 

arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon 

Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that

it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary 

rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes 

in, et cetera. 

MR. WOLF: Well, we think that if -- by 

directing that the jury consider all evidence in both 

phases of the trial, it must be relevant. Why else 

would they instruct the jury to consider such evidence, 

unless it was relevant to the sentencing questions 

the jury must answer? And obviously I agree with you, 

Justice Breyer, that if the -- if a defendant must run 

the gamut of having -- we have to remember that the 

first trial was set aside because it was defective in 

some way. And it would be an anomalous result for the 

resentencing jury to not be entitled to hear what the 

first jury heard when the defendant had an 

unconstitutional, or a defective, trial. So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Wolf, in view of the 

direction this discussion is going in, I want to go 

back to something that I really think we all thought we 

had passed but I would like to go back and get clear 

on. My recollection is that you stated, in your answer 

to Justice Stevens, that you currently maintain that 

you have a right to recall the mother to the stand at 

the -- at the sentencing proceeding.

-- my question is, Is it your present intention to call 

the mother to the stand, or is it your present 

intention to use the mother's testimony, which we all -

- I understand to be admissible? Are you going to call 

her, or not? 

MR. WOLF: Well, we would intend to call her. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You do intend to call her. 

MR. WOLF: Because we think it's important --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm not asking why. I 

just want to know whether you are. And your 

representation to me is that you do intend to call her 

as a live witness as the -- at the resentencing. 

MR. WOLF: Yes. 


JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 


MR. WOLF: And I'd like to answer the reason 


for that, because we think the jury is entitled to see 

her demeanor and gauge, based on how she testifies, how 

believable she is. We think it's much -- we think it's 

better for a jury to be able to see a live witness than 

hear a cold transcript being read by surrogates. 

And so, of course, in -- as we know, in -- if 

she were to stray from what she testified at the 

original trial, of course she would be impeached with, 

"Well, you didn't testify about that the first time." 

But the jury, we think, as the statute clearly

indicates, should allow witnesses who testified 

originally to be recalled, unless, for some reason, 

they're unavailable --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Wolf, I --

MR. WOLF: -- in which case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I had misunderstood 

something. There's going to be a new sentencing, but 

there also is going to be a new trial, is there, on 

the merits?

 MR. WOLF: No. There --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why -- because you 

mentioned, earlier, about the defect in the trial. 

MR. WOLF: The convictions -- well, the 

defect was in the penalty phase. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay. 

MR. WOLF: And so, the convictions are 

affirmed. The jury is going to be instructed, "The 

defendant stands convicted, has been found convicted 

beyond a reasonable doubt." It is to decide these four 

questions: Did he act deliberately? Does he 

constitute a future danger? And, to the extent the 

Government puts on evidence that addresses those 

concerns, we believe we have the right to respond to 

that. 

And also -- we also have to remember that the

-- that the alibi in this case was -- really was 

offered as impeachment of the codefendants. The 

codefendants are really the only evidence that links 

the defendant to these crimes. And so, to the extent 

that -- it's impeachment by contradiction. So, while 

they may find that if the codefendants say, "He did A, 

B, and C," and mom says, "No, he was with me," it 

doesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only 

that they should disbelieve the codefendants. And that 

is a -- although it seems incongruous, that's standard 

impeachment by contradiction. The jury is given an 

instruction that they're to consider it for the limited 

purpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants, 

but not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi. 

And that happens in trials every day. So, we don't 

think it's that unusual for the -- if the evidence 

relates to the sentencing questions the jury must 

consider, then it should come in. 

So, the other point that I think is important 

in this case is that the -- you know, the -- it's 

really not unlike this -- cases that this Court has 

held, Sumner versus Shuman, and Skipper. If the 

Government puts on evidence --

I see my time is up.

 Ms. Williams, you have 2 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

JUSTICE SCALIA: General Williams, I have one 

question. I'm not sure it goes to our eighth amendment 

question before us, but I honestly don't understand 

what your statute is all about. It says that after 

having been convicted of aggravated murder --

aggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall be 

presented with the following questions. Number one, 

whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the 

death of the deceased was committed deliberately and 

with the reasonable expectation that death of the 

deceased, or another, would result. Don't you have to 

find that in order to convict of aggravated murder? 

MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, we copied from 

Texas on those special issues. And so, in the 

guilt phase, what you have to establish is the 

defendant acted intentionally. And that's what's 

required as far as a constitutional state of mind. 

And the deliberateness question is sort of an 

intentional-plus. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus, okay. 

MS. WILLIAMS: It's from an additional --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I gotcha.

 MS. WILLIAMS: -- finding, beyond 

intentional, that the State has to then establish in 

the penalty phase. 

Two quick points. First, on how this 

evidence was offered. It was not offered as 

impeachment evidence. It was not offered under any 

State statute. If you look in the joint appendix, the 

second volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to 

rely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence. And 

then there's an accompanying memo that follows. And, 

also, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a 

colloquy between defense counsel and the trial court, 

where defense counsel says, "Your Honor, I made it 

very clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation. 

It goes to the circumstances of the crime. It's 

mitigating evidence that someone is not there." And, 

later, circumstances of the offense is part of the 

fourth question, which, in Oregon, is the mitigation 

question. If the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is the 2:16 a.m. alarm clock 

in the original trial, or not? 

MS. WILLIAMS: The mother's testimony about 

the time from --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. WILLIAMS: -- 2:10 a.m. to 4:20 is in the

guilt phase of the trial. 

And again from the colloquy, "If you're not 

there, that is certainly mitigating." 

And let me just mention, in terms of the 

timing of the alibi evidence, the grandfather's alibi 

covered from 9 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in the 

morning; the mother's, from 2:10 in the morning til 

4:20. The crimes occurred in the early morning hours. 

And so, there isn't any way to parse this out and say 

that the alibi testimony might have been relevant, in 

some small piece, on deliberateness. 

To the extent that the State puts on 

additional evidence to establish deliberateness, of 

course defendant can respond to that additional 

evidence, but the State doesn't make the question of 

whether the defendant was there wide open again in the 

penalty phase. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 

Williams. 

The case is submitted. 

[Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
