2  (10:02 a.m.) 

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in 

4  Florida against Nixon. 

5  Mr. Lemieux. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. LEMIEUX 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. LEMIEUX: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

9  the Court: 

10  When experienced counsel thoroughly 

11  investigates, prepares for trial, and discusses his trial 

12  strategy with his client, a challenge for effectiveness 

13  may not presume prejudice. Rather, this Court's two-part 
14  inquiry, articulated in Strickland v. Washington, is the 

15  proper measure. 

16  The Florida Supreme Court erred in its decision 

17  below for three main reasons. 

18  First, they failed to apply Strickland's two­

19  part circumstance-specific, performance prejudice inquiry 
20  to a question of trial strategy. 

21  Second, it improperly presumed prejudice under 
22  this Court's decision in United States v. Cronic where 

23  there was neither a complete denial of counsel, nor did 

24  counsel entirely fail to subject the State's case to 
25  meaningful adversarial testing. 

3

--  

1  Third, the Florida Supreme Court improperly 

2  expanded this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama from 

3  governing pleas of guilt to governing tactical decisions 

4  made during full-fledged trials. 

5  For these three reasons and because the Florida 

6  court's decision conflicts with Strickland and its progeny 

7  and will disrupt the effective administration of justice, 
8  we request reversal. 

9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, was was the 

10  attorney's essential concession of guilt sort of the 

11  functional equivalent of a guilty plea, do you think? 

12  MR. LEMIEUX: No, Justice O'Connor, it was not. 

13  Mr. Corin, after speaking to his client on three occasions 

14  about this trial strategy, sought to concede the 

15  underlying -- the underlying crimes but to argue what was 

16  the most essential part of this case, and that was whether 

17  or not death should be the outcome of the jury. 
18  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, yes, he clearly tried 

19  to preserve a role in the sentencing, but we often have 

20  guilty pleas and then leave the sentencing to be 

21  determined. Was was what he did concerning the 

22  guilt/innocence phase the equivalent of a guilty plea, do 

23  you think? 

24  MR. LEMIEUX: It was not, Your Honor, because a 

25  guilty plea, as this Court talked about in Boykin v. 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

1  Alabama, gives up rights of the defendant. The lawyer and 

2  the defendant waive rights. They waive the right to 

3  trial. They waive the right to have the State prove their 

4  case beyond a reasonable doubt. They waive the right to 

5  have a jury, to confront witnesses, to cross examine, all 
6  of the attendant trial rights. Mr. Nixon -­

7  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there any cross 

8  examination of witnesses conducted? 

9  MR. LEMIEUX: There was some cross examination, 

10  not a lot. There was cross examination of one of Mr. 

11  Nixon's uncles, who was one of the seven confessions in 

12  this case, and we don't know specifically why Mr. Corin 

13  engaged in that cross examination. It could be because 

14  that was probably the weakest of the seven confessions and 

15  perhaps he wanted the jury to hear that that confession 
16  was weak. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: There was also an objection to 
18  introduction of of photographs that -- that were 

19  inflammatory, wasn't there? 

20  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, there was, Justice Scalia. 

21  In fact, you know, Mr. Nixon was -- was very much engaged 

22  in the guilt phase of this trial. He objected to the 
23  introduction of evidence. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Those photographs would have 

25  infected the -- the penalty phase, as well as the guilt 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  --  

1  phase. So it was important for him to object to them. 
2  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: In the guilt phase. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said Mr. Nixon was -- was 

5  the client. Was he in the courtroom? 

6  MR. LEMIEUX: Mr. Nixon was in the courtroom for 

7  portions of the trial. He was in -­

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was -- was he there -- and 

9  I'll check the record -- when the attorney told the jury 
10  that that his client was was guilty, that he 

11  basically was conceding guilt? 

12  MR. LEMIEUX: Mr. Nixon was not in the courtroom 

13  for the opening statement or the closing statement. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But not for the opening 

15  statement. 

16  MR. LEMIEUX: He was there during some of voir 

17  dire. He was there after the opening statement when two 

18  witnesses testified, one who testified that he was the 

19  person who tried to sell the victim's car and positively 

20  identified him in the courtroom, and another when the 

21  sheriff's deputy positively identified him as the person 

22  who confessed and gave the 45-minute confession and the 

23  person he arrested. After those two witnesses testified, 

24  Mr. Nixon then decided to leave the courtroom on that 

25  occasion. 

6

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that guilt 

2  is not as -- not as clear as you -- as you make it out. 

3  Is -- is that -- is that issue even before us here? 

4  MR. LEMIEUX: Your -- Your Honor, none of that 

5  evidence has been presented in any of the post-conviction 

6  proceedings, and while it's creative, I think it's not 

7  before this Court because it's never been entered into 

8  evidence. It's just speculation. 
9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't a matter of 

10  whether it's before it. I -- I just wonder whether it 
11  goes to -- to the issue here, whether you needed to get 

12  his assent or not. It -- it probably goes to the quite 

13  separate question of whether there was inadequate 

14  performance by counsel. No? Is that question before us 

15  also? 

16  MR. LEMIEUX: It is, Your Honor. Both questions 

17  are before you. I -- I believe that -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was the latter question 

19  ruled upon below? 

20  MR. LEMIEUX: What the Florida Supreme Court did 

21  is they found that since this was the functional 

22  equivalent of a guilty plea, if there was not explicit and 

23  affirmative consent, that Cronic would apply and a 

24  presumption of prejudice would follow. 
25  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but -- no. I'm sorry. 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

--

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: And never -- and never reached 

2  the -- the inadequate performance of counsel question. 

3  MR. LEMIEUX: The -- the only thing that they do 

4  say, Your Honor, is that they say that the strategy 

5  employed by Mr. Corin may well have been in Mr. Nixon's 

6  best interests. 

7  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but they didn't -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They may, but that wasn't a 

9  definitive ruling. So do you agree that if we accept the 

10  position that you are taking, a remand would require for 

11  that for that evidence to be considered on the 

12  straightforward question did counsel perform adequately? 

13  MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, there were three 

14  hearings in the post-conviction proceedings, and the 

15  the defense, who had the burden in those cases to prove 

16  ineffective assistance of counsel only put on Mr. Corin 

17  and the State cross examined Mr. Corin and called some 

18  other witnesses. I don't know what further evidence could 

19  be adduced that would go to a separate claim. 

20  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it might be that 

21  there would be no justification for further evidence, but 
22  there would have to be a Strickland ruling on the merits 

23  of the Strickland issue, wouldn't there be? 

24  MR. LEMIEUX: I think that this Court could 

25  engage in that. I think you could remand and have the 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  Florida Supreme Court engage in that. 

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: But nobody has explicitly done 

3  that yet. Is that correct? 

4  MR. LEMIEUX: They have not because the Florida 

5  Supreme Court ruled under Cronic. 

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Because of the Cronic point. 

7  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about the courts 

9  below the Florida Supreme Court? Didn't they rule on it? 

10  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor. Three trial 

11  court judges all found that there was effective assistance 
12  of counsel. 

13  Judge Hall, who presided over the trial, in 

14  fact, described Mr. Corin's advocacy as being right on the 

15  mark. He found in his approach an excellent analysis of 

16  the realities of the case and the preservation of 

17  credibility and the credibility of any mitigating 

18  circumstances. He also found that it was perhaps the only 

19  steps that could have been taken to afford his client some 

20  relief. 

21  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Getting back to the practical 

23  equivalent of a guilty plea, Brookhart v. Janis do you 

24  think goes to the outer margin of what the functional 

25  equivalent is? Are there other examples of what a 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  functional equivalent would be that would fall under both 

2  Cronic and Brookhart? We have a line-drawing problem -­

3  MR. LEMIEUX: Sure, sure. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as -- as to whether or not 

5  this is the functional equivalent. 

6  MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, I think that Brookhart 

7  in fact probably supports our position because in 

8  Brookhart the situation was factually different. It was 

9  more of a -- a guilty plea situation where there was going 

10  to be this prima facie trial, which was, in essence, a 

11  guilty plea with a profferer through one witness. And in 

12  that case, the defendant stood up and said, I want a 

13  trial, I want everyone to understand I'm not pleading 

14  guilty. And this Court said that counsel can't waive 

15  those rights to a full trial when the defendant is 

16  objecting to it, but if the defendant consents or 
17  acquiesces, this Court said the ruling would be different. 

18  Well, certainly Mr. Nixon at least acquiesced. 

19  Mr. Corin spoke to him on three occasions -- and that can 

20  be found at 255 of the joint appendix -- and talked to him 
21  about this strategy. Mr. Nixon never responded either way 

22  as to his assent or what he wanted to be done. 

23  Now, Judge Ferris, who was the third trial court 

24  judge who heard this matter, said that because of the 
25  longstanding relationship between this defendant and this 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

1  lawyer, because he had represented him three times before 

2  over a 2-year period, that there was a level of 

3  relationship, they were both veterans of the criminal 

4  justice system, they had a rapport with each other. And 
5  she was able to determine that there was consent to the 

6  trial strategy in the fact that Mr. Nixon did not object 
7  to it. 

8  The Florida Supreme Court wants explicit and 

9  affirmative consent, and they want a colloquy on the 

10  record. And we think that this will be very problematic, 

11  and we're already seeing these problems in Florida. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any cases involving 

13  what -- what you describe as tacit consent? 

14  MR. LEMIEUX: In terms of a trial strategy, Your 

15  Honor? 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in terms of of 

17  pleading guilty. Do we have any cases in which a similar 

18  thing happened, that the counsel said I'm going to plead 

19  you guilty and the -- the defendant doesn't say anything, 

20  just passively sits there as though, you know? 
21  MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, I think you do and I 

22  think that Boykin addresses that there has to be a 

23  colloquy with a plea of guilty, and that the -- the 

24  defendant can't tacitly consent to a plea of guilty. 

25  But our position is that this is not a plea of 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  guilty. This is not a complete surrender. This is a 

2  tactical retreat made for reasons of trying to contest the 

3  one issue in this case that could be contested, and that 

4  was trying to save this defendant's life. This lawyer 

5  took 52 depositions. He hired medical professionals. He 

6  investigated Mr. Nixon's background, going back to the age 

7  of 10. He did everything -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to the 

9  photographs? I wasn't clear from the submissions. There 

10  were inflammatory photographs. Were they in fact 

11  admitted? 

12  MR. LEMIEUX: They were admitted over his 

13  objection, and that was taken up on direct appeal to the 
14  Florida Supreme Court, and the Florida Supreme Court, in 

15  Nixon I, did not find that they were inflammatory and 

16  found that their introduction was proper. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were not 

18  reintroduced at the sentencing phase. 

19  MR. LEMIEUX: They were already in evidence and 

20  the State incorporated its evidence from the guilt phase 

21  into the sentencing phase. It's just a procedure. The 
22  only evidence that the State put on in the guilt phase 

23  were his prior two convictions and evidence that Mr. Nixon 

24  tortured the defendant by removing her underwear before he 

25  burned her alive. Besides that, the rest of the evidence 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

1  was incorporated from the guilt phase. 

2  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if -- do you think 

3  his representation would have been inadequate if he had 

4  not discussed the strategy with the client but everything 

5  else was exactly the same? 

6  MR. LEMIEUX: It may -- it may have been but it 

7  would be something that would be evaluated under 

8  Strickland, Justice Stevens. 

9  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why would it be -- why 

10  would it make any difference under Strickland whether he 

11  talked to the client or not if the same -- if the same 

12  considerations are in play? In other words, he just knew 
13  it was the -- the wiser strategy to try and save him from 

14  the death penalty? 

15  MR. LEMIEUX: I think the only point I would 

16  make there is this Court said in Strickland that counsel 

17  should consult with their -- with their client, with the 

18  accused, and that that's an obligation on counsel. If 

19  there was a failure to consult, perhaps that would be 

20  argued that that failure to consult was deficient 

21  performance. 

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that isn't that 

23  because we -- we take the consultation at -- at least as 

24  an indication that the lawyer was -- was adequate in 

25  communicating back and forth with the client so that the 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

1  client could tell him what the lawyer needed to know to 

2  defend him? 

3  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Justice Souter, I think 

4  that's correct. I think that there could be meaningful 

5  discussions between the defendant and the accused that can 

6  help the lawyer represent the defendant at trial. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: But even apart from the 

8  competence of the lawyer, whether it shows adequate 

9  performance by the lawyer, can't you -- can't you divide 

10  the Boykin rule, which doesn't relate to the lawyer's 

11  competence at all, into three different categories: 

12  number one, where there is express consent which is 

13  makes it okay; number two, when there's no consent at all, 

14  which is bad; and number three, where there is what -­

15  what you call here implicit consent? Aren't there really 

16  three different situations? 

17  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. 

18  That's what the Court speaks about in Brookhart, and 

19  although we think that that's more of a guilty plea case 

20  than a trial strategy case, if this Court were to go in 

21  that direction, that standard certainly could apply. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -­

23  JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me rather 

24  difficult to -- to draw that line. If -- if consent is 

25  necessary, why shouldn't it be express? I'm not saying 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  consent is necessary, but normally if you're going to have 

2  something this important and consent is necessary, it 

3  seems to me it ought to be clear on the record. You 

4  certainly wouldn't accept this for a guilty plea, what you 

5  have here. 

6  MR. LEMIEUX: That's correct, Your Honor, but in 

7  -- I think this Court has held in cases like Jones v. 

8  Barnes and Taylor v. Illinois, that questions of strategy 

9  are questions that are reserved to the lawyer, and that 

10  all -­

11  JUSTICE STEVENS: That's right, and that's why 

12  I'm suggesting if it really is a question of strategy, you 

13  don't even need implicit consent. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

15  JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm not sure there's a -­

16  MR. LEMIEUX: We -­

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: -- three-part rule, as Justice 

18  Scalia says. There's just a two-part rule. 
19  MR. LEMIEUX: We -- we agree with that position, 

20  Justice Stevens. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I assume -- I assume 

22  your response is that if you eliminate from the Boykin 

23  rule the possibility of implicit consent, you are forcing 

24  the lawyer who believes he has the consent of -- of a -­

25  an intractable client such as this fellow who -- who 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  didn't go into the courtroom, took all his clothes off so 

2  they couldn't take him into the courtroom. He was 

3  obviously not -- didn't want to be responsive. Your -­

4  you would have forced this lawyer to adopt a strategy 

5  which the lower court found would have been damaging to 

6  this defendant, even though the lawyer believes that the 

7  defendant really approved of the strategy that the lawyer 

8  was undertaking. Why would we want to adopt a rule like 

9  that? 

10  MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, it's not our position 

11  that you should a rule of consent. I was saying if this 

12  Court were going in that direction, that the acquiescence 

13  level would be what we would suggest. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what about a -­

15  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there were a plea -- if it 

16  were a plea of guilt, wouldn't this be an academic 

17  question because I assume Florida has some counterpart to 

18  the rule 11 colloquy where the judge must confront the 
19  defendant and ask him a series of questions to elicit his 

20  consent? So this issue can come up, if you have a 

21  counterpart to rule 11, only in the concession of guilt by 

22  the attorney but with a trial. 

23  MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, Florida does have a 

24  rule for a guilty plea, but -- and now the Florida Supreme 

25  Court says there has to be a colloquy for a strategy 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  1  decision that where there's a concession, but we 

2  disagree with that. We don't think that there should be a 

3  colloquy. We don't think that that -- that should be 

4  required. And we think that that's problematic and we're 

5  already seeing in Florida that -- that judges, laboring 
6  under the Nixon decision, are asking questions to 

7  defendants as to whether or not all sorts of strategy 

8  decisions are decisions they agreed to. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If Florida wanted to adopt 

10  that procedure on its own, that wouldn't present a Federal 

11  question. I mean, the prosecutor would have no -- the 

12  prosecutor would have no right to stop it if the -- if 

13  Florida said, well, we want that same colloquy to go on 

14  whether it's a guilty plea or whether it's a concession of 

15  guilt. 

16  MR. LEMIEUX: Well -- well, Justice Ginsburg, 

17  they're doing it under these decisions of this Court is 

18  the reason why that they've articulated that this has to 

19  be done. They're saying it's a functional equivalent of a 

20  guilty plea. Therefore, Boykin is required and therefore 

21  there has to be a colloquy. And we think that those 

22  colloquies are tremendously problematic, that they invade 

23  the attorney-client privilege. They may affect an 

24  accused's right to -- you know, not to self-incriminate 

25  himself. There may violate the relationship between the 

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  lawyer and his client. 

2  JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but these -- let me just 
3  understand. These colloquies are not, in your view, 

4  commanded by the Florida Supreme Court's holding. 

5  MR. LEMIEUX: They are. The Florida Supreme 

6  Court specifically says you must have these colloquies to 

7  determine consent. 

8  JUSTICE STEVENS: But only -- is it -- it's not 

9  just when there's the equivalent of the guilty plea, but 
10  any major trial strategy -­
11  MR. LEMIEUX: The lower -- Justice, I'm sorry. 

12  JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this -- I want to know if 

13  the Florida Supreme Court's holding is limited to cases 

14  that are the functional equivalent of -- of a guilty plea, 

15  and -- and it's only there that they're requiring the 

16  colloquy. 

17  MR. LEMIEUX: It's only there that they've 

18  required it, but lower courts now defense counsel are 

19  making these arguments that, boy, you know, and the judge 
20  is concerned this is a strategy decision. 

21  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but of course what the 

22  lower courts are doing may or may not be right as a matter 

23  of Florida law, but that's not before us really. 

24  MR. LEMIEUX: It's not before Your Honor. 

25  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if it were a matter 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  of Florida law, the Florida legislature could change it. 

2  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's a matter of Federal 

4  law, it can't. 

5  MR. LEMIEUX: That's correct. 

6  If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my 

7  time. 

8  JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein. 

9  ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN 

10  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

11  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

12  MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Stevens, and may it 

13  please the Court: 

14  The most serious problem with the Florida 

15  Supreme Court's explicit consent requirement is that it 

16  prevents counsel from pursuing what may be the most 

17  effective strategy for saving a defendant's life, even 

18  when counsel consults with the defendant on that strategy 

19  and the defendant does not object. In that situation, the 
20  Florida Supreme Court would require counsel to pursue an 

21  alternative reasonable doubt strategy even though that 

22  might undermine the case for sparing the defendant's life 

23  and even though the defendant has not consented to that 

24  strategy either. 

25  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take it as a given that 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  if he does not consent, in fact, directs his lawyer not to 

2  make this concession, that the lawyer is bound to follow? 

3  MR. GORNSTEIN: No, Justice Kennedy. You would 

4  still look at that question through the prism of 

5  Strickland's reasonableness inquiry. It would raise 

6  distinct concerns. A reasonable counsel would make a 

7  reasonable effort to iron out differences. Reasonable 

8  counsel takes into account the considered views of his 

9  client. But if, at the end of that process, counsel 

10  reasonably concludes that this is the only effective 

11  strategy for saving the defendant's life, then the pursuit 

12  of that strategy is not per se ineffective. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does -- does that up the ante 

14  and the defendant now is in the position to terminate the 

15  lawyer, or will the judge say it's -- it's too late, I'm 
16  not going to grant that motion? 

17  MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, the -­

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: As -- as a matter of Federal 

19  law. 

20  MR. GORNSTEIN: As -- the defendant could go to 

21  the -- to the judge and his counsel could go to the judge 
22  and say, we have had such a breakdown between us on what 

23  should be done here, we think alternative counsel should 

24  be appointed. But that would be a discretionary call for 

25  the district court. So too, the defendant could say, I 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  want to exercise my right to self-representation, which he 

2  has a right to do. So those are the two checks on that. 

3  JUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- what if there's a 

4  third possibility and -- and the lawyer makes remarks in 

5  front of the jury, as -- as this lawyer did, in effect, 
6  concession kind of remarks, and the defendant stands up 

7  and says, hey, I'm not making those concessions? I am not 

8  guilty. I'm not conceding a darned thing. Does the 

9  lawyer at that point at least have a -- an option to 

10  proceed on the concession theory, leaving it to judge his 
11  performance under Strickland afterwards? 

12  MR. GORNSTEIN: If I understand your question, 

13  Justice Souter, this is a situation where there was no 

14  objection initially, the lawyer proceeded to adopt a 
15  strategy, and then there was a -­

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- actually I -- I 

17  didn't get into that one way or the other. Let's assume 

18  we've got a case in which the client says, no, I -- I 

19  don't agree to these concessions. I'm not guilty and I 

20  want a defense. As I understood your -- your earlier 

21  answer, you said if -- you know, if it is the lawyer's 

22  considered judgment that this is the only way to save his 
23  life -- he's talked with him, et cetera -- he -- he still 

24  may have that option to concede. And I'm taking the -­

25  the facts one step further and saying let's assume the -­

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

1  the client goes whole-hog in his objection. And he stands 
2  up or -- or says in front of the judge and the jury, I 
3  I'm not conceding any of this. 

4  MR. GORNSTEIN: That -- that sounds to me like a 

5  case where there ought to be alternative counsel appointed 

6  if there has been such a --

7  JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I would certainly agree if 

8  we get to that point. But let's the lawyer does, as you 

9  at least left the door open for him to do, and -- and he 

10  does proceed to represent the guy. The judge doesn't 
11  remove him and the lawyer continues to concede. Do you -­

12  do you think that there is any possibility on a Strickland 

13  analysis of finding adequacy of counsel? 

14  MR. GORNSTEIN: Probably not, Justice Souter, 

15  that you would analyze that under Strickland and you would 

16  find that that's not the reasonable performance of counsel 

17  in that circumstance. 

18  JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I -­

19  MR. GORNSTEIN: And so -- but the question here 

20  really is what do you do not in a case where there's been 

21  an objection, because there was no objection here. 
22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So a substantial component of 

23  reasonableness under Strickland is whether or not you 

24  follow the client's instructions? 

25  MR. GORNSTEIN: It is one factor that reasonable 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  counsel will take into account, but it is not the only 

2  factor. In some situations, if you're not following the 

3  defendant's instructions, it can lead to such a breakdown 

4  in the attorney-client relationship that you couldn't 

5  possibly render effective assistance of counsel. So it is 

6  going to be a factor in that respect. 

7  But this case presents only the question of what 

8  happens when there's no objection, and when there's no 
9  objection, it makes no sense to say that where there's 
10  been consultation, no objection, that instead of allowing 
11  the lawyer to exercise his reasonable judgment on what the 
12  best thing to do is, he instead has to pursue an 

13  alternative reasonable doubt strategy that is less 

14  effective. And the Sixth Amendment simply can't be read 

15  to require counsel to pursue a less effective strategy 

16  that the defendant hasn't asked for. 

17  Now, there's no perfect analogy here, but the 

18  closest analogy is to the division of responsibilities for 

19  appeal where the defendant has the right to say whether he 

20  will appeal, but counsel has the right primarily to make 

21  the strategic judgments of what arguments will be raised 
22  on appeal. So too here, the -- the defendant has the 

23  right to decide to stand trial, but client has primary 

24  responsibility for making the strategic judgment of what 
25  defenses will be raised at that trial. 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  Now, there is -- this is an important question, 

2  and therefore there is a duty on the part of counsel to 

3  consult with the defendant, but once that consultation has 

4  occurred, and there is no objection, and the choice that 
5  counsel made is a reasonable, tactical judgment under all 
6  the facts and circumstances, his pursuit of that strategy 

7  satisfies constitutional standards. There is no 

8  requirement of explicit, affirmative consent, and the 

9  Florida Supreme Court's judgment should, therefore, be 
10  reversed. 

11  If the Court has no further questions, thank 

12  you. 

13  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. 

14  Mr. Tillinghast. 

15  ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. TILLINGHAST, III 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

17  MR. TILLINGHAST: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may 

18  it please the Court: 

19  The issue before the Court today is whether a 

20  defense counsel can concede guilt beyond a reasonable 

21  doubt in his opening and in his closing statements in the 

22  trial, particularly when the defendant is not present. We 

23  submit that the answer is no, and there's two reasons that 

24  it's no. 

25  First, we believe that it's the functional 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  equivalent of a guilty plea as found by the Florida 

2  Supreme Court. 

3  Second, because the -- what was stated was so 

4  clearly an acknowledgement that the State had proven its 

5  case, that there was a complete breakdown of the 

6  adversarial process and there was no meaningful testing of 

7  the State's case. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Tillinghast, may I go 

9  back to something you said? Because I don't want to lose 

10  sight of it. You seem to suggest that the defendant's 

11  absence from the trial should work in his favor when this 

12  was defendant's own choice not to be there. The judge met 
13  with him and said I want to make sure you know what you're 

14  doing. Right? Why should we count at all in the 

15  defendant's favor that he was -- he absented himself from 

16  trial any more than we would give a fugitive credit for 

17  not being there? 

18  MR. TILLINGHAST: Justice Ginsburg, part of the 

19  issue here is -- is the lack of consent. Mr. Nixon was 

20  not present during the entire guilt phase of the trial. 

21  What we would submit is that in this case where there was 

22  the hearing in a holding cell -- it was on the record. 

23  It's part of the record before Your Honor -- where the 

24  judge inquired about Mr. Nixon's willingness to 
25  participate in his trial, and he declined to go into the 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  courtroom, that refusal to go into the courtroom, we 

2  submit, was a refusal to attend the -- the hearing on the 

3  presumption that he was going to have a trial consistent 

4  with his guilty plea -- or not guilty plea -- excuse me -­

5  the not guilty plea that was entered. What he anticipated 

6  was a trial where the State's case was -- was tested and 

7  it was consistent with his not guilty plea. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But he -­

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- you equate this 

10  to a case where the defendant is just accidentally not 
11  present. That's -- that's what I got. I -- I had the 

12  same problem with your opening two sentences as Justice 

13  Ginsburg did. You said if the defendant is absent from 

14  the courtroom. Well, in this case, he was absent because 

15  he chose to be absent. You're -- you're equating this 

16  case to one in which it was as if for some reason they 

17  forgot to have him in the courtroom. 

18  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, the -- the important 

19  issue here is there was not consent. The lack of his 

20  presence in the courtroom compounded that problem, but the 

21  important issue here and the issue before the Court is 

22  that defense counsel conceded guilt and conceded that the 

23  State had proven its case without the consent of his own 

24  client. 

25  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't agree with your earlier 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

--  

1  statement that what -- what this defendant expected was a 

2  contested trial in which, you know, the State's evidence 

3  is challenged, blah, blah, blah. That's to the contrary. 

4  He said this whole thing is -- is just a big railroad job 
5  and that's one reason I don't want to be there. Go ahead 

6  and do whatever you want. He wasn't he wasn't 

7  expecting -- in fact, if you're -- if you're talking about 

8  is subjective expectations, they would reinforce the 
9  lawyer's belief that he had no objection to conceding 
10  guilt because he was referring to this as -- as one big 

11  railroad job. 
12  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, respectfully, Your 

13  Honor, I would -- I would disagree because that what -­

14  what we do have from Mr. Nixon is he stated that -- that 

15  he had fired his lawyer. He wanted a black lawyer. He 

16  wanted a black judge, and that he didn't want to go into 
17  the courtroom because he would be railroaded. That was 

18  after in the newspaper it had indicated that he had -­

19  that his counsel had pled him guilty in his opening 

20  statement, and he was clearly objecting to that conduct. 
21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought he had made those 

22  statements about being railroaded before he found out 

23  about the lawyer's concession. 

24  MR. TILLINGHAST: Actually the you're 

25  correct, Your Honor. 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

--  

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's correct. 

2  MR. TILLINGHAST: The the railroading 

3  statements were before the opening statements. The 

4  objection to the newspaper story was after the opening 
5  statement. 

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you a question just 
7  about what you -- what you're assuming when you make the 

8  -- the statement -- prefaced the argument to the effect 

9  that there was a complete breakdown of -- of the adversary 

10  process. You're assuming, I take it, when you say that, 

11  that the guilt phase and the penalty phase have got to be 

12  regarded as distinct and separate phases. 

13  MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes, Your Honor. 

14  JUSTICE SOUTER: You're dividing it in half. 

15  MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes. 

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that -- why is that 

17  legitimate? Why should a lawyer -- I mean, I presume no 

18  defense lawyer tailors his his guilt phase 

19  representation without a thought to what is going to 

20  happen at the penalty phase if they get to the penalty 

21  phase. And so I -- I have difficulty in saying that there 

22  should be some kind of a firewall for analytical purposes 

23  between guilt and penalty when -- when we're in a -- a 

24  question of Cronic or Strickland. 

25  MR. TILLINGHAST: If the Court -- if the Court 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

1  was to look at the totality and -- as opposed to looking 

2  at the guilt phase, what would happen would be that 

3  capital cases would have -- would end up having a lower 

4  standard than a non-capital case because -­

5  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they wouldn't end up 

6  having lower standards. They -- they would end up having 

7  a a standard at the guilt phase which takes into 

8  consideration what the lawyer is or is not going to be 

9  able to do plausibly at -- at the sentencing phase. And 

10  you know, those -- those may be very, very difficult 

11  questions, but it's hard for me to say that either the 

12  standard is different or that a lawyer should -- or that 

13  we, in setting down standards, should pretend that a 

14  lawyer somehow has to go into a state of oblivion about -­

15  about what's going to happen at sentencing if he gets 

16  there. 

17  MR. TILLINGHAST: The difficulty here is -- is 

18  this was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea 

19  without consent, and -­

20  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let me ask you this. 

21  Do you think that it's possible that in some instances it 

22  is a valid strategy to focus on the punishment/sentencing 

23  phase rather than the guilt phase if the lawyer has 

24  reviewed all the evidence and it appears to the lawyer to 

25  be overwhelming? Is it possible that there's a case where 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  a strategy such as this might make sense? 

2  MR. TILLINGHAST: Your Honor -­

3  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that possible? 

4  MR. TILLINGHAST: With -- with statements in the 

5  opening -­

6  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that possible? 

7  MR. TILLINGHAST: Not without the consent of a 

8  client with statements like this. 

9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now you're building in 

10  something that I didn't ask. I'm asking you if it is 

11  possible that the better strategy for a defendant in a 

12  given case would be to focus on the sentencing rather than 

13  the guilt phase based on an evaluation by the attorney of 

14  the evidence. 

15  MR. TILLINGHAST: There could be circumstances. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you're so -­

17  I thought that the literature was replete with Law Review 

18  articles saying that this is the best strategy. Trial 

19  judges have told us this is the best strategy. I -- I 
20  don't quite understand your hesitation unless it's to 

21  build in this -- this factor of consent. 

22  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, it is the -­

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I thought this -- this 

24  was something you'd say, well, of course. 

25  MR. TILLINGHAST: It -- it is the factor of the 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

--  

1  consent. In -- in this case, in the opening statement, 

2  the -­

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but what -- what about 

4  the basic question, that as a matter of trial strategy, it 

5  is a recognized, acceptable, sometimes prudent, sometimes 

6  wise strategy to concentrate on a sentencing phase? 

7  MR. TILLINGHAST: In the general sense, yes. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no difference 

9  between a capital case and a regular case insofar as the 

10  intelligence of that strategy is concerned because even 

11  when there is not a separate penalty phase, it is 

12  sometimes in the interest of the defendant to, in effect, 

13  throw himself on the mercy of the sentencer, whether that 

14  is the jury or the judge, by -- by not contesting the 
15  the fact that -- that he did the acts charged. That -­

16  that occurs not just in capital case but in -- in regular 
17  cases. 

18  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Justice, the the 

19  distinction here is -- is it -- it wasn't a strategy to 

20  not contest the State's case. What it -- what it was was 

21  it was a complete concession in opening statement that the 

22  State would prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not entirely because both in 

24  the opening and in closing, the lawyer said to the jury, 
25  he did it, but I want you to know from my very opening 

31 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  that this case is about life or death, and that's the 

2  ultimate decision you will have to make. He said that in 

3  his opening and he said it in his closing. It wasn't 

4  simply a case of saying, my client did and now the 

5  prosecutor is going to go through the motions. He told 

6  the jury, what I want you to focus on is the decision 
7  you're going to have to make whether, in the counsel's 

8  words, to spare his life. 

9  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

10  issue here is that he did that and he went beyond just 
11  saying that he did it. He said that the State has proven 

12  its case beyond a reasonable doubt for murder and arson, 

13  and he did it without consent. That's -­

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you say without 

15  consent. At least as -- the record that we have suggests 

16  that the client was told this is what the lawyer planned 

17  to do and said nothing. 

18  Justice Scalia asked a question when the prior 

19  argument was ongoing. When a client doesn't say yes and 

20  he doesn't say no, to take the words of a familiar song, 

21  mustn't the lawyer then do what he thinks is best to do? 

22  Because if he says, okay, I'm going to -- I'm going to 

23  require a full-stop trial, I'm going to cross examine 

24  every witness, he may be damaging his client. The client 

25  didn't tell him not to do that any more than he told him 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  to do it. So mustn't the lawyer in that situation 

2  exercise his best judgment? 
3  MR. TILLINGHAST: I would submit that in this 

4  case, because that it is the functional equivalent of a 

5  guilty plea, and as this Court has held under Boykin and 

6  under Brookhart that you must have voluntary and willing 

7  and knowing consent -­

8  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what if we think that's 

9  not correct, that it is not the equivalent of a guilty 

10  plea? There was some cross examination. There was some 

11  participation. So if we don't accept your statement that 

12  it is the functional equivalent, then what standard do we 

13  employ for the tacit consent or the failure to 

14  affirmatively respond? 

15  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Justice O'Connor, if -­

16  if you're -- if the Court was to view it as not the 

17  functional equivalent, as you've suggested, you could 

18  affirm based upon the nature of the statements and finding 

19  that there was a complete failure under Cronic. 

20  And -- and with respect to the trial, there were 

21  -- there were 35 witnesses called by the State. There 

22  were five what I would submit were perfunctory questions 

23  asked on cross. 

24  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you said we could 

25  affirm if we applied Cronic, but I thought the issue was 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

10

1  whether perhaps Strickland applied, and if Strickland


2  applies, I wouldn't think we'd be affirming necessarily.


3  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, Strickland is -- is 

4  respectfully not before the Court. It was -- the record 

5  below was strictly on -­

6  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the -- the question of 

7  which standard applies I thought was before the Court. 

8  Was it correct for the Florida Supreme Court to employ the 

9  Cronic standard or should it have reviewed it under 

Strickland? Is that not before us? Is that not -­


11  MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- one of the questions? 

13  MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. Thank you. 

15  JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that Boykin and 

16  Boykin and -- and Brookhart were about really a somewhat 

17  different matter. The language, functional equivalent of 

18  a guilty plea, is lifted from Brookhart. Boykin and 

19  Brookhart are about what a judge does, not about what a 
20  lawyer does. In Boykin, the judge accepted the guilty 
21  plea, and the Court said you can't do it without the 

22  express consent of the defendant. In Brookhart, it was a 

23  judge who accepted -- now, here it was an odd procedure, 
24  and it was that procedure that the Court called the 

25  functional equivalent of a guilty plea. And therefore, 

34 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  we're talking about what a judge can do. Here we're not. 
2  We're talking about what a lawyer can do and when it 

3  arises to the level of improper lack of counsel. So I 

4  don't think they govern it. 

5  Rather, I thought -- and I want your view on 

6  this -- that the most relevant case was really Roe v. 

7  Flores, you know, where -- where the lawyer did a weird 

8  thing. He didn't file an appeal. And here he's doing a 

9  little odd thing. So what we said there is you have to 

10  consult, which is just what the Government is saying here. 
11  I'm exposing that thought process to you to get your 

12  reaction. 

13  MR. TILLINGHAST: I -- I think, first, under -­

14  under Jones v. Barnes, it's been held by this Court that 

15  there are three fundamental things that only the client 

16  can do, one of which is to plead guilty. And in -- in the 

17  Roe case, the -- the record below was -- was unclear as to 

18  what happened as to whether there was a duty for the 

19  attorney to file an appeal and what the conversations were 

20  or were not with -- with the defendant. 

21  But we would submit that -- that a guilty plea 

22  is something very special because that it goes to the 

23  heart of the case. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: This is not a guilty plea and 

25  the words -- a guilty plea is something accepted by a 

35

--

1  judge and the judge didn't. But I grant you it's a very 
2  odd situation and very special, and that's why I wonder 

3  what the appropriate way to -- what kind of requirement 

4  there ought to be. Maybe there should be something. I'm 

5  not sure why it should rise above the level of 

6  consultation since you know, better than I, you can have 

7  some awfully difficult clients who are virtually incapable 

8  of understanding what's in their interests. And -- and 

9  that's why I'm awfully reluctant to go beyond saying you 

10  have to consult with your client. You start insisting on 

11  an answer, and you don't know what they're going to say. 

12  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, the -- the lawyer here 

13  did have alternatives. He -- he could have put the State 

14  to its burden and consistent with the not guilty plea that 

15  was entered in the case. Or as an alternative, there 

16  could have been an inquiry on the record of -- by the 

17  judge with the lawyers of Mr. Nixon to determine whether 
18  or not he was consenting to this -- this sort of -- the 

19  opening statements and the closing statements, which 

20  which were extraordinary, particularly the closing 

21  statement because -- and in the closing statement, he 

22  specifically said that the State did prove beyond a 

23  reasonable doubt that each and every element of the crimes 

24  charged, first degree, premeditated murder, kidnapping, 

25  robbery, and arson, had been proven, which is truly 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  extraordinary. Here is a situation where the lawyer who 

2  is the only person in the courtroom, because Mr. Nixon was 

3  tried in absentia, who -- the only person in the courtroom 

4  who was there as the trusted advisor and counselor for Mr. 

5  Nixon, stands up in front of the jury in the opening and 
6  the closing and concedes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

7  I would submit that upon doing that, the -- the whole 

8  adversarial process breaks down because it -­

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? When -- when his object 
10  is to spare this person's life. He knows the evidence is 

11  very strong. He wants, to the extent that he can, 

12  insulate the penalty phase from all that damning evidence 

13  that's coming out at the trial. So he wants the evidence 

14  to come out at the trial, but he doesn't want to be in a 

15  situation where the jury has heard the defendant resist 
16  the determination that he did it and then have to plead 

17  for his life after. 

18  MR. TILLINGHAST: The difficulty, again -- it 

19  comes back to the lack of consent. Had he had consent, it 

20  would be different. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my problem -- and I -­

22  I'm not sure I understand your answer to it. In this 

23  case, in fact the client didn't say yes and he didn't say 

24  no. So if the -- if the lawyer is to assume, well, then 

25  since I don't have a positive, explicit yes, I will assume 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

1  the answer is no, even though that is against the lawyer's 

2  best interest -- the -- the lawyer's best judgment, why is 
3  he an effective counsel if he assumes the answer is no? 

4  MR. TILLINGHAST: In -- in -- particularly in a 

5  capital case, what this Court and all courts would 

6  would want is a reliable record where there had been 

7  testing. When you have a situation where Mr. Nixon, as 

8  here, said nothing, so the -- so Mr. Corin didn't know 

9  whether there was consent or lack of consent, we would 

10  submit that what should have happened is, as I said -­

11  suggested before, he shouldn't have -- he could have not 

12  contested certain things, but the admission on the -- what 

13  I submit is an admission and a plea of guilty without 

14  consent was where the problem was. He could have gone 

15  on -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- but that's not a 

17  problem. According to the lower courts, that was a good 

18  strategy. I don't know why you want counsel, when -- when 

19  the client doesn't answer, to say, gee, I -- you know, I 

20  don't know whether he has approved or disapproved, I'm 

21  going to have to take the course that will probably get 

22  him executed because I -- I haven't received an answer. 

23  Why would you force that course on the -- on the lawyer? 

24  If the lawyer believes that the silence implies consent, 

25  as -- as silence usually does, why not let the lawyer do 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  what's in the client's best interest? 

2  MR. TILLINGHAST: He had the alternative of -­

3  of having an inquiry with Mr. Nixon, with the court 

4  determine whether or not -­

5  JUSTICE SCALIA: And Nixon -- okay. You have 

6  the inquiry and Nixon just stands there, the same, doesn't 
7  say a thing, assuming you could get him into the 

8  courtroom, you know, assuming he had put his clothes on so 

9  you could bring him into the courtroom. He just -- he 
10  just sits there. 
11  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well -­

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you say, well, since 

13  we don't have an answer, we have to take the course that's 

14  going to get this guy executed. That doesn't seem to me 

15  to make much sense. 

16  MR. TILLINGHAST: I would respectfully submit 

17  that given the nature of the opening and closing, the 

18  words that were used, in -- in that kind of a extreme 

19  situation, that is a decision that the client should make. 

20  This is not a decision that is a normal strategy decision 

21  that a lawyer would normally make, such as which witnesses 

22  to -- to call, aside from the defendant himself, the order 

23  of the witnesses, and -- and types of cross examination. 

24  This is a very -­

25  JUSTICE SOUTER: No. No, but I don't think 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  --  

1  you're getting to -- at -- at what bothers us. Nobody is 

2  saying that the client should not make a decision. The 

3  problem is that the client won't make a decision, and the 

4  client acts as if he had made the decision to allow the 

5  lawyer to do what the lawyer proposes. This isn't a 

6  question of whether he should be heard or not, but what -­

7  what to make of the behavior. And you're saying when -­

8  when the behavior appears to be acquiescence from silence, 

9  you nonetheless -- the lawyer is, nonetheless, obligated 

10  to take the course which is coming closest to guaranteeing 

11  that he will receive the death penalty. And that's what's 

12  bothering us. 

13  MR. TILLINGHAST: The in in this 

14  situation, it's -- it's the nature of what was said and 

15  his lack of presence in the courtroom where there was no 

16  affirmative defense. And in -- in the record below where 

17  the Florida Supreme Court sent it down to determine 

18  whether or not there was consent, there was no 

19  acquiescence. Mr. Nixon simply did nothing. When -- when 

20  asked -- when Mr. Corin testified and was asked about 

21  whether he discussed the trial strategy and whether Mr. 

22  Nixon agreed or disagreed, Mr. Nixon simply did nothing. 

23  He -- he didn't acquiesce to the strategy. 

24  JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Tillinghast, can I ask you 

25  if you are familiar with the Loeb/Leopold trial many, many 

40 

Alderson Reporting Company

--  

--

1  years ago that was conducted by Clarence Darrow? If 

2  you're not, I won't push you on it. 

3  MR. TILLINGHAST: Unfortunately, I'm not, Your 

4  Honor. 

5  JUSTICE STEVENS: Because he he applied 

6  exactly this strategy and it was one of his great 

7  victories. In -- in fact, it's a long, long time ago. 

8  But that was the way Clarence Darrow sized up this very 

9  problem, and the -- and I think in that case they were 

10  very young clients that he had. They didn't -- they were 

11  not -- they did not expressly consent to what he did. But 

12  he saved their lives. 

13  MR. TILLINGHAST: Well, if -- besides the 

14  what we believe was a fundamental -- what was a complete 

15  failure -- excuse me. Aside from the guilty plea, what we 

16  submit is a guilty plea, we believe that when these kinds 

17  of statements were made, Your Honor, without the consent, 

18  that the advocacy system that was envisioned in Cronic 

19  completely failed. 

20  JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question that 

21  I asked the other side? And that is, if we don't accept 

22  your argument, if we think when the client is silent, the 

23  lawyer must exercise his best judgment and not assume that 
24  the client would give an answer that would jeopardize the 
25  client's position, if that's the position that this Court 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  adopts, what would you say is left over for remand? Is it 

2  simply that the Florida Supreme Court then takes the 

3  record as it is and determines under Strickland whether 

4  there was effective -- ineffective performance? 

5  MR. TILLINGHAST: The -- yes, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be -- that would 

7  be all. 

8  So what do we do with, in the brief, all this 

9  information about things that the lawyer should have done 

10  by way of cross examination? That wasn't put in the 

11  record earlier -­

12  MR. TILLINGHAST: When I say yes, the -- what 

13  would -- what would be left is an entire hearing on the -­

14  on the Strickland claims and the motion to vacate. That 

15  -- that would be the remaining part of the case -­

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why do we need a hearing 

17  rather than an examination of the record? Tell me why. 

18  MR. TILLINGHAST: Because the -- the hearings 

19  below, when it was sent back down by the Florida Supreme 

20  Court, were only on the issue of whether or not there was 

21  consent to -- to the -- what the Florida Supreme Court 

22  deemed to be the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. 

23  There was not a hearing on the balance of the issues, and 

24  it was strictly limited to that. 

25  JUSTICE SCALIA: Hadn't there been a hearing on 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  those issues on the way up? 

2  MR. TILLINGHAST: No. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

4  MR. TILLINGHAST: No. 

5  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't -­

6  MR. TILLINGHAST: It was actually denied by 

7  Judge Hall. So the only thing that's -- that's occurred 

8  is the hearing strictly on whether or not there was -- was 

9  consent. 

10  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why was it denied in the 

11  trial court? Why was the introduction of what the lawyer 

12  might have done -­

13  MR. TILLINGHAST: It was -- it was because of 

14  the focus of the Florida Supreme Court on -- on whether or 

15  not there was a consent. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: No. We're talking below. 

17  JUSTICE SOUTER: No. We're talking about the 

18  trial court. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking below on the way 

20  up to the Florida Supreme Court. I assume that -- that he 

21  raised below the issue of inadequate performance of 

22  counsel and he had his opportunity to introduce whatever 

23  evidence he had on that subject on the way up to the 
24  Florida Supreme Court. 

25  MR. TILLINGHAST: He -­

43 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why the Florida 

2  Supreme Court should be obliged to remand it in order to 

3  give him a second bite at the apple. 

4  MR. TILLINGHAST: It was raised but -- but he 

5  was not given an opportunity for a hearing on that. 

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, was he denied the 

7  opportunity? 

8  MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE SOUTER: Did the -- did the judge say, 
10  look, we're -- we're going to confine it strictly to this 

11  one issue? 

12  MR. TILLINGHAST: Yes. 

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

14  MR. TILLINGHAST: So, in conclusion, Your 

15  Honors, we submit that there are two -- two approaches to 

16  affirming the Florida Supreme Court. First is -- is that 

17  it was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without 

18  consent. The second is that because of the nature of the 

19  statements, it was a complete failure of the advocacy 

20  process where the State's case was not tested in any way. 

21  In fact, as I mentioned, there were 35 witnesses. There 

22  were five very perfunctory questions asked such as what 

23  date was it and when did certain things occur. There was 

24  not the material testing of the record to determine the 

25  truth, which is what is -- is involved in the Sixth 

44 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--  

1  Amendment. 

2  And none of -- none of the challenges, that are 

3  pointed out in -- to the facts in our brief ever came out 

4  because that there was no testing. Simply we have an 

5  opening statement where counsel says the State will prove 

6  beyond a reasonable doubt that these events occurred. 

7  Then we have virtually no cross examination. We have no 

8  witnesses called by the State -- excuse me -- by -- by the 

9  defendant throughout the entire guilt phase of the trial. 

10  And in fact, at one point, the -- the trial judge stopped 
11  asking -- asking Mr. Corin if he wished to cross examine. 

12  And then we have the closing statement where Mr. 

13  Corin stated that the State has proven beyond a reasonable 

14  doubt that -- that he is -- Mr. Nixon was guilty of the 

15  crimes. 

16  And all the while during that guilt phase, Mr. 

17  Nixon was not present in the courtroom. So he had no 

18  ability to object to the opening or the closing statements 
19  because he wasn't here -- there to hear them. 

20  And further, as -- as the record indicates, 

21  there are issues of -- of Mr. Nixon's competency, that 

22  he's mentally retarded. His own lawyer referred to him as 

23  nuts. His own lawyer also referred to him as an ogre in 

24  his closing argument. These are the types of statements, 

25  we would submit, are even if they are not the 

45 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent, 

2  they -- they substantially and completely destroy the 

3  advocacy process. So there is no testing, and under 

4  Cronic, the Court should affirm also. 

5  Thank you. 

6  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Tillinghast. 

7  Mr. Lemieux, you have about 4 minutes left. 

8  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. LEMIEUX 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

10  MR. LEMIEUX: Thank you, Justice Stevens. 

11  I'd like to point this Court to page 486 of the 

12  joint appendix where Mr. Corin is asked, do you feel in 
13  this case that you were put in a position that you had to 

14  make decisions because your client did nothing? And he 

15  said, yes, sir. There is ample evidence in the post­

16  trial proceedings that Mr. Corin wanted the help of his 

17  client. He did not want to be on the bridge of the ship 

18  alone, but Mr. Nixon abandoned the ship. And although he 

19  consulted with his client at least three times on this 

20  trial strategy, there was no input back that would have 

21  given him any reason to believe that Mr. Nixon did not 

22  want him to go forward to pursue a strategy that Mr. 

23  Corin, in his experience of 14 years as a lawyer, after 

24  having taken 52 depositions in this case, believed was in 

25  the best interest of his client. 

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  I just have a couple of points I'd like to make. 
2  There was a question that was asked about whether or not 

3  the -- the guilt phase and the penalty phase are distinct 

4  parts of a trial. This Court has addressed that in the 

5  Monj v. California case when it said that it's really one 
6  trial and that issues of guilt and innocence are often, in 

7  a capital trial, still being determined in the penalty 

8  phase of that matter. 

9  I'd also like to mention the point that the 

10  counsel made about Cronic. Counsel would ask, as the 

11  Florida Supreme Court did, to apply Cronic to this 

12  situation. There is a harmony that exists in this 

13  jurisprudence between Strickland and Cronic. Issues of 
14  trial performance and trial strategy are articulated and 

15  evaluated under Strickland's two-part standard. Questions 

16  of structural defects that infect the process with error 

17  are evaluated under Cronic. And that harmony works in the 

18  system. It allows for the independence and vitality of 

19  counsel to pursue strategies in their clients' best 

20  interests and it also allows when there are structural 

21  defects, for them to be taken care of with the 

22  presumption. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to get to the 

24  point of whether there was, indeed, an opportunity for 

25  this defendant to introduce evidence about inadequate 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  performance of counsel? 

2  MR. LEMIEUX: Yes, I am, Your Honor, and I'll 

3  get to that right now. There was ample opportunity. 

4  There were three hearings. And in fact, there was 

5  disagreement between the sides as to whether or not there 

6  was this opportunity for a Strickland hearing. We don't 

7  have Strickland hearings -­

8  JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what did the judge -­
9  what did judge say? Your brother said the judge said, no, 
10  I won't hear this. 

11  MR. LEMIEUX: Your Honor, I would point the 

12  Court to pages 385 to 390 of the appendix where Judge 

13  Smith denies the Strickland claim. 

14  The defense has the burden of proving 

15  ineffective assistance of counsel. During the first 

16  hearing, there was an issue as to whether or not it was an 

17  ineffective counsel hearing because it was still on direct 

18  appeal. But certainly in hearings two and three, there 

19  was ample opportunity to put that evidence on the record, 

20  and they didn't take that opportunity. Now, they quibbled 

21  and said they didn't have notice and they didn't know that 

22  they were supposed to be here for a Strickland hearing. 

23  We disagree with that because there aren't Strickland 

24  hearings, there are not Cronic hearings. 

25  JUSTICE STEVENS: Why should -- why should they 

48 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  put in Strickland evidence if they've won under Cronic? 

2  MR. LEMIEUX: Well, they had not yet won under 

3  Cronic, Your Honor. They were still making those 

4  arguments. 

5  JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought it was remanded for 

6  an issue -- for a hearing on the consent issue after -­

7  MR. LEMIEUX: This is -- there was a hearing 

8  before that and a hearing after that. 

9  JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. 

10  MR. LEMIEUX: In conclusion, Your Honor, we 

11  believe that the harmony between these two lines of cases 

12  works, that the Florida Supreme Court got it wrong, and 

13  for that reason, we would request reversal. 

14  Thank you. 

15  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. 

16  The case is submitted. 

17  (Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in the 

18  above-entitled matter was submitted.)
