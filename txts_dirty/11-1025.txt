3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-1025, Clapper v. Amnesty 

International.
 

6  General Verrilli.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and
 

may it please the Court: 

11  The question in this case is whether 

12 Respondents have standing to bring a facial challenge to 

13 the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence 

14 Surveillance Act. Those amendments provide authority to 

the executive to conduct surveillance targeted at 

16 foreign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence 

17 purposes. 

18  Along with that grant of authority, Congress 

19 imposed statutory protections designed --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, is there 

21 anybody who has standing? 

22  As I read your brief, standing would only 

23 arise at the moment the government decided to use the 

24 information against someone in a pending case. To me, 

that --

25

Official 

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: Several points,
 

2 Your Honor --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would seem to say
 

4 that the Act -- if there were a violation; I'm not
 

suggesting there is -- but that if there was a
 

6 constitutional violation in the interception, that no
 

7 one could ever stop it until they were charged with a
 

8 crime, essentially.
 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, under the
 

statute, there are two clear examples of situations in 

11 which the individuals would have standing. 

12  The first is if an aggrieved person, someone 

13 who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the 

14 government intends to introduce information in a 

proceeding against them. They have standing. That 

16 standing could include a facial challenge like the one 

17 here. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, can you 

19 be specific on who that person would be? Because, as I 

understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the 

21 lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal 

22 offense. It's more probable that their clients would 

23 be; but, according to the government, their clients have 

24 no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who 

are noncitizens who acted abroad.

Official 

1  So it's hard for me to envision. I see the 

2 theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person 

3 who would be subject to a criminal charge who could 

4 raise an objection.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if the 

6 information were -- if anyone gets notice, including the 

7 client, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would 

8 be in a position at that point to act. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the client is somebody 

who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S. 

11 citizen. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainly true. 

13 But, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that 

14 -- that electronic communication service providers can 

challenge authorizations under the Act, so you -- there 

16 certainly would be standing in that instance. 

17  There was such a case. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is it that a 

19 service provider would object?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the service 

21 provider did object to the immediate statutory 

22 predecessor to the 2008 amendments. And the -- and the 

23 FISA court litigated that constitutional challenge. So 

24 there's a concrete context there in which it arises. 

But even -- but beyond that --

5

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the litigation was 

2 unsuccessful. 

3  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that's right. The 

4 Court found there was no Fourth Amendment violation 

there. 

6  But I think the point here, Your Honor, 

7 is -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal 

8 case, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the 

9 authority to that plaintiff. In a situation like this 

one, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a 

11 plaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the 

12 application gets into classified information pretty 

13 quickly. 

14  I think what the Respondents have tried to 

do here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that 

16 difficulty. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, using what you just 

18 mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court 

19 should hold there is standing. Couldn't the government 

then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this 

21 information is classified, these are state secrets, we 

22 can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation? 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: That is a possibility. 

24 Of course, there's a procedure that the executive branch 

would have to go through, but that's a possibility.

1  But I don't think we can get to that point, 

2 Your Honor, because I do think the key point here is 

3 that the Respondents' claims about this statute depend 

4 on a cascade of speculation. This statute only grants 

authority. It doesn't command anything. And in order 

6 for the Respondents to make a claim that they are 

7 injured, in fact, by this statute --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I don't know 

9 that you've answered my question. Perhaps you have, but 

I just want to make sure that I'm clear. 

11  Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the 

12 targets of an investigation, if they -- if their 

13 conversations would be intercepted, according to you 

14 they'd never have standing.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think it's 

16 appropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III 

17 standing requirement of injury in fact based on the 

18 reality that the specific applications of this statute 

19 may involve classified information.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, we've had --

21 we've had cases in the past where it is clear that 

22 nobody would have standing to challenge what is -- what 

23 is brought before this Court. 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's exactly right, 

Justice Scalia.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said that that 

2 just proves that under our system of separated powers, 

3 it is none of our business. 

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: That the Court's 

authority cannot be invoked in that circumstance. And 

6 the mere fact that a specific application requires 

7 getting into classified matters can't change that basic 

8 Article III requirement. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the test that you 

propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the 

11 word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it 

12 unfair to characterize the government's position as 

13 saying that you're submitting that the injury must be 

14 certain?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: No. The key point, I 

16 think, is narrower than that, Justice Kennedy. 

17  This is a case in which the speculation is 

18 about the government's conduct, not the connection 

19 between the government action and an ultimate effect on 

the Plaintiff. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume --

22 let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be --

23 that the lawyer would be injured if his communication 

24 with the client were intercepted, or at least that he 

would have standing to prove injury. Let's assume that

1 for the moment. 

2  If that is an acceptable premise, assume 

3 that it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to 

4 occur? And another test is there's a reasonable 

likelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a
 

6 substantial likelihood. You have to say -- you say
 

7 imminent.
 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: The government conduct
 

9 being challenged has to either have occurred or be
 

certainly impending. And here, we have the polar 

11 opposite, Your Honor. I think it is important to think 

12 about --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Certainly impending. 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: Certainly impending. 

That's the language from this Court's opinions. 

16  And I think -- I think, if the Court thinks 

17 about it, every single case in which the Court has found 

18 standing, there's never been a dispute about whether the 

19 government was going to act or not; the dispute was only 

about the connection between the government action and 

21 the plaintiff's injury. 

22  Here, they're fighting about what --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, but in 

24 this case the Complainant can never know. I mean, I 

know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim, 

9

1 but it's not speculative if the government being given 

2 this authority by Congress is going to use it. Isn't 

3 that so? 

4  I mean, are we to assume that --

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's not 

6 speculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative 

7 is the connection between the grant of authority and a 

8 claim of injury. I do think it's important --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- you were 

talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of 

11 inferences, I think was your phrase. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: There's a cascade of 

13 speculation --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want to tell us that 

in your view these -- all these inference that we're 

16 required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is 

17 adopted, you were going to tell us about --

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I'd like very much to do 

19 that. Thank you, Your Honor, yes.

 First, the Respondents have to speculate 

21 about what the intelligence priorities and objectives of 

22 the executive branch are. 

23  Second, they have to speculate about how the 

24 executive branch officials are going to exercise their 

judgment to translate those priorities into procedures 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 and procedures that comply with the statutory targeting 

2 and minimization requirements. 

3  Third, they have to speculate about the 

4 independent judgment of an Article III court assessing 

the lawfulness of those procedures and assessing whether 

6 those procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there much of a 

8 speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one 

9 time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the 

FISA court ever -- ever turned down an application. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, but that, Your 

12 Honor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the 

13 process. It's really very much an iterative process in 

14 which there's a dialogue between the executive branch 

and the FISA court in which the court can demand more 

16 information, raise objections. Those get worked out, 

17 and then there's a final order. 

18  So I don't think it's fair to infer from the 

19 fact that there's only one rejection that this -- that 

it's a process that isn't rigorous. 

21  But, in addition to the speculation I just 

22 described, once you get through all that, you still have 

23 to speculate about whether the communication that --

24 whether the persons with whom the Respondents are 

communicating are going to be targeted, and that 

11

1 Respondents' communications will get picked up and --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here is -- I assume 

3 that it is an injury for an American speaking in America 

4 to have his communication intercepted against his will 

by the American government. We take that as a harm; is 

6 that right? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: It may be a harm, yes. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the question is 

9 how likely is that to occur?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think the question 

11 under this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the 

12 government is going to take an action that makes that 

13 certainly impending. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Fine. That's 

why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow. 

16 I mean, you know, nothing is certain. But I see it's 

17 some degree of what you say -- some people say 

18 certainly, some people say likelihood, etc. So put that 

19 to the side.

 What I want to know is, we have the 

21 declaration of Mr. Scott McKay. Now, Mr. Scott McKay 

22 says he's represented two of the people who are 

23 allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he 

24 has represented them for some time. One was in 

Guantanamo. Another is charged with various crimes and 

12

1 is subject to many, many civil suits. 

2  In the course of that, he has to phone and 

3 has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the 

4 various Arab states, and in the past the U.S. 

intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 

6 20,000 e-mail communications involving his client. 

7  So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty 

8 certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the 

9 security agencies are doing their job, they will, in 

fact, intercept further communications involving this 

11 particular individual, the two that he's representing? 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: Actually, Your Honor --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: And why doesn't that meet 

14 the test?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: -- I think that gets to 

16 the last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in 

17 order for them to make out their chain of causation, and 

18 it's this: They have to speculate that whatever 

19 surveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as 

opposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do 

21 not challenge. 

22  And Mr. McKay, that situation is a very good 

23 example of this. We point out in footnote 11 at page 32 

24 of our brief that Mr. McKay says, yes, my client was 

subjected to 10,000 interceptions of phone calls, 20,000

1 interceptions of e-mails. Every one of those, it's a 

2 matter of public record, was under the authority of FISA 

3 before it was amended in 2008 --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: But why can't we get an 

answer to that question? I mean, I see your point. I'm 

6 interrupting because I -- I see where you're going. And 

7 it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I 

8 can't imagine what security it would violate, whether 

9 the government were to say, if necessary privately to a 

judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new 

11 authority for this purpose. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: But he's just --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Or it could say the 

14 contrary. And so couldn't we find out whether he has 

standing there without jeopardizing any concern of 

16 national security? 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think you can't get 

18 there without establishing that there's a case of 

19 controversy. And they haven't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is if, in fact, 

21 the government is going to use this statute to continue 

22 to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: But this case is at 

24 summary judgment now, and the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

25

Official 

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- Respondents moved for 

2 summary judgment based on the declarations that they 

3 submitted. And the declarations that they submitted 

4 contain the information I described.

 And so the only information that's in front 

6 of the Court in making a decision now is information 

7 that that surveillance occurred under another authority 

8 that still exists and could still be applied --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how that 

is pertinent. What you're saying is they don't have 

11 standing to challenge program A because they may also be 

12 injured under program B. And do you have an example of 

13 a case where we've held that? 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's -- I think 

the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in 

16 that the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty 

17 to incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty 

18 is triggered by, according to their expert affidavit --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there again, 

it depends how you phrase their injury. If you phrase 

21 their injury as being subject to surveillance under a 

22 particular statutory provision that they think is 

23 facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to 

24 get any relief because you're going to be subject to 

surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they

1 may say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have 

2 the right to cure the injury of being subject to 

3 surveillance under 1881a. 

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: But they still have to 

show a concrete application of the authority they're 

6 challenging. That's what this Court faces --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we parse injury 

8 that finely? I mean, the injury, it seems to me, is 

9 being overheard. Does it -- by the government. Do we 

say, oh, well, it's one injury to be overheard under 

11 this statute, it's another injury to be overheard under 

12 another statute? Do you know any case where we've --

13 we've cut the baloney that fine? 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I don't. But -- but 

I do think the redressability point is a valid one. 

16 They have to show --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the thing is they are 

19 going to be injured by being overheard. And you're 

saying that they will be overheard anyway, and, 

21 therefore, by preventing the government from overhearing 

22 them under this statute, we're not redressing their 

23 grievance, which is being overheard by the government. 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's precisely what I'm 

saying.

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Verrilli, this 

2 statute greatly expands the government's surveillance 

3 power. Nobody denies that. And so if the question from 

4 these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of 

being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take, 

6 this statute makes them think about that question in an 

7 entirely different way, doesn't it? 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think, as 

9 compared to -- let me make two points about that. 

First, in terms of the expansion of authority, yes, 

11 that's fair with respect to the authority that existed 

12 immediately preceding the statute. 

13  I actually think -- a bit of context is 

14 relevant here -- that what this statute was trying to do 

is reset the initial balance that Congress struck under 

16 FISA in 1978, when the large majority of overseas 

17 communications were carried by satellite and, therefore, 

18 not within FISA. 

19  And, of course, what --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but if you take the 

21 baseline position before this statute and the position 

22 after this statute, these lawyers and other people in 

23 their situation are going to understand that this is 

24 just true, that the government is intercepting more 

material, and that they have to take greater precautions 

17

1 in order to keep their conversations confidential, if 

2 that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do. 

3  So they're going to take precautions that 

4 they wouldn't have had to take the day before this 

statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of 

6 commonsensical point of view. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't agree with that, 

8 Justice Kagan. I think -- this statute does not 

9 regulate them. It confers authority on the government. 

They take whatever precautions they choose to take based 

11 on their beliefs about how that authority's going to be 

12 exercised. That depends on the speculation I described. 

13  What this Court held in Summers is that you 

14 have to have a concrete application of the authority in 

order to meet the minimum constitutional requirement for 

16 Article III standing. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now we're back at the 

18 same circle we started with, which is the one that 

19 Justice Breyer started with. He pointed to one person 

under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of 

21 thousands of interceptions. Can you really say that the 

22 government's not going to target him under this greater 

23 authority that it sought just for the purpose of 

24 ensuring that it casts a broader net?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I think it is 

18

Official 

1 speculation. I think you do not have a concrete
 

2 application of this authority against anyone, and
 

3 therefore you cannot meet the basic Article III
 

4 requirement of standing that's set forth in Summers.


 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't see why,
 

6 General Verrilli, this case is any different from
 

7 Monsanto. In Monsanto, the government deregulates
 

8 genetically modified alfalfa, says, go plant it.
 

9  Now, there were these farmers who were
 

complaining, and they said, we don't know if that will 

11 contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a 

12 significant risk that it will contaminate our crops. 

13 Because we think that there's that significant risk, we 

14 have to take precautions.

 Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening 

16 in this case? We now think, says the -- say the 

17 lawyers, that there is a significant risk that our 

18 conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't 

19 exist before. Because of that significant risk, we have 

to take precautions of the exact same kind that the 

21 farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the difference 

23 between this case and Monsanto illustrates our point. 

24 If the plaintiff in Monsanto had come into court and 

said, Congress has enacted a statute that gives the 

19

Official 

1 government agency the authority to deregulate 

2 genetically modified seeds, we think there is an 

3 objectively reasonable likelihood that the government is 

4 going to exercise that authority to deregulate 

alfalfa --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't see that difference 

7 at all, General Verrilli --

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and then --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because, in fact, what 

Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but 

11 the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go 

12 plant genetically modified crops. 

13  And then there was the question whether, 

14 because of that, essentially, delegation of authority, 

the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened. 

16 And the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed, 

17 and we have to take precautions in order not to be 

18 harmed. 

19  So it's the same thing. It's a different 

actor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a 

21 fear that that delegation of authority will result in 

22 harm leading to a set of precautions. 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: There is at least two 

24 differences, Justice Kagan, with all due respect.

 First, there is an exercise of the

Official 

1 delegation of authority in Monsanto that is not present 

2 here. Here, there is speculation about how the 

3 authority will be exercised. 

4  Second, with respect to the authority, the 

record in that -- in Monsanto showed the seeds were in 

6 the ground, and the only question was a question of 

7 scientific assessment about the likelihood that the 

8 plaintiff farmers' crops were going to be affected, and 

9 that was a scientific judgment based on the pollination 

radius of the bumblebee, whether it would affect their 

11 crops. 

12  But what we're talking about here is 

13 speculation about how government officials are going to 

14 exercise policy judgments to implement the statute 

and --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is it really such 

17 speculation, General? I mean, just imagine 

18 that -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the 

19 lawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a 

terrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case 

21 of one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to 

22 that person's family members and associates and trying 

23 to find out everything that I can. 

24  Now, as a lawyer, would you take 

precautions, or would you pick up the phone and start 

21

1 writing e-mails to all those people? 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: If I took precautions, it 

3 would be because of a belief that I had to comply with 

4 an ethics rule, and the ethics rule would be the cause 

of me taking those precautions. It doesn't change the 

6 standard. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't even think it has to 

8 do with an ethics rule. If you're a good lawyer --

9 forget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply. 

Are you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer, 

11 would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute 

12 and talk to -- these terrorists' associates? 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, it seems to 

14 me that that hypothetical is a variant of exactly the 

argument that the Court rejected in Summers. There 

16 isn't a concrete application. 

17  In Summers, the Court said, even in a 

18 situation where it would be likely that some members of 

19 the Sierra Club would be affected by the exercise of 

authority that the statute conferred, that you cannot --

21 you do not have a case --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: In Summers, the Court 

23 said --

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- or controversy absent 

the exercise of the authority.

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. In Summers, the 

2 Court said, well, we don't know that this person is just 

3 going to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by 

4 this government action.

 I asked you a different question. You're a 

6 lawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the 

7 terrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this 

8 statute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way 

9 that you ordinarily would use the e-mail?

 Well, given the availability of traditional 

11 FISA surveillance, surveillance under Executive Order 

12 12333, surveillance by foreign governments, I don't 

13 think it depends on this statute. 

14  But -- but, in any event, whatever the 

reasonable judgment of a lawyer in those circumstances, 

16 there isn't a concrete application of the statute that 

17 creates a case or controversy here. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You never know. There 

19 may be dozens of concrete applications affecting the 

Plaintiffs in this case, but we will never know. 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I do think the 

22 problem here, Justice Ginsburg, really is -- the heart 

23 of the matter here really is that in a normal lawsuit a 

24 plaintiff would challenge the application of a statute, 

of the authority conferred under the statute.

1  Here, that would run into classified 

2 information. So the Respondents have tried to plead a 

3 theory that allows them to avoid that problem. But it 

4 is inherently based on speculation, and I --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you think it's 

6 speculation. The government has a statute that says you 

7 can wiretap in the United States organized crime when 

8 life is at stake and you show it to a judge. Then they 

9 say, that isn't good enough. We pass a new statute, and 

it says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when 

11 you want, without a judge. 

12  Now, a lawyer who represents organized crime 

13 says, my clients have been wiretapped under the first 

14 statute 400,000 times.

 Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets 

16 ahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million 

17 times, because they want to suppress organized crime. 

18 I'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know. 

19 Okay. So.

 Now, the question, which I haven't thought 

21 of before, you are saying no standing, no standing, 

22 can't raise it --

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: In a case like that, the 

24 lawyer -- the normal course would be for the lawyer to 

challenge the application of the statute. Here, you

1 have the classified information problem. 

2  But I will say --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: No, you can't. You can't 

4 do that here. So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems 

to be separate from other people. He seems very likely 

6 to have a concrete injury. If they -- if they aren't 

7 wiretapping the people who are described here, who are 

8 they wiretapping? And they passed this statute in order 

9 to have extra authority.

 So put those three things together, and they 

11 seem to spell mother, perhaps, you know. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, they don't. 

13  And the other thing I think that's critical 

14 here is that I think Congress was sensitive to the 

probability that you could not have facial challenges of 

16 the kind that Respondents want to bring. And so there 

17 is an entire --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you are 

19 saying that the government has obtained this 

extraordinarily wide-reaching power and we have 

21 extraordinary risks that face this country and the 

22 government's not going to use it. That's just, it --

23 it's hard for me to think that the government isn't 

24 using all of the powers at its command under the law --

GENERAL VERRILLI: I'm not --

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in order to protect 

2 this country. And you -- you want to say: Oh, well, 

3 don't worry that it's not happening. There is another 

4 statute. That -- that's the problem I have with this 

line of argument. 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I'm not saying that 

7 at all, Justice Kennedy. But it remains the case that 

8 the way -- that in order for there to be an Article III 

9 case or controversy, a concrete application of that 

authority has to be demonstrated and it hasn't 

11 been under the theory of the plaintiffs' case. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's Justice Kagan's 

13 hypothetical. The lawyer -- and I don't forget 

14 about the -- I think the ethics problem is, is a very 

substantial one. I think the lawyer would engage in 

16 malpractice if he talked on the telephone with some of 

17 these clients, given this statute. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- and I think it 

19 would be the ethics rule that caused the lawyer to take 

those steps, not the statute. He would still have the 

21 same inferences. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's still the 

23 reality. He still has to change his conduct. 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: I would like to make one 

more point, if I could, Justice Kennedy, that I think

1 goes to this and then I would like to reserve the 

2 balance of my time. 

3  Congress was aware of the difficultly that 

4 -- of bringing facial challenges, and so Congress put 

into place an alternative structure of accountability
 

6 here. There are -- this is not unbounded authority.
 

7 There are targeting requirements, minimization
 

8 requirements, certification by the highest level --

9 highest levels of the executive, and there is
 

independent review by an Article III judge to ensure 

11 compliance not only with the statute, but also with the 

12 Fourth Amendment, and there is ample congressional 

13 oversight. So it's not the case that this is a 

14 free-ranging authority at all.

 Thank you.

18  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMEEL JAFFER 

19  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. JAFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

21 please the Court: 

22  Plaintiffs have standing here because there 

23 is a substantial risk that their communications will be 

24 acquired under the Act and because this substantial risk 

has effectively compelled them to take immediate 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 measures to protect information that is sensitive or
 

2 privileged. Plaintiffs are lawyers, journalists and
 

3 human rights researchers who routinely engage in
 

4 communications that the Act is designed to allow the
 

government to acquire. Plaintiffs communicate, for 

6 example, foreign intelligence information, the kind of 

7 information that the statute expressly authorizes the 

8 government to collect, to retain and disseminate. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our cases, of 

course, say, do say "certainly impending," not 

11 "substantial risk." 

12  MR. JAFFER: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

13 there is a -- a question even in cases that involve only 

14 a future injury, whether "certainly impending" is in 

fact the standard. But leaving that to the side, this 

16 is not a case that involves only an allegation of future 

17 injury. Our --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, let's leave that 

19 aside. You have two arguments; one is likelihood of 

future injury and the other is present obligations or 

21 cause. I want to focus on the former. Our standard is 

22 certainly impending, and you articulated it by saying, 

23 substantial risk. There is obviously a vast difference 

24 between those two.

 MR. JAFFER: Well, I don't think, Your 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 Honor, that the Court has settled on certainly 

2 impending. The cases that the -- the government cites 

3 are cases like -- I think that the one that the 

4 government cites, relies on most heavily is Summers. 

But in Summers, the distinction between likelihood and 

6 certainly impending was not one that the Court relied on 

7 in -- in that decision. The Court said that plaintiffs 

8 couldn't meet even the lower standard. So I think that 

9 the discussion of certainly impending --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But both in Summers and 

11 Monsanto the government tells us: We knew that the 

12 governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew 

13 that, the question was substantial risk. 

14  MR. JAFFER: Justice Kennedy, the -- the --

the cases that we rely on, Monsanto, Laidlaw, 

16 Meese v. Keene, these are cases in which the Court 

17 didn't look to the certainly impending standard at all. 

18 The question that the Court asked in those cases was: 

19 Is there a substantial risk? Is there a substantial 

risk that effectively compels the plaintiff to act in 

21 the way they are -- they are acting? 

22  You are right that the government points out 

23 this distinction in Monsanto. They say Monsanto is a 

24 case in which the government was actually doing 

something, was known to -- to be doing something. But 

29

25

Official 

1 even, in this case, first of all, we know that the 

2 government is using the statute. They have acknowledged 

3 that they are using the statute. So there -- there is a 

4 certainty of government conduct.

 But aside from that, those cases like 

6 Monsanto and Laidlaw and Meese are not cases that --

7 that actually turned on the fact that the government was 

8 doing something. They are cases that turned on the fact 

9 that there was a substantial risk of future injury, and 

the substantial risk compelled plaintiffs to do 

11 something immediately. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not enough, of 

13 course, to know that the government is using the 

14 statute. The whole question is whether or not your 

clients have been injured, not whether the statute's 

16 being used. 

17  MR. JAFFER: I -- I agree with that. I 

18 don't think it would be enough for a plaintiff to walk 

19 into court and say the government is using the statute 

and therefore we have standing. But our plaintiffs are 

21 not in that position. Our plaintiffs --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have an 

23 issue --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, do you 

want to finish? If it's all right, could you finish the

Official 

1 answer? 

2  MR. JAFFER: Sure. I was just going to say 

3 that our -- our plaintiffs have -- have reasons to 

4 believe that their own communications will be monitored 

under the statute. One relates to the kind of 

6 information that they routinely exchange over the phone 

7 and by e-mail, foreign intelligence information. But 

8 it's also that -- that plaintiffs communicate with the 

9 kinds of people the government is likely to -- to 

monitor under the statute. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that assessment take 

12 into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon 

13 the government's ability to intercept these 

14 communications?

 MR. JAFFER: It does, Justice Scalia. I 

16 mean you -- you are right that there is a court that in 

17 some sense stands between plaintiffs and the future 

18 injury that they -- that they fear. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: With the obligation to 

apply the Fourth Amendment. 

21  MR. JAFFER: I don't think it's that simple. 

22 The -- the -- the court, the FISA court, is tasked with 

23 assessing the reasonableness of targeting and 

24 minimization procedures. But the statute itself 

forecloses the court from imposing the kinds of limits 

31
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 that plaintiffs think the Fourth Amendment requires. So 

2 for example, the statute itself in section (g)(4) says 

3 that the government is not required to identify the 

4 facilities to be monitored. And the statute itself in 

defining targeting procedures defines them to be
 

6 procedures intended to ensure that the targets are
 

7 outside the United States.
 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But if as you say those
 

9 procedures violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't
 

matter what the statute says. 

11  MR. JAFFER: Well, the Court would have 

12 to --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: If those statutory 

14 provisions would produce a violation of the Fourth 

Amendment, they are null and void, right? 

16  MR. JAFFER: Well, I think that's right. 

17 The -- the court --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the FISA Court 

19 would presumably know that.

 MR. JAFFER: Well, I think if that had 

21 happened over the last 4 years, the government wouldn't 

22 be seeking reauthorization of the statute now. But even 

23 apart from that --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jaffer, could you be 

clear on the expanded authority under the FAA? As I 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a 

2 target was identified and FISA decided whether there 

3 was -- the court decided whether there was probable 

4 cause. Under this new statute, the government doesn't 

say who the particular person or the particular 

6 location. So, there isn't that check. There isn't that 

7 check. 

8  MR. JAFFER: That's absolutely right, 

9 Justice Ginsburg. There -- the whole point of the 

statute was to remove those tests, to remove the 

11 probable cause requirement, and to remove the facility 

12 of requirement, the requirement that the government 

13 identify to the court the facilities to be monitored. 

14 So those are gone.

 That's why we use the phrase "dragnet 

16 surveillance." I know the government doesn't accept 

17 that label, but it concedes that the statute allows what 

18 it calls categorical surveillance, which -- which --

19 which is essentially the surveillance the plaintiffs 

here are concerned about. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you address --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: If we accept the -- if we 

23 assume for the sake of argument that "certainly 

24 impending" is the, the general standard, if we accepted 

your other argument, that the plaintiffs have standing 

33

Official 

1 because they took preventative measures, wouldn't that 

2 undermine completely the -- the "certainly impending" 

3 standard? You have a person who is in a situation where 

4 there is a certain risk, a certain degree of risk of --

of the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's 

6 not certainly impending. So then the person simply 

7 takes some preventative measures, and acquires standing 

8 that wouldn't otherwise be present. 

9  MR. JAFFER: I don't think it would 

undermine the -- the future injuries standard, Your 

11 Honor, for a couple of different reasons. The first is 

12 that "fairly traceable," which is the standard that the 

13 Court has used when there is an actual injury, is a 

14 standard that does real work.

 So if plaintiffs, for example, were acting 

16 unreasonably in taking the measures they are taking, if 

17 plaintiffs were gratuitously buying flight tickets, they 

18 couldn't create standing out of nothing. It would have 

19 to be a reasonable reaction to the risk.

 But the other thing is, and this is just to 

21 go back to sort of the -- the basic standing --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, before we go 

23 further. A reasonable reaction to the risk; but it 

24 doesn't have to be a reasonable reaction to a certainly 

impending risk, does it?

25

Official 

1  MR. JAFFER: You are right, Justice Scalia. 

2 It doesn't, on -- on our theory. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's his question. 

4 Doesn't it undermine the certainly impending?

 MR. JAFFER: And the only point I was trying 

6 to make is that if there is a distance between these two 

7 standards, it's a -- it's a pretty narrow distance. But 

8 the other point I want to make is just that the 

9 reason -- to the extent the Court has imposed a higher 

standard for cases involving only future injury -- and 

11 again, we don't concede that the Court has imposed a 

12 higher standard, but to the extent it has, it has done 

13 so because it wants to assure itself that the future 

14 injury is sufficiently concrete to warrant the Court's 

intervention. 

16  But if there's an actual injury, the Court 

17 is assured of concreteness. The actualness of the 

18 injury makes the case concrete on its own. And so I 

19 think that the standards do different work. I don't 

think it's a question of an end-run around the imminent 

21 standard. It's a question of the Court assuring itself 

22 that there is a concrete case before it. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me 

24 that your -- the government's strongest argument goes 

something like this -- and I don't think that they would

Official 

1 say it in these words, but you have some clients where 

2 it actually does seem completely reasonable that they 

3 would take precautions, that they would not get on the 

4 phone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way 

that any old person would. 

6  But just -- those clients, these lawyers of 

7 terrorists, essentially shouldn't be using that e-mail 

8 or getting on the phone anyway. Even before the FAA was 

9 passed, they would have been wise and, indeed, maybe 

ethically required to use precautions. 

11  So what does the FAA do? I guess this is a 

12 point about redressability, it's a point about --

13  MR. JAFFER: Right. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- causation, but that seems 

to me the strongest of the government's arguments. 

16  MR. JAFFER: Well, Justice Kagan, this is 

17 something that the declarations address specifically, 

18 the distinction between the burden imposed by FISA, 

19 traditional FISA, and the -- the burden imposed by the 

new statute. 

21  And it's true that the old -- under the old 

22 statute, plaintiffs were required to take precautions 

23 with respect to a subset of their communications. And 

24 they acknowledge that in their declarations.

 But the new statute reaches whole categories

1 of people who couldn't have been reached under FISA. 

2 FISA had a probable cause requirement. It had to be a 

3 foreign agent on one end of the phone. And so when one 

4 of the lawyers in this case was talking to somebody who 

they thought the government might believe to be a 

6 foreign agent, they took those precautions even before. 

7  But now they have to take those 

8 precautions -- some of which are very costly -- they 

9 have to take those precautions with respect to people 

who are, for example, witnesses overseas, of journalists 

11 overseas or human rights researchers overseas. As Scott 

12 McKay says in his declaration, with respect to every 

13 single international communication, I have to make an 

14 assessment of the risk that the government --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have specifics in the 

16 affidavits of things that your clients would have done 

17 previously that they cannot do now? 

18  MR. JAFFER: Yes, Your Honor. So, for 

19 example -- well, I'm not sure that this goes directly to 

your question, but in the McKay affidavit, as well as in 

21 the Sylvia Royce affidavit -- Sylvia Royce is another 

22 one of the attorney plaintiffs in this case -- both of 

23 those Plaintiffs discuss the additional burden of the 

24 FAA. They talk about measures that they are taking 

because of the FAA specifically. And they mention the

2 could not reasonably be thought to be foreign agents. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What other measures 

4 besides having to travel to have conversations?

 MR. JAFFER: I think it's a spectrum, 

6 Justice Ginsburg. It begins with just being more 

7 circumspect on the telephone, and it goes to, for 

8 example, talking in generalities rather than specifics. 

9  Let me see if I can give you actual 

citations for these. So -- so -- so, the Plaintiffs 

11 have in some cases been deterred from communicating over 

12 e-mail or the phone. Chris Hedges discusses that at 

13 366a of the appendix; Scott McKay discusses it at 371a. 

14  In some instances, the Plaintiffs have 

talked in generalities rather than specifics. Sylvia 

16 Royce at 352a. 

17  In some instances, it has even required 

18 Plaintiffs to travel overseas to gather information that 

19 they might otherwise --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the travel overseas 

21 I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount 

22 attached to it. 

23  MR. JAFFER: Right. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But these others -- these 

other precautions, being more circumspect in their

1 questions, talking in generalities --

2  MR. JAFFER: There is no dollar cost, 

3 Justice Ginsburg --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. JAFFER: -- but there is a professional 

6 cost. And I don't think it's -- it shouldn't be hard to 

7 understand the professional cost. If a lawyer is --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you go back to being 

9 a little bit more specific on this?  I think I got it.

 There is a class of people that they would 

11 have spoken to on the phone or e-mailed before because 

12 they didn't think they would be covered by other 

13 surveillance measures --

14  MR. JAFFER: That's right, 

Justice Sotomayor. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that were in effect 

17 before this Act? 

18  MR. JAFFER: That's right. The --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you talk about what 

kinds of people those are? Because if the targets are 

21 always terrorists --

22  MR. JAFFER: Right. No. Right. Under this 

23 statute, there's no requirement that the target be a 

24 terrorist or a foreign agent, right?

8 journalist in Afghanistan about the detention of one of 

9 her prisoners at Bagram Air Base, that is a conversation 

that could not plausibly have been picked up under FISA, 

11 but it's a conversation that could be picked up under 

12 the FAA. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it seems to 

14 me that the concern you're talking about is present in 

every area of practice. If you're representing someone 

16 who is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail 

17 saying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where 

18 you threw the gun, and we've got to be prepared to 

19 answer questions on that because, as you know, that's a 

real probable. 

21  I mean, you don't send messages like that 

22 through the e-mails or just talk casually over the phone 

23 either. 

24  MR. JAFFER: I think that's -- that's right, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that, to some extent, this exists in

1 every area of practice. 

2  But this is a statute that is focused on 

3 gathering foreign intelligence information, and our 

4 clients include lawyers who represent defendants charged 

with foreign intelligence-related crimes. 

6  And this statute, I think for good reason, 

7 makes them especially concerned about the communications 

8 they are engaged in with people overseas who couldn't 

9 have been covered under FISA, but who are covered under 

this statute. 

11  If I could just address --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back to a 

13 question that Justice Breyer asked, where he used the 

14 analogy of a lawyer who is representing someone who is 

alleged to be an organized crime figure. 

16  Suppose you have a case where a lawyer says, 

17 I represent so and so, the government thinks this person 

18 is an organized crime kingpin, I know the government has 

19 a very extensive wiretapping program for people who fall 

into this category, I want to raise -- I want to 

21 challenge the constitutionality of the statute under 

22 which some of this wiretapping occurs. Would that 

23 person have stand -- would that lawyer have standing? 

24  MR. JAFFER: I think so. I think so, 

Justice Alito. I mean, assuming that the lawyer could

1 establish that there was a substantial risk that his 

2 communications would be -- would be monitored, and that 

3 the substantial risk had compelled him to take measures 

4 immediately, I think that lawyer would have standing.

 Whether he would have a claim is a different 

6 question, but I think he would have standing. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know of any case that 

8 holds that? 

9  MR. JAFFER: Well, I think that -- I don't 

think it's a novel proposition. I think that in every 

11 one of -- for example, in a case like Skinner, which was 

12 a challenge to the rules that allowed for blood tests of 

13 railway employees who had been in a -- in accidents, 

14 that was a facial challenge brought to the statute, and 

nobody questioned standing in that case. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: The Federal wiretapping 

17 statute has been around for 40 years. Has there been a 

18 single case that falls into this category that you're 

19 talking about?

 MR. JAFFER: No, but I think that that --

21 that there's a good reason for that, which is under 

22 Title III people who are monitored get notice. There is 

23 a notice provision, a general notice provision. And so 

24 it doesn't -- you know, and people don't have to worry 

that this is going on secretly.

4 Only for prosecutions. And the government has made 

clear that it's not going to -- that the main purpose of 

6 this statute is not to gather evidence for law 

7 enforcement --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I think the -- which I 

9 think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat 

unique, so that what you're worried about most is the 

11 definition of foreign intelligence information, which 

12 defines it to include information with respect to a 

13 foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the 

14 conduct of foreign affairs. It's very general.

 MR. JAFFER: That --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: And then, the 

17 Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent 

18 circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going 

19 to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary 

wiretapping. 

21  Now, you say, look, if there is any special 

22 group that's going to apply to, that is the group that 

23 they wiretapped 10,000 times when they didn't even have 

24 that authority. And the government is saying, maybe, 

maybe not. And there, we have an argument.

these are the most likely people to be harmed and there 

6 is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to 

7 think it will be used for them, that the government --

asking for, if the government were to walk into court

22 plaintiffs will never be monitored under this statute, I

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the plaintiffs 

3 aren't going to be monitored under the statute. Other 

4 people are, and your concern is collateral, that the 

plaintiffs' discussions might be picked up. But the
 

6 plaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.
 

7  MR. JAFFER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
 

8 don't think that's exactly right. I know that the
 

9 statute says that the government has to target people
 

abroad, but in targeting people abroad the government is 

11 collecting plaintiffs' communications. So, you know, 

12 this isn't a situation where plaintiffs are entirely --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I'm 

14 saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the 

government could come in and say: We're not going to 

16 monitor these people. Under the statute, you can say 

17 that today. The question is whether or not your 

18 clients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental 

19 way.

 MR. JAFFER: Right. I -- I guess I'm 

21 disagreeing with the word "incidental." It's -- the 

22 whole point of this statute was to allow the government 

23 to collect Americans' international communications. 

24 The -- the executive officials threatened a presidential 

veto when it was proposed that Americans' communications

Official 

1 should be segregated in some way, that in the district 

2 court the government was very upfront about this, that 

3 the statute's whole purpose was to regulate the -- the 

4 surveillance of Americans' international communications.

 So there is a sense in which Americans --

6 the surveillance of Americans is incidental, but it's
 

7 a --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't what you just
 

9 suggested as a way of resolving this case rather
 

bizarre? Someone who is -- whom the government believes 

11 to be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country 

12 can stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an 

13 American lawyer and then having the American lawyer come 

14 into court and say -- you know, challenge the 

constitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the 

16 case would be for the government to go into court and 

17 say: Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to 

18 target this -- this person whom we believe to be a great 

19 security threat?

 MR. JAFFER: I -- I didn't mean to suggest 

21 something like that, Justice Alito. You know, 

22 ultimately, the authority that the government has 

23 claimed under this statute is what requires the 

24 plaintiffs to take the measures that they're taking. 

And I suppose that if all the government were to do at

1 this point is to say secretly to a judge, "We're not 

2 actually going to use this against plaintiffs," 

3 plaintiffs would have to take the same measures they're 

4 taking right now. And they would be injured in exactly 

the same way. What --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To that point, you're 

7 conceding the government's position that -- on 

8 redressability? 

9  MR. JAFFER: No, not at all, Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That even if they 

11 promise you they weren't going to intercept you under 

12 this statute, that you would still take the same 

13 measures? 

14  MR. JAFFER: No, no, I wasn't talking about 

the other programs. I was just saying that plaintiffs' 

16 injuries flow from the authority that they're -- that 

17 they're claiming under the statute. And if the 

18 government were to have a secret -- you know, if there 

19 were some sort of secret government memo that said 

plaintiffs will not in fact be surveilled, their 

21 communications won't be picked up, if plaintiffs don't 

22 know about that change to the government's authority, 

23 they're going to have to take the same measures that 

24 they're taking.

Official 

1 your argument, which makes me more nervous than the 

2 other branch. The other branch, they might say 

3 something like: We're supposed to minimize risks of 

4 catching in surveillance Americans and this is what we 

do. And they show that and they say: We go to the FISA 

6 court. Except in these very rare instances where there 

7 are emergencies, da, da, da. 

8  And I guess by that point they might be able 

9 to reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where 

it's the same as virtually anybody else or they might 

11 be -- be showing it's constitutional. That's where I --

12 that's why I ask the question. I'm not certain of where 

13 I am going. 

14  MR. JAFFER: So -- so maybe it's helpful to 

think of the -- the cases involving pre-enforcement 

16 challenges. So you think -- think of a case like 

17 American Book Sellers Association, which we cite on I 

18 think page 55 of our brief, the case in which there's 

19 uncertainty about how the government is going to 

implement the authority. Nobody knows whether this 

21 particular plaintiff is going to be prosecuted. In 

22 fact, in that case nobody knew whether anybody would be 

23 prosecuted. But the authority was out there and the 

24 fact that the authority was out there, the government 

hadn't disclaimed it, plaintiffs were required to take

Official 

1 immediate measures to conform their behavior to the 

2 statute, and plaintiffs -- some of the injury there 

3 related to the kind of self-censorship that the Court 

4 has always been especially concerned about in First 

Amendment cases. 

6  All of those things led the Court to find 

7 that plaintiffs had standing to bring a pre-enforcement 

8 challenge. And the kind of uncertainty that the 

9 government says is present here, uncertainty about how 

the government will actually implement the statute is 

11 the same kind of uncertainty that is present in every 

12 single pre-enforcement challenge. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart 

14 from the government's power that you point out to 

conduct some of this surveillance without approval by 

16 the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year, 

17 leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your 

18 challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this 

19 statute can be characterized as a facial challenge, 

because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will 

21 mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment 

22 violation, doesn't it? 

23  MR. JAFFER: I don't think that's so, 

24 Justice Scalia. Our concern is not -- not that -- that 

the FISA court will make mistakes, although it well

1 might. The concern -- the main concern is that the 

2 reasonableness inquiry that the FISA court engages in is 

3 a narrowly cabined one.  They court can't say this is 

4 unreasonable because you haven't identified the 

facilities. They can't say this is unreasonable because 

6 you haven't identified a specific target. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it can say it's 

8 unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us. 

9 Don't you think the FISA court is able to say, what 

we're allowed to look into under this statute does not 

11 comport with the Fourth Amendment. 

12  MR. JAFFER: I think in --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: We have to look into more. 

14  MR. JAFFER: Right. I think it's within the 

realm of -- -- of the conceivable that -- that the court 

16 could essentially subvert the statute in that way or 

17 find it unconstitutional, but the government would not 

18 be pressing for reauthorization now, and plaintiffs have 

19 to act on the basis of the authority that is delineated 

in this Federal law. And plaintiffs see that there's a 

21 law that is designed to allow the government to mine 

22 Americans' international communications for foreign 

23 intelligence information. The plaintiffs are people who 

24 report on war zones or they investigate human rights 

abuses in places like Syria and Lebanon and the Yemen

1 and the Sudan, places where the government is likely to 

2 use this power. And plaintiffs include people who 

3 represent defendants who've been charged in -- in --

4 terrorism crime and foreign intelligence-related crimes. 

And so they --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. 

7  MR. JAFFER: In our view, they act entirely 

8 reasonably in taking the measures they're taking and 

9 they are effectively compelled in the same way that the 

plaintiffs in Monsanto, in Laidlaw in -- in -- in 

11 Meese v. Keene were effectively compelled to take the 

12 measures that they -- that they were taking. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jaffer, you mentioned 

14 your journalist clients. Do you have any affidavits or 

anything else in the record to suggest that those 

16 journalists have simply not gotten information from 

17 third parties that they otherwise would have gotten? In 

18 other words, this would not be a question of what 

19 precautions they took and what precautions were 

reasonable. 

21  MR. JAFFER: Right. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: But if you assume that 

23 information is the lifeblood of journalism, that their 

24 sources and their information has dried up as a result 

of this statute.

1  MR. JAFFER: Yes, Justice Kagan. Naomi 

2 Klein's declaration at page 338A addresses that. I 

3 believe that Chris Hedges' declaration addresses it too, 

4 although I don't have a page citation for you. It's 

certainly in the lawyers' affidavits that some third 

6 parties are less willing to share information, Sylvia 

7 Royce, 353A. 

8  So -- so -- so the declarations were filed 

9 early, it was a summary judgment motion, they were filed 

relatively early. So to some extent, they are making 

11 predictions about how third parties will -- will react, 

12 but I think it's an entirely fair prediction to -- to 

13 predict that third parties who believe that the 

14 communications are being surveilled will react in the 

way you just described. And although it's not in the 

16 record, we -- we have spoken to our journalist clients 

17 more recently and they have told us that their 

18 predictions have actually been realized in some cases. 

19  Just to go to -- to -- to address the --

the -- the Monsanto point -- point once more. I mean, I 

21 understand the Court's -- that the Court has to struggle 

22 with the distinction between cases that involve only 

23 future injuries and cases that involve present injuries 

24 as well. I think it's just important to recognize that 

the Court has never found the kinds of present injuries

1 that we are pointing to here to be irrelevant to the
 

2 analysis.
 

3  In Monsanto, in Laidlaw, in Meese, in
 

4 Camreta, the Court looked to -- looked to the present
 

injuries as well as to the likelihood of -- of -- of 

6 future harm. And we are not making an argument that we 

7 are entitled to a lower -- lower standing -- to lower 

8 standing requirements or less stringent requirements 

9 than the Court has applied in other cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But in Monsanto, suppose the 

11 challenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said, 

12 "I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans, 

13 I'm afraid that they're going to start planting 

14 genetically modified soybeans, but they haven't done it 

up to this point, but, you know, this might be something 

16 they will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm 

17 going to have to take precautions." 

18  MR. JAFFER: I think that would be a much 

19 harder case than the one that they've brought. I mean, 

in part because the Plaintiff would presumably know 

21 when -- when the soybeans had been -- had been planted, 

22 and the Plaintiff would then have an opportunity to come 

23 into court. 

24  And it would be hard to -- to establish, I 

think, a substantial risk in those circumstances where

1 the Plaintiff couldn't point to any evidence that --

2 that any action had been taken towards the 

3 implementation of this policy that -- that he feared. 

4  But in our case, again, the government has 

conceded that the statute is being used. It's 

6 conceded -- or it's acknowledged that the statute has 

7 been used to collect Americans' communications. 

8  It's true that we don't know that our 

9 Plaintiffs specifically have been monitored, and we will 

never know that. But that kind of uncertainty was --

11 was present in Monsanto and in --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe it's a 

13 difference in how we're using the word monitor. You do 

14 know that your Plaintiffs have not been monitored.

17 don't -- well, others have been monitored abroad, right? 

18  MR. JAFFER: I don't --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not monitored 

in the sense that this is the person's e-mail, and 

21 that's what we're going to collect information from, 

22 right? 

23  MR. JAFFER: Well, what -- what happens is 

24 that the government identifies some category of targets 

abroad. In the course of collecting --

2  MR. JAFFER: -- those targets' 

3 communications, they collect Americans' international 

4 communications. And when they're collecting Americans' 

international communications, they are monitoring those 

6 communications. 

7  The statute allows the government to acquire 

8 them, to retain them, to disseminate them. It 

9 requires -- even if it's not foreign intelligence 

information, which is, as Justice Breyer says --

11 recognized, is defined very broadly -- the statute 

12 allows the government to disseminate that information, 

13 just redacting the Americans' name. 

14  The statute also allows the government to --

to retain evidence of criminal activity. And for 

16 criminal defense lawyers, that's -- that's a -- it's a 

17 real issue. 

18  So you're right that -- that our 

19 communications are not being targeted, but they are 

being monitored.

1  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, 

3 Mr. Chief Justice. 

4  Two specific points and then three broader 

points. 

6  First, Justice Kagan, with respect to the 

7 Naomi Klein declaration, what it says on page 338a is, 

8 "Some of my sources will decline to share information 

9 with me if they believe that their communications are 

being monitored by the United States." 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: That's a fair point, 

12 General. What if it said something different? What if 

13 she said -- what if there were even an affidavit from 

14 the source saying, "I have stopped talking with this 

journalist because of the FAA and because of my fear 

16 that my communications will be intercepted"? 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think you'd still have 

18 the problem of speculation there. 

19  And if I could, Justice Breyer, go to your 

proposed solution. I don't think it's a solution. I 

21 think it's a mechanism for people who think they may be 

22 under surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they 

23 may be under surveillance, to find out whether they are 

24 or not. I -- I just don't think that's a workable 

solution at all.

Official 

1  Now, three broader points, if I may. 

2  First, the -- in every case in which the 

3 Court has found standing, every one on which the 

4 Respondents rely, the government conduct either happened 

or was certain to happen. 

6  In Meese against Keene, the films had been 

7 labeled as political propaganda. It wasn't a question 

8 about how authority to do so would be exercised. In 

9 Laidlaw, the permit had issued, and the pollution was in 

the water. There wasn't speculation about that. 

11  Monsanto, we already talked about; the 

12 government action was certain. That's true in every 

13 case. 

14  And Summers drew a distinction with those 

cases because, in Summers, there was no example of a 

16 concrete application of the authority. 

17  Second, their -- the fact that some of their 

18 clients may take steps that incur costs doesn't change 

19 the injury. It's still speculative. It's the kind of 

subjective chill that Laird said was -- was not 

21 sufficient to establish standing. 

22  And I think, if you take a step back, 

23 think -- ask -- think about what they're asking you to 

24 do. They are asking you to invalidate a vitally 

important national security statute based not on a 

57

1 concrete application --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: No, General Verrilli, this 

3 is not about the merits of the statute. They might have 

4 no claim on the merits at all, and so there would be no 

question of invalidation. The question is only: Can 

6 they make their argument to a court? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: But the whole point, 

8 Justice Kagan, the basic, most fundamental point about 

9 the case or controversy requirement and the 

injury-in-fact requirement that is embedded in it is to 

11 preserve the separation of powers. 

12  They are asking the Court to consider 

13 invalidating the statute based on an assumption either 

14 that there is dragnet surveillance or an assumption 

that their clients are going to be put under 

16 surveillance, without a single fact to substantiate 

17 either of those assumptions. 

18  I submit to the Court that it would be --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which they can never, 

never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there 

21 could be a person in this category who would know, but 

22 the person will never know. 

23  You did mention minimization procedures as 

24 one safeguard against abuse. What are the minimum --

what -- what minimization standards are taken that will

1 protect plaintiffs in this class? 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: It's a little bit hard to 

3 talk about, Your Honor, because, to the extent we're 

4 talking about the process of acquiring foreign 

intelligence, that's a very sensitive intelligence 

6 method; and, to the extent minimization plays into that, 

7 it's -- it's not public information. 

8  But there are some steps that are publicly 

9 known, and they are, for example, that information 

acquired can be retained only for certain limited 

11 periods of time; that whenever -- when reports are done 

12 on information, that the names of U.S. persons or 

13 corporations are redacted. There are other restrictions 

14 on the ability to use the information. So there are 

steps of that nature. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there restrictions on 

17 giving the information to other government agencies, in
