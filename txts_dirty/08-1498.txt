P R O C E E D I N G S 

(10:09 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1498, 

Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project and the 

cross-petition. 

Mr. Cole. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE 

ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL. 

MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This as-applied challenge asks whether the 

government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the 

Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with 

the Kurdistan Workers Party. Specifically, they seek to 

advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to 

write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish 

rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human 

rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful 

conflict resolution. It is undisputed that the 

Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of 

lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support 

only lawful ends. 

The government has a concededly compelling 

interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even

tried to defend these prohibitions under strict 

scrutiny. Instead, it rests its entire case on the 

proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a 

regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be 

upheld under O'Brien. 

That view is mistaken for two fundamental 

reasons. First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien 

is inapplicable where the government prohibits pure 

speech --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Cole, don't you 

agree that some of the speech could be regulated? 

MR. COLE: Some of my clients’ speech? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Some of the speech of your 

client. 

MR. COLE: I don't think -- I don't think 

any of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless the 

government can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that this 

Court applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure 

speech. So, no, I don't -- I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think all of the speech at 

issue is protected? 

MR. COLE: I think that certainly all of the 

speech that I've just identified, which is the core --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You identified quite a 

bit.

MR. COLE: Right. Yes. It’s core -- and 

I think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political 

speech on issues of public concern. It is advocating 

only lawful, peaceable activities. This Court has never 

upheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech on 

issues of public concern. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could the 

government, I assume -- I assume you will say "yes" --

could the government forbid any NGO or other 

organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of 

these organizations, from giving them money? 

MR. COLE: I think money is different, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they -- could the 

government prohibit that? 

MR. COLE: I think money is different 

because it's -- it's conduct, not speech. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Let's assume the 

government could prohibit that. Then the next question 

is: Could the government prohibit speech instructing 

the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid? 

MR. COLE: Right. And I think -- - I think, 

Your Honor, that the answer is no, for the -- unless the 

government can meet the higher standard of scrutiny that 

applies when you’re regulating speech.

MR. COLE: Well, I don't know whether it 

would necessarily be Brandenburg. I think for -- in 

order to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor, 

all the Court has to find is that when the speech 

advocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the 

sort advocated here, that's not sufficient. I think 

specific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard, 

which is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you get 

tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for 

terrorist money. So why can't the government forbid 

teaching how to get that money? 

MR. COLE: Well, again, Your Honor, that --

if the government -- if the connection between the 

speech and the government's concern were sufficiently 

close, then maybe it could. But the problem --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't there 

be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what's the test? 

Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg? 

MR. COLE: I think the test is whether the 

-- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think the 

test is whether the speech has been provided with 

specific intent or knowledge that it will further

unlawful, terrorist ends of the group. 

CHIEF JUSTICE: What if it goes --

JUSTICE ALITO: And that applies --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it goes to 

the mere existence of a group? Let's say you have the 

Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on 

some purely mundane issue. The Nazis have a hospital, 

and you are giving them advice on how to run a 

hospital, but the government decides that anything that 

legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that 

group's terrorist activities. Can the government make 

that kind of determination? 

I'm thinking of something like Regan v. 

Wald --

MR. COLE: Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where they say, 

look, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want to 

do anything that legitimizes the regime. 

MR. COLE: Right. Well, two answers. 

Does your question refer to the Nazi Party 

today or the Nazi Party during World War II? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I meant during 

World War II. 

MR. COLE: Okay.

an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of 

the issue today. 

MR. COLE: Right, right. So I think -- the 

reason I ask, Your Honor, is that it may make a 

difference if we are at war. The law of treason 

prohibits aid --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I didn't -- my 

hypothetical was confusing. I didn't mean to suggest we 

were at war. 

MR. COLE: Okay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I meant to hypothesize 

a group that the government could reasonably determine 

should not be supported in any way --

MR. COLE: Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because it 

legitimizes it. It's going to make their hospital run 

better. People are going to like their hospital. So 

the party, the group, will be legitimized. 

MR. COLE: Right. Well, I think all the 

Court held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible 

for the government to regulate conduct -- not speech --

travel, and economic transactions, not speech. Those 

were essentially O'Brien cases. 

And, in fact, in Regan the Court 

distinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the

board from a prohibition directed at a group, the 

Communist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where 

the Court held that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can't travel 

there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can 

meet with and discuss lawful activities with people 

there. If you can't get there, you can't speak. 

MR. COLE: That's right, Your Honor. But 

that -- but that's essentially an O'Brien situation. 

The prohibition is on a conduct, whether it's 

draft card burning or travel. The individual who seeks 

to engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for 

speech purposes. But the Court says the government has 

a freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and, 

therefore, as long as you’re regulating the 

non-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply 

O'Brien. But what this Court has said is that when --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the government 

stop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists? 

MR. COLE: From meeting? No, I don't think 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just meeting, traveling 

to one of these countries to actually do your teaching 

to a terrorist -- let's say the law said you're 

prohibited from traveling to meet any of these

individuals. How would that be different than the Cuba 

situation? 

MR. COLE: Well, then, if it's -- if it's 

traveling for the purpose of association, then it would 

be targeted at association, not at the conduct of 

travel. The whole --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's no different 

than the Cuba situation. 

MR. COLE: No, but the whole point of the 

Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this 

Court said, it was an across-the-board ban. It did not 

apply to different political groups. It applied to 

anyone who sought to travel to Cuba. And it was about 

travel. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it's a ban 

just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, 

Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical. 

MR. COLE: Right. Well, then I think -- I 

think that's -- that’s different from this case, right, 

because this case -- suppose it's a ban on speech 

wherever it occurs. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the -- what 

about the hypothetical? 

MR. COLE: Right. Well, with respect to the 

hypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be

whether the government's interest in banning that travel 

is unrelated to the associational or speech purposes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's what the Chief 

Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will 

inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we 

have a governmental interest in not allowing that. 

MR. COLE: There's no -- there’s no dispute, 

Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest 

in cutting off aid to terrorism. The question is whether 

it can do so by criminalizing pure speech. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it hasn't criminalized 

speech. It has criminalized providing aid and 

assistance to these organizations. Most of that aid and 

assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of 

speech, but it happens to include speech as well. 

MR. COLE: Right, but, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that’s quite 

different from a law that is directed explicitly at 

speech. 

MR. COLE: Well, I don’t -- I think it's not 

in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia. Imagine a 

statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States 

Government. And it had three provisions: One, you can't 

assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and 

weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;

three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government. 

If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy, 

we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the right --

that's not the right number three. The right number 

three is you cannot advise and assist an organization 

that is seeking to overthrow the government. That's 

what is at issue here, not --

MR. COLE: Well, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not independently promoting 

the objectives of these terrorist organizations. Your --

your clients are free to do that. 

MR. COLE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But when they assist 

the organization by providing advice, that's a different 

matter. 

MR. COLE: Well, the government says if 

they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group, 

they -- and they’re providing a benefit to the government, 

that's prohibited. So, for example --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. When they provide a 

benefit, right? 

MR. COLE: So, for example, under that view, 

the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times, 

all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons --

sort of support, right? President Carter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No, no. I thought 

that he was -- he wants to meet with the people. The 

New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how 

great their editorial was. 

MR. COLE: No, but it's not about -- it's 

not about whether you meet with them. It's about 

whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly 

coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and

accepting and then publishing his editorial. That is --

that would be providing a service. It would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what 

"coordinating" means, doesn't it? And we can determine 

that in the next case. 

MR. COLE: Well, let me -- let me also 

answer it this way, Justice Scalia: If you look at the 

specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it 

includes writing and distributing literature in 

conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the 

United States advocating their support. How is that 

different from the New York Times? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Supposing that -- what you 

say is you want to engage in political advocacy on 

behalf of the Kurds. That's your words. All right. 

Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals. Hypothetical 

one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, 

know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to 

pretend they're a political advocacy organization, 

but to go around shooting the people who don't agree 

with them. Okay? Case one, the hypothetical defendant 

knows it. In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true. 

MR. COLE: Well, I think -- I think if 

you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid 

will further the group in its terrorist activities, then

it's not protected speech. But if you're -- if you 

don't know that and you don't intend that, and in this 

case --

JUSTICE ALITO: And that goes for all forms of 

training? No form of training or expert assistance can 

be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends 

to further -- that the training will be used to carry 

out terrorist activities? 

MR. COLE: Well, Justice Alito, this is an 

as-applied challenge. So the question simply is whether 

training in what international human rights consist of, 

in how to advocate for international human rights, and 

how to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies. 

That's the speech that's at issue here. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just out of curiosity, 

I thought your position was that no form of training or 

assistance could be prohibited -- -

MR. COLE: No, I was just --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- consistent with the First 

Amendment. That's not your position? 

MR. COLE: No. I think -- I think, again, 

it depends upon the form of speech. There may be some forms 

of training that are so closely connected to the -- to 

the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to 

proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in

military exercises. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The end that Congress seeks 

to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist 

organizations. And the theory of the legislation is 

that when you aid any of their enterprises you’re 

aiding the organization. Hamas, for example, gained 

support among -- among the Palestinians by activities 

that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, 

all sorts of things. 

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is what fosters the 

terrorist organization and enables the terrorist 

activities. Why isn't that a reasonable connection? 

Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot 

be separated from assistance to their terrorist 

activities. 

MR. COLE: Right. Well, Your Honor, 

that is precisely the argument that the United States 

made to this Court in Scales. And here I’m quoting 

from the government's brief: "Active membership can be 

proscribed even though the activity be expended along 

lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any 

kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal 

purposes." 

That was with respect to an organization

that Congress spent 10 years studying, made findings 

that it was an international conspiracy directed and 

controlled by the Soviet Union with the aim of 

overthrowing the United States by force and violence, 

using terrorism. And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales 

held you've got to distinguish between that aid and 

support and membership which is furthering the lawful 

activities and that which is furthering the illegal 

activities; otherwise you are penalizing the exercise of 

lawful speech. The Court said the same thing in De 

Jonge. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cole, as I remember, 

Scales upheld a conviction, wasn’t --

MR. COLE: It did, Justice Ginsburg, but 

only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be 

limited to specific -- to members -- active membership 

that is specifically intended to further the illegal 

ends of the group, precisely --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it didn’t -- it was not 

a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible 

support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a 

difficult case for me. And the second paragraph, page 

17, you say: "The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in 

this Court means that the case does not involve the 

propriety of banning financial or other tangible

support." 

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you say: "Nor does it 

involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent 

activity." 

But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, 

that is tantamount to material support. 

MR. COLE: Well, I -- right, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the speech is 

tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, 

encourages, or strengthens the organization. 

MR. COLE: Well, two things in response to 

that, Justice Kennedy. First, that is what the United 

States argued in Scales. And, again, the Court, not only 

in Scales but in a host of cases striking down 

Communist Party statute, said you have to distinguish 

between aid that’s intended to further lawful activity 

and aid that’s intended to further illegal activity 

when it's in the form of protected activity --

association, here speech and association. 

And, secondly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In those cases, the real 

question was whether membership was enough, wasn’t it? 

MR. COLE: Active membership --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is support. It's 

different. 

MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge, 

one of these cases, one of this Court's first First 

Amendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jonge 

aided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by 

conducting a meeting for them and being their lead 

speaker at the meeting. And this Court said: We've got 

to look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the 

meeting; yes, he was a member of the Communist Party; 

yes, he solicited people to join the Communist Party. 

But what did he do? He advocated lawful peaceable 

activities. And this Court said --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there wasn't a statute 

on the books that prohibited material support --

MR. COLE: Well, I don't think it would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here there is, and this 

is in aid of that prohibition. 

MR. COLE: Right, but Your Honor, what would 

-- if Congress came along after the Communist Party cases 

and said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime to 

criminalize membership in the Communist Party; we are 

now going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction

with the Communist Party -- do you think the 

decisions would have come out any differently? 

I don't think so, because this Court has said that 

speech is different from money, that it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very 

unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations 

with the Communist Party. Those cases involved 

philosophy. The Communist Party was -- was -- was more 

than a -- than an organization that -- that had some 

unlawful ends. It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of 

extreme socialism. And -- and many people subscribed to 

that philosophy. 

I don't think that Hamas or any of these 

terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical 

organization. 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, this -- this Court 

accepted Congress's findings. Congress's findings were 

not that this was a philosophical debating society, but 

that it was an international criminal conspiracy 

directed by our enemy to overthrow us through terrorism. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be, but people 

joined it for philosophical reasons. 

MR. COLE: Oh, sure --

philosophical reasons. These terrorist organizations

joining them or assisting them is to assist those

MR. COLE: Well, I don't think that's -- I 

don't think that's fair, Justice Scalia. The 

Humanitarian Law Project has no interest in furthering 

terrorism, but the Kurdistan Workers Party are the 

principal representatives of the -- of the Kurds in 

Turkey. They do have an interest in protecting the 

rights of the Kurds. They do have an interest in 

encouraging the Kurdistan Workers Party to -- to disavow 

violence and engage in lawful peaceful means of 

resolving their disputes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cole --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cole, would you 

distinguish -- I think this came up in the court of 

appeals. There are a lot of groups on the list. I 

think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned, 

and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that 

if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect 

to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would 

be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda, 

and I’ll throw in the Taliban.

suppose the group is not the two that we have here --

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but Al-Qaeda and 

the Taliban? 

MR. COLE: Right. What we said, for the 

record, is that it would pose a very different 

constitutional question. And I think there are two 

reasons why it might pose a different constitutional 

question. One is -- and that was -- I’m picking up on my 

question back to Mr. Chief Justice, is it during wartime 

or not? And during wartime, Congress has broader powers 

pursuant to the treason --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I want to be sure I 

understand that point. You think the issue in this case 

would be different if we were at war? 

MR. COLE: I think it might be different if 

we were at war with these groups. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if that's true, why 

aren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition to 

these organizations?

MR. COLE: Well -- well, two things, Your 

Honor. With respect to -- it might be different if 

you -- if you’re talking about treason. Tokyo Rose, 

for example, was engaged in speech, but she was doing so 

with -- with the purpose of aiding the enemy and the 

specific intent of betraying the United States. And 

that's what's required. And what the Supreme Court has 

said is that the -- the aid has to be to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question that I 

want to be sure you are focusing on --

MR. COLE: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS -- but in the issues in this 

very case --

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would they be different 

if we were now at war? 

MR. COLE: I think it would depend, Your 

Honor, because the -- what -- what treason requires is 

aid to the enemy, and aid might be in the form of speech. 

But it also requires a specific intent to betray the 

United States. And when you aid someone with whom we 

are at war, there is an -- there may well be an intent 

to betray the United States. There is no betrayal of 

the United States here.

to one of our allies? And we’re seeking to gain the 

assistance of these allies against those terrorists who 

aim their terrorism at us, and yet --

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we -- we are supposed to 

allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations 

that are directing their violence against them? 

MR. COLE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a 

sufficiently serious reason for the government to do 

what it's done here? 

MR. COLE: I think the question, Your Honor, 

is there -- is there any realistic nexus between writing 

an op-ed, advocating before Congress, urging a group to 

use lawful nonviolent means to resolve its disputes, and 

killing Americans? And there just isn't. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've 

picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy 

for you. What about personnel? Is there a connection 

between providing personnel that participate in legal 

activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the 

organization can then say, well, because you are

providing this personnel, we can take them out and shift 

them to bombmaking? 

MR. COLE: Right. And -- and -- and I guess 

my answer to that would be it would depend upon whether 

the -- the -- what is being prohibited is speech. If 

what is being prohibited is speech, I'm not sure that it 

would be permissible for the government to say we’re 

going to criminalize your speech, even though it’s 

advocating lawful activities, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 

things that’s being prohibited here that you challenge 

is providing personnel. 

MR. COLE: That's right. And -- and that's 

exactly what De Jonge was essentially charged with. And 

the Communist Party was, again, found to be engaged in 

criminal activity, to be a criminal syndicate, 

essentially, by the Oregon statute. The Court didn't 

question that. At that time it was illegal to even 

advocate illegal activity. 

He was charged with providing his person, 

personnel, by conducting a meeting under the auspices of 

the Communist Party and providing the lead speech there. 

And the Court said, even though the argument was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your 

argument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or

does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the --

if there are any, Hamas hospitals? 

MR. COLE: Right. Our argument, Your Honor, 

is -- again, this is an as-applied challenge with respect to 

the particular speech that our clients seek to engage in, 

so it would not -- it would not require the Court to 

decide whether any nonspeech assistance could be 

proscribed. In fact --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When -- but the way you 

define the speech that you want protected is speech that 

is advocating some lawful activity. 

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what’s unlawful 

about teaching people medicine and how to cure people 

from infection? 

MR. COLE: If -- if that were what they were 

doing, Your Honor, if it was teaching, then it would be 

protected by the First Amendment. But if -- I took 

Chief Justice Roberts's question --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you see no 

difference -- you’re not advocating a difference in 

this case between training that could reasonably be used 

in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to 

care for the ill could be used to teach people how to 

care for the wounded.

It regulates speech because of what it conveys.

any difference in the nature of the speech, that it's --

this is an as-applied challenge. 

MR. COLE: Yes. Exactly. And that's --

here, I think the connection between the government’s --

framework to address that question. 

MR. COLE: All right. Well, I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government says 

under O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forget 

about the tsunami aid speech. Let's just talk about the 

political petitioning speech, the petitioning for --

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a difference 

and under what analytical framework would we reach it? 

MR. COLE: Well, I think the question -- the 

question at the -- at the -- at the bottom would be 

whether there is a sufficient connection between the 

speech which is being expressed and the government's 

compelling interest. And if -- certainly there would be 

if it's -- meets Brandenburg. I think there might be if 

it is specifically intended or known that it will further 

terrorist activity. But where -- with respect to our

enjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something 

happens. And the reason is then we have specific facts.

this is not really -- we usually talk about as-applied

with the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. This Court has

principle this Court established with respect to the

right of the people peaceably to assemble? Now, mind 

you, I understand this is the right of U.S. citizens in

What the statute does is to prohibit Petitioners from 

giving support to foreign terrorist organizations in 

their ability to petition international organizations.

governments or foreign organization has long been 

acknowledged by this Court. It was acknowledged in 

cases like Regan and Zemel and others, not only with 

respect to nations with which we are at war, but with 

respect to foreign nations and other entities as well --

foreign nationals. 

And in fact, the Petitioners' supposed First 

Amendment claims really are not speech claims at all. 

They are all association claims. Petitioners can do 

whatever independent advocacy they wish. What 

Petitioners cannot do is to provide support to a foreign 

terrorist organization. And there, indeed, the 

government's position is that the Association Clause 

does not extend that far to give Americans, American 

citizens, the ability to deal in whatever way they wish 

with foreign nations --

their end.

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, you’re 

exactly right that, in addition to engaging in 

independent advocacy, Petitioners can meet with members 

of the foreign terrorist organizations, can join the 

foreign terrorist organizations, that membership is not 

prohibited by the statute. What the statute does 

prohibit is active support of all kinds, both

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they -- can they

advocacy. You can advocate to the world that they are 

right. Can you advocate to the association that you 

should change your ways, that you should use Lexis to 

find international law precedents, et cetera?

point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy, I want 

first -- I’m going to answer your question, and I’m 

going to say that that's still not covered, but I want 

also to make a general point, which is that this Court 

can exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this 

case, and it will be irrelevant to the case at hand, and 

that would be so for two reasons. 

First, because with respect to overbreadth, 

all of those uncertain or even unconstitutional 

applications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the 

ocean full of completely legitimate applications of this 

statute. And, second, because those hypotheticals have 

nothing to do with this case. 

Mr. Cole said several times, I heard, this 

is an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied 

challenge. And to the extent that the Court thinks that 

there are certain categories of activity that the 

statute could not prohibit that would raise serious 

constitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I 

disagree with, but there may be some. To the extent 

that that's true, the Court can -- can put those off to

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. They want to 

apply. They want to do --

GENERAL KAGAN: I’m sorry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: They say in this case that 

they want to provide training in the issue of 

humanitarian international law, and they want to provide 

training and expert advice and assistance in respect to 

how you petition the UN. 

Now focusing on those two things, and going 

back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the 

government's interest in the following? Under O'Brien 

or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching 

have a First Amendment interest -- training? Yes. And 

what about teaching about advocacy? That's what they 

are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy. 

Yes. Therefore there is a First Amendment interest 

implicated, seriously. 

Now, when that is seriously implicated, 

there is also a government interest, on the other side, 

in not having terrorism. But there is a less 

restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that 

situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as 

saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably 

would believe that their teaching, assistance, 

training, would not significantly aid this organization

in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty. 

Now, what is the government's interest in 

not accepting that interpretation? The First Amendment 

is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they 

describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less 

restrictive way of going about it. And they have to be 

reasonable in what they think. Now, what's the 

objection to that? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I think the 

objection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with 

his hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually 

perfectly aligned with this case. You can't give 

tsunami aid, but the question is: Can you instruct 

these organizations about how to get tsunami aid? 

And then these organizations get tsunami 

aid, and they, in fact, use that aid in such a way that 

they also have more money to --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I’m not 

talking about tsunami aid. I am talking about the 

instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how 

to do something, and that something is the kind of thing 

that the First Amendment protects. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, that something, which 

is the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how 

to petition international bodies in order to get various

kinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will 

strengthen those organizations in everything that they 

do. What Congress decided --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, and if a reasonable 

person would know that, that it's going to help them, 

then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a 

reasonable person would think it was going to help them 

in their unlawful activities. But we're not --

GENERAL KAGAN: Congress was the reasonable 

person here. And Congress reasonably decided that when 

you help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's 

legal activities, you’re also helping the foreign 

terrorist organization's illegal activities. 

Hezbollah builds bombs. Hezbollah also 

builds homes. What Congress decided was when you help 

Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah 

build bombs. That's the entire theory behind this 

statute, and it's a reasonable theory for exactly the 

kinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by 

that hypothetical. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And doesn't that lead to --

kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere 

membership could be prohibited? Could you explain how 

someone could be a member of one of these organizations 

without providing a service to the organization? Simply

by lending one's name as a member -- that might be 

regarded as a service. If you attended a meeting and 

you helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up 

afterwards, you’d be providing a service to the 

organization. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I -- I actually don't 

think -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to 

include that. And I think that the normal words that 

Congress used make that pretty clear. When you think 

about personnel, when you think about training, when you 

think about expert advice and assistance, even when you 

think about service, you -- the notion that I am serving 

a terrorist organization simply by the act of membership 

I think would not be correct. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say Congress 

clearly did not intend that? You know, I would have 

guessed that you are providing a service or personnel 

when you make yourself a member of the organization. 

Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it? 

GENERAL KAGAN: That is certainly not the 

way the government reads the statute, and that's not the 

way the government has ever read the statute. And, 

indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief, 

believes that there are certain kinds of joint 

activities that would be allowed by the statute.

Now, that's not to say that Congress could 

not have gone farther. In this specific context, where 

one is regulating dealings with a foreign organization, 

it's possible that Congress could have gone further. 

But we understand the statute and -- and I think there's 

a -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only 

material support, a true service, something that will 

help the foreign organization in whatever it does. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but petitioning the 

United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them 

-- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something 

that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in 

their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas. 

Now --

GENERAL KAGAN: This would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Congress put a 

thing in here which says: Don't construe this statute 

in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights. So 

it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights. 

GENERAL KAGAN: And I think you are exactly 

right about that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And is there any evidence that 

something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of 

ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?

that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress 

thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and 

legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in 

fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the 

illegal and illegitimate goals. 

Congress made findings about the fungibility 

of these resources. Congress said over and over that 

these organizations have no firewalls, no organizational 

firewalls --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you --

GENERAL KAGAN: -- no financial firewalls. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that the -- not 

only the membership, but they can meet and they can 

discuss. And I don't understand the line between 

meeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing 

things with them, and instructing them on how they can 

pursue their goals through lawful means. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I agree 

with you that there may be some hard cases that are at 

the borderline between the two, as there are in most 

statutes; that there may be hard cases. This is not one 

of them.

show is the extensiveness of the activities that they --

of the services that they wish to offer to these foreign 

terrorist organizations and the value that those 

services are going to give those foreign terrorist 

organizations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, you've 

talked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about 

the legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating 

illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all 

that, and legitimizing the group. 

Is that an argument you've made before this 

Court or below? I looked at your briefs, and I thought 

it's almost all about: This is O'Brien, this is 

conduct, this is not speech. I didn't see the argument 

that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is 

the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate 

activities to take place. 

GENERAL KAGAN: No, I believe we -- we have, 

Mr. Chief Justice, although if we didn't emphasize it 

enough, I -- I will plead error, because I think that it 

is an -- a crucial point to this case. But I think in

GENERAL KAGAN: Yes. In the part of our

standard, and we say what are the governmental interests 

there. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know. It seems 

to me your case is all about O'Brien. I'm not sure you have 

an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is 

satisfied. If we disagree with you and think that some 

of this activity is speech, I don't see the argument 

that you've presented on strict scrutiny. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think that that’s right, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that we have not specifically 

addressed the strict scrutiny argument. I think this 

would pass a strict scrutiny standard, but I actually 

think that to the extent that the Court thought a strict 

scrutiny standard were appropriate, a remand might be in 

order, that no Court has ever actually gone off on that 

ground, that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why is O'Brien the correct 

standard? How can you argue that training and providing 

advice is not speech?

part of a statute which regulates material support and 

resources of all kinds, and to the extent that what 

you're saying is, you know, training and advice, those 

are always speech restrictions if you find them in a 

statute, I think that that's not right. 

I mean, if you think about the range of 

things that training can involve: Training how to 

build a bomb, training how to fly a plane, training how 

to use sophisticated communications equipment, and 

training how to engage --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about training to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's involved 

here -- I think they said that they want to train them 

how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a 

lawful, rather than a terrorist, way. And that is 

speech. It is not conduct. They want to engage in 

advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of 

these groups. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Congress, of course, allowed 

them to engage in all the advocacy that they wish on 

behalf of these groups. Indeed, Congress did not 

prohibit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they want to 

communicate, and you say they can communicate. And I

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think if they are 

engaged in just discussion of ideas, this statute does 

not prohibit that. What the statute prohibits is the 

provision of actual support, services to the 

organizations that the organization can use in its 

activities, both legal and illegal. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you stick with the 

argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus 

brief? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I'm right in 

saying it that that was the argument below. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, I think that would 

be a service. In other words, not an amicus brief just 

to make sure that we understand each other. The 

Petitioners can file amicus briefs in a case that might 

involve the PKK or the LTTE for themselves, but to the 

extent that a lawyer drafts an amicus brief for the PKK 

or for the LTTE, that that's the amicus party, then that 

indeed would be prohibited. That's the kind of 

service that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that 

your opponent's argument here today is prohibited.

Petitioners here are arguing for themselves. What I'm 

suggesting is Petitioners can do all the advocacy they 

want, can engage in courts in any way they wish. The 

only thing that's prohibited is if the PKK hired a 

lawyer to write an amicus brief on its behalf. At that 

point --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I understand, 

I could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents 

go out to the industry and say we need some amicus 

briefs, and they flood in from all sides. Would that be 

illegal? Because the -- the organization --

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, if the PKK --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- came out and said we 

need a brief -- amicus briefs from law professors? 

From --

GENERAL KAGAN: If -- if the PKK or the LTTE 

or Al-Qaeda or any of the other organizations on this 

list said we want amicus briefs, and somebody provided 

an amicus brief --

this statute, teaching these members to play the 

harmonica would be unlawful. You are teaching --

training them in a lawful -- in a specialized activity. 

So how do we -- there has to be something more than 

merely a congressional finding that any training is bad. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think here we have 

the congressional definition of what kind of training 

is bad, and that definition focuses on training in 

specialized activities. Now, you say, well, maybe 

training a -- playing a harmonica is a specialized 

activity. I think the first thing I would say is there 

are not a whole lot of people going around trying to 

teach Al-Qaeda how to play harmonicas.

the word “training” and the word “expert advice and

responses here -- I mean, they -- Congress was both 

responsive and responsible, that it really took into 

account court decisions and tried to go back to the 

statute and --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in that -- on the --

just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried 

about the lawyer. You’re saying that a -- a group abroad 

which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume 

they do -- want to hire a lawyer. And this lawyer is supposed 

to file some amicus briefs and do other activities. You’re 

saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute, 

and that's constitutional? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, first of all, 

Justice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I 

-- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount 

of uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with 

respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect 

to this challenge --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know if that's

Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who 

does legal work like filing amicus briefs. 

GENERAL KAGAN: To the extent that there is 

any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to 

representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or 

a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases, 

that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in 

civil cases, then the government believes that the 

statute should be read so as not to include that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do these hypotheticals 

make any difference? This is an as-applied challenge. 

We should look to the activities that this organization 

wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there 

is an overbreadth problem. And that seems to me -- I'm 

not even sure that the Petitioners assert that here. 

Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this 

statute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of 

speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal. That 

being the case, of what relevance are these 

hypotheticals? It's a lot of fun, and it's very 

interesting, but we can deal with all of that when the 

situations arise, can't we?

intangible.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here's how to do it.

apply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, now you can't, 

because when you tell people here's how to apply for 

aid and here's how to represent yourself within 

international organizations or within the U.S. Congress, 

you've given them an extremely valuable skill that they 

can use for all kinds of purposes, legal or illegal. 

And it's not sufficient for the Petitioners --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can -- you can 

communicate, but the communications are censored. That’s 

-- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you 

can attend meetings, you can discuss things, but there 

are only -- there’s a certain point at which the discussion 

must stop, right?

when you -- when you go over the line into giving 

valuable advice, training, support to these 

organizations. At that point --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a sort of basic 

question that I’ve had trouble with throughout the 

whole argument? We’re talking about whether this is an 

as-applied challenge or on its face. And what the 

district judge did was hold part of the statute 

unconstitutional as being too vague: the words “training” 

and “advice,” et cetera. Why isn't that a facial 

decision? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, the -- both the 

lower courts -- I think the district court and the 

court of appeals, I think, had a kind of confused analysis 

here, which is that they said, well, it's vague as applied. 

The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague 

on its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here, 

and yet they appeared to incorporate aspects of overbreadth 

analysis into their as-applied claim. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you're in an 

overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an 

as-applied challenge. A statute can be vague as applied 

to certain conduct, although the core conduct that it 

covers is clearly covered. 

GENERAL KAGAN: No, that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We have cases like that.

as-applied vagueness claim, the government's position is 

there's -- there's -- there -- it's not vague, because

included within --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I have the 

same --

GENERAL KAGAN: -- the statute and what's 

not. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had the same question as 

Justice Stevens. It's a very odd as-applied challenge 

because there hasn't been a prosecution. And vagueness 

as applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, it 

seems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague. 

I don’t understand that, but --

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I can't -- I can't

applied to certain things. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I 

am missing some case.

not covered. All the independent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that’s -- I'm 

not -- I'm not sure that's right. I mean, expert advice or 

assistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell, 

you know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know, 

resolution or whatever. Is that expert advice? Is that 

specialized knowledge? And I understand training, 

service, personnel, but that one's a little hard to --

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, as I said, 

Mr. Chief Justice, there will be some hard cases, there 

always are when it comes to applying statutes. The 

question is never are there hard cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my -- my point 

is that this --

GENERAL KAGAN: The question is the 

indeterminacy. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. My point is that 

even knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard 

to decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge 

or not. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think it -- it actually is 

pretty clear in this case. If you read the declarations, 

if you read the complaints, the expertise of these

of his expertise, justifiably so. He has --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- what --

what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have 

any resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have 

brought under this Act? It was my understanding that 

those were for supplying weapons, supplying other 

equipment. Are there any prosecutions that are -- that 

aim at training to pursue the organization's aims 

through peaceful means? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I think 

that this is not the typical case. This is, of course, 

a case that might never have reached this Court, except 

that it was brought as a declaratory judgment action. 

For the most part, what the government prosecutes are 

cases which involve a wide variety of support to foreign 

terrorist organizations. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Specifically, does this 

particular man have to be prosecuted? 

GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this particular 

individual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes the 

speech to the United Nations? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, I do 

believe that this individual can make whatever speeches

he wants at the United Nations. To the extent that he 

is acting as a representative or as an agent of the PKK, 

he does fall within the contours of the statute. That's 

a different thing. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And is there evidence that 

he would be prosecuted if he --

GENERAL KAGAN: Of course, that's a 

different thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is used 

to decide which are the high-priority cases and which 

are the low-priority cases. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in essence, this is an 

action to enjoin a potential prosecution against 

somebody for making a potential speech? That's really 

what we are fighting about, I think. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Again, the government did 

not bring this action. Judge Fertig and the Petitioners 

brought this action to try to get a declaratory 

judgment. As applied to them, the statute indeed 

covers their various efforts or proposed activities of 

being an agent of, of representing the PKK and the LTTE, 

that falls within the statute and I think makes the 

as-applied claim here not vague at all.

ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL. 

MR. COLE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I want to start by addressing the question 

of strict scrutiny. The -- the -- Justice Kennedy, you 

asked, and a number of the Justices asked, doesn't it 

make a difference that what they've done is prohibited a 

wide range of conduct and just some of that is speech? 

Well, that's precisely an accurate 

description of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen 

v. California. It forbade breaches of peace through 

loud noises, through horse racing in the streets, 

through any kind of offensive conduct. But when 

California applied that statute to the words on Mr. 

Cohen's jacket and then argued because we are not 

interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested 

in preserving the peace, however it’s breached, O'Brien 

should apply, the Court said no. We deal here with the 

conviction resting solely upon speech, not upon any 

separately identifiable conduct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I agree. And that 

was as applied to a conviction. 

MR. COLE: That's right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just haven't seen an 

as-applied challenge on declaratory relief. The 

government doesn't seem to object to that procedure.

MR. COLE: No. Well, the government doesn't 

object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v. 

Wisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent. But, 

again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet 

with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact, 

the House report says that you are free to speak with 

and on behalf of a designated group. 

But then you have a statute that says, if 

you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them 

anything that’s derived from specialized knowledge, if 

you tell them anything of specific skill, you're --

you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for 

15 years. 

That's why the Humanitarian Law Project came 

to me. They said: We’ve been doing this kind of 

lawful activity. We think it's our right, but we’re 

not going to risk going to jail for 15 years to do 

it. 

The government has spent a decade arguing 

that our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannot 

inform about international human rights. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If O'Brien applies, what 

remains of your case? 

MR. COLE: If O'Brien applies, then I think 

the Court would still be applying the scrutiny that

asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable 

fit between the specific speech that's at issue here, 

speech on issues of public concern, advocating only 

lawful activity, and the -- and that the government 

legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support 

for terrorism? Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That analysis of the 

activities that you are proposing has not been done by 

the lower courts, correct? 

MR. COLE: Well, the lower courts struck --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -- they haven't --

they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --

MR. COLE: Right. The --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- none of the courts 

either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the 

reasonable fit --

MR. COLE: No, and, in fact, the government 

has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict 

scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy 

strict scrutiny. And under this -- under Cohen, strict 

scrutiny is what must be applied here. 

In addition --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't -- why 

don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict 

scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply

here? 

MR. COLE: I think it would be appropriate 

to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if 

you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply. 

O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is 

not content neutral. This is a statute that doesn't bar 

all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech. It permits 

unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they 

advocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even 

if they are advocating peace. 

So -- so there are -- the -- the lower 

court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our 

clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right 

to engage in this activity. I think you can reach that 

result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by 

applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is 

so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact, 

undermines the fit, because people are chilled from 

engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want 

to prohibit. 

All right, if I am told you -- you -- you’ll 

go to jail if you tell them anything that’s derived from 

special --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cole, there were 

congressional findings that money is fungible first for

terrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for 

legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and 

used for illegitimate means. 

MR. COLE: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't that enough, 

either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard, 

reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach 

these groups how to get money? 

MR. COLE: Right. Well, one -- well, we’re not 

-- we’re not teaching them how to get money. We’re seeking 

to teach them how to advocate for lawful human rights 

or --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, one of your -- one 

of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to 

teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief. 

MR. COLE: Right. That -- that claim has 

been mooted because the LTTE is no longer -- has no role 

in Sri Lanka. So what’s left is solely -- has nothing 

to do with money. 

Secondly, Congress only made a finding about 

money. At the same time that it made a finding that 

money is fungible, it said this is a statute -- and 

this is from the House report -- only affects one’s 

contribution of financial and material resources and 

does not prohibit speaking in concert with and on behalf
