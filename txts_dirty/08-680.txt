 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this term in Case 08-680, 

Maryland v. Shatzer.

 General Gansler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DOUGLAS F. GANSLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GANSLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 This case is here from the Maryland Court of 

Appeals. In that case, the court of appeals suppressed 

a statement that was given by Respondent following what 

the trial court found to be a valid waiver of his 

Miranda rights and following a free and voluntary 

confession.

 The reason why the court did so is because, 

two years and seven months prior to that, the defendant 

was in a different custodial interrogation and at that 

time invoked his right to counsel. We ask that this 

Court reverse the Maryland Court of Appeals.

 It is our position that a break in custody 

from custodial interrogation should be the bright line 

that this Court adopts in order to end the irrebuttable 

presumption that this Court created in the Edwards case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Without regard to 

the time? A break in custody of one day, do you think 

that should be enough?

 MR. GANSLER: Your Honor, we do think one 

day should be enough, as long as it is not in the 

pretrial detention category. Obviously, the three cases 

that have come before this Court, Edwards, Minnick and, 

Roberson, all -- two of them were three days, and one of 

them was one day, but those defendants were in the 

pretrial detention status.

 So if in fact a defendant is brought in, 

questioned, and then released back to his or her daily 

routine, and away from the isolation of the custodial 

interrogation, we feel that that should be the bright 

line for a break in custody.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if it's 

repeatedly done? You know, you -- you bring him in, you 

give him his Miranda rights. He says, I don't want to 

talk. You let him go. You bring him in, give him his 

Miranda rights. He says, I don't want to talk. You 

know, just sort of catch and release, until he finally 

breaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.

 MR. GANSLER: There is parade of horribles 

of catch and release and Your Honor just went through 

one of them, and there are obviously a number of

hypotheticals that one could posit. We would suggest 

that the break of custody would be the end of the 

Edwards irrebuttable presumption. However, there are 

still three responses to that. The first would be the 

defendant could still say that his or her Miranda rights 

were not given voluntarily and willfully. Secondly, the 

due process jurisprudence that this Court had prior to 

Miranda still is in existence, and therefore the 

defendant could argue that that confession was given in 

an overborne way, that his will was overborne.

 But finally and I think most relevant, 

because this is sort of the other side of this case, is 

that there has been -- since 1982 eight Federal circuits 

and over 20 States have had the break of custody rule in 

effect. And in fact this Court in the McNeil case, 

albeit in dicta and parenthetically, assumed a break in 

custody as the rule. There has not been one published 

opinion, at least that we could find, that has this --

that has that scenario --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the rationale for the 

break in custody that there is a likelihood of 

non-coercion? Is that the reason that you offer for the 

rule?

 MR. GANSLER: Your Honor, it goes to --

yes, this Court has said, most recently again in

Montejo, that the reason for Edwards is that we want to 

prevent badgering.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. But this 

person was in custody in the sense he was in prison and 

the brief said, oh, he was released to the general 

population. But the possibilities for coercion or 

pressure are very substantial in the prison. The warden 

comes in and says: Oh, your cell doesn't have a window. 

I mine, there's countless way in which a prisoner in the 

general prison population would consider that he is --

that there has been no break in custody. I think that's 

a very difficult rule that you are proposing.

 MR. GANSLER: Well, the courts -- the lower 

courts have shown that there is a difference between 

police interrogational custody and correctional custody. 

What we are suggesting is once the person -- in our 

case, for example, in the second interview, the 

defendant was in what's called -- what's called a 

maintenance room in the room, with a metal table and the 

two chairs. It was clearly an interrogation context. 

When that person is released from that, some people are 

habitual criminals and they're put back into the general 

population amongst -- that's where they live for that 

time period. Other people go home. But the break in 

custody for Edwards purposes ought to end at the end of

the interrogation.

 Now, could there be an interrogational 

situation while the person's in prison? Absolutely. 

You can envision a correctional officer coming to the 

cafeteria when there's, the public is there, the public 

being other inmates, and that would not be deemed to be 

an interrogation atmosphere. If, however, they cleared 

the cafeteria and had officers standing by the doors and 

blocking the doors and saying no one's allowed to come 

in here, that could then become interrogation custody.

 And this Court and other courts, the courts 

all the time, have to decide in the Edwards context 

whether or not the defendant was in custody when the 

statement was given.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the defendant goes 

home, he can contact a lawyer. In prison he can't do 

that. So, if the whole idea is to protect his right to 

counsel, then it makes a big difference whether he's at 

home or in prison.

 MR. GANSLER: Your Honor -- well, first of 

all, the defendant while they're in prison can contact a 

lawyer in some circumstances. For example, during the 

two years and seven months between these two 

interrogations he could have written, he could have 

called.

But let's say that that was unavailable to 

that particular defendant. It's our position that what 

Edwards does, Miranda, Edwards, Roberson, Minnick, it 

provides the opportunity to consult counsel. But the --

what we are talking about here is the custodial 

interrogation situation. In other words, the police 

don't have to get somebody a lawyer. Whether or not 

somebody has the opportunity to consult a lawyer or not, 

as long as they are provided with their Miranda rights, 

the Miranda rights themselves are the protection that 

the defendant has.

 We know, for example, in this case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we know exactly what 

the Miranda warning in this case was?

 MR. GANSLER: The Miranda warnings in this 

case the judge, the trial judge, found exactly comported 

with the Miranda warning --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But what did it tell the 

person in prison he could do about a lawyer?

 MR. GANSLER: That he had the right to a 

lawyer and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Did it tell him how he 

could get a lawyer?

 MR. GANSLER: It didn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you're in prison and

they give you the Miranda warnings, what would that tell 

the average prisoner with respect to access to a lawyer?

 MR. GANSLER: It would tell them they have a 

right to counsel and if they couldn't get one one would 

be provided to them.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And would they have 

provided a lawyer to him right away if they had -- he 

had asked for it?

 MR. GANSLER: Well, had he asked for one, 

which he did the first time, what they did there --

JUSTICE STEVENS: When he is in prison, I 

mean.

 MR. GANSLER: Yes. It's unclear from the 

record whether they would have or not. That would be 

conjecture. What they do what the bright line of 

Edwards says is they have to stop asking questions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that.

 MR. GANSLER: Right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering if he 

thinks, well, I'd like a lawyer, what can he do?

 MR. GANSLER: He could -- during those two 

years and seven months in this case, he could have tried 

to get a lawyer through -- either his own lawyer in the 

case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right on the spot, when he

is in the room there and they give him the Miranda 

warnings and he says, that sounds like a good idea, what 

would happen?

 MR. GANSLER: He would not be given a lawyer 

by the police at that time. There's not a lawyer sort 

of waiting outside.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the Miranda warning is 

a little misleading, isn't it, in that context?

 MR. GANSLER: Well, I would argue that it is 

not, because he is given the right. He is said, if you 

want a lawyer before talking to us, that's fine; you 

have to invoke your right to counsel. He invokes the 

right to counsel, they stop talking to him. What he 

can--

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do they also say it will 

be provided to you?

 MR. GANSLER: Yes, but he can -- there's a 

number of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's not going to be 

provided to him.

 MR. GANSLER: Well, it would be, Your Honor, 

if, for example, the lawyer in his underlying case came, 

he could say, look, I need a lawyer, they're asking me 

questions about this other case; can you represent me on 

that case?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if asks for a 

lawyer. He said: I don't want to talk to you without a 

lawyer, correct?

 MR. GANSLER: In 2003, yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the State doesn't 

provide him with a lawyer, correct?

 MR. GANSLER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what 

gives him an understanding that one will be provided the 

next time he's questioned?

 MR. GANSLER: Well, what he does understand 

from the first time he is questioned -- and he 

understood the rights because he himself invoked that 

right to counsel. So he knew that he could say "I want 

a lawyer," and he did. What he understands is the 

police will stop questioning him at that point.

 There is no, as far as I can tell from the 

jurisprudence and this Court's holdings, there is no 

obligation for the police to actually go out, nor would 

I suggest that you want to have that rule, to go out and 

actually ascertain, get a lawyer.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, because we tell the 

police they have to stop.

 MR. GANSLER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So presumably they

wouldn't re- engage until the lawyer is present, 

correct? That's what Edwards tells them not to do.

 MR. GANSLER: Well, Edwards tells them to 

stop questioning. Minnick says that if they have the 

opportunity to consult with a lawyer they still can't 

start without the lawyer being there. But that is a 

different analysis than that because had they asked him 

on the second time, after they read his rights and he 

said, I want a lawyer, they couldn't keep going until 

there was a lawyer present. He chose during that two 

years and seven months when he had a mental reset that 

he didn't need a lawyer.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, this is a 

different part of your argument. This is not the 

custody or break in custody. This is the time and the 

fact that such a prolonged period of time has minimized 

any coercive effect, correct?

 MR. GANSLER: No, Your Honor. We would 

still argue that -- in this case, obviously both exist. 

The Court could fashion a bright line rule. This Court 

has shown an interest in bright line rules in this area. 

And this Court could adopt a bright line rule of a 

particular time period. We are arguing the better 

bright line rule would be a break in custody. Obviously 

a break in custody plus --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Catch and release then 

no longer -- catch and release is unimportant to you? 

There is no meaning to Edwards in that situation, 

because every prisoner, because he is a captive, is 

questioned in a place and then told to go back to his 

room. His room happens to be a locked cell. So he 

doesn't have the freedom to leave and he doesn't have 

the freedom necessarily to make calls to discuss his 

choice with anyone.

 MR. GANSLER: Well, in this case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is a very different 

situation then someone who is free to go home.

 MR. GANSLER: I'm not sure -- the question 

sort of posits two different scenarios. One scenario is 

when the defendant is arrested, they are questioned and 

then they are put into a cell. That is a different 

scenario. That would be a pretrial detention analysis, 

which in Minnick, Roberson and Edwards extended up to 

three days, which we would argue is sort of the end of 

the time line right as it exists today.

 The different scenario, which is in this 

case, is, yes, he is locked up in the general 

population, he comes in for the interrogation, he is 

then released back to his daily routine. And at that 

point our view is that the rebuttable presumption of

Edwards ends. And you know --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because he is not in 

custody, when he is in jail.

 MR. GANSLER: He is not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When he can't leave --

JUSTICE STEVENS: True, we have to reach out 

and find some arbitrary number, but after all, Edwards 

is an arbitrary rule.

 MR. GANSLER: The reason why I think break 

in custody is not as problematic, and this goes to the 

Justice's earlier question as well, is because literally 

the year after Edwards, 1982, was the first of the eight 

Federal circuits that found the break in custody rule. 

And there is no -- they have been able to work with 

this.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- there is no 

small --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In those cases, was there 

a considerable interval between --

MR. GANSLER: Not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was just the break in 

custody? A week --

MR. GANSLER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- was enough?

 MR. GANSLER: Yes, Your Honor. Obviously,

in different cases there's different lengths of time. 

But if -- in Justice Kennedy's question, if we were 

going to adopt a time limit, I -- we would suggest, 

like, for example, a seven-day time limit. The Court 

suggests that is arbitrary. The reason why I would pick 

seven days is, right now the rule is three days, and you 

cannot envision the situation, at least I can't, where 

somebody would be held without being presented for more 

than three or four days, so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say the rule is 

three days? What rule is that?

 MR. GANSLER: Because right now, if you look 

at Edwards being the next day, Minnick and Roberson 

being three days, that that is the only cases from this 

Court which says when the Edwards presumption goes. So 

we don't have -- whether -- what Respondent's rule would 

do is, in our view, extend it right now from the 

three-day limit -- now, many have suggested that's in 

perpetuity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but you -- you are 

not arguing for a seven-day limit no matter what, even 

if he is held in jail, are you?

 MR. GANSLER: If he is held in jail on his 

own case -- see, the most difficult scenario, in our 

view, is one that we don't think the Court needs to

reach here, which is actually the Green case from the 

District of Columbia, where he is held on his own case 

in a pretrial detention --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. GANSLER: -- scenario, because then he 

does have different incentives to cooperate or not 

cooperate with the police and then the question would 

be, well, does that -- is the break of custody there at 

conviction or at sentencing? And we can quibble about 

that.

 We don't need to get to that in this case. 

But if he is held in jail on another case, that's where 

he lives. He is there for 10, 15, 20 years, and he is 

brought in, away from the life that he is accustomed to, 

and put there with different officers in a metal room --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it's the same 

officer. Does -- you said in your brief and just now it 

was a different officer. Suppose it was the same 

officer?

 MR. GANSLER: Well, I actually think for --

in this case, with Detective Blankenship and Detective 

Hoover, the Court should assume it's one and the same. 

In fact, Roberson said just that, that within the same 

department -- but it is instructive in this sense. In 

Respondent's -- if Respondent's rule were to be adopted,

there is no way that one police department can know what 

happened in front of another police department, in front 

of another police department, while that person is being 

detained --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you could limit it 

to the same police department, the same investigation, 

so you are not covering the waterfront of every 

interrogation about any crime, any place.

 MR. GANSLER: Except for right now, we live 

in a world of Roberson, where we do. So in other words, 

if a defendant invokes in California for a shoplifting 

case and then is transported to Iowa and then to 

Maryland, the Maryland authorities have no idea whether 

he invoked in one of the other two.

 What is worse is right now, since we don't 

have a break in custody rule, this defendant, Shatzer 

himself, could have invoked counsel 20, 25 years ago in 

some other State. We have no way of knowing that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the 

hypothetical you are positing is an investigation about 

unrelated crimes. We are talking about, and I think 

it's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to, it was an 

invocation on this crime, on this criminal activity, not 

one in another State or another police department. And 

so that's a substantially different question.

MR. GANSLER: It is, though he is not being 

held on -- on that crime. He is being held on a 

completely unrelated sexual abuse case. I mean, it's 

related in the sense it's the same crime, but it's a 

different case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I thought 

Roberson told us it's not a different question, that 

it's the same question. Roberson did not draw a 

distinction between what crime he was being questioned 

on the second time.

 MR. GANSLER: That's exactly right, and 

that's what creates the problem that if defendant -- if 

we don't have a break in custody rule, a defendant who 

invokes anywhere at any time is forever immune from 

being questioned by the police, regardless of what would 

be a sort of a wholly irrational view and an absurd 

result, which I think is where we live right now.

 And it becomes, obviously, greater in a 

world where we have DNA. Obviously, there was no DNA in 

1981, but with these cold cases coming back 15, 20, 25 

years later --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I wonder if you're 

right about that premise. Supposing the prison had a 

rule that the inmate does not have to see visitors and 

they say that: Somebody here wants to talk to you. And

circuit courts have recognized this break in custody 

theory.

are cases that are weeks rather than years that they 

have --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This Court has repeatedly made clear that 

Edwards v. Arizona is a prophylactic rule designed to 

implement the protections of Miranda v. Arizona, and it 

does so by operating as an anti-badgering rule. On the 

facts of this case, I don't think there is any colorable 

argument that Mr. Shatzer was badgered into waiving his 

Sixth Amendment rights.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I know that you're 

going to go into the question of how we shape a rule, 

and I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other 

counsel, to comment on the following: I don't see -- as

Justice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem 

with anything that just says break in custody, and 

taking time seems fairly arbitrary.

 Suppose you -- could you try to shape a rule 

on the civil situation, the codes of ethics, where you 

are not supposed to talk to a client who is represented 

by a lawyer? That's where my mind is going. And the 

best I could do at the moment is you would say: When, 

due to a breach in custody and the passage of time, the 

questioner did not and would not reasonably believe that 

the suspect was looking for or was represented by 

counsel?

 What I've tried to do is take the purpose of 

the civil rule, the ordinary ethical rule, and then use 

it to shape a standard. So I would appreciate any 

comments on that thought.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I think there 

is a few problems with that approach. First of all, 

this case is not about the Sixth Amendment right to the 

assistance of counsel. It's about the Fifth Amendment 

right against compulsory self-incrimination, and this 

Court has said several times that rules of legal ethics 

are not relevant to the Fifth Amendment 

self-incrimination rule. It says that in the Burbine 

case, for example. That is the case where, although the

questioner knew that the suspect had an attorney who was 

trying to reach him, the Court said that is not a Fifth 

Amendment self-incrimination problem, because we have to 

look at things from the perspective of the suspect.

 The question is whether the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Quite a lot of what I read 

was about the problems of counsel. Counsel has nothing 

to do with this, nothing at all?

 MR. HEYTENS: Counsel has something to do 

with it, but the Court has made clear going back to 

Miranda that when we're we are talking about the Fifth 

Amendment right to counsel, the only reason that counsel 

matters is to help to make sure that --

JUSTICE BREYER: If -- are we interested in 

counsel or not? If we are interested in whether he's 

represented by counsel, and Miranda covers both, then I 

would repeat my question.

 MR. HEYTENS: We are not --

JUSTICE BREYER: If we are not interested in 

representation by counsel, then I would withdraw my 

question and you don't have to answer it.

 MR. HEYTENS: We have -- in the Fifth 

Amendment context, we are interested in counsel only as 

a derivative of his right not to be forced to 

incriminate himself. It is in this context a purely

derivative right, and we need to look at it from his 

perspective.

 I think the reason that this case matters in 

an intensely practical way is, there are approximately a 

million and a half prison inmates in this country right 

now, many of whom are serving extremely long sentences.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, couldn't we say that 

in -- in the situation where there is a change from 

pretrial status to post-conviction status, the Edwards 

rule is no longer an irrebuttable presumption, but it's 

simply a rebuttable presumption? And that there -- that 

the rule would not apply if the prosecution could show 

that under the circumstances the reason for the rule, 

the concern about law enforcement badgering, was not 

present?

 MR. HEYTENS: That would certainly be open 

to the Court to say that, Justice Alito. Ultimately, 

this is a -- a second-order --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be a good idea to 

say that?

 MR. HEYTENS: I don't think it would be a 

good idea.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we liked clear 

lines in this. I mean, the police won't know what to 

do.

MR. HEYTENS: And, Justice Scalia, that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But carrying -- carrying 

that analysis one step further, if you are just talking 

about people who were inmates pursuant to prior 

conviction, why wouldn't the better rule be that if the 

inmate is given the opportunity to say no, I don't want 

a visitor today, and then if he accepts the visitor, you 

would say he is no longer in custody? But if he says, I 

don't want to, then he -- then he is in custody and you 

preserves the presumption.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Stevens, I 

suspect that's what the police would do, if you ruled 

against the State in this case. But I think the reason 

that you shouldn't do that is you have to ask yourself 

what is the benefit that such a rule is trying to 

accomplish. The Court has made clear again --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that -- such a rule 

would accomplish the benefit when he really wants --

willing to talk, he would say: I would be glad to talk 

to the officer.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If he doesn't want to, he 

should just say no.

want to talk to the officer, there was nothing to

prevent him from invoking his Fifth Amendment right to 

counsel.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is a little 

different when the man first comes, says, will you talk 

to officer. He can very clearly say no. But if he is 

in the room with two or three people around in a 

different setting, then he is still in custody.

 MR. HEYTENS: He is in custody, Justice 

Stevens, but the premise of Miranda is that a person who 

is given the Miranda warnings can choose to decide 

whether to talk or not to talk.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the change --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You started to tell us why 

this case was important. Would you -- would you finish 

that? You said there were --

MR. HEYTENS: Certainly. The reason this 

case is important, Justice Scalia, is that because under 

the Maryland Court of Appeals decision no police 

officer, no corrections official, can approach any 

prisoner without first attempting to determine if at 

some point, to someone, at some place, during the period 

of continuous incarceration he has ever invoked his 

Fifth Amendment right to counsel.

to the officer, and you could produce something, they 

could question every -- everybody in jail all over the 

country.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, they can't approach him 

for questioning.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They can't force him to 

attend the questioning. But if they give him an 

opportunity to say, I -- I'm a prisoner, I just want to 

stay in the prison population and not go to an 

interrogation room. And if he is willing to go, you 

could question him. You do not have the example of no 

possibility.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, the problem 

in that situation, again, though, is that ultimately the 

only basis for applying this presumption at all is if 

it's appropriate to apply an irrebuttable presumption 

that, even though we gave him the Miranda warnings and 

even though he said, I am happy to talk to you, we 

should presume that when he said that, that wasn't the 

truth.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I thought that you 

couldn't approach him. I thought that once he's invoked 

his right to counsel, you can't approach him and say, 

would you like to talk now? Right? Isn't that -- isn't 

that the rule?

MR. HEYTENS: Well, under Rhode Island v. 

Ennis, you are entitled to -- to update him on the 

status of the interrogation, but you are not entitled to 

resume custodial interrogation unless there has been a 

break in custody or something has terminated Edwards.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if the incarceration 

is a continuation of custodial custody, to be redundant, 

if it is a continuation of the custody, then why 

wouldn't asking him whether he would like to see 

visitors who want to ask him about a particular crime, 

why wouldn't that be a violation of Edwards?

 MR. HEYTENS: I think defendants may well 

argue that it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure they would.

 MR. HEYTENS: -- Justice Scalia, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- the -- the scheme 

that Justice Stevens proposes wouldn't work. You would 

be violating Edwards when you asked him if he wanted to 

see interrogators.

 MR. HEYTENS: I think there would be a risk 

of that happening. I think the other reason is --

again, this is a second order prophylactic rule that the 

Court has adopted solely in order to prevent people from 

being coerced, coerced into incriminating themselves 

when they don't want to.

lead to fewer line-drawing problems. It is certainly 

open to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's become apparent, 

and I'm indicating that I think the time rule might have 

some benefits.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, we certainly don't 

oppose the Court adopting a time rule in the event that 

it rejects our primary submission. In United States v. 

Green, the government argued for a raw passage of time 

approach, and we think, ultimately, this is the Court's 

rule, it's a second order prophylaxis rule that is 

designed to implement the Fifth Amendment, and it would 

certainly be open to the Court if it thought necessary 

to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't give us 

any -- any suggestions. As -- you know, the State opens 

the bidding with seven days.

within 70 days. Would that be a benchmark?

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I think as a practical 

matter, though, there are so -- as you point out, 

Justice Kennedy, there are so many exceptions to that. 

We think that would be far longer than would be 

necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. I 

mean --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this -- in this case 

it's two years and seven months. Why should the Court 

take that -- a period of that length and say, well, we 

are going to now rule for all future cases it should be, 

say, six months.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I think that is another 

potential defect in adopting a pure passage of time 

approach, though I think this case is particularly easy.

 And I think the fact that the Maryland Court 

of Appeals in this case concluded that two years and 

seven months is covered by an anti-badgering rule just 

shows at some point how far this has departed from the 

original purposes of Edwards in the first place.

 So, I do think -- I mean, the Court could 

simply say this case is too long, though at that point 

the Court isn't providing a great deal of guidance to 

the lower courts that have to deal with these problems 

on a day-to-day basis.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or to the police who have 

to decide whether they can interrogate or not.

 MR. HEYTENS: Absolutely. It would also not 

provide very much guidance to the police to just say two 

years and seven months is too long. And that's again 

why we think an approach that is either -- either 

tethered to the break in custody, which as I think I 

have said, we think better maps on to the concern that 

motivated Edwards --

Let me address for a moment the catch and 

release situation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't want to 

interrupt that, but there were two aspects to Edwards. 

One was the coercion, but the other was the respect for 

the advisement of counsel. And so the test that you are 

proposing only addresses the coercion prong of it, not 

the respect for the invocation of counsel.

 MR. HEYTENS: The Court has mentioned 

respect in the choice. I think, with respect, 

ultimately though, that can't be the basis for the 

Edwards rule. The Court has made clear repeatedly that 

the Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelling someone to 

be a witness against himself.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CELIA A. DAVIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. DAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Creating exceptions to the rule of Edwards 

means a clear rule is lost. It introduces uncertainty 

into the determinations of what constitutes custody and 

what length of time might be adequate to excuse the 

protection.

 JUSTICE ALITO: This is an area where it is 

very difficult to draw lines, at least I find it 

difficult to draw lines. So let me start you out with 

an extreme hypothetical, and I would like you tell me 

whether you think the Edwards rule reaches this far. 

And if it doesn't, then I would like you to tell me why 

it doesn't. And what limitations, if any, on the rule 

you would be willing to defend as consistent with the 

rationale for the rule.

 Someone is taken into custody in Maryland in 

1999 and questioned for joy riding, released from 

custody, and then in 2009 is taken into custody and 

questioned for murder in Montana.

 Now, at the time of the first questioning, 

the -- the suspect invokes the Fifth Amendment right to 

counsel. Now, does the Edwards rule apply to the second

interrogation?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes, it does, Justice Alito. 

The Edwards rule provides two ending points as it stands 

right now.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And you don't think that's a 

ridiculous application of the rule? First of all, how 

are the authorities in Montana possibly going to know 

whether this person was interrogated previously on a 

crime for which the person was never convicted in 

Maryland, and that invoked the right not to be 

questioned without -- without an attorney? And you 

think there is badgering in that situation?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes, Justice Alito, because 

badgering in this context has become a term of art. It 

is used in quotation marks in the Montejo opinion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't mean badgering.

 MS. DAVIS: It means an attempt by --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We ought to get another 

term for it then.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Questioning?

 MS. DAVIS: I think it means returning in an 

attempt to get a suspect to change his or her mind. And 

in this case, the suspect said when first questioned --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There was no attempt in

this hypothetical to get him to change his mind. They 

didn't know he had made up his mind.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, first of all, I didn't 

answer the question properly. But the police, I think, 

can run a rap sheet and find out from prior arrests if a 

person has been taken into custody. And that would 

alert a police officer that that person may have invoked 

their right and they should do more to find out. And 

second --

JUSTICE ALITO: So all right, they run the 

rap sheet and they find out, if they do, that the person 

was arrested ten years earlier in Maryland and then 

what? They try to find the detective that questioned 

the -- the suspect in 1999 in Maryland? And they find 

out that the detective is retired and is now, you know, 

fishing down in the Florida Keys, and they have to track 

this person down and say, now do you recall whether this 

person -- that's the rule you are arguing for?

 MS. DAVIS: Well, the police officer should 

attempt to do so. But I understand that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to 

interrupt you -- interrupt there, and I will let you get 

back to the answer. They should attempt to do so. The 

rule here does not allow the police to approach that 

person, a murder suspect. And you are saying he cannot

even be approached to see if he would waive his rights 

ten years later because he was -- invoked the right in 

connection with joy riding?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes. Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MS. DAVIS: -- if they have invoked the 

right, then the second approach means an attempt to 

persuade the person to change their mind about having 

counsel. And where they haven't done so in the interim, 

that amounts to --

JUSTICE ALITO: Let me pose you my 

hypothetical again, the same joy riding questioning, and 

then 40 years later after the person has gotten a law 

degree and become an entrepreneur and made $20 million, 

he's taken into custody and questioned by the Federal 

authorities for stock fraud. Forever, you know, this 

right that was invoked back in adolescence continues 

forever.

 MS. DAVIS: It should. But let's look at 

this case, Your Honor, because here this suspect was 

questioned about the same allegations by detectives from 

the same police department and while he was in custody 

continuously. And under those circumstances Edwards and 

the rationale of Edwards should apply strongly.

case we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it, 

which I know you don't want us to do. I'm now thinking 

and I would like your comment, if you want, of a 

combination of what Justice Alito said and what I said, 

that is, that there are two parts to the Edwards thing. 

One is the lawyer part, and the other is the 

incriminating self part.

 Now the lawyer part would be handled by 

shaping a rule based on the rules of evidence, along the 

lines I suggested. And that would give you a time. And 

then the Miranda part could be handled by saying: but 

the suspect retains the right to show that this 

questioning is badgering without the question marks. In 

other words what they are really up to is to try to get 

him to change his mind. Now would that work?

 MS. DAVIS: I -- I believe the Court could 

adopt a type of rebuttable presumption under these 

circumstances but it shows the difficulty that courts 

would have and police officers, too, in measuring 

degrees, degrees of coercion or degrees of custody. I 

think the foregoing discussion has illustrated that 

prisoners may be under different types of coercion in 

their prison context. I just --

right?

 MS. DAVIS: Well--

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is arrested for joy 

riding; he is let go; and you are saying that for 20, 

40 years he is now immunized from being reapproached by 

the police under the Edwards rule?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are advocating 

that no break in custody ever stops the Edwards clock.

 MS. DAVIS: Right. The problems with the 

break in custody are a break will exist in almost every 

case, and even in Edwards there was a change in 

custody --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but not --

MS. DAVIS: -- between the police to a State 

or county jail. So there is a change in -- a break in 

custody right there. The prisoner was removed from the 

police department and taken to the county jail.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was one day. He 

said he wanted the --

MS. DAVIS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to remain silent 

in the evening, and at 9:00 the next morning they were 

back.

MS. DAVIS: But a -- a release from custody 

does not signal that a person who has asked for counsel 

has changed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are now -- you 

are now accepting your adversary's point that somehow a 

-- a change from a locked room in a prison to a 

different locked room is a release from custody.

 MS. DAVIS: No, I don't --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't -- if we 

don't accept that proposition, isn't there a clear break 

when someone is let to go home? When someone is 

released and permitted to go home?

 MS. DAVIS: There is more of a break, 

Justice Sotomayor, but it doesn't say anything about 

that person's choice to proceed with counsel, and if 

counsel is not provided then the attorney is excluded 

from the adversary system of Federal justice.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about a 

different approach? We are dealing in this case with 

somebody who was constantly in custody but for a 

different reason than the during the pretrial situation. 

He is in the general prison population. What -- what 

would be wrong with the rule that said that a person in 

that situation should be advised that somebody wants to 

question him, and he has a right to say I do or do not

want to talk to the visitor? And if he is willing to 

talk to the visitor, then you have to give him new 

Miranda warnings and you start from scratch.

 But have the -- have the focus on whether he 

is in custody at the time of the questioning, and say 

that an inability to refuse to go to the interrogation 

room would be not treated as custody. It would be 

treated as in the general prison population. What would 

be wrong with such a rule?

 MS. DAVIS: I don't think anything's wrong 

and I don't think a new rule is needed to cover that 

situation, because it is conceivable that a person, even 

in a prison environment, if they have control, if they 

were to telephone out or to be free to refuse visitors, 

might not be considered in custody.

 But in this case Michael Shatzer lived in a 

prison environment. He was not free to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the record doesn't 

tell us whether he was given an opportunity to say "I 

don't want any visitors today."

 MS. DAVIS: No, it does not, but I think the 

State has the burden to show. The circumstances --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's a question who 

has the burden of showing he's in custody or is he free 

to live leave. If he has the burden, he didn't carry

the burden in this case.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, the record does show that 

he lived in a maximum security prison --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.

 MS. DAVIS: -- and does not show that he 

would be free to refuse.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you can still live in 

a maximum security prison and say I don't want any 

visitors.

refused under the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: As far as the records 

show.

Justice Stevens --

him, you know, what visitors? I mean, is that the 

question?

visitors today?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or do you ask him,

And he says what crime? I mean, how specific does --

does the request for permission to have visitors have to 

be?

 MS. DAVIS: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for this rule to cut in?

 MS. DAVIS: This discussion shows the 

problems with allowing such a determination in the first 

place. Our position is the definition of custody for 

Miranda purposes must be the same for Edwards purposes, 

for a prisoner lives within confined space under 

constant surveillance, and with no freedoms and limited 

expectation of privacy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then I don't 

understand why your answer to Justice Alito's 

hypothetical was what it was, because that person 

obvious was not in custody.

 MS. DAVIS: It -- all I'm saying is that if 

we were to adopt the language that this Court in Montejo 

utilized, if a person is in control, if a person is not 

in custody, they are in control and can shut the door or 

walk away. If that's an operable definition, then it 

did not apply in this case, because Michael Shatzer did 

not have such freedom of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're -- if you 

are going to use the Edwards, which I think is a good 

idea, as counsel part, which I think is a good starting 

place, you and every other member of the bar deals with 

this problem every day of the week. Not every day of 

the week, but very often. You know somebody's 

represented in a case, and you know you are supposed to 

talk to the lawyer. But eventually time passes, and 

then you are probably free to talk to him, because the 

whole thing's gone away.

 Now that's a pretty vague rule. You could 

make it more specific, but the -- the bar has lived with 

that kind of situation, I guess for years.

 MS. DAVIS: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So why can't we here?

 MS. DAVIS: We -- I think we should. The 

police officers have lived with the Edwards decision 

which says --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, that's not what I 

mean. I mean that the obligation to deal with counsel, 

you don't have, after enough time passes, that it's no 

longer reasonable to think that that individual either 

has or wants counsel.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, in this case there is no 

reason to think that this suspect changed his mind.

When first given his --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, what is the 

ethical rule about counsel? I thought if -- if there's 

counsel in a particular case and you want to approach 

the client about that case, you can't do it without 

going to counsel.

 MS. DAVIS: I think, though --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But when there is an 

entirely different case, there is totally different 

litigation, you can't approach the fellow without going 

back to the counsel whom he hired for a different case? 

I don't think that's the ethical rule. But that's the 

effect of Edwards. Even if it's a different crime, you 

have to go back to the counsel whom he hired for a 

different prosecution? That bears no relationship to 

the ethical rules of -- of counsel.

 MS. DAVIS: Well this Court could adopt a 

rule that the Edwards protection -- an alternative that 

was raised in United States v. Green -- that the Edwards 

protection extends to the same case for which the police 

initially questioned the suspect and for which he asked 

for counsel. That's one alternative and I submit that 

would be more clear than --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would make a 

difference? Does it make a difference? If -- we can

limit it to the same case. But here, the reason that 

the police came back is that they had additional 

evidence, and so they wanted to ask him, confront him 

with the new evidence. It's not the same situation that 

it was when he was initially questioned.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, I think from the suspect's 

point of view it is the same situation. He was in the 

same position, facing the police in 2003 as he was in 

2006, in that he was accused of committing crime and in 

the interim he had no access to counsel and I think that 

this is significant in this case, because it's not clear 

that even if he had been able to call out of the prison 

he would have had representation, because the public 

defender's office was under no constitutional or 

statutory duty to provide counsel for a person who's not 

presently being questioned and who has not yet been 

charged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if we 

limited Edwards to the same crime? That would -- that 

would really make it much easier form the police to --

MS. DAVIS: I agree.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to know whether this 

person in fact invoked the right to counsel.

 MS. DAVIS: It would be easier, yes; and it 

would apply to this case because it was the same crime.

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that require us to 

overrule Roberson?

 MS. DAVIS: Well, it does present some 

tensions with Roberson. However, in this case, since it 

is limited to the same crime, does it extend as far as 

Roberson does? And I would like to answer Justice 

Stevens' question.

 In this case, the suspect was told -- he was 

advised of his rights and said, "I have the right to 

talk to a lawyer and have him present with me while I'm 

being questioned. If I cannot afford to hire a lawyer, 

one will be appointed to resent -- represent me before 

any questioning, if I wish."

 Those rights were never fulfilled in the two 

years and seven months they've had.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

Miranda Rights do not require the police to provide 

counsel. They have to mean -- mean you have to stop 

questioning, until the person has right to counsel.

 MS. DAVIS: Yes. They have to.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the one thing 

this person knew from the prior Miranda situation -- was 

2003?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that, if he said, 

"I don't want to talk without counsel," the one thing he 

knew is that the police would stop questioning because 

that's what they did.

 MS. DAVIS: But that's not the same, Chief 

Justice Roberts, as having the counsel present during 

questioning.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Miranda 

doesn't --

MS. DAVIS: If your Miranda advice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

 MS. DAVIS: -- says that you have the right 

to have a counsel present during questioning, and all 

that advice means, after time, is, We will stop 

questioning you, then the right has been diminished over 

time.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is there a greater risk 

of badgering when the questioning is about a different 

offense?

 MS. DAVIS: I think the risk is the same. 

The risk --

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you just said we 

could -- you were suggesting an -- as an alternative, 

that -- that Edwards be limited to situations where the 

questioning is about the same offense.

MS. DAVIS: Well, that's possible -- well, 

the rationale that was extended in the Greene case is 

that, if questioning is about a different time, the 

perception, from the suspect's point of view, that the 

police are badgering him, would be less.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, this isn't fanciful. 

We just were asked to take a case involving a statute of 

limitations issue for a murder that was committed like 

30 years ago, and it said suppose somebody is questioned 

by State authorities for a murder and taken into custody 

and then released and then, 30 years later, taken into 

custody by Federal authorities and questioned for a 

civil rights violation, based on the same underlying 

transaction.

 You would say the Edwards rule applies in 

that situation?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes. It does. Now, a police 

officer in that situation, really, has three 

alternatives. One, they could wait until counsel was 

present, to be sure of obtaining a statement admissible 

in the State's case-in-chief.

 Number 2, they could take a chance, as 

happened in this case, where Detective Hoover never 

opened a case file and didn't know that the suspect had 

ever invoked his right, take a statement anyway, and run

the risk that it may have to be excluded. Or, three --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are being very 

unrealistic. Have you ever known defense counsel who 

says, "Oh, yes," to submit to the interrogation? I 

mean -- you know, once they are lawyered up, they are 

not going to talk. You know that.

 MS. DAVIS: Yes. I know that, but that --

this Court, in Miranda, was concerned with the limits 

that society must impose, consistent with the 

Constitution, in prosecuting crimes, and I think Edwards 

strikes the balance between the individual faced in 

captivity questioned by interrogators and the State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say, "in 

captivity," but you think the rule applies, whether they 

are in captivity or not. In -- in Justice Alito's 

hypothetical, the person was free for 40 years, so 

captivity is not a limitation on your -- your proposed 

rule.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, a person is going to be in 

custody in each Edwards scenario at the time they are 

questioned, so the question is the intervening time 

period. I want to say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you agreed that, if 

he is questioned and he is not in custody when he is 

being questioned. If he stopped on the street or in his

living room, they can question him there. That's the --

MS. DAVIS: Yes, because Edwards only 

applies to custodial interrogation, and, under these 

circumstances, Edwards strikes a balance in a familiar 

and predictable way. The fact that these case -- this 

case does not -- does not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, we --

MS. DAVIS: -- permit an exception.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have a case. 

None of the cases in this area, where we have applied 

Edwards, has dealt with a situation with -- where a 

prisoner has been released from custody, in any sense of 

that word, i.e., sent home.

 In all of the three situations that I am 

aware of, in which the Edwards rule has applied, the 

prisoner has stayed in jail -- some form of jail. 

Correct?

 MS. DAVIS: Yes, some form of jail. But 

there is -- you know, Chief Justice Roberts referred to 

the difference between the -- the police station and the 

prison.

 There are also pretrial detention centers, 

and there is a range of custodial scenarios that -- that 

police officers might encounter. And advancing an 

exception to the rule for a break in custody presents

practical problems.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose, if 

they are in a pretrial detention center, they know they 

are still being looked at for the crime as to which they 

have invoked the Miranda warnings.

 MS. DAVIS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you wouldn't call 

that -- and I don't understand the other side to argue 

that that is -- there is a break in custody there.

 MS. DAVIS: But a transfer within -- look. 

If it doesn't, then -- then it doesn't, but there should 

not be a break there. Otherwise, there would have been 

a break in Edwards and in many --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I agree 

with you. There shouldn't be a break there, but, here, 

the situation is quite different. There is a break 

between jail for questioning and prison for 15 years --

or whatever your sentence is.

 MS. DAVIS: But, from the suspect's point of 

view, the only thing that changed is the State agents 

who temporarily held him in a room for questioning. He 

was still --

it make sense to treat the -- the change from a pretrial

detention to a general prison population as, by itself, 

a no longer custody, provided he is told that he doesn't 

have to talk to people who want to pay him a visit.

 He could say -- they could have a rule, say 

that the prisoner does not have to talk to everybody who 

comes -- comes around, and then you could treat that as 

the functional equivalent of not being in custody.

 Wouldn't that be a sensible rule?

 MS. DAVIS: It's -- it's one possibility, 

but I don't think it's a workable rule. The 

circumstances of custody within an institution can 

change dramatically.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They can, but, if you say, 

as a condition to -- to questioning, he just has to know 

that he doesn't have to see visitors he doesn't want to 

see, which doesn't seem, to me, a very hard rule to 

administer.

 MS. DAVIS: It doesn't, Justice Stevens, but 

I think the problem is it's a hard rule for police 

officers to know. If they go to an institution to 

question someone, how do they know if that rule is 

applicable to that prisoner?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I have a 

clarification of the facts for a moment?

 In 2003, he was in one State facility, a 

sentenced prisoner. Correct?

 MS. DAVIS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he was just moved 

from one State prison to another. He wasn't in pretrial 

detention in either of these timeframes. Correct?

 MS. DAVIS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are just talking 

about a change in facility, not in status?

 MS. DAVIS: Exactly. And, Justice 

Sotomayor, I wanted to answer your question about the 

time period, where the circuit courts have sanctioned a 

break in custody. One is cited in the Respondent's 

brief, at page 27, is Holman versus Kemna, and a one-day 

break was -- was authorized in that case. That's a very 

short time period.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What were the 

circumstances? I don't recall the case.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, that was the case that is 

not entirely analogous, but it's close, where the 

question was whether a statement was tainted by an 

Edwards' violation. It also involved the Sixth 

Amendment, I believe, so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was the prisoner in a 

prison the entire 24 hours? Or was the individual 

released home, that sort of --

MS. DAVIS: I think it was a release home. 

If I recall correctly, I would have to double-check, but 

there was a one-day period that the Court recognized.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do I misunderstand Miranda 

warnings? Isn't he told, at the very outset of the 

Miranda warning, that he doesn't have to talk, if he 

doesn't want to talk?

 Is that -- is that any less strong than --

than asking him whether he wants to receive visitors, in 

general? Or, in particular, a visitor who wants to ask 

him about a particular crime?

 I mean, he is -- he is told that with the 

Miranda warning, which he is given the second time. If 

you don't want to talk, you don't have to. If you want 

a lawyer to be present, you are entitled to a lawyer,

or -- and -- and or, else, we terminate.

 I don't know why that isn't enough.

 MS. DAVIS: It isn't enough, Justice Scalia, 

because -- and I think this came out of Arizona versus 

Roberson. Merely repeating advice, when the right to 

counsel has not been fulfilled, is not enough because 

the person, over time, might lose hope of ever seeing an 

attorney, and, certainly, a prisoner has less means than 

someone on the street to hire an attorney.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't care whether he 

gets an attorney, so long as he doesn't have to talk to 

investigators. That's the issue, whether he must talk 

to these investigators, and he is told, right up-front, 

You don't have to do it, and if -- if you want an 

attorney for it, we will get you an attorney. 

Otherwise, we -- we will terminate the interview.

 MS. DAVIS: But, if he has asked for an 

attorney in the past and, over two years and seven 

months, has never seen the right fulfilled, I think that 

the -- that the pressure to cooperate with interrogators 

has increased.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is a -- isn't 

that a Sixth Amendment question? That's not a Miranda 

question, if he has not been provided a lawyer.

is directed to coercion --

MS. DAVIS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and that is 

addressed, if you stop questioning him. You don't even 

start questioning him, if he says, Look, I don't want to 

talk without a lawyer.

 MS. DAVIS: But I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Talking stopped, as 

it did the very -- the first time he was approached.

 MS. DAVIS: It did, but for a prisoner in 

custody questioned about the same offense, the coercive 

pressures that were present in Miranda are present for 

him as well. That's why we think the core holding, the 

core rationale, of Edwards applies very strongly in this 

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't he think, I 

invoked my right to remain silent without a lawyer two 

years and seven months ago, I will do it again; they 

will have to stop questioning? Why wouldn't that be the 

most likely mindset of the defendant? He knew that it 

worked the first time. Why should it not work the

second time?

 MS. DAVIS: I think it's -- it's possible. 

But in this case, where the right to counsel went 

unfulfilled for that period of time, a person might lose 

hope that that advice that he asked for help would ever 

be fulfilled.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he says -- I'm 

sorry --

MS. DAVIS: Go ahead.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you done 

answering?

 So if he said, instead of I want to talk to 

a lawyer, if he said, I want to remain silent, your case 

comes out differently? He doesn't say anything about a 

lawyer. He says, Look, I don't want to talk to you.

 MS. DAVIS: I think it would come out the 

same way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but all your 

arguments about he hasn't been provided a lawyer, there 

is an ethical obligation to provide a lawyer. Those --

those are off the table.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, what's different is in 

this Court, I think may be clear in Michigan v. Mosley: 

Asking for help from an attorney is materially different 

than saying, I choose to remain silent. And the reason

is a person who invokes the right to silence while 

questioned in custody is in control and chooses to stop 

the questioning.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't ask for an 

attorney. He just says, I don't want to talk without an 

attorney. That's what he says. He doesn't demand an 

attorney. He says, I don't want to talk without an 

attorney. And the investigators say, Okay, in that 

case, we won't talk to you.

 MS. DAVIS: Well, and they treated it as a 

clear invocation of the right to counsel by documenting 

it in two places and putting that in the case file.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The right to counsel in the 

course of interrogation.

 MS. DAVIS: Yes. I -- I think what he said 

was, "I won't speak to you without an attorney," is the 

same as asking for an attorney.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I can think of -- I can 

think of at least one situation in which the Court has 

held that there is a time limit in which something has 

to be done in order to comply with a Constitutional 

requirement. If we were to choose a time period here, 

what would -- what would you propose?

 MS. DAVIS: Oh, anything over two years and 

seven months.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would be --

MS. DAVIS: That still doesn't solve the 

problem.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would be a serious --

what would be a serious answer to that question?

 MS. DAVIS: We've argued that Edwards 

continues to the end, and the reason is --

JUSTICE ALITO: All or nothing.

 MS. DAVIS: It's all or nothing, Justice 

Alito, because -- because this Court has already said in 

Edwards, We will allow the police to come back if the 

suspect changes his or her mind or if an attorney is 

present. And those two -- those two alternatives are 

available every day and they are easy for the police to 

ascertain.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary says that 

they -- he can't change his mind. It has to be a 

spontaneous, you know, somehow they have to be in a room 

together that wasn't planned and he has to come up and 

say, I am confessing out of the kindness of my heart. 

The police can't even approach him, according to you, 

once he has invoked counsel, to ask him whether he wants 

to change his mind.

 MS. DAVIS: That's right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the point.

 MS. DAVIS: That is the badgering. That is 

the specter of coercion that is inconsistent with the 

Constitutional right related to Miranda to have counsel 

present. And that is the reason why --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is no 

termination point, really?

 MS. DAVIS: It is not confined to time, 

Justice Sotomayor, but the termination point is, 

especially for a prisoner, it's easy for the prisoner to 

contact the police. Just tell the jail guard that you'd 

like to talk to the police about that investigation. 

They will make arrangements quickly for that to happen, 

I'm quite sure, or counsel could be present and 

questioning can proceed in that instance, and those are 

the reasons I would ask this Court to affirm the 

judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Ms. Davis.

Breyer's question, the ethics rules do not apply to the 

police, only to lawyers, and I think Justice Scalia hit 

it right, exactly right, where this -- he's actually --

in this case, he is not represented at all. He is in 

custody because his case has been concluded.

 JUSTICE BREYER: My thought is, can you use 

the rule for lawyers, which has worked, to help shape a 

rule that would work here?

 MR. GANSLER: Yes, and I will get to that in 

one second. And I agree -- and that's exactly right. 

The visitors in jail theory that Justice Stevens brought 

up: The defendant could say, "I told them I don't want 

to talk to any visitors, no matter what. I don't want 

to talk to any visitors. They dragged me up there, made 

me go into this room and answer questions." Then you 

have -- while Edwards, in our view, would have already 

been terminated, you have still the argument that my --

my Miranda warnings were not waived voluntarily and 

freely, and moreover, I was denied due process.

 In terms of the time limits of the cases, in 

The State of Maine, Stafiali was six hours, and the 

following day, Dunkins v. Thigpen in the Eleventh 

Circuit was the next day, following a break in custody. 

Now, those cases, the guy basically went home in those 

scenarios.

The confusion seems to be, in a lot of the 

questions, regarding what is custody? We will not -- we 

don't argue -- we are talking about interrogational 

police custody, which is different than being in jail, 

lying on your cot, watching cable television. We --

this is -- in our scenario, the three days that now 

exist, whereas no one questions in the Roberson, 

Minnick, and Edwards cases, those three days were 

pretrial police custody situations. There is no break 

in custody --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but there was no 

difference in those cases, as I understand it. Each of 

the prisoners was in a particular room being questioned, 

and then he was released into a more general room later.

 MR. GANSLER: My understanding of this case 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And brought back.

 MR. GANSLER: My understanding of this case, 

they were in the -- sort of the box, as we call it, and 

then they were put into a holding cell, a cell, and then 

brought back to the box. Very different --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is no difference 

between that and a holding cell, a maintenance room, and 

being put back into general prison to go sleep.

 MR. GANSLER: The latter -- the latter

scenario is very different, because that's where they 

live. That's their daily routine. Through no part of 

the state, they are habitual offenders. They live in 

the general population of a jail, in this case it is 

medium security, not maximum security, and they were put 

-- there were people around. They have recess, they 

have television, they have a cafeteria, and so forth.

 Finally, going to Justice Alito's question 

regarding the time limit, where you do it. This Court 

has the County of Riverside -- obviously, there's 

48 hours from presentment is the time.
