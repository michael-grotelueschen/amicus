 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security 

Service versus Chertoff.

 Mr. Wolfman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Federal Circuit affirmed an award of 

attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, or 

EAJA, to Petitioner Richlin Security Services Company, 

but it denied Richlin an award for paralegal services at 

market rates on the ground that statutory attorney fees 

do not include work done by paralegals.

 The Federal Circuit was wrong because, as 

this Court has explained, the statutory term "attorney 

fees" -- and now I'm quoting -- "takes into account the 

work not only of attorneys but others whose labor 

contributes to the work product for which an attorney 

bills her client." Employing that reasoning the Court 

held, in Missouri versus Jenkins, that paralegal fees 

are compensable at market rates as attorney fees under 

42 U.S.C. section 1988.

The question in this case is whether there 

is any reason EAJA should be interpreted differently. 

The answer is no. And, indeed, the only potentially 

relevant difference between the two statutes -- that 

EAJA requires fees to be awarded at prevailing market 

rates, and section 1988 requires only that fees be 

reasonable -- provides stronger support for market-based 

recovery of paralegal fees under EAJA than it would 

under section 1988.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolfman, what about 

the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in 

EAJA?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that 

really is, when we get down to it, what the government's 

argument boils down to. And I think the cap is 

irrelevant for two reasons, both of which are important. 

First, and let me -- let me first state the argument; 

then I'll give you the answers.

 But the argument that the government posits 

is -- taking a lead from the Federal Circuit -- is that 

paralegal services can't be compensable at market rates 

under EAJA because then paralegal services would be 

fully or largely compensable, while lawyers' fees to the 

extent that they exceed the cap would not be. And again 

there are two answers to that: First, the argument

incorrectly looks at EAJA from today's perspective when 

lawyers' rates generally exceed the fee cap.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The paralegals' 

rates would also be subject to the -- to the cap.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They couldn't go above the 

cap.

 MR. WOLFMAN: There is no question about 

that because -- because, Your Honor, they are attorney's 

fees.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. WOLFMAN: That's our submission. But --

but the problem with looking at it at the current 

vantage point, which is what the Federal Circuit 

essentially did, is that at the time EAJA was enacted, 

most lawyers --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask on that 

last point, does the government agree that the 

paralegals' fees are subject to a cap?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the government would 

certainly agree that if there are attorney's fees, they 

are subject to the cap. They are not willing to pay 

above the cap for anything.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, would insist.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, indeed, Your Honor. But

at any rate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they do not agree with 

the bottom line that they are subject to cap?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, what they believe -- the 

government --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- attorney's fees.

 MR. WOLFMAN: And I'm sure they can explain 

this better than I can. But what the government's 

position is, is that they are like an out-of-pocket 

expense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. WOLFMAN: -- reimbursable only at the 

cost to the lawyer. That's an interesting question, 

Your Honor, because one could -- one could posit a 

situation 20, 30 years out from now, if EAJA were not 

amended, where even the cost to the lawyer could exceed 

the cap. So, in a way, the government's argument sort 

of collapses upon itself. We -- we -- our submission is 

they are all attorney's fees and they are all subject to 

the cap. But let me go --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- isn't that one 

of the problems with your argument? Because there is 

something very strange about capping paralegal fees at 

the same amount that they would cap a lawyer's fees for, 

regardless of what that amount is and when they were

setting it.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, again, that's -- that's 

-- I took to be Justice Ginsburg's question and let me 

try to answer it. First, as I say, by -- by positing 

that's a strange situation, which we don't agree with, 

but even assuming it's a strange situation, again it 

looks at the situation from today's perspective, not at 

the time --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm looking at it from 

the perspective of the original enactment on your theory 

at that moment. These fees were legal fees, were 

attorney fees, and they were capped at the same amount 

that a lawyer's time was capped at. And that's just 

odd.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I don't believe it's 

odd. And, again, for two reasons: At that point --

again, you have to take the perspective where they are 

at. Lawyers' fees and paralegal fees were really capped 

at the same point, but all those fees were arrayed, by 

and large, under the cap so that there would be 

paralegal fees at a relatively low rate, junior 

associates at a modest rate, and the senior partner's 

closer to the cap.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, agent fees --

MR. WOLFMAN: By and large --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the problem exists 

whether or not you make paralegal fees attorney's fees, 

because agent fees are also subject to the same cap.

 MR. WOLFMAN: That is true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And agents were paid a good 

deal less than that.

 MR. WOLFMAN: That is true. That is another 

argument that could be made. Agents, who are 

individuals that are qualified by an administrative 

agency, in essence, to practice law without the 

supervision of a lawyer, they are also allowed fees 

under the administrative part of EAJA, but not under 

section 2412, which is the court part of EAJA.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You began -- and it's not 

just because of my notepad but because I'm interested --

you told Justice Ginsburg there are two reasons --

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- why the government's 

cap is wrong. And I'm not even sure you finished the 

first one. What are the two reasons?

 MR. WOLFMAN: I would love that opportunity, 

Your Honor. The first, again, is, -- and let me come 

back to this if I didn't get it out completely -- which 

is that, again, it's looking at the -- at the problem, 

if there is one from the -- the current-day perspective,

but what you had at the time, by and large, was that 

lawyers' and paralegal rates would be arrayed below the 

cap. It's just not something that would have been 

within the contemplation of Congress. But let me --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask you this?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing at the time the 

statute was enacted, paralegals' fees were not generally 

treated as lawyers' fees, but rather were disbursements, 

does that make a difference?

 MR. WOLFMAN: That might have made a 

difference, but that was not the case, Your Honor. In 

fact, what the Court pointed out in Missouri versus 

Jenkins, which was 1989, nine years later, paralegal 

fees -- it appeared to be that they were separately 

billed in about three-quarters of all law firms. In 

1980 it was probably fewer. There was a transition 

going on.

 But let me give you the Court's response to 

that problem in Missouri versus Jenkins, to the extent 

that it is a problem. And what the Court said was, 

whether they're separately billed or not, they were 

subsumed within the lawyer's rates like other forms of 

overhead. That's what the Court said in Missouri versus 

Jenkins. And the question of how they are billed

doesn't -- doesn't inform the question of how you 

interpret the term "attorney's fees." That's what the 

Court said in Missouri versus Jenkins and what it 

reaffirmed two years later in the West Virginia 

Hospitals versus Casey.

 Now, let me, if I could, get to the second 

point which Justice Kennedy asked me about. The second 

point is that the government's argument proves far too 

much, because under the Federal Circuit's theory, which 

the government has now adopted, the fees generated by 

law firm associates would also not be compensable at 

market rates because a much higher percentage of an 

associate's billed rate would also fall below the cap as 

compared to the senior partners in the firm. In other 

words, it doesn't help explain the problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is your 

point there that most associates are billed at less than 

$125 an hour?

 MR. WOLFMAN: No. That's not my point, Your 

Honor. My point is this: The -- the theory of the 

government's argument is that you would -- you would be, 

in essence, giving too much recovery to the lower -- to 

the lower-billed billing agents, whether they be 

paralegals, junior associates, and so forth. And it --

when you get up to the senior partners --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Too much money 

proportionally.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Proportionally.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Exactly. That's the argument. 

In all events, some of those various individuals' rates 

will be compensated under EAJA.

 Our point is that it proves far too much 

because the junior associates are much more like the 

paralegals than the senior associates at the largest K 

Street or Wall Street law firm. And my only point -- my 

only submission -- point in that regard is that it shows 

that the government's argument proves too much because 

it illustrates that the government's concern and the 

Federal Circuit's concern, the anomaly that they have 

pointed out, has nothing to do with the statutory term 

"attorney fees" and nothing to do with paralegals, per 

se. It's the phenomenon that's at work is the fact that 

the rate -- the hyperinflation in the legal services 

market as a whole has outstripped EAJA. That's the 

phenomenon on which the Federal Circuit, in truth, was 

relying, even though they put it to the paralegal 

question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If -- if paralegal charges 

are not fees but are other expenses, what would be the

standard for determining the rate at which they would be 

compensable? Would it necessarily be cost under this 

statute or would it simply be what is reasonable?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that's -- that's an 

excellent question. I think it, in part, undermines the 

government's position because what happened here is that 

the Federal Circuit and the Board of Contract Appeals 

below said, well, it's cost to the lawyer, and we are 

going to do an Internet search and we are going to find 

what paralegal salaries are and divide it by the 

requisite number of hours in any year. And we are going 

to make it $35 an hour, and we are going to determine 

that's the cost to the law firm.

 But, of course, that's -- that's not the 

cost to the law firm. What about the overhead? What 

about the rent, utilities, and so forth, what about 

benefits? So what you would have is a very complex cost 

analysis.

 Now, you're suggesting, Your Honor, that we 

could do it on some vague notion of reasonableness. But 

the problem is that the -- the fee-shifting statutes 

either look to market rate or actual cost. But what is 

interesting about the actual cost argument here -- and 

that's true across the entire range of fee-shifting 

statutes -- and what's interesting about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This problem is going to 

exist anyway, isn't it? I mean, even if you don't cram 

paralegals into the other expenses, there are going to 

be other expenses that are in the other expenses.

 MR. WOLFMAN: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're going to have to 

have this same problem -- and what about the overhead 

and so forth?

 MR. WOLFMAN: No, that is -- with respect, 

Justice Scalia, that is not correct because the problem 

here is -- and I'm using your words -- is that the 

government is cramming a in-house professional 

services -- service into a place where no court 

virtually in the history of American jurisprudence has 

ever put it. Out-of-pocket --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if -- if it's simply 

reasonableness -- because I don't see anything in the 

statute that says that all non-fee expenses are 

compensable at cost -- if it's simply reasonableness, 

would it be possible to say that what would be 

reasonable would be a rate that preserves the ratio 

between attorneys' fees and paralegal fees that existed 

at the time when the statute was enacted so that you 

wouldn't have the problem of attorneys being compensated 

at the same rate as paralegals?

MR. WOLFMAN: Let me -- let me answer that 

in two ways: If you were to preserve the ratio, then it 

seems to me that the -- in many markets, the paralegals 

are going to get right near the cap anyway or, you know, 

between $75 and $100, because we know that many lawyers' 

rates are well above the cap -- if you preserve that 

ratio --

JUSTICE ALITO: No. No. If the ratio -- if 

lawyers were -- I know that if lawyers were compensated 

at $125 an hour when this was enacted and paralegals 

were compensated at $75, then it would be a 2-1 ratio, 

and you'd preserve that.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes. You could do that, and 

what you would have is just a static rate for all 

players in the market, and there's no suggestion that 

Congress intended that. After all, I using the term 

"prevailing market rates" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Am I to understand, you 

claim that even if they are expenses, they should --

they should be paid for at market rate, don't you?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, not quite market rate, 

but this goes to -- I said I had two responses to 

Justice Alito's question.

 And the problem is that when we talk about 

out-of-pocket expenses, again, which is where the

government is trying to shoe-horn the paralegal 

services, we talk about out-of-pocket expenses for the 

client, for the prevailing party. Expenses, whether 

they are out-of-pocket expenses or attorney fees are --

are awarded to the prevailing party, and the cost faced 

by the prevailing party is the cost to the prevailing 

party, what it paid for the paralegal services.

 Now, that will approximate the market rate, 

no question about it. It might not always be synonymous 

with it.

 Justice Alito, I am not suggesting that 

Congress could not have done it that way, but there is 

no suggestion that it did. After all, in this statute, 

compared to other fee-shifting statutes, it specifically 

said it wants to work at the prevailing market rate. 

And the only reason that in some markets for some 

lawyers the -- the ceiling, the cap has become a floor 

is because of hyperinflation in the legal services 

market. It has nothing to do with the compensability of 

paralegal services vis-a-vis junior associates, as I've 

mentioned.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolfman, if there's 

any discretion in the district judge in setting the 

amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate 

to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an

hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer 

is $200? Does it do the same thing with the paralegal? 

The true market rate is X, and we're going to knock it 

down so that it will match the knock-down for the 

lawyer?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the reason for that 

is -- is that there -- there is no suggestion at all 

that that's what was being contemplated in this statute. 

And that may be the way that if you had seen this 

phenomenon that's developed, which again is 

hyperinflation in the legal services market, you might 

have written it that way.

 It's true that the courts have discretion. 

There's always a reasonableness factor. But the 

overriding factor is the market rate. The Congress said 

"prevailing market rate." And to me, that would be 

outside the bounds of any discretion that had been 

afforded.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it likely that 

when Congress said that, it was not thinking of 

paralegals.

 MR. WOLFMAN: No. I think -- I don't think 

-- with respect, I don't think that's the question. 

Going back -- that takes us back to Missouri versus 

Jenkins, and what the Court said there is that you have

this word "attorney's fee," and the way of thinking of 

attorney's fees is to include everything that goes into 

the labor of the attorney that ultimately gets billed to 

the client and that paralegal services are an aspect of 

that.

 Two years later, in West Virginia University 

Hospitals, the Court made -- made essentially the same 

point again, which is that -- that at the time that all 

these fee-shifting statutes were passed, paralegal 

services, to the extent that they existed, were 

traditionally subsumed within the lawyer's rate. And so 

that once law firms started billing for them 

separately --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. 

"Traditionally subsumed in the lawyer's rate," are you 

suggesting, when this statute was passed, they weren't 

billed separately to the client?

 MR. WOLFMAN: No. I'm not suggesting that. 

I'm saying traditionally, well before they were passed, 

they were subsumed to the market rate. There -- there 

came to be a tradition, roughly in the '70s and early 

'80s, for the separate billing. And what the Court held 

emphatically in Missouri versus Jenkins was that the 

separate billing didn't tell you anything about whether 

there were attorney's fees.

Let me -- let me -- if I could extend my 

answer a little bit. Appreciating what the government's 

argument is here, the government's argument is that if 

the paralegal fee, the paralegal services, are subsumed 

within the lawyer's rate, if there were a law firm out 

there that still didn't do the separate billing, that 

would be compensable as an attorney's fees when billed 

within the lawyer's rate. But if they're billed 

separately under EAJA, the government's position is 

they're not compensable at lawyers' rates.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that's no loss 

to the government because when you put it into the 

lawyer's rate, you hit the ceiling for the lawyer's rate 

that much sooner.

 MR. WOLFMAN: That is true --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems like that would be 

MR. WOLFMAN: -- but that was not true in 

1980.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. WOLFMAN: And that's the point we are

day and age --

wouldn't have gotten as high as the cap?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely. If you -- in most 

markets for most lawyers -- we deal with this 

extensively in our brief. We cite case after case to 

this effect. And I think -- and I don't mean to be glib 

here -- I think the way to put this, that in 1980 and 

1985, that the statute covered virtually all lawyers' 

fees rather comfortably on Main Street, if not 

necessarily on K Street and Wall Street. I mean -- and 

that's what the statute was for.

 I know it's hard to appreciate that now, 

when we see, you know, very high rates from the large 

law firms, but put yourself back in that perspective, 

which is -- in that vantage point, which we try to do in 

our brief.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that our decision 

will in part drive the market either way, what we do 

will effect the way paralegals are used, the way billing 

is done. If that is true, is there some utility in 

simply following the EAJA so we give a consistent signal 

to the market and then if Congress wants to change it, 

it can? I mean --

MR. WOLFMAN: I'm not sure I understand the 

question.

mean follow 1988, follow Jenkins. Follow Jenkins.

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I certainly think 

there's utility in doing that, and Congress can revisit 

this. The difficulty is that Congress has not revisited 

it. And Congress could revisit this and make -- I think 

it's -- it is clear right now that the -- the purposes 

of the statute are not being fully carried out because, 

again, of the hyperinflation in legal services.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there some 

disutilities from an economic standpoint in having two 

structures: Jenkins for one kind of cases, EAJA in the 

other cases as the government wants?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Is there some --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there some 

disadvantages to the system?

 MR. WOLFMAN: I -- of course, we don't think 

there are, but the -- to be candid, the -- the Federal 

Circuit pointed to one purported disadvantage. The 

Federal Circuit claimed that to the extent that there 

was some incentive that would be driven by a contrary 

decision, it would be that lawyers would shunt off more 

work than is efficient to paralegals, and it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- I saw 

that analysis. This Act only applies when the 

government's position is not substantially justified.

People are not going to structure their billing 

arrangements assuming the government's position is not 

even going to be substantially justified.

 MR. WOLFMAN: I certainly agree that it is 

unlikely, but as we point -- very unlikely. I agree 

with that, Mr. Chief Justice, but there is another point 

that I would make that we cover quite extensively in our 

brief, which is that -- which is that -- I think you 

have to step back and think about that for a second, 

what the Federal Circuit did.

 The notion that lawyers are going to shunt 

off work to paralegals that they wouldn't otherwise 

have, there are -- runs head long into both economic and 

ethical constraints on the profession. Economic, 

because if that was occurring, i.e., people were --

lawyers were giving paralegals work that they could not 

sensibly do, clients would, one, insist that work not be 

allocated like that; or, two, take their business 

elsewhere. That's the economic constraints. If, in 

other words, the whole premise --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That point makes 

some assumptions about the relative abilities, say, of 

junior associates and senior paralegals, and I'm not 

sure are well founded.

 (Laughter.)

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

will -- I believe that you have greater experience on 

that than I do.

 But I think the other answer to that is the 

ethical constraints. Even if there weren't economic 

constraints -- I mean, as we pointed out in our brief, 

sure, the paralegal profession has become an impressive 

one. They do a lot of things that lawyers used to do, 

no question. But a lawyer can't shunt off work that 

they can't handle because there are ethical constraints.

 I can't, for instance, give a paralegal, 

say, responsibility for -- principal responsibility for 

writing an appellate brief. I could not or would not do 

that because they can't do that, generally speaking, 

because of their training and experience.

 So I just think that just falls apart. And 

as you say, Mr. Chief Justice, the fact that -- of the 

substantial justification defense and other reasons as 

well, it's unlikely -- and this gets back to Justice 

Kennedy's questions -- unlikely that law firms will 

structure their practices and businesses around this 

problem.

 The real problem, though, is not an attack 

on the government fisc, as we point out in our brief.

Circuit's decision would be negligible. It's worth 

noting, though, that the Federal Circuit's decision 

would have an impact on clients most affected by it.

 Three groups comprise the great majority of 

EAJA applicants: Small businesses like Richlin, 

disabled veterans, and disabled Social Security 

claimants. In all three situations, clients will lose 

if paralegal services are awarded at the cost of those 

services to their lawyers. For the latter two groups, 

veterans and Social Security claimants, Federal law, in 

fact, requires that EAJA -- that the EAJA fee be paid to 

the claimant.

 So, although it makes economic sense for 

paralegals to work on significant aspects of Social 

Security and veterans' cases -- and that's set out at 

some length in the amicus brief of the National 

Association of Legal Assistants -- the claimants will 

lose those fees under the government's view of EAJA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that pertinent --

is that pertinent on the cap questions we've been 

discussing too? I mean, if you're representing a 

disabled veteran, is the lawyer typically charging more 

than $125 an hour?

 MR. WOLFMAN: No. This is how it works, and 

that's why I said Federal law provides for this. And

let me give you the citations. They are also set forth 

in footnote 2 of this Court's decision in Scarborough.

 The way the Social Security and veterans 

situations work -- and, again, they comprise the 

majority of these cases -- is that the Federal law 

allows the lawyer to take a contingent fee out of the 

back benefits, not to exceed 20 and 25 percent of the 

veterans' or Social Security claimants' back benefits, 

respectively.

 But then what Federal law also provides --

and the citations are Public Law 99-80 section 3 and 

Public Law 102-572 section 506(c) -- Federal law 

provides that to the extent that there is an EAJA fee, 

the lawyer may not double-dip and has to send that fee 

directly back to the client. So for these relatively 

impecunious claimants, essentially chopping the 

paralegal fee in third or in half or something like that 

would have a real impact on claimants.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I would not say no one 

else, but not everyone else places the importance on 

legislative history that I do, but I do. And I saw here 

that the Senate Judiciary Committee considered all these 

arguments, they wrote a report; and they sided with the

of the Court that -- is that that piece of legislative 

history accompanied vetoed legislation. But let me also 

say that, and we explained this at some length both in 

our opening and reply briefs, that the government relies 

on a snippet saying that paralegals -- paralegal 

services can be awarded, and then it says paren, at 

cost. But there are a number of other aspects of that

same piece of legislative history that point in exactly 

the opposite direction in terms of market rate recovery, 

and in fact the Court cites -- excuse me, the committee 

cites a case from the Sixth Circuit, the Northcross 

case, in which paralegal services were awarded at market 

rates.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And of course they 

may mean -- may have meant costs to the client.

 MR. WOLFMAN: And that is -- and that is my 

next point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that it said "at 

cost," but at whose cost? And the problem here, is that 

this piece of fee shifting statute and every other fee 

shifting statute of which I am aware awards a fee to the 

prevailing party. The purpose of the statute is not to 

enrich the lawyers. The purpose of the statute is to 

provide incentive for lawyers to handle cases on behalf 

of clients. Unless the Court has any further questions, 

I'll reserve the balance of my time.

two distinct categories of litigation expenses against 

the United States: fees and other expenses. The most 

natural reading of attorney's fees is one that embraces 

an attorney's time, payments for an attorney's time, 

whereas the broader term "other expenses" naturally 

encompasses outlays that are paid by an attorney during 

its representation of a client including the cost of 

paralegals whose work may be necessary for the 

preparation of a client's case.

 Congress recognized this distinction between 

attorney's fees and other expenses when it enacted EAJA 

in 1980. The relevant Senate report, like EAJA's House 

report, stated that the ceiling on "attorney's fees" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say the relevant 

one was of course on a legislation that wasn't passed, 

right?

 MR. YANG: Actually this is even before EAJA 

lacks the first time, this is upon EAJA's initial 

enactment in 1980, there was a Senate report and a House 

report and both have functionally identical language. 

The Senate report states that quote, "attorney's fees 

relates only to the compensation of lawyers themselves" 

and then goes on to explain that costs connected with 

their representation of a particular interest in a 

proceeding is not affected by the limitation that is the

cap on attorney's fees. When Congress then re-enacted 

EAJA after its repeal, Congress again made clear -- and 

this is the report that, Mr. Chief Justice, you were 

referring to -- made clear that the "other expenses" of 

EAJA fees includes an attorney's out-of-pocket expenses, 

and that those out-of-pocket expenses were illustrated 

by the specific example of paralegal time being 

reimbursed at cost.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is cost? Could you 

-- one could say I'm going to look at the Internet and 

come up with $35 dollars an hour, or you could say in 

the case of a paralegal there is a part of the overhead, 

there is the fringe benefits -- so just giving the 

hourly rate is deceptive of what the actual cost is to 

the law firm, because the law firm has to add on to 

determine what in fact it's paying for the paralegal, 

the fringe benefits and part of the overhead.

 MR. YANG: Justice Ginsburg, the government 

agrees that more than simply salary would be 

reimbursable at cost. And I think the appropriate way 

to calculate cost in the context of paralegals would 

be -- would parallel how the government calculates its 

cost for attorneys when the government seeks attorney's 

fees. And what the government does is it uses salary as 

a baseline and then adds -- for the government 29 or

approximately 29 percent of salaries for other benefits. 

And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well and it might be 

quite different for private practitioner. Your benefits 

for health care will probably cost you a lot less than 

private practice and doesn't that make the paralegal 

fees quite different than the other items of expenses 

that are listed? You know, expert witnesses, you get a 

bill, that's how much it costs the lawyer. Studies, 

analysis, engineering reports, you don't have to figure 

overhead benefits with respect to any of those. All of 

a sudden you throw in another item, paralegal costs, you 

put those under costs, and now you've got to go through 

this elaborate calculation that is going to be not worth 

it, almost, for a typical firm representing a small 

client.

 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure 

that I agree with some of the premises that you had. 

First, with respect to the analysis and reports and 

such, those are not always things that are done outside 

a law firm. The statutory text, in fact, allows the 

reimbursement of costs for any study, analysis, report, 

test or project; it's not limited to things that are 

done outside of a firm. I mean also be --

an engineering report would be outside the --

MR. YANG: Well, that's an engineering 

report, except for maybe, some intellectual property 

firms but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the 

question is a valid one, that you're running away from 

the question.

 MR. YANG: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'll let you answer. 

It suggests this further inquiry. Suppose that a solo 

practitioner knows that a paralegal in another firm is 

very good at this and he asks the other lawyer, may I 

use your paralegal, and he just sends that lawyer the 

bill. What -- how would that be billed under your view?

 MR. YANG: Well, there is now two questions 

in the air.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They both -- they both 

apply, they both apply to outside experts.

 MR. YANG: Well, when a paralegal is 

outsourced, which is your question, there is two 

potential situations. One may be that the paralegal is 

less expensive, and if that were the case you would 

think that firms would normally outsource their 

paralegals if it's less expensive to obtain them from 

the outside than the inside.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

wasn't Justice Kennedy's question. His was the 

outsourced paralegal is better at a particular task.

 MR. YANG: The outsourced paralegal is 

better, it may be that the actual cost to the firm is 

the cost that the firm pays for that paralegal to the 

third party.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well in that case it would 

bill the paralegal in the same way it would bill, I take 

it, the expense of, let's say, having water tested in a 

pollution case. It would -- it would -- I take it it 

would bill the client dollar for dollar what it had to 

pay.

 MR. YANG: In fact that's right --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And add --

MR. YANG: And not add profit on to that --

that paralegal as well.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They don't add a profit and 

they don't add a profit on to -- to travel expenses and 

things like that.

 MR. YANG: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- so if that is so, in 

each case cost means cost to the client, and you're 

coming up with a new category of expense, which is cost 

to someone else, and why should there be a subcategory

of expense, in which cost does not mean cost to the 

client when every other category of expense does mean 

cost to the client?

 MR. YANG: Justice Souter, every other 

category does not mean cost to the client. In fact, 

EAJA specifically provides for fees, but the fees are 

based on the prevailing market rates for similar 

services.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because there is a separate 

provision for fees.

 MR. YANG: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. YANG: But in that context a client does 

not incur any legal fees, have any obligation to pay any 

fees, and courts routinely award EAJA fees when there 

has been no cost to the client in fees, and similarly, 

even if the client has an obligation to pay the cost in 

those circumstances -- where for instance a firm is 

providing pro bono services or a legal services 

organization is providing pro bono services to a client, 

the client does not have to incur or pay the costs.

 The question is whether those costs have 

been ultimately incurred and have been incurred at the 

rate that the firm has incurred the cost on behalf of 

the client.

JUSTICE STEVENS: At this discretion, let me 

ask this question. Maybe it's the same question Justice 

Kennedy asked, but I want to be sure of your answer. 

Suppose you had independent firm of paralegals. I don't 

know whether the market contains them, but it surely 

could. A firm that they are all paralegals, and they 

then bill the law firm at their own hourly rate, and 

then the law firm in turn bills the client. In that 

situation, would the market rate of the independent firm 

of paralegals govern?

 MR. YANG: It would be the rate that is 

ultimately paid. If you're outsourcing the paralegals 

it would be the rate paid by the firm for those 

paralegals. Now it may also be, for instance --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I understand the 

government's position that the -- the result would 

different if a firm uses its own paralegals as opposed 

to outsourcing?

 MR. YANG: The result is not different, Your 

Honor. The result is the same in the sense that the 

firm's cost --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. But under my example 

they would be paying the market rate for paralegals, and 

I think you say they could be reimbursed for that.

 MR. YANG: It wouldn't necessarily be the

market rate. It may would be what they are paying, 

which may well reflect the market rate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they are not market 

to make business. I presume the paralegals would charge 

the going rate.

 MR. YANG: If they did.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I assume that they also 

charged the market rate.

 MR. YANG: It may be. But if it's the 

market rate, there would presumably be no incentive for 

a firm to outsource --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But again, you're not 

answering the hypothetical. Let's assume two cases: 

Case A, you hire an outside paralegal at $85 an hour. 

He is outside, he is independent. He is just like the 

expert engineer in the Chief Justice question, $85 an 

hour. Case two, it's your own paralegal. The 

prevailing rate for which you charge general clients is 

$85 an hour.

 Why should there be a difference?

 MR. YANG: There should be a difference, 

Your Honor, because with respect to outsourced firms, 

there is no concern that a firm is going to add, well --

if the firm is only going to bill at its cost, the firm 

is not going to add additional profit to the outsourced

paralegal.

 So if, for instance, a firm paid $85, under 

our view the firm could not turn around and charge $95 

to the client. Likewise -- and the reason that this is 

important under your context --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under your -- they 

can't even charge $85 an hour.

 MR. YANG: Well, that's correct if their 

cost, actual cost would be less in house. And the 

reason that's important is because in EAJA, unlike 

section 1988, there are several statutory differences. 

One, EAJA provides for other expenses, so the term 

"attorney's fees" is not the only terms that needs to be 

construed by the court. Other expenses needs to be 

construed in a manner that gives it meaningful effect.

 And Congress recognized, again, in the 

legislative history to the extent you could disagree on 

the meaning of other expenses, Congress was very clear 

both in 1980 and then again in 1984 that other expenses, 

attorney's fees do not include things that attorneys pay 

and only compensates attorneys for their own hourly 

rate.

 And the reason that the fee cap was 

important is because EAJA, as this Court recognized in 

Underwood, is not intended to be fully compensatory. If

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know you said that a 

few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to 

me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees 

and costs -- and costs is very limited in the statute in 

1920 -- and if you have attorney's fees and other 

expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than 

costs within 1988. So I -- I would think that, well, 

EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more 

items.

 MR. YANG: Justice Ginsburg, under Jenkins' 

rationale, Jenkins recognized that when there is not 

another -- another box of other expenses, where in a 

statute which was intended to be fully compensatory, 

that attorney's fees necessarily must include 

compensation for all types of costs that a lawyer might 

incur in the presentation/representation of a client. 

That works for Section 1988.

 But if that rationale were applied to the 

EAJA context, if attorney's fees were given the same 

meaning in EAJA, there is little or no work for other 

expenses to be done in the statute, because already 

you've pushed all of those expenses into the box of 

attorney's fees and --

this question only arises when the position of your 

client was not substantially justified. Now under 

those -- and it was designed, to some extent, to 

penalize you because -- because of that fact. Why 

should we adopt a construction that, in effect, 

penalizes the client who has had to face the Federal 

Government when the Federal Government's position was 

not substantially justified? They are going to have to 

pay the paralegal fees at market rates, but they are 

only goes to get compensation at cost.

 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, the reason 

that you would adopt our construction is because 

Congress is balancing more than the intent to provide 

compensation for prevailing parties in EAJA. It was 

also intending to balance the effect on the Federal fisc 

and limit the government's exposure as a means of 

passing the Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of a 

stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law 

that only applies to individuals or small businesses 

where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that 

we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat 

paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate. 

I suspect that was not foremost in their mind.

 MR. YANG: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

the legislative history illustrates that, in fact, 

paralegals and other costs --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it assumes 

that when they said "costs," that they meant costs to 

the firm as opposed to costs to the client. And that, I 

think, is entirely an open question.

 MR. YANG: Well, the relevant page of the 

legislative history in 1984 that you're talking about 

explains that Congress wanted to adopt the views of the 

Administrative Conference in its model rules, and goes 

on to quote the Administrative Conference --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not to belabor the 

point it meant that the people who drafted the Senate 

report may have meant that.

 MR. YANG: Well, that's a problem with all 

legislative history.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think it is a 

problem with legislative history.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think that the people in 

Congress who hired their staffs pay attention to what 

the staffs say in precisely the same way that any other 

executive --

legislation into law, which is what he was required to 

do before it became law and which he did not do under 

the prior bill?

 MR. YANG: The President did not express a 

view, but what we do know is that the legislative 

history in 1984 dealt with language that was identical 

to that ultimately passed by the Senate -- by Congress 

and signed by the President. And that legislative 

history explains and quotes the Administrative 

Conference that says that what should be awarded is an 

award of reasonable expenses of the attorney.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any other 

case where we used -- I mean it just gets worse and 

worse. Do you know any other case where we've used the 

legislative history of a vetoed bill to determine the 

meaning of a later bill that was not vetoed?

 MR. YANG: Yes, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Good. What is it?

 MR. YANG: This Court has twice cited 

unanimous opinions, the same report that we cite here, 

one of which was in the Jean opinion. In fact, the 

Court not only cited the Senate report, but also cited 

the House report to the 1984 bill.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean that wouldn't be 

surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because 

you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14 

sections and section of the B bill could have been 

vetoed -- been vetoed because of problem with Section 14 

and repassed without Section 14, in which case the 

legislative history for the other 13 sections would be 

highly illuminating as to what they mean.

 MR. YANG: In fact Congress recognized that, 

Justice Breyer, when it re-enacted -- when it 

readdressed the bill in 1985, the relative legislative 

history specifically references the bill that existed 

before that it was reported by --

JUSTICE BREYER: The question that I had in 

respect to this statute is -- is that my impression and 

here -- I'd like to know how they bill secretary's 

times. I'd like to know how they bill rent. And my 

thought is -- and I want to be either verified or told 

I'm wrong and explain it, that when you have no cap, the 

lawyer and the client want to shove everything possible 

into the rubric attorney's fees, including the kitchen

sink, if the plumber is there in the kitchen of the law 

firm.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's fine. No problem. 

There is no other way to get paid for them.

 But where you have a cap, you should shove 

everything the other side, if expenses are going to be 

paid for it, because that cap means that the lawyer will 

not get his full pay back and therefore, the lower the 

cap, the more you want to be sure it's covering only 

that lawyer's time. And everything else goes into 

expense so that you can pay the lawyer adequately and he 

will recover his expenses elsewhere.

 Was that the theory of this bill? Is there 

any evidence that that was the theory? If you did it 

that way, would anything get mixed up?

 MR. YANG: Well, the theory of the bill was 

that attorney's fees would be based at prevailing market 

rates, and that prevailing market rates would embody a 

certain set of costs that might be reimbursed. I would 

think that the prevailing practice is not to bill 

separately for the kitchen sink, but as the Court 

explained in Missouri versus Jenkins, Missouri's 

analysis would extend to your hypothetical, Justice 

Breyer. It explains that reasonable attorney's fees had

to cover all kinds of costs, including the costs of 

secretaries, messengers, librarians or janitors who 

might well be cleaning the kitchen sink.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right that when this 

language first came in -- this is in relation to Justice 

Breyer's question -- there was no cap? When did the --

when was the cap put on?

 MR. YANG: The cap in EAJA was imposed from 

the very beginning.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was.

 MR. YANG: Yes. It was. It was in the 

Senate bill. It was -- it was removed by subcommittee, 

reinserted by the full judiciary committee, passed the 

Senate, came over to the House and continued on for 

passage in 1980.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be a lot of 

weight to be put on three little words: "Billed at 

cost." If you just read those words, you could be the 

costs to the client, the cost to the law firm and then 

you'd have to go to this further document, the 

Administrative Conference document, it's rather thin I 

think.

 MR. YANG: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we are 

relying not only on the 1984 but also on the 1980 

legislative history, which although it does not

specifically refer to paralegals, explains that in 

connection with the term "attorney's fees" and the 

ceiling on attorney's fees -- and I'll quote again from 

the Senate report, which was the first: Ceiling on 

attorney's fees relates only to the compensation of 

lawyers themselves. And then goes on to say: That does 

not include other costs connected with their 

representation of a particular interest in a proceeding.

 And when Congress did that, it specifically 

recognized that it was taking a different approach than 

that taken in other fee-shifting statutes. The very 

next sentence explains that the committee notes that 

this section is not intended to limit or affect the 

computation of reasonable attorney's fees under any 

other provision of law, and gave as an example the Civil 

Rights Act. That is section 1988.

 So Congress knew from the very beginning 

that its treatment of attorney's fees as being limited 

only to attorneys and the larger more capacious category 

of other expenses, capturing all other costs that an 

attorney might incur in the representation of a client 

was one that was both different from other statutes, and 

one that was intended by Congress. And it's not 

reflected not only by the legislative history, but again 

by fee caps.

The fee caps I believe you started here were 

specifically designed and set by reference to attorney's 

rates, the exceptions to the fee caps -- again 

specifically reference attorneys. There is an exception 

that you can exceed the fee cap when there is a limited 

availability of the attorneys qualified at the 

proceedings involved. And it would be anomalous in that 

context where Congress has paid particular attention to 

the billing rates of attorneys, set the cap based on 

attorney's rates with no reference to paralegals to 

assume --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back --

MR. YANG: -- that Congress intended --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to the 

point, because I think you were cut off before you went 

into the full legislative history. I'm still concerned 

about the argument that even if they are not fees but 

rather costs, that the costs should be those that are 

billed to the client. And you think there is some 

conclusive answer in the legislative history that that's 

not the case.

 MR. YANG: Well, the legislative history

talking about, both the Administrative Conference rules 

and the quotation of the Administrative Conference rules

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which took place when?

 MR. YANG: This was in 1984.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: At that time were they 

billing paralegal's fees at cost to the client? Was 

it --

MR. YANG: In fact, Your Honor, there was a 

dispute that the legislative history speaks to the 

controversy that evolved regarding the -- whether other 

expenses of the term would include more than what was 

specifically enumerated in the statute. And what we 

cite to in our brief as a footnote at page 28, footnote 

12, there was a dispute. Several courts had concluded 

that paralegals were reimbursed at cost. In fact, the 

Northcross decision, which the committee reports, 

specifically references -- concluded that it was costs 

to the attorney, as this Court recognized in Jenkins. 

Footnote seven of Jenkins discusses the Northcross 

decision and explains that Northcross awarded 

out-of-pocket expenses for attorney's fees at the cost 

to the attorney.

 And so, when you take that controversy which 

had evolved regarding how you compensate these other 

expenses -- and specifically paralegal expenses -- along 

with Congress' statement that it intended to compensate

out-of-pocket expenses incurred with connection to a 

case, the model rules and Northcross when you combine 

that with the statement that paralegals are to be 

compensated at cost, seems clear to us that Congress is 

intending that in contrast to attorney's fees, which 

have a profit element embedded in them and a profit 

element capped by the fee cap that Congress imposed in 

1980 -- that when read together, it seems fairly clear 

to us that Congress intended --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Every expense that's 

reimbursed at cost has a profit element in it for 

whoever performed the service.

 MR. YANG: But when it's within the control 

of the firm --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Business or otherwise.

 MR. YANG: -- within the control of the 

firm, there is a particular danger that the firm can 

inflate its own costs. Whereas when it's going out to 

the market, of course, it's not going to control the 

profits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe this is 

the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't --

I didn't grasp the answer. Under your system it would 

make sense for lawyers to charge separately for 

photocopy services, telephone services, so on because

then they are not going to be subject to the attorney 

fee cap. And they may think, look, the difference 

between cost and market rate is relatively small; the 

difference between our hourly rate and $125 is large.

 MR. YANG: You're asking about the 

incentives that firms might have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm just 

saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be, 

I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as 

I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for 

things at a higher rate than their cost? They will 

charge higher rate for photocopy services because they 

try to factor into it overhead and things like than 

cost.

 MR. YANG: Overhead profit. We don't 

believe it's actually going to change any practices, 

because ultimately, when you're looking at what costs 

are reimbursable under EAJA, it has to be costs that are 

not traditionally already paid for in the attorney's 

fees. So you have to look not to the practice of the 

specific firm that's at issue, you have to look at the 

prevailing practice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would say --

I would say that it's now traditional for firms to 

charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it

cost them.

 MR. YANG: Well, if that's the case under 

our reading, of course, we would -- we would say that 

that is -- that is not a type of expense that was 

contemplated by EAJA, because Congress already provided 

for profits that attorneys get from representing a party 

within the attorney fee and cap that.

 The whole idea of a cap is to limit the 

reimbursement that a firm might get from EAJA below what 

the prevailing market rates for the services would be. 

If the -- the prevailing market rates were below the 

cap, the cap never comes into play. The only reason for 

that cap is to limit compensation below market rates. 

And it would be anomalous to allow --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the cap doesn't apply 

to expenses, does it?

 MR. YANG: I didn't catch you.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The cap does not apply to 

reimbursement expenses at cost?

 MR. YANG: Precisely, because in our view 

expenses are at cost and it is not -- you don't have the 

same danger of having firms imbedding profit within 

their own rate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me just the 

opposite just as the Chief Justice suggests. It seems

to me you're creating an incentive for the firms to --

to charge as much as they can -- I mean, under market 

rates for everything under the -- under the time of the 

lawyer himself.

 MR. YANG: But again, and under our view if 

they were to -- if a firm were to charge, say, 50 cents 

for a photocopy and it only cost 10 or 15 cents for that 

photocopy, under our view the firm would only be 

reimbursed for our for the 15 cents. The not an 

incentive to bill the client for anything more --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, because other costs 

reasonably interpret to include overhead. It's not just 

the paper and the accounting time.

 MR. YANG: Overhead, we don't believe, is 

fairly attributable to a particular case. And, in fact, 

Congress was specific about this particular point on 

overhead in the legislative history.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you 

missed my point. It was even if you're right, 50 cents 

and they can only charge 15 cents, they have an 

incentive to separately charge for photocopying, because 

they get the 15 cents, and otherwise it's going to --

they are going to lose it over the cap if you say no 

that's part of the attorney's fees.

extent there would be incentive to shift out costs even 

though there would be less of an incentive than shifting 

out costs plus profit. But the reason that -- that 

the -- the reason that we think that that's a bit 

different is because, again, Congress intended for the 

profit making part of a -- an attorney's compensation to 

come out of attorney's fees, and then are capped. And 

there is very little incentive to -- to shift out fees 

unless the market itself is already doing that. And if 

the market itself is already billing for photocopies, 

then that's what you're going to get. Even if you 

didn't separately charge for photocopies as part of your 

rate, you could bill under EAJA. The market is 

providing for photocopies being billed separately, you 

can simply submit a request for photocopies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you have a -- you can 

submit it a letter. I've looked in your brief, I can't 

find this Jean case that you mentioned on use of veto.

question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman. 

Isn't there -- doesn't it make sense to take a word like 

"attorney's fees" and like the word "discrimination," we 

have many different anti-discrimination statutes, but 

there has been an attempt to give that word 

"discrimination" the same meaning in all those statutes. 

And here the term attorney's fees, if it means that 

includes all of them, in terms of 1988, why not say 

every time attorney's fees comes up, that's what it's 

going to mean?

 MR. YANG: As a general rule, in 

fee-shifting statutes that are like Section 1988, that 

is in fact the rule. But the rule that similar words 

are given a similar meaning readily yields when there is 

indication that Congress did not intend the same to 

apply here, and in fact for instance in the Fogerty 

versus Fantasy case, the Court specifically rejected the 

approach of adopting the understanding of reasonable 

attorney's fees applied in other fee-shifting statutes, 

because it found that the policy and legislative history 

of the Copyright Act required or at least suggested that 

Congress intended something else.

 And here, not only do we have a different 

legislative history, we have fundamentally different 

statutory text. There is a second category of other

JUSTICE ALITO: Well on that point, does the 

statute say that all non fee expenses are compensable at 

cost? Or are you arguing that the work that's done by 

paralegals is a study or analysis project?

or analysis or at least analogous to that type of a -- a 

JUSTICE ALITO: Which is it, is it a study 

analysis or project? That seems like a strange way of 

describing it.

 MR. YANG: It can be -- it can be a project, 

for instance in this case, the paralegal compiled the 

relevant information regarding how much wages needed to 

be developed, repaid on the merits of the case, how much 

taxes needed to be reimbursed. That could be understood 

as a project, particularly when Congress has modified it 

with any, the word "any" before.

 MR. YANG: I -- I asked this question. I 

have not been able to determine that we have ever billed 

paralegal time separately. Normally, like every other 

litigant in a normal fee-shifting statute that would 

provide for attorney's fees, and again, just the way the 

government calculates it, it is based on overall costs 

per benefit, ends up some percent of salary. There is 

an attorney fees that benefits -- percentage and a small 

overhead charge as well. For the attorney's fees, not 

separately for paralegals.

towards the beginning of his argument. He said that, 

that if the Federal Circuit weren't affirmed, that there 

would be no meaning to the term "other expenses," but 

that's just not so; it would begin to lose its meaning.

It means things like travel, long distance 

phone, copying, the types of things we think of as 

out-of-pocket expenses. The problem here is they are 

shoe-horning a -- the government is shoe-horning what is 

always conceived of as an in-house professional service 

as an out-of-pocket expense, and it just does not fit 

there.

 Let me turn to the legislative history and 

I'd like to do two things with that before I close. The 

first is, let's presuppose that it should be given some 

weight, as Justice Breyer has suggested, and the problem 

is that it just doesn't bear the weight that the 

government gives the report. If you look at -- and this 

is discussed at length at page 12 of our reply brief --

let's turn for instance to the administrative conference 

report. Here's what it says. It's a 46 Federal 

Register 32913. It says that: With regard to expenses, 

they should be compensable whenever the lawyer, quote, 

"ordinarily charges clients separately for such 

expenses." That's the situation today with paralegal 

expenses.

 Then it's true that the ACUS, the 

administrative conference, did not issue a hard and fast 

rule with respect to paralegal expenses. But that of 

course is because the market wasn't uniform at that time

as it is today. Today it's nearly ubiquitous that 

paralegal services are -- are separately billed. But 

listen to what the court said --said: Indeed, we 

decline to issue because, quote, "practices with respect 

to charging clients for paralegal time vary depending on 

locality and field of practice."

 But that statement reflects exactly our 

position. That the rule the Court embraced in Jenkins 

is that the compensability of paralegal services should 

replicate prevailing practices in the market.

 Now let me just end by -- by -- on this 

note. If, there is also the question raised about 

whether you should give any weight to this -- this 

report at all. We say that you should not for the 

reasons, essentially in Justice Scalia's last question 

on that topic; but we do -- we do talk about why the 

Jean decision use of that report does not wear the 

weight that the government gives us, and that's on pages 

13 and 14 of our brief, our reply brief. And the reason 

is, is because in Jean, no one brought to the Court's 

attention in any of the briefs the problem that the --

that legislative history accompanied vetoed legislation. 

It was never brought to the Court's attention. In the 

Scarborough case three years ago, neither the majority 

opinion nor the dissent cited that report.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I think 

Justice Breyer is correct, isn't he, that there was no 

reason for the Senate to sort of redo a report that they 

had already done on a bill that was substantially 

identical?

 MR. WOLFMAN: That might be true in some 

circumstances, but that's not what happened in 1985. 

There was an extensive House report accompanying that 

legislation. There was no Senate report. The House 

report --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was no Senate 

report because they had done it just the previous year.

 MR. WOLFMAN: I think not, Your Honor. 

There were some other things taken up in the House 

report and the House report, quite extensive, says 

nothing; it's silent on the question of paralegal 

services.

 Look, let me just say as I close -- may I 

answer the question?

 Let me just say as I close that -- that if 

the Court wishes to look at that report, at the very 

best for the government, it's a wash. Thank you very 

much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel, 

the case is submitted.
