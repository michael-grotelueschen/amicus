 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in 06-340, National Association of Home 

Builders versus Defenders of Wildlife, and 06-549, 

Environmental Protection Agency versus Defenders of 

Wildlife.

 Mr. Kneedler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act 

provides that the Environmental Protection Agency shall 

approve an application by a State to administer its own 

NPDES program unless EPA finds that the state's program 

does not satisfy nine criteria that are addressed to 

whether the State has the legal authority under State 

law to carry forward with the program.

 There's no dispute in this case that 

Arizona's program satisfies those criteria. The Ninth 

Circuit nonetheless set aside EPA's approval of 

Arizona's program. The Ninth Circuit held that EPA 

could not approve Arizona's application unless it first 

insured that there would be in place under Arizona's

administration protections equivalent to those that 

would be applicable under Section 7 of the Endangered 

Species Act when EPA itself issues permits. That 

holding is inconsistent not only with Section 402(b)'s 

mandatory directive, it's also inconsistent with Section 

7 of the ESA itself.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take the case and --

I'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the 

other side -- on the assumption that if the nine -- the 

factors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no 

discretion to withhold the transfer?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That is our position, 

and that I think is clear from Section 402(b). It says 

that the administrator shall approve unless he finds 

that the state legal authority criteria are not 

satisfied. I should also point out that that's 

reinforced by 33 U.S.C. 1251(b), which expresses a 

strong preference for State protection of waters and in 

particular states that it's the policy of Congress that 

the states administer the NPDES program.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How long has that been the 

government's -- the EPA position? How long has that 

been the EPA's interpretation of the statute?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, until 1993 when the 

vast majority -- by the time -- by that time the vast

majority of transfers or approvals had already taken 

place. There had never been consultation, at least that 

we're aware of under Section 7 of the Endangered Species 

Act. EPA did consult with the wildlife agencies on six 

programs but after the Fifth Circuit -- from then until 

-- until this one, but after the Fifth Circuit's 

decision in the American Forestry case, EPA never tried 

to impose any obligations on a State under Section 7 of 

the Endangered Species Act.

 What it did is, EPA and the Fish and 

Wildlife Service worked out between themselves certain 

arrangements by which EPA would look at endangered 

species considerations, but it never conditioned the 

approval of a State program after the Louisiana program 

struck down in the American Forestry decision in 1998, 

on the states having in place certain protections. And 

in fact, I think EPA would not characterize what it did 

even in the Louisiana programs as the sort of condition 

that the Fifth Circuit understood.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Has that always been the 

EPA's position? Because there's an allegation in one of 

the briefs that you changed your position in this Court, 

to change the position you took even in the lower courts 

at issue. Is that --

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I'm -- there may be two

different things that, referring to it. Section 7 

imposes an obligation on Federal agencies in their own 

actions not to jeopardize -- or to ensure that their 

actions are not likely to jeopardize a species. 

Ancillary to that, there is an obligation on Federal 

agencies to consult with the fish and wildlife agencies. 

As to the consultation obligation, as I mentioned, EPA 

has engaged in consultation from 1993 until --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But your position was they 

didn't have to?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Our position now is that it 

did not have to, but -- and more fundamentally our 

position is that because the transfer or the approval of 

the State application is mandatory if these nine legal 

authority criteria are satisfied, EPA could not withhold 

approval of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is 

the consultation is a waste of time?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Basically, yes. If in the 

end EPA could not disapprove the State's application, 

and since consultation is ancillary to the substantive 

obligation not to jeopardize --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there a difference 

between denying the application because the Endangered 

Species Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and

saying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get 

your application. But then, so it's not just automatic 

that the thing becomes the State's domain rather than 

the Federal. But isn't there something rather detailed 

called a memorandum of agreement that's worked out, and 

couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be 

accommodated that way instead of saying one statute is 

out the window, even though EPA in a number of states 

has made an accommodation.

 Why couldn't the Endangered Species Act 

concerns be reflected in that memorandum of agreement?

 MR. KNEEDLER: The memorandum, the 

memorandum of agreement, is called for under EPA's 

regulations as really a procedural mechanism for the EPA 

and the State agency to work out the practicalities of 

the State's administering the program. They typically 

address such things as how the State agency will furnish 

EPA draft permits and that sort of thing, time 

limitations for EPA to look at, who to contact at the 

State agency.

 It's essentially procedural in order to 

facilitate EPA's continuing oversight role. It's not a 

vehicle for EPA to impose substantive obligations coming 

from other statutes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point is why

can't it be?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Because we think that would 

been consistent with Section 402(b), which requires, 

which requires the EPA to approve the transfer.

 Now, if a State agency chooses to cooperate 

with Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA in the Department 

of Commerce with respect to species under its 

jurisdiction, that is all fine. And I should point 

out --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't the ESA require 

something more than voluntary cooperation? I mean, you 

quite rightly emphasize the mandatory nature of the 

approval under the Clean Water Act. But the Endangered 

Species Act mandate seems equally unconditional.

 MR. KNEEDLER: It's unconditional with 

respect in our view to actions that are within the 

agency's discretion or consequences that the agency will 

cause. But more fundamentally in response to your 

question, Section 7 imposes obligations only on Federal 

agencies, not on State agencies. Like 402(b), it is a 

federalism-sensitive --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize that that's your 

point. But doesn't that sort of beg the question? 

Because it's not that anyone is suggesting here, I 

think, that under the Endangered Species Act the Federal

Government can keep control or that the Federal 

Government can in effect provide guarantees of what may 

happen in response to some future development proposal.

 What I think they're arguing is that when, 

when, when the agency gives the approval, it should 

require that there be some kind of procedure in place on 

the part of the State so that when problems arise the 

States will probably respond to them with the same 

values in mind that the feds would.

 And the question is why cannot the 

Endangered Species Act be enforced in that way, to 

require, in effect, an advanced mechanism before, in 

effect, the whole business is turned over to the States?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as to the latter, we 

don't believe that EPA can condition the transfer. But 

let me point out that in 2001 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I know you say you don't 

think they can do it. But the problem is we've got two 

statutes each of which is mandatory. And your response 

seems to be, well, we'll give full effect to one and we 

will ignore the other. And I don't see how that is a 

tie breaker. And why do you not have an obligation to 

do what you can with respect to the Endangered Species 

Act?

 MR. KNEEDLER: First of all, with respect to

the Endangered Species Act, the memorandum of agreement 

that was entered into in 2001 between EPA and the two 

Federal wildlife services does furnish a way in which 

after the transfer EPA can take into account endangered 

species considerations within the scope of its --

JUSTICE SOUTER: At which point EPA doesn't 

have any authority left under the Clean Water Act.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, that's not correct. 

Under Section 402(d) EPA has the authority to object to 

a State permit. And if the -- but to do so on, based on 

a determination that the State permit would not satisfy 

the guidelines and requirements of the Clean Water Act. 

So if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That begs the question 

because the concern is the enforcement of the Endangered 

Species Act.

 MR. KNEEDLER: With respect to water quality 

issues that might affect an endangered species, EPA 

takes the position -- and I think it's correct -- that 

EPA can object to a State permit where that permit would 

not comply with State water quality standards that are 

necessary to protect the endangered species.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't they get that in 

the memorandum of agreement up front?

 MR. KNEEDLER: EPA doesn't need the State's

agreement to object to a State permit. That is 

authority --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it doesn't, but isn't 

it the case that if it's in the agreement up front the 

odds are better that the State will address it, as 

opposed to the State ignoring the problem, requiring EPA 

then to take affirmative action to object?

 MR. KNEEDLER: And I wanted to get to the 

further mechanisms that are in place under EPA 

regulations and the memorandum of agreement.

 JUSTICE SOUR TER: No, but would you answer 

my question first? Isn't it likely that the States are 

going to respond or deal with the problem if they have 

an obligation in the memorandum of agreement right up 

front?

 I suppose. But let me, let me, let me 

explain what is in place. EPA's regulations require 

that a State furnish its draft permits to the public, 

but also specifically to the Federal wildlife agencies.

 That gives Fish and Wildlife Service an 

opportunity to comment about endangered species concerns 

that may be raised by the draft permit.

 The regulations also require the State 

agency to take into account the comments that are 

submitted by anyone, including the Fish and Wildlife

Service and NOAA. Those provisions built in allow the 

Federal agencies to bring their concerns to the State 

agency, and I think there is every reason to believe 

that the State agencies will --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there an obligation on 

the part of the State agency to take reasonable action 

in response to them, or can the State agency simply sit 

there, listen with a tin ear and then do whatever it 

wants to?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Those regulations do not 

because they are procedural. Then what happens if the 

State agency does not respond to the concerns raised or 

does not remedy the concerns raised by Fish and Wildlife 

Service or NOAA, EPA is notified and EPA can then try to 

work it out with the State agency, or, failing that, EPA 

can object to the State permit if it does not satisfy 

the Clean Water Act standards.

 And again with respect to water quality, 

those standards are set at a level that is necessary to 

protect endangered species. So as far as water quality 

impacts are concerned, EPA retains complete control 

under its ability to object to the permit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You are in effect saying 

that the, that the, that the enforcement of water 

quality standards is, in effect, the indirect answer to

the problem that the other side raises? That's the way 

it's done?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It is. EPA --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except to the extent that a 

project may be endangering a species, not by reason of 

change in water quality but, for example, by destroying 

habitat, constructing a dam or that sort of thing.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Upland habitat, if it's water 

habitat, water quality standards. EPA has to approve 

State water quality standards. It consults with Fish 

and Wildlife Service and NOAA in doing so to make sure 

endangered species would be protected by the water 

quality standards. And then each individual State 

permit is measured against those water quality standards 

to make sure they comply.

 So therefore, with respect to water quality, 

Fish and Wildlife Service agreed that the mechanisms I 

have just described would take care of any Endangered 

Species Act concerns.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you referring to, in 

what you just described about the cooperation among the 

Federal agencies, to what has been called in their 

brief, it's referred to as a coordination agreement?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, the 2001, February 22, 

2001, agreement between EPA and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that agreement, I 

take it from what you just said, is in full force? EPA 

hasn't retreated from that agreement and it will 

continue to --

MR. KNEEDLER: That is correct. And some of 

the things I described were embodied in EPA regulations 

aside from the agreement, including an agreement that 

State agencies furnish draft permits to Fish and 

Wildlife Service and take into account comments that are 

received in return.

 Justice Scalia is correct that, that the 

impacts that would not be covered by this would be 

non-water quality-related impacts on upland habitat. 

But in our view that simply reflects the nature of the 

Clean Water Act and under 402(b) it is a Clean Water 

Act. It deals with water quality, and we do not believe 

that EPA is authorized to withhold the approval or 

condition the approval of a transfer of permitting 

authority to a State on the basis of what the State will 

do with respect to upland, upland habitat.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Which is the -- the later 

act is the Endangered Species Act?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Essentially, the Endangered 

Species -- there was a subsequent amendment to 402(b), 

but for these purposes -- but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that control?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Because it is -- we do not 

think it repeals -- it's essentially a repeal by 

implication question.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you can just as 

well say that if it does not control then there is an 

exception by implication, the exception being based on 

the prior act. Neither of them is particularly 

satisfactory, but neither answer gives you a reason to 

ignore the problem.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Beyond that, Section 7 of the 

ESA is a generally applicable statute, whereas Section 

402(b) speaks specifically and comprehensively to the 

question of Federal approval of State programs. We also 

think this would be a particularly unlikely candidate 

for an exception to that because EPA's approval of the 

State program does not result in any immediate 

on-the-ground consequences. That would only happen --

or in-the-water consequences. That would only happen if 

after the transfer the State agency actually issued, 

issued a permit. So what we're talking about is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but by that very 

reasoning you could say that if assurance are required 

that the Endangered Species Act is going to be honored, 

that does not in and of itself prevent any development

program. Each, in effect, is a kind of mechanism for 

dealing with something that may happen in the future.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could go back to 

the point I was making earlier, that we think that the 

central thrust of the court of appeals' opinion and 

Respondent's position here is that EPA could not 

transfer the authority unless it and the State together 

replicated the sort of protections that were in place 

when EPA itself administered the Endangered Species Act. 

And as I said, that's inconsistent not only with 402(b), 

but with Congress's federalism-sensitive judgment, to 

impose the sort of substantive and procedural 

administrative requirements in Section 7 of the ESA only 

on Federal agencies, not on State agencies.

 And let me also stress that this does not 

mean that the rest of the ESA is inapplicable once a 

permitting program of the State is approved. The 

central provision of the ESA, the prohibition against 

taking endangered species act and other provisions 

against trading in them and importing, exporting, all 

those remain applicable. Those are the generally 

applicable provisions that prohibit the taking 

of endangered species.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand very well your 

argument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they

transfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is, 

we look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything. 

And now we look at our own authority and if they get --

start mucking around with this, we can refuse the 

permit. And besides that, we have a memorandum of 

understanding and the memorandum of understanding or 

whatever it is, agreement or something, is going to be 

they're going to pay as much attention as we are. So 

they'll pay attention to this, too, and if they don't we 

have an enforcement mechanism. So no problem; we are 

not putting any species in jeopardy. We satisfy the 

standard. I've got that part of the argument. I think 

I paraphrased it pretty well.

 The part I don't get is then you say, 

anyway, we don't have to do any of this because it says 

"shall transfer," therefore, it's not discretionary, 

it's mandatory. That part I don't get because there are 

nine standards there and it seems to me to say that is 

rather like saying, well, the ICC used to say you shall 

let the railroad build a spur, provided it's in the 

public interest, convenience, and necessity.

 I mean, are you suddenly saying every 

statute that uses the word "shall" is not subject to the 

ESA?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it would

require a statute by statute evaluation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But we think this one is 

particularly clear.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, my problem with saying 

it's clear is that they have nine criteria. One of the 

criteria is you look to five other statutes, which they 

have their own criteria and one of those criteria is you 

have to be certain that the State will assure the 

protection and propagation of a balanced population of 

shellfish, fish, and wildlife.

 And by the time you get through those nine 

criteria, I don't think you'd have to be too imaginative 

a lawyer to figure out ways that they involve everything 

the ESA involves. So if there ever was an act prefaced 

by the word "shall" where the ESA would apply, you would 

think it would this be this one, which has to do with 

water, environmental protection, nine criteria, many 

vague, and they use words like "wildlife," "shellfish," 

et cetera.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Several, several responses to 

that. Those cross-references -- first of all, 402(b) 

looks only to whether the State has the legal report 

under State it law. Among other things, it requires a

of the State to establish that the State actually has 

the authority to administer.

 And the references to, cross-references to 

fish and wildlife that come from incorporating other 

provisions have to do with the setting of the standards 

or setting -- under section 302, which EPA has never 

invoked, setting certain supplementary effluent 

standards to protect fish and wildlife. Those are the 

standards. EPA does not evaluate the state's water 

quality standards in deciding whether the State has the 

legal authority under 402(b) to administer the program.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Of the states to whom a 

transfer has been made how many have agreed to comply 

with this provision of the Endangered Species Act?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm not sure. I don't think 

JUSTICE ALITO: In the memorandum of 

agreement with the states to whom transfers have been 

made, in some of them, is there not language in which 

the State has agreed that we'll consult with Fish and 

Wildlife --

MR. KNEEDLER: There was, there was in the 

Louisiana memorandum of agreement that was involved in 

the Fifth Circuit's American Forestry decision, and it 

was that provision that the Fifth Circuit held was

unlawful on two grounds. That, that memorandum of 

agreement basically said we're trying to do something 

analogous to Section 7 of the ESA when the State is 

administering the program; and the Fifth Circuit said 

that went beyond EPA's authority by conditioning the 

approval on the State putting in place a compensation 

arrangement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned a whole 

string of states, I think, Texas, Florida, Maine were 

mentioned as states that -- in connection with the 

transfer of the permitting authority had conditions that 

made the Endangered Species Act applicable.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's not correct, 

Justice -- Justice Ginsburg. What, after the Fifth 

Circuit's decision, EPA never tried to impose on a State 

an obligation to go forward in the same way that EPA, or 

even in a similar way that EPA would under Section 7 of 

the Endangered Species Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what was done in 

Texas, Florida and Maine?

 MR. KNEEDLER: They all provided what I've 

described to Justice Souter, that -- that the 

pre-existing ESA, EPA regulations require that draft 

permits be furnished to the, to Fish and Wildlife and to 

NOAA, and that they take into account the comments by

Fish and Wildlife and NOAA. That doesn't come from the 

memorandum of agreement or -- or -- or EPA's memorandum 

of agreement with the states. That's something that 

comes from the regulations. Everything else --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that, would that apply 

in this case? Would that apply to Arizona?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And, and the 

biological, the memorandum of agreement in this case 

applies to all State-administered programs including 

those that were approved by EPA before 1993. This is a 

nationwide memorandum of agreement.

 And the basis --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, may I ask a 

question about the memorandum of agreement? That's kind 

of a new concept that I have a little difficulty 

following.

 Is there -- is that, is one of the nine 

conditions of approval that the State enter into a 

memorandum of agreement?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it is -- no it is not. 

The memorandum of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there not a regulation 

that issues, that requires the states --

authority for the regulation?

 MR. KNEEDLER: 33 U.S.C. 1314(i) allows --

provides -- excuse me -- for EPA to establish 

guidelines, basic guidelines, minimum standards for 

State programs and -- part of that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if -- what if the 

State just refused to enter into a memorandum of 

agreement? Would that, could that be a ground for 

refusing to transfer decision?

 MR. KNEEDLER: If, if the, if its refusal 

was based on an objection to things that are within the, 

within the legitimate scope of a memorandum of 

agreement. I think that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just says don't want -- it 

just says we don't want to enter into a memorandum of 

agreement, period.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yeah. I -- I think -- I 

don't think EPA has ever confronted that. But I think 

it probably, it probably could be denied, but the 

regulations do not -- as I recall -- specifically 

condition the approval of the program on the memorandum 

of agreement.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that require the making 

of a memorandum of agreement.

hesitate to say that EPA could not -- could not insist 

on that, but it's important again to come back to the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But how can that be 

consistent with your shall argument?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Because there's a separate 

authority for the, for the, for EPA to issue guidelines 

for minimum, minimum standards for State programs, but 

those have to do with -- with communications with EPA 

and sort of running a program. And it's not a vehicle 

as I said before for EPA to impose new substantive 

requirements outside the Clean Water Act on the State. 

And that's why if -- that's why if EPA insisted that a 

State enter into a memorandum of understanding that 

basically said we will, we will act like EPA does under 

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act under the 

administration of the program, I think the, I think the 

State agency would be entitled to decline to enter into 

that agreement. And again that's essentially what the 

Fifth Circuit held in the American Forestry case, and to 

what extent we agree with the American Forestry 

decision.

 If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of 

my time.

Mr. Glitzenstein?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC R. GLITZENSTEIN,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court.

 I particularly start off with the memorandum 

of agreement that was just being discussed, and to, I 

think, at least try to clarify an answer, I think, to 

Justice Ginsburg's question about compliance with that 

memorandum of agreement. If you look at page 260 of the 

NAHB appendix that was filed along with the petition, 

one of the elements of that memorandum of agreement is 

that there would be compliance with Section 7 of the 

Endangered Species Act when there were transfer 

decisions being made by the EPA. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this? Would you 

MR. GLITZENSTEIN: This is page 260.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of --

MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Of the NAHB appendix, 

which is -- there are two volumes of that appendix, 

Justice Scalia. Volume one was pages 1 to 317, which is 

the white cover volume, and I can quote from the 

paragraph that I was referring to. And it's the first 

full paragraph and it reads --

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: 260, I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 260.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: 260, around.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I got it.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: And it's the first full 

paragraph and it says: "EPA's current practice is to 

consult with the Services where EPA determines that 

approval of a State's or a Tribe's application to 

administer the NPDES program may affect federally listed 

species." And they actually complied with that 

memorandum of agreement in this case when they consulted 

in response to the Arizona application.

 Now, this memorandum of agreement which 

Mr. Kneedler just represented to the Court is continuing 

to be complied with, specifically provides the 

mechanisms by which the Clean Water Act and the 

Endangered Species Act will be reconciled and will be 

harmonized. This language was adopted after notice and 

comment proceedings. It is reflected not only in the 

application and the final decision made in this case, 

where once again the EPA said point blank, we are 

required to comply with Section 7 of the Endangered 

Species Act; but essentially the same understanding of 

the Agency's legal duties and how they would be

reconciled was set forth in all these past consultation 

decisions that are described in the decisions below and 

our brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can that be read just to 

apply to any, any State permits that -- that violate 

Clean Water requirements? As opposed to upland habitat 

which -- which might be affected?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: There's certainly there's 

nothing in the memorandum of agreement that says that. 

But can I just add a critical point on that, 

Justice Scalia? The Government's position now is that 

it doesn't matter. Their new position in response to 

Justice Stevens's question about the change in position, 

before the Government came to this Court, they never 

previously suggested what they're now saying, which is 

that Section 7(A)(2) consultation obligations and the 

no-jeopardy prohibition don't apply at all to these 

transfer decisions.

 So this distinction between aquatic species 

and upland species, which may be an interesting one to 

explore, we would submit on remand, is not the current 

reflection of their position. Their position now is we 

could have something causing the extinction of aquatic 

species as a result of a pollution impact but we are 

under no obligation to even take a look at that under

the seemingly mandatory requirement of Section 7.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how do you feel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not quite 

right. They would look at that in the context of 

reviewing the permits that are issued by the State 

agencies.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, and I think 

that's where we seem to have a little bit of a 

disconnect. The assumption that Mr. Kneedler seems to 

be making is the end of the consultation process that 

Section 7 requires, not the beginning of it. The 

purpose of the consultation process is to avoid 

conflicts with other statutory obligations, note to 

create them, and indeed as that memorandum of agreement 

language suggests, the consultation process has been 

used precisely --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, what he's 

suggesting is there isn't going to be any impact on any 

endangered species until a particular permit is issued 

by the State agency, and that those permits are 

submitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service for their 

review.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: That's correct, Your 

Honor. But to go back to the suggestion that I think 

Justice Souter made, what the agencies have done in the

past, and this is a situation where we don't have to 

speculate about whether the agencies can comply with 

those statutes. They have done it. They've worked 

these problems out. And what they have done when 

they've consulted, if you go back and look at the 

underlying consultation documents, they've spelled out 

exactly what Your Honor just suggested should be the 

approach. They've said, all right, when we issue these 

permits under Section 402 -- under 402(b) and do we 

exercise our oversight responsibilities under 402(d), 

here are the species we are going to pay special 

attention to. For example, in the Maine delegation, one 

of the principal species of concern was the Atlantic 

salmon, which they were concerned about because of 

impacts from the aquaculture industry. What they did in 

the biological opinion prepared as a consequence of that 

consultation was not say, we're not going to let this 

transfer go through. They said we have this oversight 

ability. We're going to work out with the Fish and 

Wildlife Service the mechanism by when those permits 

come to our attention, as they must under section 

402(d), we will discuss the circumstances and criteria 

for objecting to those, we will go to the State under 

the following circumstances, and say we think this 

permit is going to cause the jeopardy of the species --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that those are in 

place. As I understood Mr. Kneedler to say that that's 

exactly what they, what they continue to do.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, and again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that has nothing to do, 

as the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him, 

that has nothing to do with, with whether they have to 

issue the NPDES authorization.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: And I guess the point I'm 

trying to make, Your Honor, is that the Court's 

fundamental obligation when it has two statutes that 

have shall provisions, is to see if there's a way they 

can be reconciled and worked out. And What I'm saying 

is that the consultation process has been and should be 

precisely the process where those kinds of issues will 

be reconciled and that's exactly how this process is 

working. So for the Government to come in and say let's 

not use the process that 7(a)(2) calls for, in order to 

try to avoid the problems, is to really put the cart 

before the horse in the most, I think, obvious way 

imaginable.

to on page 260? I read that paragraph, and I don't see 

anything in it that imposes any obligation whatever on 

the State. It is just a description of what -- what EPA 

is, is going to do.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same kind of 

consultation with Fish and Wildlife that, that 

Mr. Kneedler described to us.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think, Your Honor, and 

I think that's critical. I think we're making some 

assumptions here that, at least on our side, we're not 

making. We're not assuming that the outcome of the 

consultation process has to be to impose new conditions 

on the State. One of the outcomes of the prior 

consultation process with Maine, with Texas, for 

example, was to spell out how the Service and EPA would 

address their post-transfer concerns.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But this is talking about 

consultation when the permit is -- the permit 

application is issued. Not consultation at the, at the 

stage of approving the State plan.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: With all deference, Your 

Honor, it says: "The current practice to consult with 

the Services where EPA determines that approval of a 

State's or Tribe's application to administer the

program. And I think there is concession by the other 

side that that in fact was a reflection of what the 

practice was. They were consulting on the actual 

transfer of the programs, and the reason they were doing 

that, Chief Justice Roberts, was to do exactly what Your 

Honor is suggesting, that is to work out a mechanism 

beforehand, so that when the State permits are being 

issued, the agencies would know how to address their 

concerns.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point -- the 

point is that it's the issuance of a permit under the 

program, whether administered by the Federal Government 

or the State government that has the potential for 

jeopardizing endangered species. It is not the 

administration of the program. And EPA has in place the 

procedures to allow them to review the particular 

permits, which what is what might jeopardize an 

endangered species. And they don't need to leverage 

their limited authority, their non-discretionary 

authority to approve a transfer, to have that authority 

to review the actual act that might jeopardize an 

endangered species.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: That's true, Your Honor, 

but again I think what the Court may be doing is 

assuming that this consultation process is somewhat more

draconian than it frequently turns out to be. If the 

only outcome of the consultation process under Section 

7(a)(2) is for the Fish and Wildlife Service to reach 

some understanding with EPA, it says when these permits 

are issued by the states, here are the circumstances 

under which you're going to lodge objections, because 

we're the expert agency on species. And I think this 

record shows what we're talking about.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying 

that the consultation does beyond the nine factors that 

are listed in the statute?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: No, Your Honor. I think 

what we're saying is that consultation goes to the 

separate obligation under 7(a)(2) of the Endangered 

Species Act to address the impacts on a listed species. 

And if I could --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that beyond the 

nine factors?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: I don't think -- I think 

what it is is an effort, as there's been discussion 

here, to reconcile two obligations, both of which 

Congress felt were important. And that's exactly what 

the agency has done in other circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I understand that. 

But when they sit down and they have the consultation,

is it proper for the EPA to say now, we're consulting 

with you, but only with respect to the nine factors, as 

to permits that are issued by the states afterwards, but 

then that's something else.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, and Your Honor, 

just on that point, I found the Government's reply brief 

a little bit odd, because I think consistent with the 

questioning from Justice Breyer, it acknowledges for the 

first time that these factors do encompass some 

consideration of wildlife impacts. But putting that to 

one side, I think it's very important to compare what 

they're arguing now with how they dealt with other 

cross-cutting legal obligations. If you look, for 

example, at how they dealt with the Indian trust 

responsibility -- I'm only bringing this up by way of 

analogy, because I think the government's position is, 

oh, we're trying to elevate the Endangered Species Act 

to some exalted status, and in fact all we're saying on 

this administrative record is that's the same status 

that they accorded to other cross-cutting legal 

obligations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what is your position 

as to the propriety of the EPA's saying what I've said 

in my hypothetical instance? If they -- they say we're 

going to consult with you but we want to make it clear

we're only talking about the nine factors.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think that my argument 

is that the Endangered Species Act on its face says that 

it prohibits jeopardy or the result of habitat 

destruction, critical habitat destruction, for any 

agency action that is authorized, funded or carried out. 

Our view is that they should first look to the Clean 

Water Act criteria and factors. We think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you are at 

issue with the government on that point.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: We are, Your Honor. What 

I will say to you, with all respect, Justice Kennedy, 

and the reason I bring up their other legal obligations, 

and I think it also reinforces the value of a remand in 

this case, so some of the issues raised by the 

government's new position would be flushed out in the 

administrative process. If you look at joint appendix, 

page 203, when Native American tribes wrote to the 

agency and said we are concerned about the impact of 

this transfer on Native American historic properties and 

cultural and religious attributes, the EPA did not write 

back and say well, we're sorry, Native American tribes, 

that doesn't fall within the nine criteria.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is -- is 

there any limitation? Let's say that EPA says we're all

set to approve this transfer, except OSHA sent us a 

letter and they don't like the occupational safety rules 

you have at the State environmental agency; so until you 

change those rules, or enter a memorandum of agreement 

that you're going to change those rules, we're not going 

to approve the transfer.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think the line, Your 

Honor, is whether you've got another crosscutting 

obligation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, like the OSHA 

act. It says, you know, the states should do this, and 

they're not doing it. So EPA can leverage their 

approval into any area of law?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Again, Your Honor, I 

think the first problem is, with that question is that, 

I don't mean to be evasive, but I think the problem is 

you're assuming the outcome of the analysis, which is 

that they'll have to impose some new condition on the 

State. With the Native American tribes, they didn't do 

that. They didn't impose any condition on the State. 

They said we'll have an agreement with the Native 

American tribes that when we exercise our oversight 

authority, we will look at the impact upon --

say no. So if they say no, presumably they're going to

have to impose the obligation as a condition of

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Yeah. And what I will 

say, Your Honor, is we think that in the past they have 

been able to work these problems out. But if they 

can't, I think it's important to recognize that Congress 

created a mechanism precisely for the very 

rare situation where there is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the -- what I'm 

trying to figure out with Justice Kennedy's questions 

and your answers is, is there really an issue here? And 

I'm beginning to see maybe there is an issue when you 

said what are they talking about. Can you -- it's a 

cactus. They're kidnapping cactus, as apparently 

happens. And if in fact this cactus, if the thing is 

transferred to the State, that cactus is going to 

disappear. Now that isn't fish. It isn't wildlife. It 

isn't water. It's a cactus.

 So can you take that into account? Is that 

theoretical? I think they're trying to raise this 

question of, suppose you know the IRS, that if you mail 

a refund check at the time, the person who gets it is 

going to use the $500 to destroy the last salamander in 

the world. Okay? Now there we are, endangered species. 

Does the Act apply to the IRS? I would have thought the

answer's no.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: The answer is no, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And then I would have 

thought the same reasoning is true here, but what the 

Act tells you to do is read your existing authority, but 

read it in light of informed by the endangered species 

objectives language, et cetera.

 And now I wonder if with that approach, is 

it possible that even the cactus could fall within the 

nine criteria? You're not going to depart from them but 

you're going to read them generously in light of the 

objective of the Endangered Species Act, which is itself 

an environmental objective. Now how does that work? 

Can you do that? You're an imaginative lawyer. Can you 

do it?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, I think you can.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. The answer is 

you can. Then are you satisfied with this result in 

this Court? One, it can be read that way. They're not 

going to agree with that. It can be read that way, and 

therefore, it applies. The ESA, the Endangered --

Two, that means they consult.

 But three, the result of the consultation 

here which has been done means there's no real objection

to the transfer, because it's virtually inconceivable 

given the weapon that the EPA has, withdrawing permits, 

given a memorandum of agreement, given the possibility 

of supervision, given the fact that the wildlife service 

will object, writing them a letter or a phone call 

immediately, given all that stuff, there's simply no 

reason to believe that Arizona will fail to protect 

endangered species.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think that's a good 

summary of what has happened with these consultations, 

and on the cactus --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what's your view of an 

opinion that roughly wrote what I just said?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, I think the concern 

I would have is that I think it goes beyond what's 

necessary here because we're not dealing, everybody 

agrees, with some purely ministerial situation like that 

one.

 I think the other critical factor here, Your 

Honor, that we haven't talked about, is the funding of 

this program. And it's very interesting when the 

government points out, if I can just get across to the 

Court I think a critical citation, because the 

government says funding is not before us. And the 

reason they say that is because it didn't need to be

before us when they took the position that authorization 

of the program was sufficient to trigger their 

consultation duties. And in a footnote in their reply 

brief, they say pay no attention to funding, which is of 

course a discretionary activity, because that's 

completely separate from the decision to authorize. If 

you look at 40 C.F.R. Section 123.23(3), and I 

apologize -- this is a response to their reply brief 

point so there's not any appendix before the Court --

but it specifically provides that funding opportunities 

are part and parcel of the decision to authorize the 

program.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you're 

talking about. Funding of what?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Funding of the NPDES 

program carried out by Arizona that had to be approved 

in order to allow --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How does the government 

fund it?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: They have to -- there's a 

-- Section 106 of the Clean Water Act provides the EPA 

with an opportunity, and it's certainly not mandatory, 

to provide funding to a State. And this is 40 

percent Federal -- we're not talking about de minimis 

funding. So it's one thing for the State to say well,

it should get the program. It's another thing to say 

funding. And just to be clear about this, this is an 

argument we're making to reinforce the propriety of 

remand in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you have 

other -- let's assume that I disagree with you on 

whether they could withhold approval of the NPDES 

transfer. Even so, I think you -- the point you're 

making now is that apart from that approval, there were 

other discretionary actions taken here, one of which is 

this funding; and another one of which, I believe, is 

whether -- never mind the MOAs, but -- I have it written 

down here, one of the other ones. Oh, whether existing 

permits would be transferred to State authority or not. 

And that is apparently discretionary and can be -- what 

do we do about that?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, we suggest, Your 

Honor -- and I think this goes back to Justice Stevens's 

question about the change in position. I think we're in 

an odd position in this Court quite frankly because we 

have an administrative record where the administrator 

conceded a duty to comply with Section 7 of the 

Endangered Species Act. We have a new position here 

saying they don't. And we think funding and the other 

example you came up with is a good reason why a common

sense result in this case is to say we have a change in 

position, there are new issues brought to the fore. As 

a consequence of that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

about changing position? Have you agreed and conceded 

that the nine statutory criteria are satisfied?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: We have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You shift back and forth 

on that point.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, let me be 

clear about that. We never conceded that. What 

happened --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view now? 

Are they or are they not?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: I think that there are 

actually arguments that, especially with regard to the 

wildlife related parts of the criteria, that are not 

satisfied. Let me -- let me try to explain why we 

didn't feel it necessary to argue that in the court of 

appeals.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Before you say why you 

didn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of 

expected you might agree when I though maybe you have 

hooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on. 

But it was the other half, which I think is what

Justice Stevens is saying now. I read through this 

record, not completely but pretty well, and I couldn't 

find a single thing that would suggest that Arizona 

presents any risk to you. And so, what is the risk to 

an endangered species that you're actually worried about 

there? And you rather -- I didn't think you'd like to 

agree with that, but I want to press you to find out 

what actually is the problem.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: If I can give Your Honor 

some citations to the record, I think it will help 

answer that. On page 54 of the joint appendix, the Fish 

and Wildlife Service biologists, the expert agency 

employees, said that there would be significant effects 

to survival and recovery of listed species through a 

destruction, degradation and fragmentation of habitats. 

They specifically pinpointed the flycatcher, the 

southwestern willow flycatcher is a species that could 

be devastated. That's at page --

JUSTICE BREYER: And how would that happen? 

How would it happen that they would get rid of the 

flycatcher in Arizona, considering the fact that they 

have laws themselves that protect endangered species, 

and that's a bird, and a bird is wildlife; and so if 

they decide they want to kill all their flycatchers, 

which I would doubt, you could intervene at EPA and stop

them. So how is that actually a problem?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, the concern 

that they had was that the mechanism that had been used 

to protect these wildlife species, and particularly 

plant species, which I want to get to in a moment, 

because I think actually the concern is even greater 

with plants, was that the consultation on federally 

issued permits had in effect been used, and this was not 

conjectural, they had been used to safeguard 

considerable habitat for these species. And if I could 

turn actually to the water level, which is I think 

actually our best example, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's not enough. 

Why wouldn't -- what would lead you to believe that it 

wouldn't -- that the same would not happen when the 

State issued the permits? I mean, you have to show some 

reason why we don't trust Arizona to do what the Federal 

government's doing.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, it is not a 

question of trusting them. I think part of the outcome 

of the consultation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well then, you have to 

establish jeopardy. You have to establish jeopardy. 

And the mere fact that you're giving it to a State which 

Congress has been willing to trust with implementing

this law is not enough to show that there's jeopardy. 

Prima facie, we would expect Arizona to do the right 

thing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Just as a technical matter, 

don't they have to show there's no jeopardy?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. The 

burden is on the Agency in the consultation process. 

And it's at, as TVA versus Hill makes clear, the benefit 

of the doubt is accorded to the species. But, could I 

try to answer that question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: We're not saying we don't 

trust the State. And In fact, one of the outcomes of 

one these prior consultation processes has been where 

it's appropriate, the service works had an agreement 

with the State where it says here are our concerns where 

the expert Federal agency, we listed these species, you 

didn't. Part of it's expertise, not trust. And in 

fact, if the State comes back and says we understand, 

we'll deal with that problem, that is one aspect of a 

consultation process that the government is now saying 

we should never have to go through.

 On the plants however, Your Honor, there is 

a very serious concern. In this respect the service 

biologists said we have protected these plants' habitats

through the Section 7 mechanism. The State of Arizona 

acknowledges that it has no law or regulation which 

forbids the destruction of federally listed plant 

species.

 Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act, 

which Mr. Kneedler brought up and said it was the most 

important provision, and I would beg to differ. I think 

Sweet Home, both the majority and dissenting opinions 

agree that Section 7 -- and Hill -- that Section 7 is 

the most important provision. But plant species are not 

protected generally by Section 9 of the Endangered 

Species Act, the take provision, except when they're on 

Federal lands.

 So we have a situation where the service 

biologists were saying, and this is how I read the 

record, and if I can give a couple more citations, page 

128 and 139 of the joint appendix. On one plant 

species, joint appendix page 436. On the water on both, 

they were essentially predicting jeopardy, unless 

additional protections could be worked out in this 

process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Jeopardy from the 

issuance of a prospective future issuance of a permit by 

Arizona if they get the delegated authority. And that 

issuance of the permit would be subject to objection and

review by EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: With regard to the plant, 

Your Honor, EPA's position to date has been that they do 

not have the authority to protect that plant species 

under their Clean Water Act authorities. Now we may 

disagree with that, but that is the position they've 

taken so far.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The position that 

EPA has taken.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: That's correct, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under their 

authority.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Under their Clean Water 

Act authority, which is what informs their oversight 

activities.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how does it 

matter whether they have it or if it's transferred to 

Arizona?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Because again, what the 

consultation process is designed to accomplish, either 

through the funding, discretionary decision that was 

made, other mechanisms that can come into play, the idea 

behind the consultation on the transfer -- and I think 

this is critical to our position -- is to say if we're

not going to be able to protect the species through the 

State issuance of the permits and the other authorities 

we have, what understanding can we come to, consistent 

with our --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand --

MR. GLITZENSTEIN: -- other obligations to 

protect the plant species.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that 

answer. The Chief Justice is asking, if EPA cannot do 

it itself, how is it creating any jeopardy in 

transferring the authority to somebody else who can't do 

it?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, what the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you assume that 

EPA can't protect these plant species under its 

legislation, what harm is there in transferring the 

authority to somebody else who can't protect it?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, I should just first 

say that we disagree with the premise of that question. 

In terms of EPA's position, we happen to think that EPA 

can protect those kind of plant species, and I think 

that's one of the additional bases s for a remand.

 But I think the more important answer to 

Your Honor's question is that the Fish and Wildlife 

Service biologist said in this administrative record

that the loss of those protections was an indirect 

effect of the transfer, that because we have used these 

protections when we've issued Federal permits to prevent 

species like these plant species from going extinction 

-- and this was not speculative --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the EPA can protect the 

plants when the permit is under its own jurisdiction, 

why can't it use that same basis for objecting when it's 

under the State's jurisdiction?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, that's an 

awfully good question. And in fact we believe that 

should have been one of the outcomes of the 

consultations.

 On the transfer. If one of the results of 

the transfer -- and I think this was -- I think what's 

happening is that the government has basically assumed 

the answer to the consultation before we've gotten to 

that point. They've assumed --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between Arizona's situation and all the other States 

that can issue permits? Are they under legal obligation

obligation to consult, Your Honor. Just to be clear, 

Section 67 imposes no obligation on the State. We 

completely agree with that. It imposes an obligation on 

a Federal agency.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You say it imposes an 

obligation on EPA to require the States to consult.

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: We don't disagree with 

that either, Your Honor. We believe that there are 

mechanisms that have been used in past consultations, 

especially after the Louisiana decision that came down, 

which involve the State not at all, which involve only 

the Fish and Wildlife Service and the EPA recognizing 

how they would exercise their --

JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand the 

difference between what you think is going to happen in 

Arizona and what is happening in all the other States

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Your Honor, we're not 

saying that -- particularly with regard to Texas, 

Florida, Oklahoma, Louisiana and other States that have 

gone through the consultation process, we're not saying 

that anything different should happen. We're saying go 

through a full consultation process, agree on mechanisms 

that can protect these species.

what is the difference between what you envision would 

happen in Arizona, if Arizona can issue permits, and 

what's happening in these other States?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Again, with regard to 

consultation with Arizona, all we're asking for and all 

we've ever asked for in this case, and this was what the 

service biologist said, was use the consultation process 

to agree on measures that can be put in place 

post-transfer that will prevent the species from going 

extinct. That's what happened --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to follow up 

on that? A few minutes -- I guess your time is getting 

short and I'd like to get away from some of the 

specifics and back to the general. A minute ago, 

Justice Breyer in effect offered you an opinion and he 

spelled it out and he said, if I put that in writing is 

that what you want? You said, well, it's really more 

than we need.

 Would you please at this point summarize as 

succinctly as you can what you need to win this case?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: Well, the narrowest thing 

we need is simply a decision that the government changed 

its position and the case should be remanded.

obligations on Federal agencies just like the Clean 

Water Act does, that the agency should make a good faith 

-- and this is the words of Congress -- "a good faith 

effort to use the consultation process provided by 

7(a)(2) to devise mechanisms to protect species.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And how will they put those 

mechanisms in legal form?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: They would put those 

mechanisms in legal form either through memorandum of 

agreement, which is what's been used in the past, 

separate agreements between EPA and the Fish and 

Wildlife Service --

the States to sign those agreements on pain of not

of this, these agreements, wouldn't have to be signed by 

the State at all.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Justice Scalia's got a fair 

point. What if the States say, we don't want a 

memorandum of agreement? What does the Federal 

Government do at that point? Doesn't the Federal 

Government at that point say, okay, we're not going to 

issue the transfer under Clean Water because we have an 

independent obligation under Endangered Species and 

there's got to be both or there will be neither? Isn't 

that the Federal Government's position?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: At the end of the day I 

think it is. And there is an endangered species 

committee. Once again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's your position, not the 

Federal Government's position. It's your position of 

what the Federal Government's position ought to be, 

right?

 MR. GLITZENSTEIN: What I was trying to 

suggest was -- I think if in the end of the day you look 

at all of these opportunities to protect species and you 

say there's nothing we can do about it and the State 

refuses to cooperate, you have what's called jeopardy or 

destruction of critical habitat, and Congress said that

law is the endangered species committee, which we have 

not talked about very much. That was Congress's answer.

 But what I was trying to suggest was, long 

before you get to that point and without imposing a 

single obligation on the State, simply using the 

authority under 402(d) of the Clean Water Act, which 

provides for this oversight opportunity, the service and 

the EPA can come to their own understanding as to how 

EPA will in fact carry out its post-transfer review of 

these. And we think that is, that is an acceptable 

answer to the question.

held that where an agency has a mandatory duty and does 

not have the ability to control subsequent events, that 

the agency cannot be regarded as the legal cause of 

whatever effects happen. That is exactly the case here.

 Section 402(b) mandates that EPA approve the 

State's application. EPA therefore, EPA's decision 

therefore is not the legal cause of any effects that 

might happen with respect to endangered species.

 I should point out that in this Court's 

decision in Sweet Home this Court in footnotes 9 and 13 

read the other principal provision of the ESA, the take 

provision, to incorporation a proximate cause 

limitation. We think it follows that the jeopardize 

prohibition in Section 7 also incorporates a proximate 

cause or here legal cause restriction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I hate to eat 

up any of your rebuttal time, but would you state 

briefly what -- how you would treat these other matters 

that were resolved by the agency and that were not 

mandatory, its decision to transfer prior certificate 

authority to the States, for example, and the other 

instance raised by opposing counsel? What if I agree 

with you on whether you can deny the NPDES permit, but 

I'm concerned about these other actions by the agency 

that were discretionary?

MR. KNEEDLER: There has been no challenge 

to that, so I'm not in a position to give a definitive 

answer. But I believe to the extent it would be 

discretionary that Section 7 may well kick in.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Should we remand?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, because there was no 

challenge to that. There was no challenge to that 

aspect of it. This was a challenge to the transfer of 

authority, not ancillary matters addressed under the 

agreement.

 Also, footnote 18 of the court of appeals 

opinion makes clear that Respondents did not challenge 

anything to do with funding, which is an entirely 

separate administrative determination that there's a 

regulatory set of criteria for how funding gets 

distributed, it is not dependent on whether the State 

has NPDES authority. Section 106 of the Clean Water Act 

has a separate funding mechanism for Clean Water Act 

authority generally. So funding is simply not, it's 

simply not in the case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's in your 

discretion -- your distinction to the snail darter case 

is that the decision to built the dam is discretionary, 

not mandatory?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and in fact this Court's

decision in Hill can't be understood in any other day 

because the Court went out of its way to say that, while 

Congress committee reports indicated, for the 

appropriations bills, indicated an expectation that the 

dam would be built, the Court emphasized the fact that 

there was no mandate in the appropriations statute 

itself. That would have been --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you mean the executive 

can ignore earmarks?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That part of the 

Court's decision would have been unnecessary.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's a mandatory 

decision? No, what's a discretionary decision? I mean, 

in the sense you're using it. I've never heard of an 

agency that could just give out money to whoever they 

want, like you or me. There are always criteria. Write 

a "shall"; there are always criteria.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But there are few statutes 

like this, that say the agency shall unless certain 

things happen.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean is it the word 

"unless," because here we have nine and they're broad. 

Probably with funding we have 32. Maybe with some 

others we have 14. But I can't get my mind around --

MR. KNEEDLER: There may be particular

applications of the standard, but that did not deter 

this Court in Public Citizen, where the Court applied 

the same principle and said where the agency has a 

mandatory duty and no discretion it is not the legal 

cause. That's the general principle. If there are 

other cases where that general principle has to be 

applied, there will be time enough for that 

consideration to arise.

 Another important aspect of Hill is this 

Court quoted Representative Dingell, the sponsor of it, 

saying that agencies are to take actions within their 

power, which suggest that -- and we think it's clear 

through the history, as we recite in our brief at pages 

27 and 28, from the text of the Act and from the 

evolution of Section 7, it was always understood to 

apply to situations where the agencies had the existing 

authority to take action, not to require them to 

countermand statutory directives the way the Department 

of Transportation could not countermand statutory 

directives in Public Citizen.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
