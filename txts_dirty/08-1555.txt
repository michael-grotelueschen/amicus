(10:02 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument today in Case 08-1555, Samantar v. Yousuf. 

Mr. Dvoretzky. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The FSIA applies to suits against foreign 

officials for acts taken on the state's behalf, because 

such suits are the equivalent of a suit against the 

state directly. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, I -- I want to just 

say that I have one problem with the case at the outset. 

And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your 

argument. You might want to address it later. And it’s 

a question that goes to the other counsel, too. 

I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues 

as presented in the brief really resolve very much. 

Let's assume -- I know this is not your position. Let's 

assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants 

immunity to the state for this conduct and for a 

then-serving official who is its agent and for a former 

agent. Let's assume there is -- there is immunity. Why

isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later 

enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act? 

I just don't see the issue structured that 

way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it. But I say that 

at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your 

-- your good introduction. 

MR. DVORETZKY: The Torture Victim 

Protection Act creates a cause of action but is silent 

about immunity, and, therefore, has to be interpreted 

consistently with background immunity principles and 

consistently with a preexisting statute codifying 

immunity, rather than --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what authority do 

you have for that? 

MR. DVORETZKY: I'm sorry. Could you 

repeat --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What case authority do you 

have for that proposition? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Dellmuth v. Muth, for one 

thing. Also, the government previously argued that the 

TVPA has to be interpreted consistent with preexisting 

immunity principles. When Congress wants to waive 

immunity, it knows how to do that. For example, it 

amended the FSIA to specifically waive immunity for 

actions against state sponsors of terrorism.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's like a -- it's like a 

clear statement rule? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Yes. If Congress wishes to 

waive immunity, it has to do so expressly. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you are right about 

that -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort 

Statute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there 

had been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga 

was a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic, 

none of those could have gone forward? 

MR. DVORETZKY: If, in those cases, an 

immunity defense had been asserted and it had been 

established that the official was acting on behalf of 

the state, then, yes, immunity would apply. Those 

defenses were not asserted in those cases, though. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any 

Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would 

have survived, under your view, because your view is 

it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 

Act, end of case? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Absolutely, there are 

Torture Victim Protection Act and ATS claims that could 

be brought. They could be brought whenever an FSIA 

exception applies. So, for example, if an action were 

brought against an official of a state sponsor of

terrorism, the FSIA exception for that would apply. If 

a foreign state waived immunity, either explicitly or 

implicitly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that doesn't --

that's not going to happen. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. DVORETZKY: There are cases where it has 

happened. For example, the Philippines effectively 

waived immunity when claims were brought against Marcos. 

So it certainly could happen. 

Congress envisioned that the statute would 

be interpreted consistently with immunity principles. 

The legislative history supports that inference. There 

are reports in the legislative history and a 

floor statement by Senator Specter saying that the FSIA 

could provide an immunity defense to a claim against an 

official where the official can establish an agency 

relationship with the state. 

Here, there is no question that Mr. Samantar 

was acting in an official capacity, because he is being 

sued for his actions as a prime minister and as a 

defense minister, in the midst of what was effectively 

quelling a secessionist insurgency. That's an 

inherent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that -- again,

the Torture Victim Protection Act says “an individual 

who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color 

of law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to 

torture.” 

Why isn't that a clear statement? And then 

I’ll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to 

talking about the FSIA. 

MR. DVORETZKY: Well, it's not a clear 

statement because it's only a clear statement creating a 

cause of action. It's not a clear statement that speaks 

to immunity. And, again, where Congress has wanted to 

waive immunity, it has done that expressly, as where it 

waived the immunity of a foreign state for claims brought 

against state sponsors of terrorism. 

And Dellmuth v. Muth, I think, is on point 

because there the Court held that even though a cause of 

action was created that would principally apply only to 

state agencies, that in and of itself was not sufficient 

to waive the sovereign immunity of the states. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I’ll jump on 

the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off. 

I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is 

to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state. That 

doesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause 

of action.

MR. DVORETZKY: You’re talking about the 

exception in the TVPA for state sponsors of terrorism? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. DVORETZKY: But the TVPA -- the FSIA, in 

addition, also has a cause of action applicable to state 

sponsors of terrorism. That's in the red brief at 17a. 

It's 28 U.S.C. section 1605A(c). And so in that 

situation, what Congress did was it both created a cause 

of action against state sponsors of terrorism and their 

officials and waived immunity. 

In the TVPA, all that Congress did was to 

create a cause of action. And so that cause of action 

has to be read consistently with background principles 

of immunity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when you -- going 

back to where you started -- you started saying the 

officer must go together with the state, because in 

reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the 

state. 

But this is a case seeking money out of the 

pocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of 

Somalia, so why is the suit against the officer here 

equivalent to a suit against the state? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Because the touchstone of 

foreign sovereign immunity law, which the FSIA codified,

is that one nation's courts cannot sit in judgment of 

another nation's acts. And the basis for liability that’s 

asserted in this case is Samantar's acts on behalf of 

the state of Somalia. 

The issue is not who pays the judgment; the 

issue is whose acts are in question. Now, in the 

domestic context, of course, the distinction between 

personal liability and liability from the state may 

matter, but that's only because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that sounds like 

you're -- you're talking about an “act of state” doctrine, 

not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a 

suit against the other. 

MR. DVORETZKY: The “act of state” doctrine 

is distinct from immunity doctrines, although they have 

certain shared underpinnings and shared comity 

considerations. And just as the under -- act of state 

doctrine is concerned with not judging the acts of 

foreign states, so too is foreign sovereign immunity 

law. That's the fundamental premise of foreign -- of 

foreign sovereignty immunity law. 

In the domestic context, courts do sometimes 

say that an official can be sued for personal liability 

because he wasn't acting for the state if he violated 

the state's controlling law. U.S. courts are able to

make that determination because our courts are the 

ultimate arbiters of domestic law. U.S. courts are not 

the ultimate arbiters of foreign law. In fact, a 

determination that an official was not acting for a 

foreign state because he must have violated the foreign 

state's law or international law is precisely what 

foreign sovereign immunity prohibits. 

So in the foreign sovereign immunity 

context, as long as the underlying acts are those of the 

state, foreign sovereign immunity prohibits the case 

from proceeding. And that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I 

followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se, 

because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within 

that Act and to have the government cover it, the 

officer has to be acting within the scope of her 

employment, however careless or reckless she may be. 

MR. DVORETZKY: That -- and that goes to 

when the government would be liable for the employee's 

acts. In our case, what we’re talking about here is 

when the official can be personally liable for acts of 

the state. And in the domestic context, we say the 

official can be liable when he must not have been acting 

for the state because he violated the state's 

controlling law.

Foreign sovereign immunity prohibits that 

determination with respect to the law of foreign states, 

and it prohibits U.S. courts from imposing their view of 

international law on other courts to conclude that an 

official must not have been acting for his state. 

JUSTICE ALITO: How will a court determine 

whether an official was acting within the official scope 

of the official's responsibilities? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Ordinarily, the foreign 

state would tell you, and that would be dispositive of 

the matter. 

If the foreign state doesn't tell you, you 

would look at the nature of the allegations in the 

complaint and see if they fall within a category of 

conduct that is inherently viewed in -- as sovereign. 

Atop that list --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if the court can't tell 

by looking at the complaint? Is there going to be 

direct communication between the court and the foreign 

government on this issue? 

MR. DVORETZKY: A foreign government 

ordinarily is going to -- is going to get involved in 

the case and indicate whether it wishes to assert 

immunity on behalf of the official or not. 

For example, there have been several cases

involving suits against Israeli officials, and the 

Israeli embassy communicated to the courts and to the 

State Department that these were acts of Israel and the 

official policy of the state. 

Again, if you don't have that, though, it's 

not going to be a difficult inquiry, typically, to look 

and see whether inherently sovereign acts are what's at 

issue. For example, if you have military or police 

conduct, as this Court said in Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 

that’s inherently sovereign conduct. Legislative --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is the inquiry 

any different than the one that would go under the 

common law head of state inquiry? What would be 

different in the two? 

MR. DVORETZKY: I -- I think the inquiry as 

to whether it's an official act would be the same, but 

head of state immunity is a different sort of immunity 

than sovereign immunity. It's much broader, insofar as 

it covers even personal acts by a head of state while he’s 

in office, whereas for foreign sovereign immunity, 

what you’re looking to distinguish is whether the 

official was engaged in personal activity or whether he 

was engaged in acts on behalf of the state. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your --

implicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as 

well? 

MR. DVORETZKY: No. Head of state immunity 

is a different body of common law immunity that the 

FSIA --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So why can't this be a -- a 

different body of common law? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Do you mean, why 

can't this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I mean, you’re saying 

they -- they left head of state immunity to the common 

law, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act. Why -- why should I believe that they 

did not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Because head of state 

immunity is not a form of sovereign immunity. And what 

Congress did in this Act was it codified the law of 

foreign sovereign immunity. At common law, the 

sovereign immunity of the state was always understood to 

extend to officials for their official acts. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Why --

why -- that doesn't make any sense to me. Why would we 

have had the creation of all of these common law 

immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular 

and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign

immunity was going to cover them naturally? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Because consular and 

diplomatic immunity are very different in scope and in 

purpose than state sovereign immunity. 

There are two sources of immunity that an 

individual might be entitled to. There is the immunity 

that flows from the state itself for official acts, and 

there is immunity that flows from the individual's 

office, like diplomatic and consular immunity. 

Diplomatic and consular immunity are meant 

to ensure that states can conduct their business without 

tying up their officials while they are in office in 

litigation in foreign courts over any matters, personal 

or official. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm trying to go before 

the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it 

was passed, because that was Congress's first statement, 

and we have to figure out what they intended to replace 

or not replace. 

Before the Act came in, what activities of a 

consular office would not have been covered under the 

foreign sovereign immunity of a state? What activity 

could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer 

have engaged in that state immunity, as it was 

understood at the time, would not have given him or her?

MR. DVORETZKY: He could get into a car 

accident. Diplomatic and consular immunity would 

prevent the diplomat or the consul from being sued for 

tort damages for a car accident in a foreign state. 

Official immunity would not, because driving 

is not considered an official policy of the state in the 

way that, as I was saying to Justice Alito, police or 

military conduct would be. 

So that's the distinction between official 

conduct and conduct that may well be within the scope of 

employment but is not entitled to the state's immunity. 

And where Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can you get to the 

text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you --

that you assert embraces this personal immunity? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Section 1603(a) -- excuse 

me -- section 1604 says that “a foreign state shall be 

immune from the jurisdiction” of the United States and of 

the States. When a suit is brought against an official 

for his official act, that is effectively subjecting the 

foreign state itself to U.S. jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the -- the 

Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers 

at a time when the department is a separate agency of 

Government X in 1940. In 1950, this department is

Now, it's a private entity, and someone would 

like to sue the department because they didn't pay the 

bill. It is now a private entity. They are suing them 

for what happened years ago when they were part of the 

state. 

Is it sovereign immunity, this statute that 

blocks the suit, or some other principle? 

MR. DVORETZKY: I think this statute would 

block the suit --

JUSTICE BREYER: The statute would block the 

suit. There’s precedent with -- you know, famous 

precedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite. It 

says: You were king, you are not king now; therefore, 

there may be a different principle, but we can sue you 

now. 

MR. DVORETZKY: Because the source of 

immunity in that case was head of state immunity, which 

is different from the state sovereign immunity --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you’re 

saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so 

you couldn't possibly be interfering. You couldn't 

possibly be interfering in the workings of the state --

MR. DVORETZKY: If the state --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because if the state 

doesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason 

than in the incident where the entity is no longer 

part of the state? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Because ultimately, what 

foreign sovereign immunity and this statute are 

concerned with is protecting a foreign state's act from 

being judged in court. 

In your example of the Department of the 

Army which subsequently is bought by another company, 

and the foreign state exists, the foreign state's acts 

are still being judged regardless of the status of that 

department --

state doctrine. At that point, the State Department 

comes in and says: You can't maintain this suit because 

of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you’ve 

said. 

MR. DVORETZKY: You may very well have the 

act of state doctrine, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that's my question: Do 

you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute 

cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive 

Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis? 

MR. DVORETZKY: The act of state doctrine 

might very well cover your hypothetical, but it’s a 

different doctrine that is not duplicative of immunity. 

It serves different purposes. Immunity prevents the 

suit from proceeding at the outset. It's an immunity 

not only from liability, but an immunity from the 

litigation process itself. 

The act of state doctrine is a discretionary 

doctrine, first of all. It's not automatic in the way 

that immunity is; and, second of all, it applies only on 

the merits; and, third, it serves different purposes 

because it can be used even offensively and even in 

cases where the state itself is not a party, simply to 

establish the legality of a state's conduct within its 

own territory. So the act of state doctrine is a

judge-made prudential doctrine that serves different 

purposes than immunity. 

In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, 

immunity would apply to the acts of the -- of the 

Department of the Army because, regardless of when suit 

is brought, those acts are still those of the state. In 

the hypothetical where a state does not exist at all, 

then 1604 would not come into play because there is no 

foreign state to be held immune. 

That's not this case, though. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back --

can I come back to the text? I -- just for a moment 

there we were on the text of this Act --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the suit is about. 

And you said where -- where the immunity exists is at 

604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but 

1603 defines a foreign state, which -- which says that 

it includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign 

state. 

And then it defines agency or 

instrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does not 

include private individuals, but rather just artificial 

legal persons.

define a foreign state exhaustively. It simply states 

what a foreign state includes. We know that because, if 

you look at 1603(b), the very next subsection, Congress 

said what “an agency or instrumentality” means. 

So had it meant to define exhaustively what 

“a foreign state” means, it could have said: “A foreign 

state” means its political subdivisions, agencies, or 

instrumentalities. The fact that Congress said that a 

foreign state includes a political subdivision and its 

agencies or instrumentalities suggests that it includes 

more than just the enumerated entities. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I would find it 

extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say 

that it includes the Department of Defense but would 

leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of 

Defense. I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more 

likely that you would understand a foreign state to 

include the departments of -- of that state than that 

you would assume a foreign state to include individuals 

who happen to be officials of the state. 

MR. DVORETZKY: And the reason that I think 

that Congress had to go out of its way to define what 

constitutes an agency or instrumentality is that, at the 

time that the FSIA was passed, there was uncertainty 

about whether certain governmental or corporate entities

whether certain commercial entities owned by the state 

were entitled to the state's immunity. There was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And there was no 

uncertainty about -- about individuals? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Precisely. There was no 

uncertainty about whether individuals were included. 

And so when Congress was simply continuing the common 

law against which it passed this statute, it didn't need 

to expressly say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can you maintain that 

position when the Department of State takes the position 

that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a 

state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't 

apply to officers? If it was all that certain that they 

didn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State 

Department is being recalcitrant? 

MR. DVORETZKY: The State Department asked, 

before the FSIA was passed, to have Executive discretion 

take -- taken away with respect to immunity 

determinations. Congress agreed with that judgment and 

passed the FSIA, and now the Executive Branch has to be 

held to that judgment that was made. As far --

anything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't 

codify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the 

preexisting law. Do you have an explanation for that? 

MR. DVORETZKY: I don't, other than the 

explanation that I gave Justice Scalia, which is: This 

immunity was not in question at the time that the FSIA 

was passed, and when Congress passes a statute in an 

area where there had been preexisting common law, this 

Court presumes that Congress meant to incorporate and 

continue that common law and not abrogate it unless 

Congress has spoken directly to the contrary. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But was this Act originally 

drafted by the Executive? Do you know? 

MR. DVORETZKY: I'm not sure whether it was 

drafted by the Executive or whether it was drafted by 

Congress, but it was passed at the request of the 

Executive Branch because there was -- the State 

Department was put in a position of being under 

diplomatic pressure to grant immunity on -- on favored 

status to certain nations who asked for it when they 

wouldn't otherwise be entitled to it. This --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any case by us 

in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize 

that an individual was immunized in the way that the 

state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?

Or were all of our cases having to do with other common 

law doctrines? 

MR. DVORETZKY: This Court's cases generally 

had to do with other doctrines. The one possible 

exception to that is Underhill, in which the Second 

Circuit's decision decided the issue on foreign 

sovereign immunity grounds, and this Court affirmed. 

It's unclear entirely whether this Court's 

affirmance was on act of state or immunity grounds, but 

also at the time that that decision was -- came down, 

act of state and immunity doctrines were very much 

intertwined. 

There is no question, however, as the 

government argues, that the common law before the FSIA 

recognized that officials were entitled to immunity --

to the state's immunity for their official acts. The 

Second Restatement, which was -- which was promulgated 

in 1965 just before the FSIA, says that. The Second 

Circuit's decision from 1971, just before the FSIA was 

passed, in Heaney, says that. And it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, entitled to it, or --

or able to obtain a letter from the State Department 

that would confer it upon them?

prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the 

State Department, didn't you? Even the state, 

for that matter? 

MR. DVORETZKY: No. The -- the -- prior to 

the FSIA, this was a common law doctrine that courts 

would often apply without any input from the State 

Department. 

In the Heaney case, for example, the State 

Department was asked to provide input and provided none, 

and the Second Circuit nonetheless held that, using the 

generally applicable common law principles, that the 

official was entitled to immunity for the state's acts. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what -- what if the 

State Department came in and said no, no sovereign 

immunity here, what would the court do? Would the court 

be bound by that? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Ordinarily, the court would 

at least defer to that. Whether it would be 

definitively bound by -- by that or not, it would at 

least be entitled to deference. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So they didn't have to say 

yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much 

carried the day?

covered; otherwise it won't work.

position that even if that's wrong, that under generally 

accepted principles of international law, that agents 

still have immunity. Or am I wrong about that? 

MR. DVORETZKY: Well --

a fallback position in the -- in the -- in further

FSIA incorporates the common law and that Mr. Samantar

disagree with us on that, we would certainly wish to

heart of this case, and that is of the Torture Victim 

Protection Act, in which Congress did create a cause of 

action, was -- that cause of action was created for -- to 

impose a liability, personal liability, for acts that 

were done with "actual or apparent" -- but included with

“actual” -- authority of the foreign state. 

Now, if Congress believed that the FSIA 

immunized everyone who undertook acts under color of 

law, or at a minimum with actual authority of the 

foreign state, that was a very empty statute. 

Now, part of the -- part of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Millett, I think it's a 

pretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of 

Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense. I mean, that 

seems very strange. 

MS. MILLETT: It doesn't seem strange, for 

precisely the reason that we have still with us today a 

former minister of defense when we have no Ministry of 

Defense and no Government of Somalia whatsoever. The 

reason is that individuals come and go. Individuals 

engage in acts that are not acts of the state --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the state --

there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as 

well. We’re talking about insulating state acts. The 

only way a state can act is through people. And you’re 

saying: Well, the state is insulated, but the people 

who do the acts for the state are not. I don't see how 

that can -- can work.

whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is the 

source of that insulation. And the very 

difficulty with --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, well, then --

but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was 

there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, 

they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not 

the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is 

through individuals. 

MS. MILLETT: Well, first of all, states do 

corporate acts that are greater than the -- the whole is 

much greater than the parts here. And the issue in this 

case is whether the part can claim the immunity of the 

whole, and that is a very different thing. 

The -- the individual -- individuals may 

act. They may act without authority; they may act 

contrary to authority. And the problem with the FSIA, 

which is the issue here, is there is no mechanism in it 

for addressing, for example, whether this was 

authorized. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the Ministry of 

Defense is not the whole, either. I mean, you -- you 

acknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a 

foreign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow 

not -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign

I guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why 

anybody would want to write it that way. 

MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, if 

you're going to write a statute that addresses 

individual immunities -- in particular, what this case 

is about, personal immunity for personal liability, 

then those statutes look very different. 

What’s the first thing you are going to 

want? You are going to want some way to decide what is 

official capacity or what is on behalf of a state, and 

you are going to want a mechanism for the foreign state, 

or at least the State Department, to have input on that. 

There’s nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 

that addresses that. You're going to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is your --

MS. MILLETT: -- want to identify --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. The question I 

think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it’s 

bothering me, is: Don't think of this case. Think of 

the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is 

suing an active state. He’s suing France or he’s 

suing England or -- he’s suing an active state for an 

official act. And the judge says: I have read the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed. Judge,

the names of the individuals, because there were some 

individuals who did the act. 

Now, does he suddenly fall outside the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed 

the names of the people who did it, and everything else 

was the same?

nothing whatsoever.

MS. MILLETT: You can’t --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the state, because all I 

did there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the 

same, everything was the same. I happened to go to the 

Internet to find out who were the human beings working for 

the state who did the thing I'm complaining did. And all 

I did was fill their names in, in the complaint.

question is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would have 

thought that is a suit against the state. 

Now, there may be many reasons that they 

would have. If they thought, in the Restatement’s 

words -- which are not just if you are doing an official 

act. If you are doing an official act, and the exercise 

of jurisdiction would have the effect of enforcing a 

rule of law against the state, then you get immunized. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So wait --

MS. MILLETT: That --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- you’re saying this Act 

is only good as against a bad lawyer? Because any 

good lawyer would simply fill in the right names.

lawyer. Is that what you’re saying?

answer --

have to be enforcing a rule -- the effect --

question: Sometimes the individual, in the first set of

work out the principle of when that individual would

Justice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does --

and when it doesn't. 

And I've tried to work with the idea of 

relief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or 

maybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time 

afterwards. I'm not an expert. You’re more of an 

expert than I. What are the principles that determine 

when? 

MS. MILLETT: Well, there's -- there's two 

levels here. 

First of all, we’d look -- and this is --

Congress, presumably, was drawing on a well-established 

domestic law analogies here. And they may not be 

100 percent controlling here, but we have 

well-established ways of understanding whether a -- an 

action is against an official in -- in their official 

capacity. We look at the form of relief, the nature of 

the claim. I do think we need to be careful here --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is there to suggest that 

Congress was looking to domestic analogies? This has 

nothing -- immunity of officials under domestic law 

doesn't bear very much resemblance to the immunities 

that are available to foreign officials, does it? 

MS. MILLETT: Well, this is a domestic 

statute, and for Congress -- for purposes of Congress

deciding whether a lawsuit is a suit against a sovereign 

or not against a sovereign, then that is obviously a 

relevant framework. 

And we know from two things -- the Torture 

Victim Protection Act, that they looked at that framework, 

but also embedded in the FSIA itself, in the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act itself, is that same 

distinction between holding people personally liable and 

holding the state liable. 

In 1605A, the terrorist state exception, on 

15a to 17a of the addendum to our brief, they create a 

cause of action, one against the state and one against 

the individual officials. Now, the one against the 

individual officials is a recognition that individual 

officials can have personal capacity liability for 

damages, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act. Otherwise, if -- if, under 

Petitioner's theory, every lawsuit against an 

individual -- and the language there, is “acting under 

color of office or employment” -- if every suit against 

someone under color of office or employment morphs into 

a suit against the state, there is no cause of action 

to create against the individual.

MS. MILLETT: They understood it was 

individual liability. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the 

whole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch 

out of the business of sending letters to the court 

every time a state was sued. The government requested 

it for that purpose. Now they are just back into it 

again if you say, well, you can just sue the 

individuals. 

And the government's position in this case 

confirms that. They're -- they tell us the way you 

should proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and, 

basically, we’ll send you a letter and let you know. 

So it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is 

undermined by the position you’re taking today. 

MS. MILLETT: No, I think it's because the 

inquiries are very different, as this case illustrates. 

And that is -- first of all, the point of the FSIA, as 

section 1602 says, is to codify -- as this Court's cases 

have said, was to -- largely to codify the restrictive 

theory of sovereign immunity, which did not apply to 

individual immunity. It did not apply to the head of 

state. The head of state was still immune for 

commercial acts while a sitting head of state. 

So, if that was codified, that was a dramatic

change done silently in the FSIA. The reason Congress 

would want to retain Executive Branch role here is 

because the inquires are different, and the first one is 

the most elemental one in Petitioner's case and that is 

the assertion that: I was acting in my official 

capacity. Who decides? How do we decide? Which 

agents? For which actions? For how long? What level 

of immunity? 

If the FSIA eliminated the head of state's 

normal absolute immunity while sitting from all actions, 

commercial or not, that's a dramatic revolution. We can 

now sue sitting prime ministers and presidents and 

distract them from their duties. 

If the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act made 

any official’s official act an act of the state -- and 

remember, they are now every level of the foreign 

government down to the mayor's office, and corporate 

officials, too, so we've now eliminated the long-standing 

principle in corporate law -- corporations also only act 

through individuals -- that corporate liability and 

individual liability go hand-in-hand. 

The -- the FSIA did not uproot all that, and 

it provides no mechanisms. That's why we need to return 

to the common law immunity. Now, what happens when you 

have a case that, in effect, is seeking relief against

MS. MILLETT: When you’re interpreting the

"under color of office," that is undoubtedly a job for 

the court. "Official capacity" appears nowhere in the 

FSIA. Deciding which agents will be agents of the state 

is nowhere in the FSIA. 

One court has applied this agency -- agent 

principle to say that when we hire an independent 

contractor, in the -- the United States independent 

contractor, that gets the immunity of the foreign 

sovereign state. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Courts -- courts 

decide this sort of question all the time, whether 

you’re talking about principles of domestic immunity 

or even corporate liability: Is the employee on a 

frolic or is it a detour? Determining when an individual

MS. MILLETT: Not in this area, where those 

decisions have foreign relations implications. This 

Court has done the opposite. And it has -- it has 

waited for the political branches to lead, and it has 

followed. Because the decision whether we’re 

displacing head of state immunity and now we’re going 

to have commercial immunity --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then that -- I mean, I'm 

sort of there. You may agree with this, that if you 

have an individual and with what's being charged here 

is he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense, 

and this action is an action he took in his official 

capacity, that's it. Forget it. This Act covers it. 

But where you’re claiming it's not and he's 

not now a member, the reason for the Act disappears, 

and you go back to the act of state doctrine. 

MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the -- I don't 

think -- I think -- and this may seem a little formless, 

but I simply think it's right, because you’re dealing 

with statutory text here. 

It's not so much that the defense minister 

himself becomes the state; it's that the court looking 

at that action goes: This is really an action against

the state. The state is a necessary party under 

Pimentel and must be here. You, individual, actually 

have a common law immunity, an absolute immunity, when 

you are, under the Restatement, sued for official acts. 

And the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to 

enforce a rule of law against the state. 

When you have those two things together, 

both of them, you are entitled to immunity because this 

is an action against the state. The state's a necessary 

party. Under Republic of Philippines v. -- excuse me --

Pimentel, they must be joined, and that will -- then we'll 

look at the FSIA and decide whether they can be joined 

or not. That's the way it works. 

It's not that individuals -- and this is a 

problem -- that are sort of popping in and out all 

throughout the FSIA. If it were, we need mechanisms 

that we don't have here to deal with the very sensitive 

decisions of which individuals. Well, how will we say 

you’re the agent? It’s -- the individual can show up and 

say I was working for the state; I was doing torture; 

we loved torture; that was our policy -- you can imagine 

many a government, if notified, if there was a mechanism 

for them to come in, would say: Hang on, that was not our 

policy. But there’s no mechanism under his theory.

with is if it really is an official capacity, then we --

state.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend said it

in court here until we got to this Court. There was no 

Somali government to show up to say whether this was 

official or not, and the State Department didn't show up 

for 2 years. What is a court supposed to do? 

Well, it was not supposed to do what it did 

here and declare that it’s essentially recognizing the 

transitional federal government as the government of 

Somalia, because it didn't know what else to do. That 

can't be right. And, again, we need to keep in mind the --

there is no mechanism in the text of the FSIA. This

and reconstructing the FSIA if you are going to turn 

it into either a Westfall substitution act with no 

language here, or you have to turn it into a personal 

immunity for personal liability act. 

That’s not the text. Sovereign immunity 

has never been a personal liability from personal --

personal immunity from personal liability statute. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you agree with the 

Solicitor General's position about the preservation of 

the immunities that existed before? 

MS. MILLETT: Yes, as to -- as

100 percent on what the scope or content of that immunity is. 

We certainly agree that head of state immunity was preserved, 

so we can't sue the head of state at all while sitting. 

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but whatever immunity 

existed previously for an official or former official 

was not abrogated by the FSIA. The FSIA just doesn't 

address that subject at all. 

MS. MILLETT: Our position is that the FSIA 

does not address that. Our view of what the common law

Underhill v. Hernandez, that when you start getting to 

lower level officials who are not heads of state, who 

are not diplomatically protected, consular protected, 

mission on -- have mission immunity, that that -- a lot 

of that worked through act of state doctrine, and --

no immunity for someone who is the equivalent of a -- of 

a cabinet officer, previously?

the government said, in the old days, the Tate letters 

went out in all these cases. Now, they no longer go out 

when we’re dealing with a state itself or a state 

agency, but we still -- the Executive -- basically, as I 

read the government's position, the government is 

saying: The Executive Branch decides. We tell the 

court. And if we don't tell the court that this person 

can be sued, then the person can't be sued. 

Are you in sync with the government in that 

we are now back to the Executive -- essentially, the 

Executive decides, not the court? 

MS. MILLETT: I don't think that’s the 

exclusive one, and I think, as this Court explained even 

in Altmann that deference given -- respectful deference 

is always going to be given when the Executive Branch 

weighs in, because these are foreign -- cases that have 

foreign policy implications. 

I don't think it's a rubber stamp on the 

part of the courts. As this Court said in Altmann, it 

depends on whether they’re speaking with particularized 

specialty. If they come in and say Mr. Samantar was 

the head of state, we’re done. I don't think 

there's -- I’d like to think of something; I can't 

think of anything that would save us from that. If they 

say who a head of state is, then that, I think, has

largely been treated as binding on the courts. 

If they say someone -- they've determined 

that someone was acting in an official capacity, that’s 

going to receive --- either whether communicated from the 

foreign state or based on principles that they have --

that’s going to carry weight, but it's not going to 

necessarily mean you automatically dismiss when you 

have -- you could have times where the Executive 

Branch said anyone acting under color of law should be 

immunized. Then --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I gather the --

asserts the right to say: Yes, he was acting

MS. MILLETT: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the -- the State 

Department wants to be able to decide whether 

individuals will be held liable, whether they were 

acting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it? 

MS. MILLETT: Well, they -- that -- I’ll 

let them speak for their own position. I think 

certainly -- certainly there are a variety of doctrines, 

a variety of hurdles any case has to get through. And

it's not just the Executive’s views on a case. There’s 

things like exhaustion. There's necessary party 

inquiries. There's the act of state doctrine. There’s 

substantive limits on what one can sue for. 

You know, the Torture Victim Protection Act 

is Congress's judgment that individuals who do this, 

consistent with international law, whatever else --

individuals who engage in torture and extrajudicial 

killing are held personally liable in Congress's views 

and in the views of international law. And the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act doesn't stop that. 

And what’s critical, again, is the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say --

MS. MILLETT: -- language that’s missing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that I find it much 

more acceptable to have the State Department say 

that a particular foreign country should be let off the 

hook, which is what they used to do with the Tate 

letters, than I do to leave it up to the State 

Department whether -- whether an individual human being 

shall be -- shall be punished or not. I -- I somehow 

find that less within the realm of the -- of the foreign 

affairs power of the State Department.

same question. I would agree that the State Department 

might have some expertise in telling us what the facts 

were: Who was the government, who was -- who was in 

office at the time, what the policies were. 

But it's just not clear to me what body of 

principles the State Department looks to, to make this 

determination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is 

immune and Jones isn't. 

MS. MILLETT: I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please. 

MS. MILLETT: May I, sir? The -- first of all, 

whether one thinks it's the right rule or not, the FSIA 

doesn't tell us any way of answering who was in official 

capacity and getting input, at a minimum, from the 

foreign government whose mantle this individual is 

trying to wrap themselves in. So the FSIA is not the 

source. 

The Executive viewpoint is not -- in our 

view, is not the sole source. And there are -- there 

are a number of other doctrines, whether it's act of 

state doctrine, whether it is exhaustion principles, 

whether it's a necessary party inquiries, whether it's 

substantive limits on, you know, law of nations 

requirements for the Alien Tort Statute or the Torture 

Victim Protection Act. There’s forum non conveniens.

There are a battery of doctrines that come together to 

very narrowly limit these actions. 

And what the State Department looks for 

is -- what it has said is that it has -- it has a 

pattern of decisionmaking, factors it lays out in its 

brief, that I think it finds -- it says it finds --

influential in the process. But in -- forgive me for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 

sentence. 

MS. MILLETT: But in any given case, the 

role of the Executive Branch is going to have more or 

less deference based on whether it is speaking something 

within its traditional expertise: Are you a head of 

state? Were you a diplomat? 

But when it comes to war -- and I -- I'm not 

saying it would, but if it were to come to war with the 

very elements of the Torture Victim Protection Act and 

say that torture by an individual can be immunized just 

because it was done under color of law, then I think the 

Court has a very difficult concern that was flagged in 

Altmann to resolve, and I think we might draw a 

different -- we would definitely come to a different 

answer than the Executive Branch in that situation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You made that a long 

sentence.

your position? And by that I mean, it took 2 years 

for the State -- for the government to respond to the 

district court in this case. Tell us why your reading 

of the statute would not grind the courts to a halt. 

What happens when Justice Breyer's situation 

arises? Someone takes a complaint against the state and 

just substitutes the names of the persons. What -- why 

wouldn't the courts come to a grinding halt? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me answer that in 

two ways. 

First, there’s -- there is a very practical 

distinction between suing the state and suing the 

individual. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not 

just about immunity; it's about the subject matter of 

the courts. If a foreign sovereign is found to be 

immune, the court has no jurisdiction over the case. So 

to say that the individual is -- is governed by the FSIA 

means that it would be a threshold subject matter 

jurisdictional inquiry in every case. So in terms of 

judicial administration, that is a problem. 

It is also a problem, as a practical matter, 

to apply the FSIA's very reticulated standards that were 

carefully negotiated between the Executive Branch and 

Congress when they knew what they were dealing with. 

They were dealing with the immunity of states and

the -- and the principals of states. And this is 

reflected, as Ms. Millett said, in section 1602. That's 

the business that Congress wanted to get -- Congress and 

the Executive -- wanted the Executive to be out of, 

which was the immunity of foreign states --

JUSTICE BREYER: But all you have to do is 

write a different word in. Now, that's the question 

that’s --

MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. And -- right and --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Ms. Millett 

sort of backed off that. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And that -- and if -- what I'm 

seeing here is two extreme positions. 

You’re saying: Never, no matter what, can 

you simply write the name "Joe Smith" under the word 

"Niger." Okay? Can't do it. Even though every act --

no matter what, you write that human name in, and you --

this statute doesn't apply. To me, that means it never 

applies. All right? 

The opposite would be that never, under any 

circumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for 

a -- for an official act. That seems the opposite. I 

should think sometimes you certainly could. Maybe after 

he has left the government. But I'm looking for the

principle, if I'm right, that would divide the two. 

MR. KNEEDLER: And --

JUSTICE BREYER: You want to stick to your 

extreme position? Never, just write the thing in --

MR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't regard the 

position as extreme at all. It's exactly --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you want to stick to 

that position, that all the plaintiff --

MR. KNEEDLER: Because this --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- has to do is 

rewrite the name? 

MR. KNEEDLER: -- this is a statute that 

invaded the common law in the -- the background was 

the common law in which the Executive made the 

determinations for both foreign sovereigns and 

individual officials. This -- and in addition, 

it -- it affected the relationship of the 

political branches. It had been a power of the 

Executive Branch for foreign sovereigns. The Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act took that away with the 

agreement of the political branches. 

There’s none of -- there’s no indication 

whatsoever that Congress addressed common law 

immunities, and there’s a good reason. And that is 

that there -- there are a lot of diplomatic

sensitivities about whether immunity should be 

recognized in a particular case or not. 

And with respect to foreign sovereigns, the 

political branches addressed those in very precise ways. 

There’s nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 

to take into account the different sensitivities that 

might well arise with respect to foreign sovereigns --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's an excellent reason. 

Can you give me one single example ever of a complaint 

that would ever be dismissed under this statute --

MR. KNEEDLER: It would -- it --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if -- if my lawyer is 

clever enough to look up who the individuals were and 

substitute their names? 

MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and it would -- here's 

one example in which it would work: If the relief was 

going to run against the state, if there was an 

injunction to take money out of the state treasury or to 

convey land, for example, that would, in substance, be 

an action against the state, just like under Ex parte 

Young. If you tried to bring an injunction against a 

state officer to make him pay money out of the state 

treasury, you couldn't do that. 

It's not because the officer being sued is 

the state. It's that the state is a necessary party to

that lawsuit. The state not being joined, the suit 

against the individual would have to be dismissed. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think as a practical 

matter --

MR. KNEEDLER: That's Pimentel. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- there’s a -- I'm sorry. 

Do you think, as practical matter, there’s a difference 

between a $10 million judgment against a state for 

something that is official state policy in relation to 

defense, and a $10 million judgment against the current 

foreign -- defense minister of that state for exactly the 

same policy? 

MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- there is a 

difference in the operation of the suit. We’re not 

saying that such an official should not be immune. What 

we are saying is that the immunity derives from the 

common law immunity. There’s a presumption against a 

statute invading the common law, and particularly a 

common law that was primarily shaped by the Executive. 

There should be a strong presumption against 

taking that flexibility away in the absence of a clear 

statement in the statute. And as -- and -- if the -- if 

a -- if a suit should go to judgment like that, perhaps 

the state would indemnify the person. But we are not 

saying that that person is not immune. A question that

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. To the -- and -- and I --

I understand the practical problem that the district 

court faced, and the district court was very patient. 

I think it's important to appreciate, 

though, the -- the -- this case really illustrates the 

sensitivities of -- of foreign official immunity. This 

is -- this is a claim of foreign official immunity by a 

former official of a collapsed state in a -- in Somalia, 

as some of the briefs point out. There has not been a 

functioning central government since 1991. There are a 

number of factions. On the ground in Somalia, the 

absence of a central government has led to foreign 

governments coming in and exercising influence, to 

domestic terrorist groups, and to piracy off the -- off 

the coast of Somalia. 

The request to the United States, to the 

State Department for its views, arose in that context. 

This very case at this moment arises in a context where 

things are fluid, and -- and there are circumstances in 

which the Executive Branch or sometimes even the 

court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's very nice.

A few years ago, a Spanish magistrate allowed a lawsuit 

to proceed, as I recall, against our Secretary of Defense. 

And what you say is that that's perfectly okay. It's up 

to the Spanish government to assert that that suit 

should not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly 

okay? 

MR. KNEEDLER: It -- such a suit would not 

be perfectly okay in -- because, I mean, it would depend on 

the circumstances. But as was pointed out with respect 

to the suits against the two Israeli defense ministers, 

in that circumstance, the Israeli Government said, 

listen, these two officers were acting on behalf of --

of the government when they carried -- that's the Dichter 

case and the -- and the case this Court had from the 

Second Circuit last term. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wonder -- I wonder 

if the example you give or the point you make, that 

there’s no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut 

the other way. 

Let's assume you have somebody who was 

acting in an official capacity, doing what his job 

required, whether you like it or not, and then there’s 

a change in the Somali government; and the United States 

likes the new Somali government. That guy is kind of 

put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say

what he maintains is true, which was I was acting 

pursuant to official policy of the government. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the United 

States is not going to give him the letter he needs 

because they like the new Somali government. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, under international law 

the -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of 

the state, not for the individual. The state can waive 

that immunity, and the state can determine whether, as 

happened in the Philippines case, that the -- that the 

actions being complained of were not -- were not within 

the official activity. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it your answer 

to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment 

against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not 

covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And if 

a state interprets international law to allow the suit, 

then it goes forward. 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. If -- if -- if one of 

our officials was sued in a foreign court, then we would 

expect the dynamic to play out as -- as I have 

described, where the United States would take the 

position, presumably that what was being done was within 

the scope of official conduct after investigation and

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that just goes back to

from the State Department to tell us what to do. 

MR. KNEEDLER: And the -- this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought that was the 

whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act. 

MR. KNEEDLER: It -- it was the purpose with 

respect to foreign sovereigns, but there were good 

reasons why the court did that, precisely because 

immunity questions -- as I've said, this case 

illustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or not 

to recognize would -- might favor one faction or another 

in the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --

MR. KNEEDLER: And so the -- what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is -- it's now 

many years, and we still don't -- the State Department 

has said in effect: We decide. 

Can you tell the Court, is this defendant 

amenable to suit or is there an immunity that would 

cover him?

here. The court of appeals remanded for consideration 

of common law head of state and other immunities. 

Suggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered 

to the district court. And the legislative history of 

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly 

says that the official type immunities -- using the 

word “official” immunity, head of state immunity, 

diplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things 

are not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 

Act. 

Section -- section 1602 shows that Congress 

wanted to take the Executive away because the government 

was being pressured by foreign governments with respect 

to the restrictive theory with respect to commercial 

activities. And that's where the pressure was being 

applied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of 

that business, and agreed to. If you read 1602, it 

specifically refers to commercial activities. 

There was no such conscious abrogation of 

the Executive's critical role to make immunity 

determinations on behalf of officials in the legislative 

history. And this Court should not strain to read the 

rigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 

Act, which were just not tailored to the immunities 

that the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dvoretzky,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. DVORETZKY: I’ll try to keep it short. 

I’d like to make three points: First of 

all, when a suit is brought against a -- an official or 

former official, the only question that a court will 

need to answer under the FSIA is whether the acts 

challenged are those of the state. That's a 

determination that courts can readily make and are 

accustomed to making. By contrast --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't that be the 

same question that you would ask invoking a common law 

protection like head of state or act of state? Isn't it 

-- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law 

theory -- the identical question? 

MR. DVORETZKY: It is the same inquiry that

you would have asked under the common law in inquiring 

whether the state's immunity extends to its officials. 

What the FSIA did was it codified that rule, and it took 

away Executive Branch discretion to deviate from it. If 

you look at the Solicitor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that the very 

point? If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and 

under the common law, and we’re unsure what Congress 

intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't 

explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we 

defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is --

has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction? 

Why should we take that power away when the inquiry 

would be the same under either doctrine? 

MR. DVORETZKY: First of all, as we argue in 

our brief, this has not historically been a long-standing 

power of the Executive in the way that the immunity 

itself has been recognized under the common law. And 

what Congress did in 1976 was it codified the substance 

of the common law but took away that procedure. And 

this case demonstrates exactly why it's necessary to 

extend the FSIA to foreign officials in order to -- in 

order to make the FSIA mean anything at all, and in 

order to ensure the uniformity and predictability that 

Congress intended through the statute.

If you look at the factors that the 

Solicitor General proposes to take into account in this 

case -- I’m looking at page 7 of the Solicitor 

General's brief -- “Petitioner's residence in the United 

States rather than Somalia, the nature of the acts 

alleged,” the “invocation of a particular statutory right,” 

the -- the state of the government in Somalia -- these 

are factors that have no basis in the common law that 

the FSIA codified. No case has ever held that a foreign 

official or former official loses immunity for official 

acts on the basis of these sorts of factors. 

Moreover --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you say that if 

the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of 

the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that 

you’re complaining about, is subject to the orders of 

the foreign state, and the relief would affect the 

foreign state, you are suing the foreign state? 

But where he was a member of the foreign 

state, and you want money from him, even though what he 

did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this 

lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not 

affecting the foreign state. Indeed, there isn't even 

one. So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA. In the 

second set, he doesn't. And you happen to have the

second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for 

what he did in the past, but that would be a different 

docket. 

MR. DVORETZKY: All right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where this 

is all leading me. 

MR. DVORETZKY: Because the Restatement --

what the Restatement, which summarized the common laws as 

of the time of the FSIA's enactment, says that an 

official is immune for his acts on behalf of a state if 

exercising jurisdiction would enforce a rule of law 

against the foreign state. You enforce a rule of law 

against a foreign state just as much by threatening to 

bankrupt an official as soon as he leaves office --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this case --

MR. DVORETZKY: -- as you do by issuing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this very case 

establish a rule of law for the foreign state? 

The Act is aimed at torturers. The remedy comes out of 

the private pocket. How does this establish -- if the 

thing plays out and the plaintiffs prevail, there 

will a remedy against an individual actor; there will be 

no relief awarded against any government. How would it 

set a rule for the foreign government?

MR. DVORETZKY: Because enforcing a judgment 

against a foreign official, threatening to bankrupt the 

person as soon as he or she leaves office, has just as 

much effect on the state itself as -- as enforcing a 

judgment directly against the state. It will force 

officials to conform their conduct on behalf of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Never mind that this 

person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia. 

It will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on 

the government of Somalia? 

MR. DVORETZKY: But the -- the rule that the 

government proposes, and the courts would presumably be 

left to apply on their own in the many cases like this 

one and the 9/11 litigation against the Saudis where the 

government doesn't weigh in, that rule does not draw 

those neat lines. 

Why, for example, would we know that a prime 

minister who comes to visit the United States has not 

spent enough time here in order to have his official 

immunity abrogated? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just ask one 

quick question? Am I correct in understanding that you 

do not contend that your client was covered by 

1603(b)(1)?

instrumentalities. And an official, like an agency or 

instrumentality, is the means through which the state 

acts. And, so, if the foreign state include --
