 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 06-937, Quanta Computer v. LG 

Electronics.

 Ms. Mahoney.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Under this Court's exhaustion cases, 

exhaustion has always been triggered when two criteria 

have been satisfied and the district court properly 

dismissed these claims because it found that they were 

satisfied here on the undisputed facts. The first is 

that there must be an authorized sale under the patent 

that was allegedly infringed. That's never been in 

dispute in this case. The Federal Circuit recognized 

that Intel was authorized to sell these components under 

the system and method patents at issue in the case that 

have been allegedly infringed.

 And the second criteria is that the article 

sold must be one that falls within the protection of the 

patent that was allegedly infringed, here the system and 

method patents. But as Univis holds, that test doesn't

apply simply to articles that would directly infringe 

the patent, because the law with contributory 

infringement standards provides that protection to the 

patent owner also to articles that would contributorily 

infringe. In other words --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I just 

get one thing straight in my mind. Which transaction 

triggered the exhaustion doctrine in your judgment, the 

general license to Intel or the sale by Intel to Quanta.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think they work in 

combination here, Your Honor, because once the sale 

was -- once the license was entered into with Intel and 

once unrestricted rights were given to make, use and 

sell components that would infringe, otherwise infringe 

these patents, there was really nothing else that could 

happen --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Was the license 

unrestricted? That's one of the reasons I asked the 

question. Wasn't there a use restriction on the resale?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, there was -- what there 

was, the sale was authorized. The sale was authorized. 

What --

JUSTICE STEVENS: On the condition that it 

be sold to someone who would not use it on non-Intel 

products.

MS. MAHONEY: I don't think that's what the 

lower courts found and I don't think that's what the 

argument has ever been, Your Honor. I think this is 

just like Bobbs-Merrill. There is a -- this Court has 

recognized that there is a difference between actually 

conditioning the seller's authority to sell to someone 

who's going to use it for some prohibited purpose, and 

that would be a case like General Talking Pictures, 

where it says, you do not have authority to sell to 

someone who's going to use it for the home market. But 

Bobbs-Merrill says if what you do instead -- it was a 

copyright case that was applied in Motion Picture 

Patents. If what you do instead is you give them 

authority to sell, you don't say you'll be in breach if 

you sell it to somebody who's going to sell books at 

below the retail price I've specified, if instead what 

you do is say, you have to agree you'll give them notice 

that the -- that the owner of the invention, or in that 

case the copyright, is not agreeing to your use of these 

books or sale of these books at below a certain price, 

that doesn't count. There's still an authorized sale, 

that when -- that you can't -- that the patent owner 

can't try to retain part of the monopoly right to sell.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if that's true 

then this case really isn't a big deal at all. It just

depends on exactly how you word the contract when the 

patentee sells it to a purchaser. You can word it -- in 

other words, you can word it in such a way that the 

patentee's rights extend further downstream and you're 

saying all this case turns on is whether the wording 

here was correct or not.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, the wording hasn't been 

in dispute, but a lot of important things turn on it, 

because of course if Intel didn't have the authority to 

make these sales, it would be liable for contributory 

infringement. And undoubtedly when Intel decided how 

much to pay for this license it cared deeply about 

whether it was going to be exposed to that liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand 

your position to -- to acknowledge that they could have 

structured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve 

the same result that you're saying is so bad under the 

patent laws.

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

Once they have an authorized sale, then the results are 

different, because if there has been an authorized sale 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I give you a specific 

example? I think the Chief has something on this order 

in mind. Could the patentee say to the licensee, to the

Intel, that, I license you to sell only to buyers who 

have a license from the patentee? Could -- could the 

licensee be limited in that way?

 MS. MAHONEY: They could do that, and let me 

explain the consequences of doing that. If Intel then 

under those circumstances sold to a buyer who did not 

have a license, Intel would be liable for contributory 

infringement because it wouldn't be an authorized sale, 

and the buyer would be liable for infringement because 

it didn't acquire the goods through an authorized sale. 

If the buyer instead has the license, has obtained the 

license from the patentowner, then there has been an 

authorized sale and any remedies that the owner of the 

patent would have against the buyer would be those found 

in contract, because the triggering line under this 

Court's cases is has there been an authorized sale? And 

this makes perfect sense because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But explain to me --

perhaps I should ask Mr. Phillips this question -- but 

why isn't it done that way? The way -- if the patentee 

wants to maintain control further down the line, why 

doesn't the patentee just limit the licensee to selling 

to people who are licensed?

 MS. MAHONEY: Presumably because in this 

circumstance -- it's not in the record -- but presumably

Intel wouldn't agree to these terms unless it in fact 

was given authority to sell, no matter how it was going 

to be used, because otherwise it would still be on the 

hook for liability. And -- and presumably they could 

have done something that would have required an 

agreement with -- you know, between -- only sell to 

someone with an agreement. But for whatever reason the 

parties didn't negotiate that term. Perhaps Intel 

wasn't willing to do it that way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the parties are 

unwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work 

out in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take 

their chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to 

rule. It's easier to sell these things if they're not 

encumbered by these additional license requirements and 

the manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's 

a lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been 

cured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer 

to live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than 

clear it up in the contract.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I think that this 

Court's ruling would certainly make things clear, but I 

think that the language of the contract recognizes that 

the -- specifically says that, notwithstanding anything 

to the contrary, the ordinary operation of patent

exhaustion is supposed to apply here. In other words, I 

think Intel knew --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Fine, and the person 

who wrote that provision knows that the question of how 

the patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of 

great confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme 

Court's going to have to decide it, and yet they put 

that in there rather than spelling out in the contract 

exactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could 

impose these further restrictions or couldn't.

 MS. MAHONEY: But, Your Honor, I think that 

under this Court's decision in Univis Lens, as the 

district court recognized, the answer in this case is 

actually quite clear what the patent-exhaustion doctrine 

would require. And the reason it's clear --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wasn't 

clear to the Federal Circuit, I guess.

 MS. MAHONEY: It wasn't clear to the Federal 

Circuit, but it was clear to the district court, showing 

that the idea that somehow it was absolutely known to 

everybody what the outcome of this issue would be is not 

correct. The district court, I think correctly, 

understood that Univis Lens was the controlling case. 

Of course, the Federal Circuit didn't even cite it. But 

the district court found that the Univis Lens standard

was satisfied because these components were necessarily 

manufactured in a manner that satisfied, that included 

the functionality of the system and method patents at 

issue here. At 30a, the district court looks to LGE's 

own claim charts and says that their own allegations 

show that they were manufactured in a way that met many 

of the limitations of the claims.

 In addition, at 67 of the petition appendix, 

she says that by attaching the components, the Intel 

chips, to the -- the other generic wires and memory, it 

necessarily caused these products to infringe. And, at 

46, she says, "Failure to follow Intel's design 

specifications would render the computers inoperable."

 So, this is a case where there's just no 

question that if LGE's allegations are correct these 

products would have contributorily infringed. So Intel 

knew that in order to avoid potential liability to -- to 

LGE, that it had to get full authority to sell, and it 

did. And there's never been any dispute about that. 

Instead, there's simply the Federal Circuit's view that 

even if you have an authorized sale, that the 

patentowner is nevertheless allowed to say, okay, I 

authorize the seller to sell it to anybody, but I want 

to retain the right to control the use of the -- of the 

buyer. And that's exactly what this Court's cases have

always said, with the exception of A.B. Dick, cannot be 

done because the whole point of the exhaustion doctrine 

is to demarcate the line between where the monopoly 

power to control rights to use and sell end and where 

any rights under contract must begin.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's one --

there's one more wrinkle that you don't expressly advert 

to and that is the argument that what is in issue here 

are the -- are the systems and methods patents, rather 

than the -- the equipment component patents.

 MS. MAHONEY: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that with respect to 

the equipment component patents nothing is being 

retained, but with respect to the systems and method 

patents nothing was being granted. What is your answer 

to that answer to your argument?

 MS. MAHONEY: It's completely inconsistent 

with the way the case has been litigated from the outset 

as well as the terms of the contract. At page 5 of the 

petition appendix, the Federal Circuit acknowledges that 

Intel had full authority to sell these components under 

all of the patents, including the system and method 

patents. If it didn't have authority to manufacture and 

sell under the system and method patents, it would be 

potentially liable for contributory infringement. And

in fact LGE has acknowledged in its brief in footnote 7 

that Intel isn't potentially liable for contributory 

infringement under the terms of this agreement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the answer simply is 

that that the argument rests upon a mistake of fact 

which has not been challenged in the record?

 MS. MAHONEY: It absolutely has not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MS. MAHONEY: The component patents are not 

at issue here at all. And the idea that you couldn't 

have one patent on a component and another patent on a 

system where the component would contributorily infringe 

is nonsensical. These components had thousands of 

patents on them. And certainly the argument isn't that 

by authorizing the sale of the component all of the 

owner's rights are released in that. If, instead, there 

had been a sale of a component where a patent owner 

says, I'll authorize you to sell my -- my -- that 

component under my component patent, but if you sell it 

under my system patent -- I'm not giving you authority 

to sell it under my system patent, so if you sell it, 

I'm going to sue you for infringement, that didn't 

happen here, and it's never been litigated in that way.

 Instead, that first criteria of the 

authorized sale has plainly been satisfied, and the only

question in this case has been whether or not this 

satisfied the contributory infringement standard that 

Univis Lens uses to define what articles --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, I understand 

that's really the way it's been litigated, but I have to 

confess I was puzzled by the court of appeals' statement 

that the granting of the license constituted a sale for 

exhaustion purposes, and they cited the Masonite case 

for that proposition, but it doesn't seem to me to 

support that proposition.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think all that 

that really is saying is that at a point when you enter 

into -- a patentowner enters into an unrestricted 

license to make, use, and sell with a manufacturer, then 

at that point any articles that are manufactured under 

that license, effectively the patent's been exhausted. 

But I think it's easier to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not exhausted by the 

manufacturer, is it?

 MS. MAHONEY: No. For contributorily 

infringing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's exhausted under this 

view by the licensee's sale of an article that it 

manufactured pursuant to the license.

 MS. MAHONEY: But -- right, manufactured

pursuant --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it seems to think 

there's no distinction between the sale itself and the 

basic underlying license, whereas I had thought for 

years that there was recognized a distinction between 

those two transactions.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I think that it just 

means that once you have that transaction any sales that 

occur for those articles under that license are going to 

be exhausted by definition. But, you know, we have 

certainly focused on the sale of the articles to Quanta 

from Intel, and I think, you know, it makes sense to 

look at it that way.

 And, as indicated, there really is -- there 

have been arguments that somehow this deprives the 

patentowner of the right to collect its full royalty, 

but that doesn't make any sense. Because if you -- if 

you look at the rights that are afforded under 

contributory infringement, what Congress has done in 

Section 271(c) and what this Court had done before was 

to say that if you are the owner of a system patent or a 

method patent, you can go ahead and collect your royalty 

when someone sells a product that will contributorily 

infringe.

 In other words, your -- your product is

sufficiently -- your patent is sufficiently embodied in 

those contributorily infringing products that it's 

appropriate for you to collect your royalty there. 

That's exactly what happened in this case. LGE did get 

its royalty from Intel, did give them authority to sell 

products which would otherwise contributorily infringe, 

and now what it's seeking to do is to say, despite the 

authorized sale, despite the fact it would 

contributorily infringe, we want to collect another 

royalty from the buyer of the product that can't use it 

for any other purpose. Why? Well, because we have --

we had them sent a notice that said we wanted to do 

that.

 Under this Court's cases, that is completely 

impermissible. In two cases in particular, Motion 

Picture Patents, they tried to do the exact same thing. 

And in the Millinger case the patentowner said that it 

had never gotten paid for the extension rights under its 

patent. And this Court said: Nope; once you've sold 

the article, that's the royalty you get.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your white light is 

on. I have just one question. Are there cases where 

some downstream restrictions on use might be necessary 

to prevent the patent from becoming worthless, i.e., in 

the biological area for replication of seeds in

agriculture and so forth?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, what we're -- exhaustion 

is triggered when -- with respect to the rights to 

control and use. Rights to make are treated 

differently.

 Univis, of course, though, holds that when 

you're talking about the sale of a contributorily 

infringing product, you're really talking about the 

right to -- to make it, to use it, to complete the --

complete the article. But I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought Univis was one 

of your principal cases.

 MS. MAHONEY: It is, absolutely. It holds 

-- in other words, what Univis holds is that when you 

have an article that is uncompleted -- it's not finished 

-- as in this case, by the -- the sale will -- will 

mean, by definition, that you can use it to complete the 

article.

 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my 

time. Thank you.

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 For 150 years this Court has held that an 

authorized sale removes the particular item sold from 

the protection of the patent laws. The court below 

erroneously transformed that patent-exhaustion doctrine 

from a definitional principle that delimits the scope of 

the patent grant into an optional default assumption 

that can be discarded at the whim of the patentee. 

If the rationale of the court of appeals were correct, 

this Court's decisions in cases like Univis, Motion 

Picture Patents, Straus, Bauer and Boston Store would 

have to have gone the other way, because in each of 

those cases this Court held that the exhaustion 

principle overrode express restrictions that the 

patentee had attempted to impose on after-sale use or 

resale by an authorized purchaser.

 This Court should follow its precedents and 

reaffirm the principle that the patent-exhaustion 

doctrine precludes a patentee from employing the patent 

law to enforce post-sale restrictions on use or resale 

by authorized purchasers, that is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, is there a

reason why Congress codified this doctrine in the 

Copyright Act, but not in the Patent Act?

 MR. HUNGAR: We -- there's nothing in the 

legislative record that would explain that, Your Honor. 

Presumably it's because Congress wanted to specify 

particular limits, which Section 109 of the Copyright 

Act does. It wanted to specify particular limits to 

define the scope of the doctrine in the copyright 

context in a way that it has not sought -- found it 

necessary to do in the patent area.

 But there's no legislative history about 

this. I mean, this Court has said that the 1952 act 

codified, recodified, and readopted, reaffirmed, the 

principles of the Court's cases on infringement 

generally. Obviously --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the PTO didn't take 

any position on whether it should be codified?

 MR. HUNGAR: I'm not aware of anything in 

the legislative history of the 1952 codification on the 

subject of the patent exhaustion doctrine one way or the 

other; but, obviously, Congress did not express any 

dissatisfaction with it.

 It did change certain aspects of patent law, 

but it did not attempt in any way to override or change 

the effect of the first-sale doctrine, which under this

Court's cases has been perfectly clear for well over a 

century and has the effect we've suggested.

 And we submit that, although the Respondent 

essentially ignores or runs away from the rationale of 

the court of appeals, we submit it's important for this 

Court to explicitly address and explicitly reject the 

Federal Circuit's misunderstanding of the 

patent-exhaustion doctrine, its view that a patentee can 

essentially override it simply by attaching a notice to 

the article that has been sold in an authorized sale.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Although you think 

it can be overridden simply by providing in the contract 

that the same rights and remedies would be available?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. I mean, it 

depends a little bit on what contract we're talking 

about and what it says. It is true, as Justice Stevens 

indicated, it has always been true, that this Court has 

deemed a license under a patent to be different from a 

sale of a particular article under a patent. It is the 

sale of the article that exhausts. The license does not 

-- exhaustion doesn't -- isn't relevant at the mere 

licensing stage.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A mere license can 

prevent the application of the patent-exhaustion 

doctrine?

MR. HUNGAR: Well, only at the -- only at 

the level of the licensee. That is, if it is true, as 

Ms. Mahoney said, if the -- if LG here had given a 

restricted license that restricted the right to sell, 

that said you can only sell in these instances, and if 

Intel then sold outside those permitted instances, that 

would be patent infringement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it would be 

patent infringement by the use of the product by the 

people that Intel sold to?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, because it was an 

unauthorized sale.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would sound 

like your friend on the other side, the Respondent, had 

actually won in this case.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, that's right. If this 

had been an authorized sale -- I mean an unauthorized 

sale, they would win. But, of course, it's been 

accepted throughout the case, and the court of appeals 

explicitly said at page 5A, and it's been undisputed, 

that Intel had the right to sell these items to these 

Petitioners.

 They had the right to sell. It was not 

infringing. And if it's not "infringing," by 

definition, it's an "authorized" sale. It's authorized

under the patent explicitly by the license agreement.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you couldn't put in --

you are authorized to sell the bicycle pedals that I 

have patented only if you impose a restriction that will 

tell the bicycle user that he must send me a check for 

$15 in addition to whatever he pays you. That sounds 

unlawful under contract law.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, it might be lawful. You 

could certainly do what, in fact, I think some of the 

seed companies --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or you are going to have --

I mean, there's a doctrine that you cannot impose 

equitable servitude's upon chattel.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a contract law 

doctrine.

 MR. HUNGAR: It would not be enforceable as 

a matter of patent law against the authorized purchaser. 

If -- if the licensee does what the licensee is 

obligated to do, it imposes the -- it attaches the 

notice or it requires the --

JUSTICE BREYER: My thought is that the 

reason that these things are important and you can't 

just draft your way around them is because there are 

antitrust doctrines, there are contract-law doctrines,

that also limit in significant ways what you can and 

cannot write into a contract.

 MR. HUNGAR: That's exactly right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that's 

an important question. I understood the argument at 

page 16 of your brief to say that the patent-exhaustion 

doctrine doesn't apply in that situation and that you, 

therefore, can't have the rights and remedies under 

patent law.

 You told me earlier that if the person to 

whom Intel sells the product uses it contrary to the 

license stipulation, they would be liable for patent 

infringement.

 Your answer to Justice Breyer suggests to me 

that you're saying only that they're liable to -- for 

contract infringement, and that's a very big difference.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well -- but, Your Honor, it all 

goes back to the question: Was there an authorized sale 

of the article at issue? If the sale is authorized, if 

what the licensee --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sale from whom to 

whom?

 MR. HUNGAR: The sale from the licensee to 

the purchaser. The license is not a sale -- is not a 

sale for purposes of the patent exhaustion. I think

that the Federal Circuit was just wrong in saying that, 

because what the patent-exhaustion doctrine talks about 

is the sale of an article. All the cases say the sale 

of the particular article removes that article from the 

-- from the patent monopoly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what you --

well, but what you say in your brief is that in the 

situation we're talking about the licensee stands in the 

shoes of the patentee. Now, if that's right it seems to 

me that you're telling me that the patent remedies are 

available and not simply contractual remedies.

 MR. HUNGAR: No. What we're saying is this. 

If -- if the licensee has a restricted license, that is 

its right to sell is restricted, it can only sell on 

Mondays and not on Tuesdays --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

MR. HUNGAR: -- and it sells on a Tuesday.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, or, more 

pertinently, it can only sell if the person they sell to 

agrees not to use the product in a certain way.

 MR. HUNGAR: Fine. If they have that 

restriction and they sell and they do not -- they do not 

obtain the contractual promise of the party that they 

are obligated to obtain, they're violating the terms of 

their right to sell. It's patent infringement by the

seller, and if the buyer uses it it's patent 

infringement by them as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. That's the 

critical point. You're telling me that if the buyer, in 

other words, the kind of third person in this chain, 

uses the patented article in a way that is contrary to 

the license that was given to the second person in the 

chain, then he is liable for contributory infringement 

under the patent laws and not, as I understood you to 

answer to Justice Breyer, only under contract law.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you sue under 

patent law or just contract law?

 MR. HUNGAR: If -- in your hypothetical, as 

I understand it, it's an unauthorized sale. The 

licensee does not have the right to sell under the 

patent in those circumstances, and therefore the 

exhaustion principle does not apply.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But not every infringement 

of the license is necessarily an unauthorized sale.

 MR. HUNGAR: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So there could be a 

restriction in the license which is not a restriction on 

sale and that could be violated. And the exhaustion 

doctrine would still apply, and you might have remedies

in some another theory, i.e., contract.

 MR. HUNGAR: That's correct. That's 

correct. Likewise, what happens in the real world is 

the patentee, if the patentee wants to restrict what 

people can do downstream, they say to the licensee, you 

can only sell if you obtain a contractual promise from 

the purchaser.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that this 

case would come out differently if instead of just 

requiring a notice that the -- the item should only be 

used on Intel products, that had been a condition of the 

license. If the license itself said you may manufacture 

and sell to only people who agree to use the product 

exclusively with Intel products?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes. In if those 

circumstances, if Quanta had -- if that -- if that 

license condition --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the key fact in this 

case is it was just a requirement of giving notice 

rather than a condition in the license?

 MR. HUNGAR: But let me be clear. The key 

distinction is between an authorized sale and an 

unauthorized sale. So if there is an authorized sale, 

that is, Intel --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that.

MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think I haven't been

consequences are clear --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The big key is what is an 

authorized sale? And I'm asking you if the -- if the 

license agreement to the -- to Intel had said you may 

only sell to people who agree to use the products on the 

patentee's products, that then would -- and they did 

otherwise, they didn't get -- then it would not have 

been an authorized sale?

 MR. HUNGAR: Correct, and it would be patent 

infringement. But if they sold and the purchaser did 

agree, they did enforce that requirement, they did 

require the purchaser to sign a promise -- may I finish, 

Your Honor -- to promise to limit the use and the 

purchaser then violated that promise, the point is that 

would be a breach of contract but it would not be patent 

infringement because the sale was authorized, the patent 

monopoly ends and only contract principles control 

thereafter.

Mr. Hungar.

MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Justice Souter, I want to go to your 

question, because, frankly, I think it is the key to the 

entirety of this case. And that is, what is the "it" 

that we are talking about? And what's absolutely 

critical here is, yes, there was -- you know, this is 

the first sale doctrine. It's easy to call it 

patent-exhaustion, but the truth is it's the first sale 

doctrine.

 And the question is, what was sold here? 

And the only sale that was involved here was the 

chipsets. And there is a completely separate patent 

that deals with the rest of the system and that deals 

with the method. And nothing -- and this is the key 

point of this. The exhaustion doctrine only goes as far 

as the sale.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's 

nothing to do with these chipsets other than use them in 

the computers. I mean, you don't put them on your 

shelf. They're not good for anything other than using 

in the computer. So saying there's a separate patent 

for how you use them with the other systems doesn't seem 

to be very significant.

 MR. PHILLIPS: It would be -- and that's why

you would ordinarily -- you don't deal with this as an 

exhaustion issue. That's why you would deal with this 

as an implied licensing issue.

 The assumption would be, in the absence of 

clear evidence to the contrary, that if I'm selling you 

something that only has a single use and that's in a 

separate patent, that you in fact are being licensed to 

go and use it that way. But what's absolutely critical 

in this case is that both the district court and the 

court of appeals specifically rejected the notion that 

there was any implied license. And it's important to 

realize this.

 Even as we approach this case, we didn't sue 

for any of the activities that predated when the other 

side received its notice. We sued only for the 

activities post notice. Why? Because at that stage it 

was absolutely clear that there was no implied license 

any longer and there's no basis for expanding the 

exhaustion doctrine to try to fill that void.

 The exhaustion doctrine ought to be retained 

as a very narrow first sale doctrine, because it doesn't 

have any congressional support or approval at this 

point. It is a logical way of proceeding. It protects 

people against being surprised when they purchase a 

particular product. But to go beyond that and to say

that simply because that sale, that particular product 

is, quote, an "essential feature" of a separate patent 

and therefore you have now exhausted the rights to that 

second patent seems to me a stretch that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a reason, I 

guess, that would be so. Imagine that I want to buy 

some bicycle pedals, so I go to the bicycle shop. These 

are fabulous pedals. The inventor has licensed somebody 

to make them, and he sold them to the shop, make and 

sell them. He sold them to the shop. I go buy the 

pedals. I put it in my bicycle. I start pedaling down 

the road.

 Now, we don't want 19 patent inspectors 

chasing me or all of the other companies and there are 

many doctrines in the law designed to stop that. One is 

the equitable servitudes on chattel. Another is the 

exhaustion of a patent. And now you talk about implied 

license.

 I would say, why does it make that much 

difference? What we're talking about here is whether 

after those pedals are sold to me under an agreement 

that the patent -- you know, you have a right to sell 

them to me -- why can't I look at this as saying that 

patent is exhausted, the patent on the pedals and the 

patent for those bicycles insofar as that patent for the

bicycles says I have a patent on inserting the pedal 

into a bicycle.

 Call it exhaustion, call it implied license. 

Who cares?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't have any problem with 

your hypothetical because it's not this case. Your 

hypothetical deals with the situation of what would have 

happened if you had bought the chip. Would we be in a 

position to say, even though you bought the chip, we 

nevertheless want to retain some right to come out -- to 

come after you claiming we still have a patent in that 

chip? And the answer is no. We exhausted -- that was 

exhausted by the sale of the chip.

 The question is if you buy a pedal, can you 

then take that pedal that was designed for a bicycle, 

put it into a Stair Master --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but I thought --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- patent in the Stair 

Master --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Of course, I think 

the answer to that is no, probably no, but, but, but, 

but. Now you can clarify this because I may be off on a 

wrong track. I thought we're talking about using the 

sold item in those mechanisms which account for 

virtually almost the only logical use of the sold item.

Thus, if you took the bicycle blanks -- not the bicycle 

blanks; they are eyeglass blanks. I'm mixed up between 

bicycles and eyeglasses, there we are.

 But if you took the eyeglass blanks and you 

use them for the purpose of growing plants instead of 

inserting them into eyeglasses, I guess we'd have had a 

different case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I take it here they are 

using those chips in those mechanisms that the chips are 

almost exclusively designed for and there isn't much 

else to use them for. Am I right or wrong?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That is true. But the -- but 

the point here is that that's not the relevant 

distinction. It's not whether or not this is in some 

sense an essential use. What this Court said in Univis 

is that this would be a very -- that would have been a 

very different case if there had been a separate patent 

on the grinding and finishing of those lenses. And that 

is precisely our case. There is a separate patent when 

you take those components and you then put them into our 

separate system.

 And from my perspective, Your Honor, the 

better way to analyze this is not as a question of 

exhaustion. Let's keep the exhaustion doctrine where it

fits. It's a first sale component. You buy it, you 

exhaust. Let's use the implied licensing as the 

mechanism for dealing with related patents.

 But the beauty of that in this case, 

obviously, is that -- is that the implied license in 

this case the courts below have flatly said doesn't 

exist. And it goes to the point that you made, Justice 

Breyer, as well when you said, you know, I buy this and 

I sort of assume that I'm going to be able to use it in 

a particular way. These -- this is a $10 billion 

company that at the time they bought these components, 

these chips, received explicit and specific notice that 

the one thing they could not do was use these chips to 

build new systems and then sell those systems, 

obviously, beyond -- you know, under a completely 

separate patent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips.

 MR. PHILLIPS: So it's not as though they 

didn't know what they were getting when they bought it. 

They bought cheap chips and turned them into $2,000 

laptops because they didn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Your Honor.

does clause 3.8 of the license mean? It says,

"notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 

agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall 

in any way limit or alter the effect of patent 

exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party 

hereto sells any of its licensed products."

 In other words, the patent exhaustion 

doctrine may not apply for all the reasons that we've 

been talking about, but it applies in the way it would 

apply if we just sold these licensed products. That 

seems to me to give away everything you're talking 

about.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. Because that -- that 

depends on the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine. 

If the patent exhaustion doctrine is limited to the sale 

of the specific product -- let's for instance assume for 

a moment that what in fact happened was that Intel sold 

the system, rather than the chips. Then that would --

that would exhaust the patent doctrine.

 Now, you know, the question is -- and here 

there is a disconnect in some respects between the 

Mallinckrodt decision in the Federal Circuit and some of 

this Court's previous decisions on to the extent to 

which you can condition a sale, and I think in some ways 

that language may have been given up what rights we 

might have been able to assert under Mallinckrodt on a

somewhat broader basis. But I don't think it can be 

read any further than that, and it certainly -- and the 

key to this is it certainly doesn't in any way waive our 

rights, you know, as an implied license matter, because 

that's -- specifically what both the district court and 

the court of appeals held is there is no implied license 

in this particular context, and so therefore for them to 

prevail they have to expand the patent exhaustion 

doctrine or the first sale doctrine beyond the first 

sale; and that I submit to you is something that's 

simply not appropriate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in 

understanding that you do not defend the Mallinckrodt 

decision?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I do not defend the 

Mallinckrodt decision, Justice Stevens, and clearly I 

don't believe I have to. All I need to do is have this 

Court recognize that the central limiting feature of 

Univis was the fact that it was all one patent and that 

all you were doing was fulfilling the rights that had 

been provided for you in that single patent, and that 

that that's fundamentally -- and that the Court 

recognized that if there were a separate patent involved 

and you were trying to enforce those rights, that would 

be a completely different matter.

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you also do 

not challenge the proposition that the sale by the 

licensee in this case should be treated as a first sale.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, the chip.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. There's no 

question about that. We have never challenged that, and 

I think the point I made earlier is also valid.  We 

didn't challenge their use, their otherwise infringement 

of our system until we gave them notice; and at that 

point we said there is no implied license, because I do 

think, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a fair point, and it's 

the same point Justice Breyer made, which is, look, if 

you buy something and you think this is your normal 

assumption that you're going to use it in a particular 

way, that ought to be protected. I think that's 

ordinary kind of contract expectation rules. But the 

point here is that the language of this notice could not 

have been plainer to anyone --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, now if it should 

be protected -- and here I'm not sure I'm understanding 

it, so correct me. Let's suppose we have this contract. 

So everything is identical except we've got my bicycle 

example in here because I'm more comfortable with that.

shop and I buy this, this mechanism with the pedals on 

it, and then I insert it in my bicycle. Now, actually I 

need help in doing that, but I do it. Okay. Now I 

start pedaling off, and now what is it for all these 

things here that would stop that original inventor from 

catching me and hauling me into court, and say, what 

you've done, Breyer, is you've put my -- my mechanism 

here in this bicycle and I happen to have a patent on 

the system. And now you start talking to me about, 

well, the patent was exhausted on the bicycle --

MR. PHILLIPS: Pedal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- pedals, but not on the 

system.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that -- in that 

particular context, in the absence of relatively clear 

notice, I think it would be quite reasonable to 

potentially find that there was an implied license to 

use it under those circumstances.

wrong?

particular product, what it doesn't give you the right

bicycle shop, I go in the bicycle shop and I buy the 

pedals and then they give me, you know, one of these 

pieces of paper that has all of the 42,000 words on it 

and there in these 42,000 words it says, and now you are 

put on notice that once you put it in your bicycle and 

you pedal away, they're going to get you and you're 

going to be hauled into Patent Court, then -- then 

that's okay?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Breyer, we can 

quarrel about sort of the nature of the notice and what 

notice is adequate to do that, but the basic point here, 

which I think is indisputable, is that, one, the notice 

here is quite clear. It's one page. It's very 

specific. These are very sophisticated parties and they 

understood that they were not obtaining an implied 

license by purchasing the chips rather than going out 

and purchasing the systems.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But assuming a 

simple notice, the answer to his bicycle hypo is yes, 

they can chase me down the road.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, to be sure. If I have 

separate patent on the bicycle, I'm entitled to stop 

people from using that particular bicycle. Now, 

generally speaking, to be sure, you don't go after the 

consumers because most people who are in the business of

manufacturing don't develop a really good following by 

suing their ultimate consumers. So what you do is you 

find the people who are in the middle, the middle spot, 

who are actually doing the manufacturing and who are in 

fact violating the patent, and that's who you go after. 

And in this context --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's other --

MR. PHILLIPS: Precisely -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the reason that there's 

no implied license here, one, because you got the 

notice, or two, because the component has uses in other 

kinds of methods than the patented method?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the better answer is 

one, because they had clear notice.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think the notice on 

that to defeat the implied --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think there is an 

argument as to whether there might be non-infringing 

uses. We disagree about that. But I think the better 

argument is one.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The court below did not 

rely on the fact that there might be non-infringing 

uses, did it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. The court below did not 

rely on that.

JUSTICE STEVENS: It relied on the notice.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, right. Well, I mean, 

the court of appeals had a much -- it was a much easier 

case, frankly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be kind of an 

unusual answer to the implied license argument, because 

normally it doesn't depend on what the patentee decides 

to say somewhere down - down the line. That's kind of 

an unusual reason for not finding an implied license, I 

think.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean I think the 

district court just said, look, that -- you know, 

ordinarily you would say, if you're buying something 

with the understanding that you're going to -- that its 

primary or maybe exclusive use will be in a particular 

way, that that would be a reasonable implied -- you 

could imply a license by those facts alone. Then the 

question is whether or not that implication has in some 

sense been clearly overridden by the conduct of the 

parties under the circumstances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's subsequent 

conduct. If the implied license occurred, it didn't 

occur at the time of the sale; and it couldn't be -- it 

couldn't be negated at the time of the sale. If it 

occurred, it occurred at the time of the license, right,

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No.

license clearly can't extend to the ultimate purchaser 

until the ultimate purchaser gives something.

you implicitly give the licensee the right to permit the 

people to whom he sells the product to use the license.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

licensee surely.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But we clearly didn't do 

that. That -- I mean that -- the two court rulings 

clearly resolved that.

unless it's implicit when you sell a -- a bicycle pedal

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the 

notice says.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the notice. That's 

later. That's downstream. That's after the license. 

That's at the time of the sale.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But that goes to clear -- I 

mean, but that goes to the clear understanding -- I mean 

the question is -- if the question is did Intel have the 

right to sell the system as a system, the answer is yes. 

It was licensed to do that. But it didn't sell the 

system as a system. It sold the components of the 

system. And then the question is, does it have as a 

consequence of that some kind of an implied license to 

do this? And the courts below both specifically held 

no.

 And I think the other thing about this, 

Justice Scalia, is that this was not an issue in this 

case. Both courts below held that that's not the 

question presented. In order for the Petitioner in this 

case to prevail, they have to demonstrate that this is 

an exhaustion concept.

MR. PHILLIPS: That's the question presented 

in the petition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They're saying the reason 

they have done so is that the following distinction is 

significant. There's a distinction between a license 

that says you can't sell this unless certain conditions 

are satisfied and, on the other hand, a license that 

says you can sell this, but if you sell it to a buyer 

who is described by conditions A and B, you've got to 

tell the buyer that we're going to make a claim against 

A and B. And the ones -- in the first example, there is 

a limit to the right to sell. In the second example, 

there is no limit on the right to sell, but there's a 

warning about what we're going to do if you do sell 

under certain conditions. And I think they're saying 

that unless you have a contract of the former sort which 

limits your right to sell, then when you do sell, 

exhaustion applies and whatever you may do against the 

ultimate buyer is -- is a contract problem or what-not, 

but it's not -- it's not a matter of patent.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the problem --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Number one, do you think I 

am being correct in characterizing, describing the 

distinction they make?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think so.

JUSTICE SOUTER: And B, if I am, why isn't 

that distinction an answer to your argument?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because, because it ignores 

the fact that there are separate patents involved in 

this case. There is no question that -- there is an 

issue. I mean I don't think there's a question that --

you know, as to how far you can go down the road in 

trying to condition a particular sale. I thought this 

Court may have resolved this already. Mallinckrodt 

leaves that issue open, but that's not -- that's not the 

question.

 The issue here is if I sell to you, Justice 

Souter, a particular chip, whether I condition it or 

not, I think that's -- to me that's unenforceable. But 

the question is, can you then take that chip and use it 

to violate a separate patent? And the reason you know 

that it's not exhaustion --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I understand where 

you're going. So then what you're saying, I guess, is 

that the real issue does not involve this distinction 

between a --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- a limited right and a 

right --

MR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.

later.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to go after people 

MR. PHILLIPS: That's not the issue in this 

case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What it -- what it involves 

is the statement that they make that if you license the 

manufacture, use, and sale of a particular component and 

that particular component has only one reasonable use --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- then you have 

necessarily licensed them to sell with that ultimate use 

in mind, and when you do -- when you license them to 

sell, the patent-exhaustion doctrine attaches to any 

patent right that you may have, whether you call it 

system --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- or whether you call it


component.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you are saying that 

argument is no good because that, in fact, is an implied 

license argument, and there were findings that there was 

no implied license.

position.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That is correct, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And let me further --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then explain -- now this 

you might know because it's just following up on what 

Justice Souter said better than I did. I think from 

these briefs I've gotten the impression that at least 

some people think that where you invent a component, 

say, like the bicycle pedals, and it really has only one 

use, which is to go into a bicycle, it's the easiest 

thing in the world to get a patent not just on that 

component but to also get a patent on the system, which 

is called handlebars, body, and pedals.

 And since that's just a drafting question, 

all that we would do by finding in your favor is to 

destroy the exhaustion doctrine, because all that would 

happen, if it hasn't happened already, is these 

brilliant patent lawyers, and they don't even -- they 

can be great patent lawyers, not just fine lawyers, and 

just draft it the way I said and that's the end of the 

exhaustion doctrine. And that's why it is preferable to 

say it is exhausted. What is exhausted? One, the 

patent on this component and, two, the patent on any

system involving this component where that system is the 

only reasonable use of the component, rather than using 

the terminology "implied license."

 Now, I think that's an argument that's being 

made in some of these briefs, and if so I'd like to you 

reply.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that clearly 

understates the role of the PTO in granting a separate 

patent. I mean, this is not -- these are not things you 

pick up at the corner drugstore. You have to justify 

them. And if you look at Section 282, "a patent shall 

be presumed valid," each claim shall be presumed valid 

independently of the validity of other claims. And 

there's an independence that's embedded in this entire 

scheme. If it's true that the PTO has in fact granted 

patent rights on something that's fundamentally not 

different from the other -- from some other patent, the 

solution to that is a validity challenge. And candidly, 

I think that's exactly what all of those arguments are 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- is patent validity 

challenges.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That argument didn't 

prevail last year in the KSR case, right? I mean, we're

-- we've had experience with the Patent Office where it 

tends to grant patents a lot more liberally than we 

would enforce under the patent law.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but all -- I'm not --

I'm not particularly criticizing the PTO. What I'm 

saying is that the statutory scheme presumes that there 

is a separateness when a patent is issued and, therefore 

-- and which is why -- again, the first -- there's no 

reason to go to an expansion of the first-sale doctrine 

in order to deal with the kinds of problems you have 

here because in general -- in general you can deal with 

it as a matter of implied license, but that issue has 

been resolved adverse to the other side in this case, 

and there's no reason to sort of fill in that void.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, when you say 

that was resolved adversely, you say there was a finding 

of no implied license.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that a finding of no 

implied license from LGE to Intel or no implied license 

from Intel to the buyers?

 MR. PHILLIPS: From Intel to the buyers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the crucial -- is 

that the crucial step?

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That's -- that's the 

critical component of this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that --

MR. PHILLIPS: The buyer would have to 

assert exhaustion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that was an implied 

license from LGE to Intel, then Intel would have 

authority to sell -- to sell these things for their --

for their use.

 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, Intel has the 

authority to sell these things, and it has the authority 

to sell -- it depends on what the things are. It has 

the authority to sell the chips. It has the authority 

to sell the systems, but what it doesn't have the 

authority to do is to allow somebody downstream to take 

the chips and put them into the separately patented 

systems, and the -- and the people downstream know that 

they don't have that entitlement.

 Justice Souter, to me the patent-exhaustion 

doctrine is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the exhaustion, if 

Intel got -- if Intel got -- I'm sorry. Yes, if Intel 

got an implied license to the system from LGE when it 

sold those products, it seems to me the exhaustion 

doctrine would take hold and would -- would apply to

that implied license just as it applied to the -- to the 

license of the chips.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the answer to that is 

it shouldn't, that the exhaustion doctrine should be 

retained as a first-sale doctrine alone. That's the way 

it's always been understood for 150 years. And to 

expand it this way is to undermine the rights of -- in 

the separate patents.

 And now I'll try to make the point I wanted 

to make to Justice Souter. Read the reply brief: A 

sale authorized by one patentee does not exhaust patents 

held by a different patentee. So we wouldn't even be in 

this case if it turned out that we didn't just -- we 

didn't happen to have all of these rights in the first 

place. I mean, if they bought the chips and if Wang had 

held on to some portion of the system patent in this 

case, there is no question that Wang would have the full 

opportunity -- that sale didn't exhaust their rights in 

that patent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the way you 

achieve that result is to condition the sale. What 

you're trying to do is expand what you get under a 

condition to what you get under a notice. And the 

reason that troubles me is because if you had imposed a 

condition on the sale, Intel wouldn't have paid you as

much for it. But you say, all right, we'll take the 

money because -- additional money because there's no 

condition, but we want to achieve the same result 

because of the notice.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean there can't -- there's 

no serious basis for doubting what Intel knew precisely 

what it was getting in this. It was getting peace on 

both sides of the aisle in terms of litigation, and it 

knew that there were separate patents here and that when 

it sold the chips it would certainly be entitled to 

assume that there would be exhaustion. That's the 

provision you read. But when it sells the chips, it 

didn't know and it specifically gave notice that it 

recognized that that doesn't remotely say what the right 

answer is with respect to the systems and with respect 

to the methods. And that to me, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

the fundamental distinction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're happy 

with that because the notice says you can't -- you can 

only use this with Intel products. So they're happy 

with that solution as well.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's part of the 

reason why it was negotiated in that way. But I mean 

that is -- so far as I know, there is no particular 

issue by reference to that particular limitation.

The reality is if we entered into the same 

agreement with AMD, which is one of the other 

chipmakers, I am sure they would ask for the same 

restriction on it: That you could only do it with AMD 

products, as well. I mean that doesn't have anything to 

do with the nature of the underlying problem that we are 

confronting in this particular context.

 It seems to me the fundamental issue here is 

they have a limited right when they purchase that 

product. They didn't get the right to make other 

products. They didn't get the right to breach or 

infringe a completely separate patent. And that is the 

basis on which the judgment of the Court of Appeals, 

which is all that is before the Court, should be 

affirmed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Before you sit down, to 

what extent do you think the Court of Appeals has 

already adopted your theory of the case?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean they recognized 

specifically that these are completely separate. That 

the claims that are at issue here are different from the 

amounts that were -- from the products that were, in 

fact, purchased. So the elements, the constituent 

elements, they have clearly embraced. The conclusion, 

they have clearly not embraced.

theory of the case out of my reading of their opinion.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, my --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the difference 

between "conditional sale" and "limited sale" -- you are 

saying they used the word "conditional." You are saying 

it was a "limited sale" that only -- a "limited 

license." It only licensed Patents A and B and not 

Patents C and D.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, what I was actually 

saying is that if you read the language in 4a and 5a 

where it says: The patents asserted by LGE do not cover 

the products licensed to, or sold by, Intel. They have 

to be combined with additional components. And then in 

5a they say: Notably, the sale involved a component of 

the inserted, patented invention, not the entire 

patented system.

 So they recognize, to my mind, what are the 

predicate factual bases from which I say the "exhaustion 

doctrine" shouldn't have been -- shouldn't have been 

triggered. But, to be sure, they -- they -- it was a 

much easier task for them because they -- as far as they 

are concerned, all kinds of conditions are permissible. 

And we don't need that in order to win this case. I'm 

not asking the Court to embrace that particular

 If there are no other questions, I would ask 

you to affirm the decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. MAHONEY: I'd like to start by 

emphasizing what counsel did not say. He never said 

that Intel lacked the authority under the system and 

method patents to sell these components. He never said 

that. In fact, he said that Intel was released. Why 

were they released? This would have been contributory 

infringement, otherwise.

 The reason they were released was because 

they had the authority under this license to sell these 

components under the system patent. And that's what the 

Federal Circuit acknowledged, and that's what the 

district court recognized, and it's never been in 

dispute.

 Their position is simply that, despite that, 

despite express authority to sell these under that 

patent -- not just under some other patent, under the 

patents at issue here -- that they can enforce

conditions on post-sale use. And that's what this Court 

has never allowed.

 Univis is on all fours. They say, well, 

that just involved a single patent. Well, as far as 

this case is concerned, it just involves a single 

patent, too. The whole issue here is whether or not 

Quanta's taking of the components and combining them 

with some generic things like wires and memory 

necessarily infringed under LGE's allegations.

 And the district court found that they 

would, and that's not in dispute. And what that means 

is that, just as in Univis where you had -- the court 

finds there were really two products there. It finds 

there were two different commodities, the lens blank and 

the finished lens.

 It says under Miller, the Miller/Tydings 

Act, these are two different commodities, and the patent 

was only on the finished lens. But, in order to make 

that finished lens, you had to -- you had to make a lens 

blank that would embody many of the limitations of the 

claim. That's exactly what the district court found 

happened here.

 For this, when Intel manufactured these 

chips, the microprocessors and the chipsets, it 

manufactured them in a way that embodied many of the

limitations of the system and method patents that are at 

issue here. So, as in the language of Univis, there 

they said, well, we are dealing with a product that is 

being manufactured in multiple stages.

 And during that first stage, while it's true 

it wasn't -- it didn't directly infringe because the 

lens blank wasn't the patented product, they, 

nevertheless, practiced the patent in part. Why? 

Because they -- they -- some of the -- while 

manufacturing it, they have met some of the limitations 

of the claim.

 And they said when that lens blank was sold, 

that it exhausted the rights of the patent owner to 

enforce any conditions, any type of conditions on use or 

resale after that sale. And it didn't have to rely on 

implied license because of the exhaustion doctrine. 

Once there is an authorized sale of a product that is 

protected by the patent that covered that final finished 

product, exhaustion is triggered.

 That's exactly what we have here. And they 

said, oh, but you could disclaim that with an agreement.

 Well, in Univis there was an agreement. The 

purchaser of that lens blank specifically agreed by 

contract that it would only use it in certain ways and 

only charge certain prices. So they expressly

disclaimed, you know, the idea that they were -- that 

they couldn't use it in those ways. And, nevertheless, 

this Court found exhaustion.

 When the district court found no "implied 

license," all the court was saying was, well, under the 

Federal Circuit precedent "implied license" is an 

"equitable doctrine."

 I see my time is finished. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 

Mahoney. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
