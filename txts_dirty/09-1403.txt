3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 09-1403, Erica P. John Fund 

v. Halliburton Company. 

6  Mr. Boies. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. BOIES: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court: 

11  The district court below found, and it is 

12 not disputed here, that the plaintiff fulfilled all of 

13 the requirements of Rule 23(a) for class certification. 

14 The district court also found, and the court of appeals 

affirmed, that the plaintiffs demonstrated all of the 

16 requirements for class certification under 23(b)(3) 

17 except for the Fifth Circuit's loss causation 

18 requirement. The court below recognized that whether or 

19 not there was an efficient market was not disputed. It 

was conceded that we have an efficient market here. 

21 There were no challenges -­

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

23 I just stop you there. 

24  MR. BOIES: Certainly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Boies, if could 

What if that had

1 been disputed? Is that something that can be disputed 

2 at the certification stage? 

3  MR. BOIES: Yes, Your Honor. 

4  The -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Boies, what's the 

6 difference then? Why could that be disputed at the 

7 certification stage, but not the question of price 

8 impact? 

9  MR. BOIES: Because the issue of efficient 

market goes to the presumption of reliance, and if the 

11 court holds at the certification stage that there is no 

12 efficient market, then the basis for presuming 

13 class-wide reliance is impacted. And so you can have a 

14 situation in which the common issues do not predominate 

over the individualized issues. That cannot happen with 

16 respect to loss causation because, as Respondent 

17 concedes here, loss causation is a common issue. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how about materiality? 

19 Could you rebut materiality at the certification stage?

 MR. BOIES: No, Your Honor, we don't think 

21 you can rebut materiality at the -- at the certification 

22 stage. I would note that under the Fifth Circuit rule, 

23 loss causation is in addition to materiality. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now I'm a little 

confused, because the efficient market and materiality 

4

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 are all part of the prima facie case triggering the 

2 Basic presumption. So, why couldn't you rebut one part 

3 of that case but not another part of that case? 

4  MR. BOIES: Because the issue of materiality 

is something that goes to a class-wide common issue. 

6 The issue of reliance can go to whether or not issues 

7 predominate or not. Rule 23(b)(3) talks about whether 

8 common issues predominate or not. That's the issue at 

9 class certification stage. The merits issue is not 

implicated at class certification -­

11  JUSTICE ALITO: But common reliance -­

12  MR. BOIES: -- under Rule 23 -­

13  JUSTICE ALITO: -- can be rebutted at the -­

14 common reliance can be rebutted at the certification 

stage? 

16  MR. BOIES: Excuse me, Your Honor? 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: The Basic presumption can be 

18 -- can the Basic presumption be rebutted at the 

19 certification stage?

 MR. BOIES: The Basic presumption of 

21 reliance, yes, Your Honor. For example, if you were to 

22 take a situation in which you -- not present here, but 

23 where you disputed whether or not the market was 

24 efficient or not, that is something that could be 

decided at the class certification stage.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Can it be rebutted by proof 

2 other than proof generally disproving the efficiency of 

3 the market? 

4  MR. BOIES: We believe under the Court's 

decision in Basic that that is something that is 

6 reserved for trial, that -- that rebuttal. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: And what is that based on, 

8 the footnote in Basic? 

9  MR. BOIES: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's pretty thin, 

11 isn't it? It's a -- it's dictum in a footnote in an 

12 opinion issued at a time when conditional class 

13 certification was permitted. Do you have anything else 

14 to support that?

 MR. BOIES: I don't from this Court, Your 

16 Honor. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you have anything in the 

18 rule to support that? 

19  MR. BOIES: Anything in the rule?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 

21  MR. BOIES: Well, I think the -- I think 

22 what the rule does is it talks about whether issues of 

23 common issue predominate over individualized issue. And 

24 since this is something that would be at the class 

certification stage, not creating individualized issues,

1 we would think that is something that's reserved for 

2 trial. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boies, how would it 

4 work in your view of the case? That is, you say that 

the loss, what's been called loss causation, is not 

6 something to be decided at the certification stage, but 

7 at the trial or summary judgment. Well, how -- how 

8 would the plaintiff class prove loss causation? Given 

9 the reliance hurdle that you have surmounted, now you're 

in -- you have your class certified; how does the class 

11 prove loss causation. 

12  MR. BOIES: As -- as this Court indicated in 

13 Dura, in order to prove loss causation, you must 

14 demonstrate that you had either an increase in the 

prices, and this -- this assumes that you are concealing 

16 negative information; the reverse would be true if you 

17 were concealing positive information -- an increase at 

18 the time that the concealment took place or a decline 

19 when the actual facts were revealed.

 And it would be required at summary judgment 

21 by a summary judgment standard, and at trial by a trial 

22 standard, and at the pleading stage by a pleading 

23 standard, for the plaintiff to make out that case. In 

24 other words, there are three times loss causation is 

tested: Pleadings, summary judgment, and trial. The

1 question is whether a fourth test should be interposed 

2 at the class certification stage. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, doesn't a lack 

4 of response to a disclosure -- couldn't it be in some 

situations reflective of an inefficient market? 

6  MR. BOIES: Yes, Your Honor, I think it 

7 could. I think that you -- you could very well have a 

8 situation in which if you demonstrated a lack of 

9 response, that could impact the issue of efficiency; and 

I think that would be an issue that-- that in a proper 

11 case where unlike this one it was presented -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is it? Why is this 

13 case -- why can't you pigeonhole this case into that 

14 argument, which, it appears what your -- what the 

Respondents have done is move away from the loss 

16 causation proof and gone to the issue of whether they 

17 rebutted reliance or not. 

18  MR. BOIES: The -- the problem is, as the 

19 Fifth Circuit noted at page 335 of the F.3d report, 

efficiency of this market was conceded below. In other 

21 words, the Respondents conceded that this market was 

22 efficient? So that issue -- that issue was not 

23 presented, and the rebuttal issue was not -- was not 

24 presented in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you

1 talked about loss causation. The Respondents assert 

2 that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing, 

3 that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the 

4 presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing 

that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was 

6 nothing that could justify the presumption. 

7  Would you be satisfied if we just said that 

8 we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss 

9 causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the 

Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the 

11 theory that Respondents assert they have already 

12 adopted? I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it 

13 seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss 

14 causation.

 MR. BOIES: Well, it depends on how the 

16 Fifth Circuit then construes reliance. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they -- they would 

18 construe it the way Respondents say they have already 

19 construed it.

 MR. BOIES: Your Honor, I think that if they 

21 simply changed the wording and called loss causation 

22 reliance, obviously it wouldn't make any difference. 

23 But as this Court indicated in Basic, and just last 

24 month in Matrixx, loss causation and reliance are two 

distinct elements. And the reason that's important in 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company

10

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 this particular context is that reliance can create a 

2 situation where you have individualized issues 

3 predominating over common issues. 

4  Loss causation can't because, as Respondents 

concede here, loss causation is a class-wide issue. 

6 Either -- there either is loss causation or is not loss 

7 causation. That, as this Court held in Dura, is an 

8 element of the merits case. It is one that we must 

9 prove at all three stages -- pleadings, summary 

judgment, and trial. But it is not something that goes 

11 to the Rule 23 standard. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you've said is 

13 that there's really no difference between loss causation 

14 and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit 

found. 

16  MR. BOIES: No, Your Honor. I did not mean 

17 to say that. I think that there is a difference. I 

18 think there's a -- I think there are -- there are two 

19 differences. There's a difference between what 

Respondents say and what the Fifth Circuit says. The 

21 Fifth Circuit talks about loss causation, says it's in 

22 addition to efficient market, does not talk about 

23 reliance. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. BOIES: There's also a difference

1 between what Respondents say and what this Court has 

2 said in Basic and Matrixx and the other cases, in terms 

3 of what is required to prove for class certification. 

4 What is required to prove for class certification under 

Rule 23, unless and until Rule 23 is changed, is that 

6 common issues predominate. Common issues will 

7 predominate even with respect to what the Respondents 

8 here argue because -- because what they argue, just like 

9 loss causation, is a common issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but -- but you -- you 

11 would want us to say that and not just say that loss 

12 causation -­

13  MR. BOIES: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. Yes, 

14 Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you see or what 

16 difference do you see between their loss causation 

17 evidence and an inefficient market? Could they -­

18 assuming there was no stipulation in this case, do you 

19 see any difference in -- in how they could use the fact 

that other information affected the market and not this 

21 one? Or is it your theory of the case that there is no 

22 evidence that they could marshal to show that this is an 

23 inefficient market? 

24  MR. BOIES: I don't believe under this 

Court's decision in Basic that, given the actual 

11

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 objective facts that have been admitted -- it's a very 

2 public market, very widespread distribution of 

3 information, a lot of analysts are reporting on it -- I 

4 don't believe that as a objective factual matter they 

would be able ever to demonstrate that this was not an 

6 efficient market. 

7  If you had a much smaller market, indeed if 

8 you -- if you had a market as the Court was considering 

9 in Basic, which was a much smaller market, much less 

public, much less analyst support, there may be areas in 

11 which they -- they could rebut it. But I think, given 

12 what we all know about the Halliburton stocks -- widely 

13 traded, large number of shares traded, a lot of 

14 analysts, a lot of public information -- I don't believe 

under this Court's decision in Basic you could conclude 

16 reasonably that that was not an efficient market. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say to -- to the 

18 following argument, that there are some economists who 

19 say that, even in a market that is generally efficient, 

there can be instances in which the market does not 

21 incorporate certain statements into the price of a 

22 stock; and therefore even when it is demonstrated that 

23 the market meets the test for efficiency that the lower 

24 courts have settled upon in the wake of Basic, the 

defendant in a -- in a class action where there is

1 reliance on the Basic presumption should be permitted at 

2 the class certification stage to prove that the 

3 allegedly fraudulent statements had no impact on price, 

4 and by doing that destroy the theory that the class 

relied on the statements, because they relied on the 

6 price which incorporated the statements? 

7  MR. BOIES: I -- I think, Your Honor, that 

8 if you have a situation in which the proof is 

9 class-wide, it is something that goes only to summary 

judgment or trial. It does not go to the class 

11 certification stage. With respect to the issue of 

12 whether somebody is relying on an efficient market, that 

13 is distinct from whether a particular statement was or 

14 was not actionable.

 In other words, the summary judgment issue, 

16 the trial issue, is whether the particular statement was 

17 actionable and that includes all of the things that the 

18 court identifies. But those issues are going to be, if 

19 there is an efficient market, class-wide issues. In 

other words, it's not going to be the case that in a 

21 particular instance a statement did not get into the 

22 market will affect only one member of the class. It's 

23 going to affect all members of the class. Because it is 

24 something that is common all of the class members, Rule 

23 says that is something for trial, not for class

1 certification. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, whether there's an 

3 efficient market is also common to all members of the 

4 class, so why would you make an exception for that?

 MR. BOIES: Because if there's no efficient 

6 market, then individualized issues are going to 

7 predominate. That is, the test under Rule 23 is whether 

8 individual issues or common issues are going to 

9 predominate. If you destroy the efficient market theory 

in a particular case, then individual issues of reliance 

11 can predominate. However, that can't happen with 

12 respect to loss causation or price distortion or any of 

13 these other issues that are fundamental to the merits 

14 and are common to the entire class, because if there's 

no loss causation, there's no cause of action. As this 

16 Court held in Dura, there must be loss causation. So if 

17 there's no loss causation there aren't any individual 

18 issues to adjudicate. 

19  If there are no more questions, I would save 

the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

14

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

2 please the Court: 

3  The Fifth Circuit erred in requiring proof 

4 of loss causation at class certification for three 

reasons: First, it's conducting a merits inquiry that's 

6 not tethered to the Rule 23 requirements; second, it's 

7 taking a presumption and requiring plaintiffs to prove 

8 it; and third, it's confusing the distinct elements of 

9 reliance and loss causation.

 Just to start in with some of the Court's 

11 questions: First, Justice Scalia's: Does the court 

12 require proof of loss causation? The Fifth Circuit 

13 could not be more clear. It is not talking about 

14 rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the 

defendants an opportunity to do that at class 

16 certification. It is putting an affirmative burden on 

17 plaintiffs that they have to meet in every single case, 

18 even if the defendants do not come to court with any 

19 evidence. And that is a very heavy burden, as the 

district court in this case realized. 

21  And just to make this as concrete as 

22 possible, loss causation is the question at the end of 

23 the day, whether the price decline that caused the 

24 losses was sufficiently related to the earlier alleged 

material misstatement and whether there was any other 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 cause that could have led to the price decline. 

2  So if a plaintiff cannot come in and prove 

3 loss causation, there could be many reasons for that. 

4 It may be because the market is not efficient. It could 

also be because there's no material misstatement. But 

6 it could also be, as this Court recognized in Dura, that 

7 there was a material misstatement, it did inflate the 

8 stock price, but then other causes such as a bad economy 

9 or other news about the company came along, and that's 

what caused the stock price to drop. Justice -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you acknowledged that 

12 if the cause was the fact that the market was not 

13 efficient, that could be raised at the certification 

14 stage.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that's certainly what 

16 the Court suggested in Basic and what the courts of 

17 appeals have done, is to say that that's a threshold 

18 showing that is sufficiently collateral to the merits 

19 that it needs to be made, so that the presumption can be 

invoked in the first instance. 

21  But these ideas about rebutting the 

22 presumption by showing that at the end of the day the 

23 plaintiff can't prove its case, these are things, as Mr. 

24 Boies said, that stand or fall on a class-wide basis. 

And the real problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 is that it did not tie its proof of loss causation to 

2 the requirements of Rule 23. Everyone agrees here that 

3 loss causation stands or falls on a class-wide basis. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The rule isn't, I take it 

-- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the 

6 issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged 

7 at the certification stage. We don't have a rule that's 

8 that broad, do we? Or am I missing a point? 

9  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that's what Rule 23, 

23(b)(3), which is the one at issue here -- the question 

11 is do common issues predominate over individual ones. 

12 What you're trying to answer is can this group of people 

13 proceed together, not can this group of people make out 

14 their case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose there's no 

16 demonstrated basis that that common issue exists? 

17  MS. SAHARSKY: Then I think the plaintiff 

18 should lose at the 12(b)(6) stage, and that is a stage 

19 that has real bite after this Court's decision in Dura 

and after the PSLRA. There are heightened pleading 

21 requirements that apply. There are plaintiffs that will 

22 lose at summary judgment on the issue of loss causation, 

23 for example, because, A, either they don't allege a 

24 price drop, B, they don't connect the price drop to the 

earlier distortion of the market when there's a material 

17

1 misstatement. 

2  There can be many reasons that they lose at 

3 that merits stage, but class certification is not a 

4 merits stage, and the Fifth Circuit made it one because 

of its own policy judgments about the effects of class 

6 certification. And with all due respect to the Fifth 

7 Circuit, it's just not that Court's judgment to make 

8 that -­

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Class certification 

is not a merits determination except with respect to 

11 reliance? Except with respect to the fraud on the 

12 market theory? That you can; that is a merits inquiry 

13 and you can decide it at the class certification stage? 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And except, just to add to 

the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market 

16 theory? 

17  MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. You're asking 

18 is this theory going to be available to the plaintiffs 

19 at trial, and the way that the plaintiffs show that the 

theory is available to them is by establishing an 

21 efficient market and saying that they traded within the 

22 time period while the price was distorted. It's just 

23 like establishing any other threshold inquiry that would 

24 make evidence or a legal theory available at trial.

 But the question the Court is supposed to be 

18

5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 asking at the 23, at the Rule 23 stage, the class 

2 certification stage, is not can these people win on the 

3 merits. And that's a question the Fifth Circuit was 

4 asking. The question it's supposed to ask is can this 

group of people proceed together. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: You seem to -- maybe I don't 

7 understand your argument, but you and Mr. Boies seem to 

8 be arguing that whether there is a common question -­

9 that it is a common question whether there is a common 

question, and therefore that has to wait until the 

11 merits stage. Is that what you're saying? 

12  MS. SAHARSKY: No, that's not what we're 

13 saying. What we're saying is when common issues 

14 predominate on the issue of reliance, and when the 

Petitioners -- or when the plaintiffs invoke fraud on 

16 the market and they show that there is an efficient 

17 market, this Court said in Basic, they can all proceed 

18 together because they are showing that the price -- that 

19 the material misstatement was reflected in the stock 

price. This is an impersonal market in which you rely 

21 on the stock price. They all rely on it in the same 

22 way. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: And if they show that the 

24 statement was not incorporated in the price, in the 

price, and they're not claiming that they relied, that

2 statement, they're all claiming they relied on the price 

3 - if they show that the statement wasn't incorporated in 

4 the price, then why doesn't reliance cease to be a 

common issue and become a question of an individual 

6 issue that would have to be proved by each, each member 

7 of the class? 

8  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, in that circumstance 

9 reliance ceases to be and the case cannot be established 

on the merits. They stand or fall together on the 

11 merits. Their theory is the same for all of them. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but the fact that they 

13 would lose on the merits doesn't necessarily mean that 

14 they are entitled to class certification.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. They're entitled to 

16 class certification if they have a common issue. And 

17 what the Court said in Basic is that if they set out the 

18 prerequisites for the fraud on the market, which the 

19 court of appeals agreed were met in this case, that they 

could proceed together. That threshold showing is 

21 required. 

22  Justice Kagan, I take your point that there 

23 is -- that even the question of whether the market is 

24 efficient is a common one, so perhaps one could 

logically say: Well, they have a common issue on the

1 efficiency of the market; why should they even have to 

2 show that at class certification? But this Court said 

3 in Basic, and the courts of appeals have said, it's 

4 reasonable in that case since it's so divorced from the 

merits to require a threshold showing to even allow them 

6 to invoke the presumption at the outset. 

7  But that is very, very different from what 

8 the Fifth Circuit said in this case. The Fifth Circuit 

9 in this case said basically: Prove your whole case. 

You don't just have to prove that there was a price 

11 decrease; you have to prove that there was an initial 

12 material misstatement, that it distorted the stock 

13 price, that it led to a price decrease and that the 

14 price decrease can't be, can't be shown by any other 

superseding cause. It's essentially, as the Seventh 

16 Circuit said -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you -- can you do this 

18 in reverse? I mean, suppose the class comes in and, 

19 instead of proving at the outset that the market's an 

efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they 

21 come in at the back end and they say: When that 

22 statement that we assert was a misrepresentation was 

23 corrected, the price of stock went down and we lost 

24 money.

1 well, that's a good allegation if it's an efficient 

2 market, which is a common question, right? 

3  MS. SAHARSKY: Right. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So they can certify under 

Rule 23 by using the back end. Instead of proving the 

6 efficient market, they can prove that there was a 

7 statement correcting the alleged misrepresentation, the 

8 price of stock went down, right, and they can certify 

9 the class?

 MS. SAHARSKY: No. The Court said -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? It would be -- it 

12 would be a common question whether the market's 

13 efficient or not. 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: This Court said in Basic that 

in order to establish the presumption that you need to 

16 show the efficiency of the market, the trading during 

17 the relevant time period. I agree with you that -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: They're not relying on that 

19 assumption. They -- they come in and show that there 

was a correction of what we alleged was a misstatement 

21 and the market went down. That's all that they allege. 

22 And of course, that proves anything only if there's an 

23 efficient market. But that will be a common question to

1  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, with respect, just 

2 alleging that the market went down would not be enough 

3 to show that there was an initial price distortion 

4 because of the company's material misstatement. Stock 

prices can go down for any number of reasons. There's a 

6 significant linkage that's required between the initial

the initial misstatement.

1 Basic for 20 years, Congress is well aware of it and has 

2 not seen fit to change it. This is the way that these 

3 cases proceed. 

4  This Court at the time of Basic recognized 

that every court of appeals had thought that it made 

6 sense to proceed in that way, using the fraud on the 

7 market theory. This is well established. And just to 

8 be clear, Respondents never suggested in this case that 

9 Basic should be revisited. This is not an issue that 

the courts below considered. This is not an issue that 

11 was fully briefed, and it's not something that we think 

12 should be considered. 

13  The problem in this case is that the Fifth 

14 Circuit took it upon itself to tighten the Rule 23 

requirements. It was not satisfied with the rules as 

16 they exist, and it took the class certification stage 

17 and turned it into a merits inquiry stage. They 

18 required plaintiffs to prove almost their entire case at 

19 this stage of the litigation, and that just wasn't 

right, because the class certification stage -- can I 

21 finish this -- is about whether plaintiffs can proceed 

22 as a group together, as the Court in Amchem said they 

23 often can in securities fraud actions. The judgment 

24 should be reversed.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID STERLING 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

4  MR. STERLING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

6  Basic recognized that, absent the class-wide 

7 presumption of fraud on the market reliance, individual 

8 issues of reliance predominate, as they do in any other 

9 fraud context. Consequently, when a district court, 

after the rigorous analysis required by Rule 23, finds 

11 that the presumption is unavailable or rebutted, 

12 reliance ceases to be a class-wide issue. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- when -- what 

14 in the Fifth Circuit's decision puts this inquiry into 

the reliance prong and where did you argue it this way 

16 below? 

17  MR. STERLING: We argued it below based upon 

18 the premise in Basic that the presumption is rebutted 

19 when there is proof -­

opposed to relying on Oscar to argue that the Fifth

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 Circuit was right in addressing as a merits question 

2 whether the plaintiff had proven loss causation? 

3  MR. STERLING: It was not addressed as a 

4 merits question, Justice Sotomayor. It was addressed, 

as Oscar said, as a prerequisite for finding reliance in 

6 order to certify the class. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're not defending 

8 the rationale of the Fifth Circuit now? You're -­

9 you're sort of backing yourself into the reliance 

element? 

11  MR. STERLING: We are not defending all of 

12 the language in Oscar, clearly, but the basic test in 

13 the Fifth Circuit, as our case made clear on pages 116a 

14 and 119a of the petition appendix, is not loss 

causation; it's price impact, because Basic says at page 

16 248 any showing that severs the link between the 

17 misrepresentation and the stock price defeats the 

18 presumption. Basic makes clear on that same page that a 

19 showing that the stock price was not distorted by the 

misrepresentation defeats the presumption. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Sterling, if I 

22 think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar 

23 said that loss causation needs to be shown at the 

24 certification stage, you agree that that is not a 

correct statement of the law; is that correct? 

26

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  MR. STERLING: We do agree with that, 

2 Justice Kagan. But our opinion made clear that it's not 

3 loss causation as this Court knows it in Dura; the test 

4 is simply price impact. And the Fifth Circuit 

recognized -- and the Fund recognized this below on page 

6 551a of the Joint Appendix -- their only burden under 

7 the Fifth Circuit caselaw was to show price impact, and 

8 they could show it either of two ways. Their papers 

9 show this, page 116 and 119a of the joint appendix.

 They can show price inflation upon a 

11 misrepresentation, which, as this Court made clear in 

12 Dura, is not synonymous with loss causation. Or failing 

13 that -- and they could not show that here because their 

14 own proof showed that none of the alleged 

misrepresentations moved the market. So, the 

16 alternative way to show price impact is simply to show a 

17 price decline following a corrective disclosure. 

18  And while that showing is similar to loss 

19 causation, it's an easier, less rigorous showing of loss 

causation, because under the price impact test at the 

21 Fifth Circuit, all the plaintiff need show is that it's 

22 reasonable to infer that some portion of the decline was 

23 attributable to the revelation of the truth. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure 

what argument you were making in your brief. One 

27

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 possible argument you could be making is that the 

2 plaintiffs have to show a price impact. Another 

3 possible argument you could be making is that you have 

4 to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of 

the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was 

6 no price impact. And you seemed often to be saying the 

7 first, even though I would think that the second is the 

8 most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument. 

9  MR. STERLING: If we suggested the first, 

Justice Kagan, I apologize because we did not intend to. 

11 Basic puts the initial burden on the defendant to show 

12 the absence of price impact, showing that the presumed 

13 fact does not exist. 

14  Once that threshold showing is made, the 

burden remains on the plaintiff under Rule 301 and Rule 

16 23 to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the 

17 market price was in fact, distorted. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but why do you -­

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The way the Fifth Circuit 

wrote the decision, the Fifth Circuit seems to be 

21 saying: Plaintiffs, you didn't show an initially false 

22 representation; and you, you plaintiff, didn't show a -­

23 a corrective statement that caused a price drop. As I 

24 read the Fifth Circuit's decision, it says: Plaintiff, 

you failed to prove one of the two things that you would

1 have to prove. 

2  And you say: No, they really put the burden 

3 on -- on defendants, Fifth Circuit put the burden on 

4 defendant and found that defendant had met it instead of 

the other way around? 

6  MR. STERLING: We agree, Your Honor, that 

7 the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden of production 

8 on the plaintiff and that's contrary to Basic. We -- we 

9 agree with that. However, in terms of the Fifth 

Circuit's language that I believe Your Honor's referring 

11 to, that is when the Fifth Circuit was discussing the 

12 alleged corrective disclosures. 

13  Because the plaintiff could not show that 

14 any of the alleged misrepresentations moved the market, 

they had to rely upon what they claimed were corrective 

16 disclosures. That was the only way they could show 

17 price impact. 

18  The Fifth Circuit, at various times, looked 

19 at each of the alleged corrective disclosures and said 

that's not a corrective disclosure because it doesn't 

21 reveal the truth in any way; it's bad news, but it's 

22 non-culpable bad news. It doesn't in any way suggest 

23 that Halliburton said something during the class period 

24 that was false.

1 question out. Try to give me your best answer. If I 

2 don't have it clear enough, just forgive it and go on to 

3 another. As I'm understanding this case with Basic, the 

4 idea is there is a presumption. Somebody lies and says 

there's an oil well I found oil in. A lot of people buy 

6 on the stock market. It turns out there was no oil, and 

7 a lot of people say they lost money. All right. 

8  The point of the stock market presumption is 

9 to say: Smith, you're a typical plaintiff and this 

presumption is going to help you by the following. 

11 We're going to say what happened to the typical person 

12 on the stock market during that period happened to you, 

13 and there are a lot of people who bought and sold on the 

14 stork market. And that's why efficient markets is 

needed to show at the certification stage, because if 

16 there weren't certification -- if that isn't shown, the 

17 whole thing falls apart. 

18  But what you're just saying on terms of 

19 whether the revelation lowered the price has nothing to 

do with the question of what happened to the typical 

21 person, Smith, happened to you, nothing to do with it. 

22 It has to do with whether anybody was hurt. Now, that 

23 has nothing to do with the certification stage. That's 

24 the win or lose stage.

 Now, that's how I'm understanding it at the

1 moment. So what's wrong with the way I understand it? 

2  MR. STERLING: Justice Breyer, the -- the 

3 problem is, we're back to reliance. Basic exists -­

4 Basic creates a presumption as an exception to the long 

understood rule that fraud cases were not appropriate 

6 vehicles for class actions because each individual would 

7 have to say, Mr. Smith in your hypothetical, I read 

8 Halliburton's statement and I relied upon it. 

9  Basic said, because that's so impractical 

cases would never be certified, we're going to say we're 

11 going to assume the entire market is like Mr. Smith, and 

12 Mr. Smith relies on the integrity of the stock price 

13 when the stock price is distorted by the 

14 misrepresentation. But if the stock price was not in 

fact distorted by the misrepresentation, it makes no 

16 sense to say everybody relied on the misrepresentation 

17 through its effect on the stock price. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Which means you would lose. 

19 I -- I mean, which means that the plaintiff would lose. 

But it doesn't mean that there is not a common issue, 

21 that the -- that the latter question, whether in fact 

22 the market was affected or not is, is not a common 

23 question. Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a 

24 common question.

 MR. STERLING: But Justice Scalia, Basic 

31

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 sets forth a special rule. Basic is an exception to the 

2 long-understood rule about the nonsusceptibility in 

3 class actions to class treatment of fraud cases. Basic 

4 says it's not just enough to allege the operative facts, 

and we will presume reliance. Basic says you have to 

6 plead and prove them, and all of those operative facts 

7 are subject to common proof. The efficient market: the 

8 efficient market applies to everybody, it's common 

9 proof. Everybody recognizes, everybody agrees, Mr. 

Boies said so today, and the government said so today: 

11 if the market -- if the district court does not find 

12 that the market -- that the market for the stock is 

13 efficient at the class certification stage, you can't 

14 certify, because it's not reasonable to infer then that 

the misrepresentation was translated into the stock 

16 price. 

17  Materiality is another requirement under 

18 Basic. It's a threshold condition. Again, common 

19 proof. All the courts except for the Seventh Circuit 

agree materiality must be proven at the class 

21 certification level. Same thing for whether the 

22 misrepresentation was public. If it was not publicly 

23 made, it's not reasonable to infer that it had an impact 

24 on the stock price.

 All of these operative facts are subject to 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 common proof. But Basic says unless those facts are 

2 proven at the class certification stage, the presumption 

3 of class-wide reliance doesn't apply and individual 

4 issues of reliance predominate.

 The same must be true for rebuttal proof. 

6 Basic says eight times that the presumption is 

7 rebuttable, and it makes no sense at all to rely upon 

8 these indirect or surrogate, circumstantial proof of 

9 whether the misrepresentation moved the market. That's 

all these are -- materiality, whether it was publicly 

11 made, whether the market was efficient. These are all 

12 just surrogates of whether it is reasonable to believe 

13 or to infer that the stock price was in fact distorted 

14 by the misrepresentation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, could you explain 

16 to me why in this case it's not reasonable to believe, 

17 meaning assuming the truth, that there was falsity in 

18 the statements made, those alleged -­

19  MR. STERLING: Because -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming truth to those 

21 statements, why wouldn't a market react to corrective 

22 measures? Because what I see is a difference between 

23 saying it's an inefficient market or that the statements 

24 had no price impact for some other merits-related 

reason. But why does that tie to an inefficient market

1 at all? 

2  MR. STERLING: Well, again, general market 

3 efficiency is just a proxy or a surrogate for whether 

4 it's reasonable to think the conditions exist for the 

stock price to be affected by a misrepresentation. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me why on its 

7 face, with the false statements alleged here, why would 

8 it be unreasonable to conclude that the market wouldn't 

9 respond to them?

 MR. STERLING: One reason is because the 

11 market deemed the information to be immaterial, the 

12 market didn't care about it, the market didn't react to 

13 it. Another reason could be that, while a market is 

14 generally efficient, a market was inefficient for this 

type of information. I -­

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but you conceded 

17 efficiency below, so you've sort of given up that 

18 argument. 

19  MR. STERLING: We conceded efficiency below 

because, candidly, their own proof showed that none of 

21 the misrepresentations moved the market. And what we 

22 have here is not circumstantial proof of general market 

23 efficiency or materiality or whether the statement was 

24 public; here there was direct proof that none of these 

misrepresentations moved the market, and that is the

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 whole premise of the Basic class-wide presumption of 

2 reliance. 

3  Basic itself says if the stock price was not 

4 distorted by the misrepresentation, you can't say the 

entire class relied upon the misrepresentation to the 

6 stock price. And that's exactly what we have here. It 

7 is the DNA proof, and it makes no sense for district 

8 courts to be certifying class actions based upon this 

9 indirect or circumstantial proof while ignoring the 

direct proof of the absence of price impact. 

11  And in effect what they're asking this Court 

12 to do is to extend Basic. Basic itself is a judicially 

13 created presumption designed to make a judicially 

14 created cause of action easier to be maintained as a 

class action. 

16  Now, it was one thing for courts decades ago 

17 to imply a private cause of action under 10(b) and it 

18 was another thing for this Court to create a rebuttable 

19 presumption of reliance in Basic in order to make it 

easier to maintain these cases as class actions. But it 

21 would do violence to Stoneridge's admonition that the 

22 10b cause of action ought not be further expanded to 

23 make that rebuttable presumption of reliance 

24 irrebuttable at the class certification stage.

1 seems to say, to -- to get a class certified you have to 

2 virtually prove your case on the merits. You -- you 

3 leave almost nothing over. I mean, if you've won the 

4 class action certification on your basis and you've 

shown the material misleading and the price dropped as a 

6 consequence, the efficient market first -- you've shown 

7 all that, what else is left on the merits? You win on 

8 the merits if you win certification. 

9  MR. STERLING: Justice Ginsburg, that -­

that is not our position. Our position is in order to 

11 get the class-wide presumption of reliance, it's the 

12 plaintiff's burden to plead and prove upfront as 

13 threshold facts, a public misrepresentation that was 

14 material made in an efficient market. However, the 

defendant has the right at the class certification stage 

16 to rebut that presumption by any showing, to quote 

17 Basic, "that severs the length between the 

18 misrepresentation and the stock price." When that 

19 threshold showing is made, the burden is back on the 

plaintiff to demonstrate the necessary linkage. 

21  It's not a finding on the merits. A 

22 determination at the class certification stage is simply 

23 one of whether the Rule 23(b) predominance requirement 

24 is met and whether the class can appropriately proceed 

as a class, as opposed to in the traditional individual

1 fashion, and that finding is not binding on the ultimate 

2 finder of fact. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Sterling, maybe this is 

4 just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what 

else is there? I mean, what would not be proper to 

6 introduce in the way that you're talking about at the 

7 certification stage? 

8  MR. STERLING: Falsity, scienter, actual 

9 proof of loss causation, and damages.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: The Fifth Circuit suggested 

11 that scienter could come in at the -- at the 

12 certification stage. You're disclaiming that? 

13  MR. STERLING: Footnote 35 of the Fifth 

14 Circuit opinion makes clear that it is not requiring 

scienter. The Fifth Circuit says, in response -- in 

16 analyzing what is or is not a corrective disclosure, it 

17 says it has to do something that suggests that a 

18 statement was made that is potentially actionable was 

19 false. Otherwise it's not a revelation of the truth. 

And all that is, again, is a second way under the Fifth 

21 Circuit's test of showing whether there is the necessary 

22 price impact to justify certifying a class, or 

23 alternatively to determine that individual issues of 

24 reliance predominate.

1 presumption of reliance at the class certification stage 

2 is consistent with this Court's class action case law 

3 and with Rule 23. This Court has consistently said that 

4 the Rule 23 requirements are not to be presumed, they're 

not to be assumed, they have to be found. Actual 

6 conformance is the test. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The only requirement 

8 we're talking about is (b)(3) because it's -- it's not 

9 argued and the district court found that all of the 

23(a) requirements were satisfied. That's not the 

11 particular -­

12  MR. STERLING: Correct Your Honor. But 

13 23(b)(3) requires a court to make a finding that 

14 predominance exists. And the 2003 amendments to the -­

to Rule 23 make clear that a court should not certify a 

16 class unless and until it is satisfied that all of the 

17 Rule 23 requirements are met; and it makes no sense to 

18 say that a court is going to conduct this rigorous 

19 analysis and make the Rule 23(b)(3) findings without 

considering the defendant's rebuttal proof of whether, 

21 in fact, there was price impact, because Basic itself 

22 says if there is no price impact, the presumption falls 

23 away, individual issues of reliance predominate, and the 

24 class cannot be certified.

1 point, you said just now that all you had to do was come 

2 forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains 

3 on the plaintiff. Is that -- what kind of evidence do 

4 you think you have to come forward with in order to flip 

the burden back to the plaintiff? 

6  MR. STERLING: Well, under Basic, it's any 

7 showing that severs the link, and here it was proof -­

8 we had our own expert that demonstrated that, again kind 

9 of harping on their expert -- none of the 

misrepresentations inflated the stock price -­

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: So you're saying you can put 

12 an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was 

13 no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make 

14 the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at 

the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to 

16 prove that by a preponderance? 

17  MR. STERLING: Correct, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Once you put a expert on the 

19 -- on the stand.

 MR. STERLING: Under Rule 301, the 

21 presumption does not shift the ultimate burden of proof. 

22 It stays on the party that -- that bears it. That is 

23 consistent with Rule 23 as well, which puts the burden 

24 on the plaintiff, to prove all of the Rule 23 elements 

exist.

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that does suggest that 

2 the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world. 

3 That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic 

4 presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to 

actually prove their case at that very early stage that 

6 there was no price impact. 

7  MR. STERLING: We agree, Your Honor, that 

8 they have to show price impact, but that's not a hard 

9 burden to show. If any of their 22 -- they allege that 

we made misrepresentations that were false on 22 days 

11 during the class period. All they had to do was show 

12 one day during that class period statistically 

13 significant price movement, and they're in. Or all they 

14 had to show was any of the alleged -- I've forgotten how 

many -- corrective disclosures during the class period. 

16 Any one day, if there was a -- a meaningful price 

17 movement that a court could infer was related to the 

18 revelation of truth, that's all they need to show. But 

19 they couldn't show that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I suppose 

21 if you prevail and a defendant tries to establish at the 

22 certification stage that there's no loss causation and 

23 loses, then that's law of the case and you've missed the 

24 three opportunities that Mr. Boies was willing to give 

you at the pleading stage, summary judgment, and the

1 merits. That issue is out of the case if you lose, 

2 right? 

3  MR. STERLING: No, Your Honor, because the 

4 finding at the class certification stage is not binding 

upon the ultimate fact finder. So if the -- if the 

6 Court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that 

7 reliance is not there, if the Court -- if the case goes 

8 to trial and an individual plaintiff brings his or her 

9 own case based upon subjective reliance, that the 

Court's determination that the class certification stage 

11 is not binding on the jury. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there's 

13 no -- no new evidence? One of the objections to your 

14 theory is you don't have discovery at the certification 

stage. What if you have no new evidence to put on at 

16 later stages? 

17  MR. STERLING: It's possible that the jury 

18 would agree with the judge who made the determination at 

19 the class certification hearing, it's possible that the 

judge -- that the jury might not. But the discovery 

21 issue, Your Honor, is a complete red herring, because 

22 Rule 23 makes clear that the district court has ample 

23 discretion at the class certification stage to allow 

24 discovery into the merits to the extent that they are 

relevant to the class certification issue.

1  And more importantly here, the Fund never 

2 asked for discovery. In fact, when the Fund filed its 

3 motion for class certification on page 139A of the joint 

4 appendix, the Fund said no discovery is needed to 

resolve this motion except for expert discovery. The 

6 Fund never asked for discovery at the district court 

7 level, the Fund never asked for discovery at the Fifth 

8 Circuit. The only time they've ever hinted that they 

9 wanted discovery related to the class certification 

issue was at this Court. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the whole 

12 reason you -- you say that the class certification stage 

13 is so significant is precisely because once the class is 

14 certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits 

of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants 

16 that they're inclined to throw in the towel. Now you're 

17 telling us that you -- you want to move discovery up to 

18 the class certification stage? 

19  MR. STERLING: Justice Scalia, that was not 

my point, and I apologize if -- if it came out that way.

22 wasn't your point, but -­

1 know, Your Honor, to the district court, we think we -­

2 we can't -- we should not have the class certification 

3 hearing yet because we need some discovery on point A, 

4 B, C, which did not happen here, the district court can 

say fine or can say I don't think you need it. But the 

6 premise of your question is certainly correct. The 

7 grant of class certification is a seminal event in a 

8 10b-5 case. It has huge repercussions for the 

9 defendant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. You -­

11 on page 13 of your brief you say one of the objections 

12 to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that 

13 it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut 

14 the presumption, result in countless classes being 

certified with the certain knowledge that they would 

16 have to be decertified later. Well, if it's so certain, 

17 then there's no in terrorem effect. 

18  MR. STERLING: Just when -- that's assuming 

19 that the defendant has the wherewithal to stick it out 

through it all, but the sheer grant of class 

21 certification which aggregates hundreds, tens, 

22 thousands -- tens of thousands of these claims together 

23 in one big case makes every one of these cases, in 

24 effect, a company case, and it puts huge settlement 

pressure on the defendant.

1  I mean, in -- in this case Halliburton had 

2 440 million shares of stock outstanding during the class 

3 period. The class period lasts 2 1/2 years. It's easy 

4 to do the math and say that had this class been 

certified, there would have been huge pressure upon 

6 Halliburton to settle. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Does your rule apply in all 

8 fraud cases? That is, a thousand farmers say, 

9 Mr. Jackson was our common buying agent, and the 

defendant lied to Mr. Jackson, and he relied on the lie. 

11 It is a common issue whether he relied on the lie or he 

12 didn't rely on the lie. I can understand somebody 

13 saying at the certification stage they have to see 

14 whether he's really a common agent. But let's imagine 

that's assumed. The only question left is, did he rely 

16 or not rely?

7  JUSTICE BREYER: No. A thousand people say

represented us. Relied on that. I'm asking if you that

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

7  MR. BOIES: Thank you, Your Honor. Thank 

8 you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

9  Let me respond to Mr. Sterling's statement 

that all we had to do was show one statistically 

11 significant price movement. As the Court is aware from 

12 the briefing, on December 7th of 2001, the Halliburton 

13 put out a release that indicated that their prior 

14 statements that their asbestos reserves were -- were 

adequate were not -- were not true. The stock dropped 

16 42 percent, more than 42 percent. The actual drop was 

17 42.4. 

18  Expert witnesses calculated that the 

19 company's specific drop was slightly larger than that 

because the market was generally going up that day. But 

21 it was a dramatic drop. 

22  Their own expert, as is indicated in the 

23 briefing, agreed that there wasn't anything else 

24 happening that day other than asbestos news, and so -­

1 win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage, 

2 whatever. So why is it such I big deal to you here? 

3  MR. BOIES: Because under the -- the Fifth 

4 Circuit rule, I understand that counsel disavows the 

actual language of the Fifth Circuit rule, but it was 

6 that language that the district court relied on in 

7 failing to certify the class. And with -- with -- with 

8 respect to the Fifth Circuit test, what the Fifth 

9 Circuit says is that because the announcement on 

December 7th did not specifically reference the prior 

11 announcements, it cannot be considered a correction of 

12 those prior announcements. 

13  Indeed, the court, the Fifth Circuit goes 

14 even further, and this is at page 338 of the F. Supp. 

opinion. It says, quote: The district court must 

16 decide whether the corrective disclosure more probably 

17 than not shows that the original estimates or 

18 predictions were designed to defraud. 

19  So what the Fifth Circuit is doing is it's 

bringing, even the defrauding aspect, not just the 

21 falsity aspect, but the defrauding aspect right into the 

22 class certification stage. 

23  And I think Justice Scalia's question was 

24 exactly on point with respect to discovery, because 

either they're going to make these merits decisions

1 without discovery or you're going to have all of the 

2 discovery before you have the class certification. It's 

3 got to be one or the other. And in either case what is 

4 happening is you're converting what Rule 23 says is an 

issue as to whether common issues predominate into an 

6 issue as to what is the strength of the merits claim 

7 that the plaintiff has, and while it is true, reliance 

8 is part of the merits claim. 

9  The reason reliance is different is because 

reliance, if it -- if there is no reliance, if there's 

11 no efficient market, then reliance can make individual 

12 issues predominate, but when the only issue is not a 

13 step issue like efficient market, but is a direct merits 

14 issue, there isn't any way that you can make individual 

issues predominate regardless of how you decide it; and 

16 loss causation and price distortion are both those kind 

17 of common issues; and counsel says he doesn't defend 

18 the -- the actual loss causation statements of the -- of 

19 the -- of the Fifth Circuit, and what I would ask is 

whether the Court, if the Court does decide to send it 

21 back, that the Court look at what the right standard is 

22 for the court below to be applying when it deals with 

23 class certification. 

24  And I would urge the Court that when you 

have pleadings, summary judgment, and trial tests for

1 merits questions, then you don't need another merits 

2 test on -- at the class certification stage, even if 

3 Rule 23 permitted it, which we don't think it does. 

4 What Rule 23 is designed to do is simply say are 

individual issues or common issues going to predominate? 

6 And all of the class have the same loss causation, have 

7 the same price distortion issues. 

8  If the Court has no more questions, that 

9 completes my argument.

11 counsel. The case is submitted.
