 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first today in Case 07-10441, Corley v. United 

States.

 Mr. McColgin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. McCOLGIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. McCOLGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 FBI agents delayed presenting Mr. Corley to 

a Federal magistrate judge in order to obtain his two 

confessions. The admissibility of these two confessions 

depends on an issue of statutory interpretation: The 

interpretation of 3501(c), together with the 

McNabb-Mallory rule and the right of prompt presentment.

 Now, there's two critical issues I would 

like to address. The first is that 3501(c) as it's 

written by Congress leaves the McNabb-Mallory rule in 

place outside the six-hour time limitation. And the 

second is that the Government's interpretation, under 

which 3501(c) is merely a voluntariness safe harbor, is 

unfaithful to the text and the structure of the statute.

 Turning to the first point, subsection (c) 

modifies McNabb-Mallory, but does not eliminate it. The

exact text of the statute here is crucial. And for the 

Court's convenience, on page 7 of the yellow brief the 

operative language of the text of the statute is set 

out.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we -- before we 

get to the statute, McNabb-Mallory are exercises of this 

Court's supervisory authority over the lower courts?

 MR. McCOLGIN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they were both 

pre-Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of 

his right to remain silent. Whatever Congress put in 

1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, McNabb-Mallory 

are no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.

 MR. McCOLGIN: This Court could, but for 

several prudential reasons this Court should not, 

overturn McNabb and Mallory and should not find them to 

be no longer valid considerations. First of all -- or 

no longer valid precedents.

 First of all, the Solicitor General's Office 

has not asked that McNabb and Mallory be overturned.

 Second of all, the parties have not briefed 

that issue. It has been briefed instead as a statutory 

interpretation issue.

 Thirdly, Congress through 3501(c) structured 

the statute on the existing precedent of McNabb and

Mallory, and at this point for the Court to pull McNabb 

and Mallory out from underneath that structure would 

cause that structure to basically collapse. It depends, 

the six-hour time limitation, depends on the existence 

of McNabb-Mallory outside that six-hour time period.

 Congress can revisit this issue at any time. 

Their hands are not tied. Congress could choose to 

change 3501(c) so that it no longer provides for McNabb-

Mallory outside the six-hour time period. But that's a 

decision for Congress and this Court, I would suggest 

respectfully, should respect the prerogatives and the 

policy choice that Congress has already made.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you arguing that the 

language in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory 

rule?

 MR. McCOLGIN: I am arguing that the exact 

language, whether it is "codification" or "leaves 

intact," doesn't matter. What it does is --

JUSTICE ALITO: There is a very big 

difference, isn't there, between saying we are codifying 

this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and 

saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was 

adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we are 

creating an exception to it? Which of those two things 

does subsection (c) do?

MR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, it does the 

latter. It leaves McNabb-Mallory in place. However, 

the language of the statute uses the phrase "time 

limitation" in the proviso. "Time limitation" implies 

more than we're just not just touching McNabb-Mallory 

for the time being. It depends -- the statute depends 

on McNabb-Mallory to create the time limitation, because 

without McNabb-Mallory there is no limitation. After 

the six hours nothing else happens unless McNabb-Mallory 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would be 

consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say 

that there's a six-hour safe harbor, whatever term you 

want to call it, and beyond six hours the Court is free 

to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what 

Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Well, but again, the language 

of the statute is "time limitation." That's strong 

language for Congress to use and it indicates that 

Congress intended to limit the taking of confessions to 

those first six hours. There is no limitation without 

McNabb-Mallory in effect.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is a little bit odd to 

say that Congress has built a statute around a 

supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this

Court to reexamine the supervisory rule.

 MR. McCOLGIN: I am not actually saying that 

Congress has taken away the authority of the Court. I 

am saying as a prudential manner, since Congress can 

address this on its own and since it structured the 

statute on the foundation of McNabb-Mallory, it would be 

best for this Court to leave up to Congress that policy 

choice.

 Congress chose in 1968 to leave of 

McNabb-Mallory protection against presentment delay in 

place after six hours. It was a compromise, and it was 

the appropriate compromise, because what it did was it 

cut out the first six hours during which there had been 

the most problems with the application of 

McNabb-Mallory. The six-hour time limitation 

effectively lowers the social cost of this rule of this 

rule of inadmissibility while maintaining the deterrent 

effect of McNabb-Mallory outside the six hours.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you were trying to 

get to page 7 of your yellow brief?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. On page 7 I 

set out the operative language of the statute. And what 

the statute actually provides is that a confession shall 

not be inadmissible solely because of delay if such 

confession is found by the trial judge to have been made

voluntarily and made within six hours of arrest. Now, 

the phrase "inadmissible solely because of delay" is 

clearly a reference to the McNabb-Mallory rule because 

that is exactly what McNabb-Mallory does. It renders 

the confession inadmissible solely because of delay if 

the delay in presentment was unreasonable.

 So what the statute is providing on its face 

is that a confession shall not be subject to the 

McNabb-Mallory rule if it is voluntarily given and made 

within six hours. The six-hour provision means that 

McNabb-Mallory is in effect outside of the six hours.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or it may just mean 

that the confessions beyond six hours may be excluded 

solely because of delay. In other words, if the judge 

says, look, I don't want to hear about all this other 

stuff, it's just too long, he can't do that beyond the 

six hours, but he can within the six hours.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Within the six hours he 

cannot exclude solely because of delay, even a voluntary 

statement. That is the McNabb-Mallory principle, 

inadmissible solely because of delay. So what it's 

saying is that McNabb-Mallory does not apply within the 

six hours.

 Now the government's interpretation is that 

this is simply a voluntariness safe harbor, and what

they do is they read the word "inadmissible" as being 

synonymous with the word "involuntary." But the text of 

the statute shows that those two terms are not 

synonymous, because the text of the statute says that in 

order for a confession to be admissible it must be 

voluntary and made within six hours.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they have that textual 

problem, but you have at least an equally big textual 

problem, because you want to read the first sentence of 

subsection (a) completely out of the statute based on 

some supposition about what Congress was intending to 

do. So really, if you live by the text you die by the 

text. I don't see how you are going to succeed with a 

subsection (c) textual analysis if you're going to 

disregard the text of subsection (a).

 MR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, we don't 

disregard the text of subsection (a). Instead, we just 

apply the principle that a general provision, if it 

conflicts with a specific provision, the specific 

controls over the general. What we have in subsection 

(a) is a general statement that voluntary statements are 

admissible. But if we read that the way the government 

does, as making admissible every voluntary statement, 

then that would make subsection (c) completely 

superfluous.

JUSTICE ALITO: And if you read subsection 

(c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean 

something quite different from what it says literally.

 MR. McCOLGIN: No, it simply establishes an 

exception in the area of delay. This is the way 

statutes work. When there is a conflict between a 

general provision and a specific one, the specific must 

control over the general. If it worked the other way 

around, it would render the specific superfluous. So 

this has happened in statutes in numerous case. In 1983 

versus 2254, it was held that 2254 as a specific 

provision controls over 1983. So this is an accepted 

principle of statutory interpretation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What you're -- you are not 

arguing that there is a specific provision that controls 

a general provision. You are arguing that an arguable 

negative inference from an arguably more specific 

provision reads new language into the text of a specific 

provision. That's what you are arguing, isn't it?

 MR. McCOLGIN: With respect, no, Your Honor. 

We are not making the negative inference argument that 

the government suggests we are making in the first part 

of their brief. Instead, we are making the argument 

that subsection (c) was constructed on the existing 

precedent of McNabb and Mallory, which already

established a rule of inadmissibility. Subsection (c) 

then just carves out the first six hours from that. So 

it's not creating a rule of inadmissibility by negative 

inference. Rather it's just recognizing that a rule of 

inadmissibility already exists in the case law and the 

purpose of this statute was to simply carve out from the 

first six hours the McNabb-Mallory rule.

 The government --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't you argue that 

what happens when you are not within the safe harbor is 

simply that the time period cannot alone govern, all 

right, but it can still be part of the list of things 

that can be taken into account in determining 

voluntariness under (b). Why doesn't that reconcile the 

two provisions?

 MR. McCOLGIN: That, again, is the 

government's interpretation. But it requires a 

rewriting. It requires reading "inadmissible" as 

"involuntary" to interpret all of subsection(c) as a 

voluntariness safe harbor. But Congress used the word 

inadmissible deliberately. That's a reference to the 

McNabb-Mallory rule. McNabb-Mallory did not render 

confessions voluntary or involuntary based on delay. It 

rendered them inadmissible. So that language is 

crucial. This cannot be read as a voluntariness safe

harbor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But admissibility is 

defined in 3501 itself. (A) says that it shall be 

admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given; and 

(b) says what factors will be taken into account in 

determining whether it's voluntarily given.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. And (c) 

makes clear that, at least for purposes of subsection 

(c), voluntariness is not enough for admissibility, 

because it says on its face that in order --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that. It is 

not alone enough.

 MR. McCOLGIN: So the two terms --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So if you are outside of 

that safe harbor you cannot rely upon the time alone. 

But why can't you rely on the time plus the other 

factors?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, because the 

effect is again to allow for a confession to be 

inadmissible solely based on delay if it's outside of 

the six hours.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not being admissible 

solely on the basis -- I'm sorry. Delay is not the only 

factor being considered in making the inadmissibility 

call. Delay is one of the things; whereas, within the

safe harbor delay can't be taken into account at all.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Well, what the Congress said 

was that delay alone cannot be a basis for 

inadmissibility within six hours.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. McCOLGIN: That leaves in place 

McNabb-Mallory, under which delay alone is a basis for 

inadmissibility.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It -- it leaves it in 

effect only if you ignore (a) and (b). (A) says that 

it's admissible if it's voluntary --

MR. McCOLGIN: But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and (b) says it's 

voluntary if you take into account the five factors, one 

of which is the period of time before arraignment.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, that depends. 

The premise of that depends on the argument that 

"inadmissibility" is synonymous with "involuntariness" 

for purposes of subsection (c), and "admissibility" is 

synonymous with "voluntariness," but they are not 

synonymous as used in subsection (c).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are synonymous as 

used in (a).

 MR. McCOLGIN: Well, subsection -- as used 

in subsection --

JUSTICE SCALIA: (A) says that if it's --

it's admissible if it's voluntary.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. However, as 

used in subsection (c), that should control, because the 

word "inadmissibility" is being used in that very same 

sentence. Since the very same sentence makes clear that 

voluntariness is not enough for admissibility, it's 

clear that those two terms are not synonymous.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it your position 

that the McNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than 

to ensure the voluntariness of the statement?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, it protects --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's what you're 

trying to reach here?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. It protects 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if that's true, then 

why is it that we would suppress the confession if it's 

completely voluntary? I mean, what's the link between 

some other end that's being served by McNabb-Mallory --

MR. McCOLGIN: It's protecting --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- something other than 

voluntariness and suppressing the confession?

 MR. McCOLGIN: It's protecting the right of 

prompt presentment. McNabb-Mallory was meant to prevent

the exploitation of delay in presentment as a means of 

obtaining a confession.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why do we want to 

avoid delay in presentment? What reason do we give? 

And I assume there are reasons that -- to contact family 

and so forth -- other than voluntariness.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Well, voluntariness is 

certainly a part of it. But it's in addition, because 

there's rights that attach at presentment that allow a 

defendant to make a much more informed decision as to 

whether --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do those rights have 

to do with a confession that is conceded, for our 

analytic purposes, to be voluntary?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Because the confession itself 

was obtained through exploitation of the delay. During 

a period of custody -- before presentment the defendant 

was just in the hands of the zealous police officers who 

have actually arrested him. It's a fundamental 

principle of our justice system that that period should 

be as short as reasonably possible because during that 

period, as time goes on, the effect of the delay is to 

increase the inherently coercive power of that uncertain

principles when you have got Rule 5 of the Rules of 

Criminal Procedure? Don't they say that an arrestee 

shall be taken before a magistrate without unreasonable 

delay?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Exactly, Your Honor. It's 

the right under 5(a) to prompt presentment that is being 

protected.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all you are doing is 

trying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the 

wholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if 

it's voluntary. If it's not voluntary, of course, it's 

related.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Well, the purpose of 

McNabb-Mallory was actually to cut the line a bit short 

of having to actually make a voluntariness 

determination. It's a recognition that, even if the 

statement is voluntary, that still there are inherent 

coercive pressures that develop during a period of 

presentment -- of presentment delay, and that that 

period of time should be as short as possible so that 

that coercive nature, the coercive nature of the 

interrogation, doesn't cause the person to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you are saying a 

confession can be coercive and still voluntary?

 MR. McCOLGIN: It's -- yes, Your Honor. Not

in the sense that it's a coerced confession. I'm not 

arguing that this was involuntary. Instead, I'm arguing 

that McNabb-Mallory intends to avoid the voluntariness 

requirement by establishing a prophylactic rule, so that 

a presentment needs to be made as soon as reasonably 

possible after the arrest so that that delay cannot be 

exploited as a means of obtaining a confession. It both 

protects the right to prompt presentment and it also --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this: What 

other remedy, other than suppression of the confession 

made after six hours, is there available to the 

defendants to enforce the interest in prompt 

presentment?

 MR. McCOLGIN: There is no other remedy 

available. In fact, the message that an affirmance in 

this case would send to law enforcement is that delay 

for the purpose of interrogation is permissible and that 

the right of prompt presentment is unenforceable. 

Without McNabb-Mallory, this becomes an empty right. 

There is no other remedy. And that's why particularly 

where the delay is purposeful, as we have in this case 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why would that be the case? 

The confession could still be suppressed on grounds of 

involuntariness?

MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is you don't 

trust district judges to make accurate determinations as 

to whether the confession is voluntary or not. You need 

-- you need a rule that takes that out of their hands.

 MR. McCOLGIN: It's not that we don't trust 

them. It's that delay for the purpose of interrogation 

should not be pushed to that limit; that delay for the 

purpose of interrogation should not be permitted. The 

delay, particularly where it's for that express purpose, 

even if the defendant cannot show that it rose to the 

level of involuntariness, still it's exploitation of 

delay. It's a violation of the right to prompt 

presentment, and that violation of the right to prompt 

presentment under McNabb-Mallory renders that confession 

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the purpose of the 

requirement of prompt presentment?

 MR. McCOLGIN: The purpose of the right of 

prompt presentment is several-fold.

 First of all, it's because there are 

inherent coercive characteristics that develop during a 

period of custody, and a person, once arrested, should 

be presented to a neutral magistrate so that the neutral 

magistrate can both assign counsel, give an opportunity

for consultation with counsel, and can also inform the 

person of his rights, address bail, and issues such as 

that. So the right of prompt presentment is considered 

fundamental. It's considered a basic right, a basic 

statutory right in our system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McColgin, what do you 

do with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay 

longer than six hours nondestructive of the 

admissibility of the confession if the delay beyond six 

hours "is found by the trial judge to be reasonable 

considering the means of transportation and the distance 

to be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge 

or other officer."

 I can think of a lot of reasons why you 

can't do it within six hours other than the means of 

transportation and the distance to be traveled.

 MR. McCOLGIN: We have to remember, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You see, if you take the 

government's position that it really doesn't matter, it 

gets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those 

factors into account, and the ultimate question is 

whether the confession was reasonable.

 But if you take your position, the defendant 

automatically walks, or at least his confession is

automatically thrown out, and the only exception made is 

if the means of transportation and the distance to be 

traveled made six hours impracticable.

 MR. McCOLGIN: No, Your Honor, that's not 

our position. Our position is that the first question 

is did the confession fall within that six-hour time 

period?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Or longer, depending on 

transportation, means of transportation. For that 

determination of whether it falls within the exclusion 

period, only means of transportation or distance is 

considered, but once the confession is outside that 

period, then McNabb-Mallory applies and the confession 

may still be admissible if the delay was necessary. And 

for those purposes, once we are determining whether 

McNabb-Mallory requires inadmissibility, the court can 

consider, for example, emergency hospital treatment or 

unavailability of the magistrate. So all of those 

factors can and do get considered once we get into the 

determination of whether McNabb-Mallory requires 

exclusion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that certainly is a 

very back-door way of doing it, isn't it?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Not at all, Your Honor,

because once we look at the structure of the statute 

what it's doing is carving out the first six hours from 

McNabb-Mallory. So the determination of whether we are 

in that carve-out period is limited to transportation 

and distance, but once we are outside of it, we just 

apply McNabb-Mallory, and that's McNabb-Mallory as it 

has developed in the case law, which includes all of 

these other considerations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why -- why was it 

appropriate to have a special rule for transportation? 

In other words, everything that is covered by the 

transportation proviso would, on your theory would on 

your theory have been subject to consideration under 

McNabb-Mallory anyway. So why did they simply have a 

six-hour rule and leave any exceptions, transportation, 

unavailability of magistrate, medical emergency, 

whatever, to -- to the leeway that McNabb-Mallory 

allows?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Because the first question, 

again, is just whether to exclude the confession 

altogether from the McNabb-Mallory determination. And 

for those purposes, they -- some Senators from larger 

States where there's greater distances to travel wanted 

to make sure that there was an exception for 

transportation and distance.

JUSTICE SOUTER: So basically -- I don't 

mean this disparagingly, but basically the answer is 

politics. Somebody from a State thought of it and 

nobody else said, well, gee, let's pile on some other 

provisos. It's as simple as that in your view?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Exactly, Your Honor. There 

was very little comment on it added at the -- at the 

last minute. The Scott Amendment had just included the 

six-hour provision, but then the proviso was added on 

the floor at the very last minute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I see.

 MR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, the government 

also relies on 402 as a basis for arguing that 

McNabb-Mallory has been basically overturned by 

Congress. Rule 402, however, clearly does not apply 

here. The advisory notes -- the advisory committee 

notes make clear that Rule 402 was never intended to 

overturn McNabb-Mallory. In fact, the advisory 

committee identified McNabb-Mallory as a rule of 

inadmissibility that was meant to stay in place even 

after the implementation of Rule 402.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At least one time limit 

that has been complied with -- and that's the Fourth 

Amendment, how long you can keep somebody seized without 

taking them before a magistrate -- there is no violation

of that time period, is there?

 MR. McCOLGIN: That's correct, Your Honor, 

the McLaughlin principle that less than 48 hours is 

presumptively reasonable. However, Congress in -- in 

3501(c) chose to set a six-hour time period for the 

taking of confessions and to leave McNabb-Mallory in 

place outside that time period.

 I would suggest that Congress struck an 

appropriate balance at that time, keeping McNabb-Mallory 

in place for the more extreme types of delay, but 

eliminating it from the shorter periods of delay. And, 

in doing so, Congress struck an appropriate balance, and 

I would suggest that this Court should respect the 

balance that Congress has struck. Unless there is any 

further questions, I would ask that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I just have one question. 

Do you think the -- that the D.C. Circuit -- the statute 

pertaining to the District of Columbia is relevant?

 MR. McCOLGIN: As legislative history, yes, 

Your Honor, because the 3501(c) was modeled on the D.C. 

legislation, which established clearly a three-hour time 

period. And the legislative history for that was very 

clear that they intended to leave McNabb-Mallory in 

effect outside that time period.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It's important in this case to go back and 

look at the original Rule of Exclusion that this Court 

developed in the McNabb case in 1943 and then reiterated 

in the Mallory case in 1957. Both of those cases 

considered a pre-Miranda regime in which there was no 

constitutional law that required that a suspect be 

advised of his rights.

 Under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of 

Criminal Procedure and under statutes that preceded it 

that were in effect at the time of McNabb, the only way 

to ensure that a suspect was informed of his rights to 

silence and counsel was to bring him before a 

magistrate, and the magistrate would advise him of those 

rights. This Court in McNabb and Mallory thus fashioned 

a judicial rule of evidence, an exclusionary rule under 

the Court's supervisory power not as an effectuation of 

something that Congress specifically intended but of its 

own force as a way to backstop the Rule 5 requirement.

In the government's view, two acts that came 

subsequently to McNabb and Mallory, section 3501 and 

Rule 402 of the Federal Rules --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask before you 

get to those, Mr. Dreeben: Other than the McNabb-

Mallory Rule, what was available as a sanction for 

violations of the rule of prompt presentment?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, I am not sure 

that there is any evidentiary sanction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, not -- apart from an 

evidentiary sanction.

 MR. DREEBEN: None has risen in the case law 

that I can point Your Honor to. I think the primary 

safeguard of the enforcement of Rule 5 is the obligation 

that is placed on the government and on government 

agents to comply with rules of criminal procedure that 

are valid.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So at the time that 

Mallory and McNabb were decided the Court thought that 

an extra rule was necessary to give the government an 

incentive to comply with prompt-presentment 

requirements. The very same factors are still at work 

today, aren't they?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think that they 

are, Justice Stevens, because the -- the critical thing

that the Court was doing in Mallory and McNabb was 

trying to come up with a way to ensure that suspects 

were advised of their rights to protect against abuses 

in the interrogation process. And the Court's ultimate 

constitutional solution to that lay years in the future. 

It came in the form of Miranda.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I am not -- we are 

not talking about a constitutional problem but a rule 

problem encouraging compliance with the -- the -- with 

the rule that requires prompt presentment.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that what the Court 

was after-

JUSTICE STEVENS: I say that to the extent 

-- to the extent that was a motivating factor in McNabb, 

it seems to me that it would be precisely the same 

motivating factor in McNabb.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that it was not 

the sole motivating factor in McNabb.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Not the sole, but it was a 

motivating factor. And it would have equal strength 

today as then.

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I would not agree that it 

would have equal strength.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, wouldn't --

wouldn't you still have this disincentive which --

wouldn't you still have this disincentive, which is 

considerable? If you -- if you exceed the time limit, 

it may be taken into account in determining that the 

confession was involuntary.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, certainly, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that enough of a 

disincentive? If you delay too long, that delay is one 

of the factors to be taken into account in deciding 

whether the confession was voluntary.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, excessive delay can be a 

-- it is by statute a factor that will be taken into 

account in determining --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about Rule 5? 

And Rule 5 doesn't say a word about voluntary. It says 

unnecessary delay -- shall be brought before a 

magistrate without unnecessary delay. So whatever the 

balancing there may be in 3501, I think what you're 

saying is that Rule 5(a), which just says bring 

theoretically before a magistrate without unreasonable 

delay, that that has no teeth; that that is effectively 

unenforceable.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think it is unenforceable by 

the exclusion of a confession that results from what a 

court concludes is unnecessary delay. And I think that 

that is true for two reasons, by virtue of congressional

action and rulemaking action. And I think that as an 

additional actor this Court, which struck that 

supervisory powered balance in a pre-Miranda era, would 

do well to consider whether the factors that motivated 

it to suppress confessions in McNabb and Mallory should 

still be evaluated the same way today.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But isn't your -- I'm 

sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 5 is about 

unnecessary delay, and here we have a case, if I 

remember the facts right, where the officer said, yes, 

the reason we didn't bring him before a magistrate 

sooner is because we wanted to get a confession from 

him.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, what 

happened in this case is that the suspect was given his 

Miranda rights and waived them and agreed to give a 

confession. There are three circuits and the D.C. local 

court which all have concluded that a waiver of Miranda 

rights waives the right to prompt presentment. So the 

question of whether there was in fact unnecessary delay 

that would constitute a violation of Rule 5 has not been 

litigated in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must be losing the thread 

of the argument. It seems to me that McNabb and Mallory

only provide punishment for excessive delay where there 

has been a confession. Isn't that right?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so long as the length 

of the -- the delay can still be considered as one of 

the elements in determining that the confession -- that 

the confession is involuntary, there is still a degree 

of incentive based upon only the confession. Now, it --

it may not be as high a degree -- that it is 

automatically excluded -- but the police are going to 

have to consider that any confession they may get within 

that period of excessive delay may be challengeable.

 MR. DREEBEN: It is certainly challengeable 

on voluntariness grounds. Now, the Court's motive-

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is still true they have 

everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to 

interrogate.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, they do have something 

JUSTICE STEVENS: If they don't get the 

confession within six hours, they haven't got it. So if 

they continue on, their only purpose is to try to get a 

voluntary confession.

extent that it is correct that a waiver of Miranda

rights waives the prompt presentment right and prevents 

an objection based on whatever survives of 

McNabb-Mallory, the officers are doing nothing wrong if 

they obtain a valid Miranda waiver; and this was just 

not a factor that the Court had on the horizon when it 

decided McNabb and Mallory.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't there a -- a new 

factor now that the Court has decided Miranda? And 

you've argued that we should regard this in the 

post-Miranda light, but I think there is at least one 

way of doing that that cuts against the government's 

argument and I would like your response to that.

 That is that in the post-Miranda world in 

practical terms, if a -- if a court in considering a 

suppression motion finds that the Miranda warnings were 

given and that after they were given this individual 

said, okay, I'll talk, that is in practical terms the 

end of the issue. The notion that there is a -- an 

independent voluntariness concern is pretty much theory, 

not practice.

 Given what I think is the, kind of the 

real-world effect of Miranda -- say the magic words, get 

the defendant to say, I'll talk, that's it -- doesn't it 

make sense to have a further safeguard in something like 

the six-hour rule understood as preserving

McNabb-Mallory after the six hours?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter, I think 

that is purely a question of policy of whether there 

should be such a strong exclusionary rule that mandates 

the barring from admission into evidence of a purely 

voluntary confession where there's no dispute about its 

voluntariness because the officers delayed beyond six 

hours.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I agree with you; it 

is an issue of policy. But I thought your whole 

argument for considering this as a post-Miranda case was 

in effect a -- a policy context in which you wanted us 

to decide this.

 MR. DREEBEN: It's a policy context that I 

think Congress has decided in two different enactments, 

and I think that if this Court were to reach it as a 

matter of policy, it should revisit the balance that it 

reached in McNabb-Mallory because of the changed legal 

context. But this is a case about section 3501 and 

about Federal Rule of Evidence 402.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I knew you were going to 

get to 3501 eventually.

 MR. DREEBEN: I am glad that I have finally 

reached it.

MR. DREEBEN: Section 3501 on its face says 

nothing about excluding any evidence. What it says is 

that in section (a) voluntary confessions are 

admissible. In section (b) it says that in determining 

voluntariness, a court will consider a variety of 

factors under the totality of the circumstances, 

including prearraignment delay. Then in subsection (c), 

it attacks more directly the McNabb-Mallory rule. And 

as originally formulated it would have wiped out 

McNabb-Mallory altogether; there is no dispute about 

that. After the bill was introduced there was a 

modification of it on the floor of the Senate in which a 

six-hour limitation was put in.

 Now, the effect of that six hours is to say 

that within six hours after the arrest delay by itself 

can never be an exclusive grounds for suppression; it 

just can't. And to that extent it overrules 

McNabb-Mallory to the extent that McNabb-Mallory would 

have allowed less than six hours of delay to serve as a 

basis for suppressing evidence. Outside of six hours, 

it does not say that evidence is suppressed. It simply 

leaves that determination to other sources of law.

 In the government's view, the primary source 

of law that controls the answer to that question is 

subsection (a), which says that voluntary confessions

are admissible, and I believe that, as Justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is the answer, why 

do we need (c) -- I mean, why did Congress need (c) at 

all?

 MR. DREEBEN: Congress never needed (c); (c) 

in the government's view was always superfluous, even at 

the time when it directly said delays shall never be the 

grounds for suppressing a confession. There was already 

a provision in (a) that said voluntary confessions are 

admissible and it was well understood that 

McNabb-Mallory -- and this Court was very explicit on 

the point -- excluded totally voluntary confessions.

 So if this Court has nothing before it but 

the text of the statute, subsection (a) makes voluntary 

confessions admissible, and the only way that Petitioner 

can get around that is to say that section 3501(c) 

carved something out of subsection (a).

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if it doesn't, Mr. 

Dreeben, what do the words "time limitation" mean in the 

proviso?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's the limitation on a --

the period during which a court cannot rely exclusively 

on delay within the meaning of the statute. It simply 

-- it carves out six hours from McNabb-Mallory plus 

reasonable transportation delays, and it leaves the

six-hour -- after the six-hour period to other sources 

of law.

 Now, one source of law -- and this is where 

Petitioner looks -- would be McNabb-Mallory. But 

McNabb-Mallory is not a constitutional rule of decision. 

This Court has been clear, most recently in the 

Sanchez-Llamas decision, that it is a rule of 

supervisory power created by this Court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are really asking the 

Court to overrule McNabb-Mallory, because you say 

Congress provided six hours, no McNabb-Mallory, but 

after six hours the test is voluntariness -- only 

voluntariness. So there's nothing left under the 

government's view of McNabb-Mallory.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct, but the 

modification, Justice Ginsburg, is that I think Congress 

has displaced McNabb-Mallory. It obviously cannot 

overrule a decision of this Court, but it can prescribe 

a rule of law that takes precedence over a decision of 

this Court that rests on its supervisory power.

 Petitioner does not contend that 

McNabb-Mallory was an interpretation of Rule 5 of the 

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and I don't think 

that he could do that. This Court was explicit that the 

predecessor statute that existed before Rule 5 and

provided the prompt presentment requirement did not 

address the issue of remedy.

 And it's notable I think that in the 

preliminary draft of the Rules of Criminal Procedure a 

rule of exclusion was explicitly provided. The rule 

would have said: "No statement made by a defendant in 

response to interrogation by an officer or agent of the 

government shall be admissible in evidence against him 

if the interrogation occurs while the defendant was held 

in custody in violation of this rule."

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what if the 

other reasons apply? I take it the words 

"self-incriminating statement" in (e) means any adverse 

evidence?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that's right, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, there are a lot 

of reasons we exclude evidence. You know, I mean -- it 

might, for example, might not in the circumstance be 

worth the confusion. It might not in the circumstance 

be worth the time. It might violate -- I don't know, 

there is like a whole -- there are many reasons.

 So in your opinion, does section (a) mean to 

set aside all the reasons? In other words, if for some 

other reason this particular piece of self-incriminating

mean that.

 MR. DREEBEN: If the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So if it doesn't mean that, 

then why does it mean that we should ignore this other 

rule of evidence contained in Rule 5 of the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's precisely my 

point, Justice Breyer. The other rules that might 

permit exclusion of a voluntary confession in the Rules 

of Evidence are explicit, or they are there because the 

courts interpreted that rule to require it. That's not 

what happened in McNabb-Mallory, and I don't think 

that --

are, in other words, as you have heard, a number of

things that can happen when you hold a person, let's say 

for 40 hours for 29. I mean, one thing that happens is 

he doesn't learn how he gets out on bail. Another thing 

he happens, he doesn't learn exactly what the charge is 

against him. Another thing -- they are all listed in, 

in Rule 5.

 And -- and when you have an exclusionary 

rule, you enforce not only what you are talking about, 

which I understand, which is the voluntariness part, but 

you also enforce all these other things that happen when 

you bring a person before a magistrate and don't keep 

him for 70 hours or something.

 So why should we interpret (a) as setting 

those other things aside and requiring us to overturn 

McNabb and Mallory?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, McNabb and Mallory are 

not constitutional decisions of this Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not.

 MR. DREEBEN: They were attempts to 

effectuate a particular policy choice. That policy 

choice was one that Congress was free to revisit, and I 

submit it did revisit in two different provisions, one 

in 3501(a) and the other in Federal Rule of Evidence 

402.

legislative history, which interests me, that the 

purpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and McNabb?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Breyer, and I will 

concede to you the legislative history on the point that 

section (a) was considered to overrule Miranda and 

subsection (c) was addressed to McNabb-Mallory.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer 

suggested that there are rules of evidence other than 

those based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that 

might result in the exclusion of a confession. Maybe 

there are such rules, but I'm trying to think of them. 

I can't think of what they might be. Certainly it's not 

hearsay. Is it ever going to be ruled to be irrelevant? 

Is it common for a confession to be excluded under Rule 

403? Are there rules that would --

MR. DREEBEN: I think in theory Rule 403 is 

such a rule. Rule 16, which requires discovery 

obligations, contains its own authorization for an 

exclusionary rule. And my answer to Justice Breyer on 

those rules is that they are explicitly provided by 

Congress. The difference in a Rule 5 --

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you familiar with cases 

in which a defendant's confession has been excluded 

under -- under 403?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Alito.

JUSTICE BREYER: I wasn't focusing on the 

word "confession." I was focusing on the words in (e), 

which were "any self-incriminating statement." And 

that's why I asked you if you interpreted that to 

include anything that the individual said after, say, 

29 hours that might turn out to be adverse to that 

defendant's interests. And your answer to that was yes.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I think you are right. 

I think we agree on that.

 So, if the defendant said, if you look under 

the rock you will find the writing such-and-such, it 

might not be authenticated for that particular writing. 

There are many reasons. It might be triple hearsay, 

what he says. I mean, you know, there are a variety of 

things, aren't there? Maybe I am wrong.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think the general principle 

is what the Court ought to be focused on here. And the 

general principle is, yes, if there is some specific 

provision that should be together with subsection (a) --

JUSTICE BREYER: The reason I brought that 

up is not to be technical. The reason I brought it up 

is to point out that there are many, many words that a 

person could utter in confinement under 30 hours, which 

in a variety of ways could stab him in the back without

it having anything to do with Miranda, without it having 

anything to do with coerced confession.

 And similarly, there are many reasons for 

bringing him forward that have nothing to do with 

either. And therefore, I wonder if all those reasons 

could support retaining McNabb-Mallory, a matter about 

which Congress said nothing.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think it would be quite 

extraordinary for the Court to decide to revive its 

supervisory power decisions in McNabb and Mallory. They 

clearly were aimed at the problem of incommunicado 

detention with a suspect who did not know his Miranda 

rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, I tend to 

think that what we should be focusing on is the language 

of 3501. Can I bring you back to that? What I do not 

understand about your argument is the following: The 

six -- the six-hour safe harbor applies only when the 

confession is made voluntarily, right?

 I would think that the proviso likewise 

assumes voluntariness. That is, the time limitation 

contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation 

applicable to voluntary confessions. And it says that 

time limitation shall not apply in any case in which the 

delay in bringing the person is beyond six hours is

found by the trial judge to be reasonable.

 I think you have already voluntariness 

assumed in the proviso, but you want us to go back and 

re -- reconsider voluntariness under (a). I just don't 

think that's -- that's a fair way to read it.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think the statute, as we 

read it, contains some overlap in voluntariness 

requirement, and we interpret the voluntariness 

reference in subsection (c) to really mean otherwise 

voluntary; in other words, not to be deemed involuntary 

solely on the basis of delay, but otherwise voluntary.

 And in that sense section 3501(c) does 

contain --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I am reading it that 

way, too. Otherwise voluntary is in the safe harbor.

 MR. DREEBEN: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then when you have a 

proviso, which refers to the time limitation contained 

in this subsection, it's a time limitation upon 

voluntary confessions.

 MR. DREEBEN: It's a -- it's a limitation on 

the time during which a judge may not rely on delay 

alone to find a confession inadmissible. That's all 

subsection (c) does. It says, judge, you may not find 

the confession to be inadmissible solely because of

delay if it's within six hours plus reasonable 

transportation delays.

 And our interpretation of that language is 

that the inadmissibility as you mentioned, 

Justice Scalia, refers back to subsection (a), which 

speaks about confessions that are admissible if they are 

voluntarily given.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't the statute 

say, instead of saying inadmissible, shall not be found 

involuntary solely by reasons of delay. Because it 

seems to me that your argument twain the two.

 MR. DREEBEN: It is, and I think the reason 

that it was written that way, Justice Souter, is it was 

a direct attempt to make clear that McNabb-Mallory shall 

not operate in the six-hour period after arrests and 

before presentment.

 It was an attempt to displace McNabb-Mallory 

explicitly. Originally it was to displace it 

altogether. As it ended up being written, it displaced 

it for six hours. And our submission is that you read 

the rest of the statute to determine what happens to 

confessions that are taken outside of six hours. And I 

would recognize that this makes subsection (c) in 

certain respects unnecessary to achieve the result that 

voluntariness controls.

But the most that Petitioner argues and he 

made it very clear today, the most that he argues is 

that section 3501(c) leaves McNabb-Mallory to live 

another day for confessions outside of six hours. And 

if that is true, then the government's position is that 

Congress, in 1975 in Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of 

Evidence provided the bases on which relevant evidence 

can be excluded. And it listed four sources and they 

are the Constitution, an act of Congress, a rule of 

evidence, or -- and this is the relevant one -- other 

rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to 

statutory authority.

 And what Congress meant by that were rules 

that this Court promulgates pursuant to Rules Enabling 

Act authority. It did not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's Rule 5.

 MR. DREEBEN: No. Rule 5 it certainly 

prescribed pursuant to Rules Enabling Act authority, 

although it was originally enacted by Congress. But 

Rule 5 contains no exclusionary rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And as you have said 

without the exclusionary rule, Rule 5(a) has no teeth at 

all. And I agree with that. It says -- it's a straight 

out command, no unnecessary delay. And isn't the reason 

for 5(a) exactly what happened here? This was a case

where the police officers were trying to admit that the 

sole reason that they didn't bring Corley before a 

magistrate properly was to extract a confession.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's exactly what 

McNabb-Mallory was trying to --

MR. DREEBEN: There is a crucial difference 

between this Court deciding that there is a command in 

the Rules of Criminal Procedure and we as a court are 

going to back it up by an enforcement mechanism, which 

is the supervisory power route, and Congress saying what 

we intend is that a violation of this rule produced 

inadmissibility of a confession. Congress has never 

said the latter. This Court, in promulgating rules of 

evidence, have never said the latter.

 And what that leaves the Court with is the 

option of persisting in McNabb-Mallory as a supervisory 

powers decision or following the text of Rule 402 of the 

Federal Rules of Evidence, which says that there isn't 

any authority to say that relevant evidence is out of 

the case simply because of the Court's views on 

supervisory powers --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, do you think 

the Rule 402 argument is strong enough to prevail even

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The statute was really 

unnecessary to overrule McNabb-Mallory, in your view?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Congress focused on the 

problem of confessions in section 3501 and it dealt with 

McNabb-Mallory in section 3501(c). We submit that the 

text of the statute provides an answer to McNabb-Mallory 

in section 3501(a).

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is superfluous and 

unnecessary answer if your interpretation of the rules 

is correct?

 MR. DREEBEN: It came many years before, 

Justice Stevens. In 1968 when Congress reacted to this 

Court's Miranda decision and to McNabb-Mallory, it 

passed section 3501. Rule 402 is a very general rule 

that says the policy of the federal courts is that we 

are not going to have evidence rules made any more by 

case-by-case decision by the Supreme Court. We are 

going to have them promulgated in a code of Federal 

rules, and if the Court wants to change them, it can do 

that through the revisory committee process, and it 

would be open to Congress at any point, which has 

superior ability to gather facts and to survey the 

impact of whether there is a pattern of violations of 

rule 5 that warrants the very strong --

JUSTICE STEVENS: We could never acknowledge 

or recognize a new privilege, then, for example --

MR. DREEBEN: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- psychiatrists or 

something like that?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I think the Court did that 

and quite properly did it, Justice Stevens, because rule 

502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- 501 or 502 says 

that principles of privilege shall be developed in light 

of reason and experience, and so it was a specific grant 

to this Court of the authority to do that.

 But beyond that Congress did not intend that 

the Court use supervisory powers to exclude relevant 

evidence. There is a rulemaking process; if the bench 

and bar want to get together and conclude as they did 

not conclude in 1943 -- this is the point I was trying 

to make to Justice Breyer -- in 1943 after this Court's 

decision in McNabb, there was explicit consideration of 

an exclusionary rule provision in rule 5; it engendered 

enormous controversy; it was rejected; it was taken out 

of the rule and it was never promulgated.

 So McNabb-Mallory exists not by virtue of 

the rulemaking process but by virtue of a supervisory 

decision of this Court more than half a century ago in 

an entirely different legal climate, in a climate where

the costs of excluding a reliable, probative confession 

were not balanced against the benefits, if any, to be 

achieved by enforcing of a prompt present requirement 

through exclusion.

 Since that time this Court's Miranda 

jurisprudence has made it far more inappropriate for the 

Court to conclude that the enforcement of a rule-based 

mechanism which serves as a prophylactic to protect 

voluntariness should now result in exclusion of a 

confession when rule 501 says voluntary confessions come 

in and section -- and rule 402 says that relevant 

evidence comes in unless excluded by four sources --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any indication 

of the rules advisory committee, any of their notes, 

that 402 was meant to overturn McNabb-Mallory?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I -- Justice Ginsburg, the 

rules advisory committee notes I think reflect an 

expectation that McNabb-Mallory was the law. Our 

submission is that the text of 402 is simply 

inconsistent with that, because it is quite explicit in 

limiting the sources of rules that can bar the admission 

of admissible evidence; and the phrase that is in 402, 

which is on page 29 of our brief, is "rules prescribed 

by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority."

Now the advisory committee drafters may have 

thought that that subsumed rule 5, but I think that is a 

legal question for this Court, and the correct answer to

not a rule promulgated by this Court.

 Rule 402 as it was enacted clearly was not 

intended to overturn existing rules of inadmissibility 

such as McNabb-Mallory. We know that because the 

advisory committee notes specifically identify it as a 

rule of inadmissibility that would survive after rule 

402. It was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may not

statutes at the time of McNabb which were seen as 

precluding presentment delay. And then after the 

enactment of -- of rule 5, it was seen as based on that 

as well.

 After -- in 1968 Mallory was also seen as 

being incorporated into 3501(c) which is clear from the 

citation in the advisory note to both Mallory and 

3501(c). So it was viewed when it was enacted as 

leaving in place McNabb-Mallory, because McNabb-Mallory 

was viewed as being pursuant to statutory authority --

pursuant to statutory authority because it was enforcing 

statutory rights.

 So rule 402 clearly does not in any way 

overturn McNabb-Mallory.

 I would like to address very quickly the 

Miranda issue and note that you know, certainly, 

although Miranda came into effect after McNabb-Mallory, 

Miranda itself in rule 32 notes that the existence of 

the Miranda warnings should not be seen as a basis for 

disregarding the rights under McNabb and Mallory and the 

importance of that exclusionary rule. So Miranda itself 

recognized that it was still important to have a 

protection against presentment delay, and I think the 

facts of this case illustrate that very well.

 We have in this case a flagrant and

deliberate violation of the right of prompt presentment, 

where the agents admitted freely that they delayed the 

presentment in order to obtain the confession. If --

again, if the Third Circuit were to be affirmed in this 

case, it would be telling law enforcement around the 

country that that sort of flagrant conduct is 

permissible.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that --

that sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if 

it had been done within six hours, right? Assuming it 

was a voluntary confession?

 MR. McCOLGIN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The purpose of the 

law enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is 

irrelevant under six hours.

 MR. McCOLGIN: As long as it is under six 

hours, that's correct, there is no problem; and that's 

because within six hours there is no delay. Congress 

has determined that anything less than six hours is not 

within --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't it 

seem odd that the focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as 

being as important as you are emphasizing, but not --

but totally irrelevant at 5:59?

in this sort of case, so when you get close to the line, 

you may have results that are dramatically different. 

In this case we are far outside the line. The second 

confession was 26 and a half hours after the arrest; and 

as I have noted and as this Court has noted, it was a 

deliberate delay for the purpose of obtaining the 

confessions.

 Where we have such purposeful delay, 

Congress left McNabb-Mallory in place to address 

precisely such flagrant conduct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can you waive the right, the 

5(a) right?

 MR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor, as long as 

it is waived within the six-hour time period, and as 

long as it is an expressed waiver of a right to prompt 

presentment, it can be waived. In this case, of course, 

there was no waiver; there wasn't even a Miranda waiver 

until well -- well after the six hours.

 If there is no further questions, thank you, 

Your Honor.
