 (10:13 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-1343, J. McIntyre 

Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro.

 Mr. Fergenson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR F. FERGENSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FERGENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Because J. McIntyre did not direct any 

activity at residents of New Jersey either itself or by 

directing its distributor MMA to do so and had no 

awareness or knowledge that the distributor took the 

action that it did toward New Jersey, New Jersey lacked 

adjudicative jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say "its 

distributor," was this distributor at all controlled by 

the defendant?

 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. It was not. 

And both under Ohio law, Wells v. Komatsu America, and 

under the Restatement (Second) Agency, section 1(1), the 

right to control is essential to ascribe actions to 

create an agency, and it's on a per-purpose basis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It might be better to refer

to it as the company that distributed its product, 

rather than calling it "its distributor."

 MR. FERGENSON: Very good, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's loaded, it seems to 

me.

 MR. FERGENSON: Very good, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, in your 

question presented to this Court, you ask whether 

there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -­

"solely because the manufacturer targets the United 

States market for the sale of its product."

 So I'm taking from that, that you 

acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British 

manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the 

sale of its product. That's correct, yes?

 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, that's what the 

New Jersey Supreme Court held, and that's how we 

fashioned the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: That's your question 

presented.

 MR. FERGENSON: -- the test.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Did this -- well, I'll just 

ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United 

States market? Did it want to sell its products in the 

United States?

MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So what does that 

mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson? Because the United States 

is the United States. It's made up of 50 States. So I 

assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted 

to sell its products in each of the 50 States. Is that 

right?

 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: It only wanted to sell its 

product in a few States?

 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. It wanted 

to sell its product anywhere that the distributor could 

find. The distributor was the market manager.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. Anywhere. So if the 

distributor came up with California, that was great. If 

the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey, 

that was great. As many as possible, more the better, 

all over the United States. Is that right?

 MR. FERGENSON: As many as possible, 

wherever the -- the distributor could find a customer, 

yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Exactly. So you targeted 

New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New 

York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else.

 MR. FERGENSON: Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN: You targeted the entire 

United States. Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in 

each of the States you targeted?

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, because, 

first, this Court's jurisprudence looks to a direct act, 

from World-Wide Volkswagen and even before, as it 

brought forward Hanson. As this Court has applied 

World-Wide Volkswagen, Burger King and Justice 

O'Connor's concurrence in Asahi and the other 

occurrence -- concurrence, Justice Brennan's concurrence 

in Asahi, look toward a specific State -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fergenson, I suppose 

you could say the same thing about any United States 

manufacturer -­

MR. FERGENSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who would desire to sell 

his product in any of the States that would buy it.

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And to say that this 

foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State 

would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in 

any State, which -­

MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- none of our cases hold.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suable in any State

where the incident arises. This is not general 

jurisdiction. This is specific jurisdiction. So the 

question is, when you target the entire United States 

and each of the 50 States within that and an accident 

occurs within one of those States, are you subject to 

jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a 

claim based on that accident? Not generally, but just 

for a claim based on that accident.

 Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you 

referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said 

as long as there's purposeful availment, there is 

specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment 

when there's an active effort to target a market.

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, in Burger 

King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the 

purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities 

within the forum State. The -- this Court, through 

those opinions, foreseeability, clear notice, reasonably 

anticipate -- all converge.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all of those cases, 

there was a forum in the United States where someone 

injured in the United States could sue. Your 

proposition is that a company can deliberately send its 

products, wants to exploit a U.S. market. But I take it 

that there is no place in the United States, because New

Jersey is no different than California or any other 

place -- is it your position that there is no forum in 

which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this 

distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having 

its machines in as many locations in the United States 

as it could? Is there a forum in the United States 

where it could be sued?

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which one?

 MR. FERGENSON: Ohio. It could have been 

proceeded against in Ohio.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It could be reached in 

Ohio. Now, does that make a whole lot of sense? Is it 

any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than 

New Jersey? It's a lot less convenient for 

Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this 

machine.

 But you -- you are conceding that there is a 

forum where this British company can be sued on a tort 

that occurred in New Jersey. Explain to me why, since 

there is a forum in the United States, the logical one 

isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, first, the 

issue of convenience, choice of law, conflict of law, as 

a determinative factor was rejected by this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you -­

MR. FERGENSON: What?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the question: Where 

can it be sued? Well, something happened in New Jersey. 

The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm 

there. What happened in Ohio? What basis for specific 

jurisdiction is there in Ohio? There was no tort in 

Ohio.

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, under Ohio 

law, the -- there can be an assignment. There was no 

written contract between MMA and J. McIntyre. There can 

be an assignment in return for a release of a common law 

indemnification right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but, Mr. Fergenson, 

just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is 

a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim 

between the British manufacturer and its distributor in 

Ohio. Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the 

agreement between the two -- Ohio is the appropriate 

place for jurisdiction. But Ohio does not seem the 

appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're 

talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as 

to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New 

Jersey.

The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is 

that you need a relationship between the defendant and 

the forum and the claim. And here the claim arose in 

New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio.

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, Ohio 

explicitly provides, and they -- it's arisen in statute 

of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers 

Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both 

express and common law indemnity arises under contract.

 So, upon the assignment -- and there need 

not be a judgment under Ohio law; that's Fort Defiance 

Construction v. Village of Grover Hill -- there can be 

an assignment of a common law indemnity under strict 

product liability.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of common law 

indemnity are we dealing with here? Where does 

Mr. Nicastro sue? He hasn't got any assignment, any 

indemnity. Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States 

by a machine manufactured in England, and he wants to 

sue, understandably, in the United States. Why are we 

talking about assignments, indemnity? That has nothing 

to do with Mr. Nicastro.

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor, it does. 

Mr. Nicastro had an action under strict product 

liability. I want to come back to more fully answer the

why question that you asked: Why is it just and right 

that he go -- that he to Ohio?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I would just like to 

know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and 

not in New Jersey. In New Jersey, it's the place where 

the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but 

the relationship between the distributor -- there's a 

contract between the distributor and McIntyre. So why 

does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?

 MR. FERGENSON: Ohio has New Jersey -­

jurisdiction. There -- as Your Honor noticed, there are 

three places that Mr. Nicastro, in looking over this, 

could have chosen: United Kingdom, which he is now in, 

in filing a claim in the liquidation proceedings; Ohio; 

and New Jersey. The accident occurred in New Jersey. 

That's a forum non conveniens issue that's -- ­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a forum what?

 MR. FERGENSON: That's a convenience issue, 

a forum non conveniens issue. And Justice Brennan was 

clear before Burger King that that's what he wanted to 

see the law go in the direction of. He was clear about 

that.

forum State -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the claim in suit. 

That's very important.

 MR. FERGENSON: And -- and the cause of 

action, yes. There -- the one place where both the 

distributor, who would upon suit and then a claim over 

under product, strict product liability, would disappear 

-- that's why you could get an assignment -- the 

distributor is in Ohio, and so too is the contract 

relationship.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't -- I don't 

follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment, 

indemnity. Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he 

sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt. 

And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction; 

specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is 

where the claim arose. International Shoe, it arose in 

the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -­

the people who were promoting sale of International 

Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day. 

So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by 

International Shoe based on the events that occurred in 

California. It was not all-purpose jurisdiction.

 And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a 

proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really

don't follow that.

 MR. FERGENSON: It -- Your Honor, it is. 

Mr. Nicastro could have contacted MMA, and stated I have 

a strict product liability action, or the trustee in 

bankruptcy. The statute of limitations was 2 years in 

both cases. Ohio would have applied New Jersey strict 

liability law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer to Justice 

Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you, 

but it seems to me rather strange. All of a sudden 

you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out. 

thought the question was, from the standpoint of the 

defendant at least, whether the defendant purposefully 

availed itself of the forum. And you would say the 

defendant here purposefully availed itself of Ohio by 

choosing an Ohio distributor. But you don't make that 

argument. You're talking about a contract, an 

indemnity, which seems to me another step. That's 

choice of law and applicable law.

 MR. FERGENSON: I agree, Your Honor; it is 

choice of law. And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Also, I don't think it's 

worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole 

lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or 

not. You really think that that's --

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, in the -­

in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in 

Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially 

accepted by Justice Brennan -- in that footnote, it 

states that national contacts is for the national 

sovereign to decide.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. But if the 

national sovereign, the United States, provided by 

statute that Federal district courts would have 

jurisdiction over any -- any tort suit by a person 

injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the 

United States, would that be proper?

under the Fifth Amendment what circumstances it may be,

it. It may be that Congress -­

limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the 

United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than 

in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, 

does have jurisdiction. That seems backwards.

 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's 

power to control, let's say, imports, then as a 

condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign 

Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act looks for.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Congress has power to 

control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress 

says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter.

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, could I try 

another hypothetical?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the question is why 

the State can't make the same choice that the Congress 

does. The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be 

sure. Is that the only distinction? That doesn't sound 

to me like due process. What we're talking about is a 

source of authority, not fairness to the defendant.

availment of the privilege of conducting activities 

within the forum. And then the other -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Fergenson, the 

question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and 

here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50 

States -- is purposeful availment. So let me -- let me 

just try a different hypothetical.

 Suppose you had the same arrangement with 

your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to 

serve the entire United States market. Instead, the 

arrangement was to serve only five States in the 

Midwest. That's what you wanted, your client wanted, 

the market to be. So it was going to be Ohio and 

Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right? 

So now a machine blows up in Illinois. Is there 

jurisdiction in Illinois?

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: There is jurisdiction in 

Illinois, even though your relationship with your 

distributor was in Ohio. But there's jurisdiction in 

Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were 

seeking to serve the market; that's right?

 MR. FERGENSON: Because there was a 

direction of the distributor to go into the State where 

the accident occurred.

JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Now we have -- now we 

say this is working very well. Let's get another nine 

distributors on board. We'll give each of them five 

States, all right? Now, if I understand you correctly, 

now you're liable all over the United States because 

you've had this relationship with 10 different 

distributors, each of whom are going to serve 5 States. 

So there's personal jurisdiction in any State where a 

machine blows up.

 MR. FERGENSON: If the -- yes, Your Honor, 

if the States are assigned by name.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And now I say: Let's forget 

these 10 distributors. Who needs 10 distributors? I'll 

just have one distributor.

 Why is there any difference?

 MR. FERGENSON: Because that distributor -­

unless that distributor is told you must go -- like a 

traveling salesperson, you must go into each State, you 

must personally go into each State -- that's purposeful 

availment.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, with respect, 

this distributor was told to sell as many products as it 

could in as many States as it could.

 MR. FERGENSON: No, it was not, Your Honor. 

It was not told to do anything more than to sell

English company traveled to the trade shows with the

That letter also states that we've spent 

$350,000 and we performed the -- we performed repairs 

and warranty service without seeking reimbursement from 

you, and that's consistent with the distant relationship 

here.

 Your Honor, we asked for the names of the 

customers. We didn't get it. We didn't get -- we 

didn't drop-ship. And that would obviously have been a 

lot less expensive in cost rather than shipping it to 

Ohio. They were the market maker. They controlled the 

relationships with the individual customers.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then why was your number 

and name both printed on the machine and in the warranty 

book? The American -- obviously, some customers had to 

be reaching out you to because all the materials they 

received directed them to the English company, not to 

the American company.

quotes, from this Court's transcript of record in 

International Shoe. And in international Shoe, the 

salespeople were controlled by International Shoe.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Can I ask you -­

MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, first, the word 

"distributor" hurts you, so I'm going to take that out, 

and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs 

from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not 

you, okay?

 Now, a person walks into a shop in either 

West Virginia or the country of India where they make 

pots. They're very nice pots made, actually, in West 

Virginia. And the potter makes several thousand a year, 

and this individual says: Mr. Potter, I want to sell 

your pots; send me a thousand each year. Where are you 

going to sell them? Everywhere. Great.

 Okay? That's it. Now, suppose that the law 

were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for 

jurisdiction throughout the United States that the 

distributor or independent buyer said good, I'm selling 

them everywhere I can. And two or three end up in New 

Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up.

Suppose that was sufficient to find jurisdiction.

 You've prepared for this case. I want to 

know in your opinion, if that were the rule -- that's 

all that's necessary -- what cases in this Court in your 

opinion would that conflict with? I mean, I'm thinking 

of the facts. I'm not thinking of statements of law or 

whatever, but you can bring those in, too. I want to 

write those down because I want to read those cases, and 

you know them better than me.

 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, I believe that 

the -- that the principles of law as stated, because 

they're law and they're applied in each case, it could

rejection of the convenience test by this Court in 

World-Wide Volkswagen, Savchuk, and in Shaffer, where 

Justice Brennan posited that there be a convenience 

test, that those -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what a 

convenience test is. Assume I'm very ignorant, which 

isn't too far from the truth. I would like you to tell 

me, are there any cases which we would actually be 

conflicting with were we to say all that's necessary to 

assert jurisdiction in every State is that a buyer walks 

into a shop where the manufacturer of pots makes pots 

and tells the potter I'm going to sell everywhere I can,

and the potter says good, okay. Now -- and he buys the 

pots.

 Now, if that were the rule, can you find a 

case that that actually conflicts with?

 MR. FERGENSON: I believe that that 

conflicts, Your Honor, with Asahi.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Asahi, okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Asahi -- Asahi, 

Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese 

component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished 

product manufacturer. What -- how in the world could 

you compare that case, which really has nothing at all 

to do with the United States? It's -- it's a Japanese 

valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in 

Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go 

forward in the United States?

 I can see it going forward in -- in Japan, 

but it has no connection with the United States. And 

how can you possibly compare that with this case where 

somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions, 

allegedly?

 There was something very interesting you 

said in your brief. And you said the U.K., which you -­

a trusted legal system.

 What would be your answer if the 

manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell 

anyplace in the United States you can, is from China? 

Would you give the same answer?

 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, I would have to 

look at -- and -- and the answer would not be, off the 

cuff, the same. It would not be flatly the same. 

There's been a recent decision by Judge Chasanow on 

melamine in which Chasanow applied the availability law 

that this Court has set forth in Piper and Gulf Oil 

and -- and the other cases that follow, and determined 

that China was an available forum for the plaintiffs 

suing for the harm to their children from tainted milk.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you made a point 

about the trusted legal system. Well, let's say it was 

Russia, Mexico -- you may pick any one. The machine is 

manufactured in one of those countries where it's not so 

certain that there's a trusted legal system.

 MR. FERGENSON: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And so under Piper, Gulf Oil -- and I can't remember the 

name of the other case that Judge Chasanow relied 

upon -- they are difficult cases, and the ability of the 

court to determine whether the other forum is available 

is quite cabined. And they are difficult, Your Honor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. ROSS, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. ROSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 "All we wish to do is sell our products in 

the States and get paid." That's what the British 

manufacturer said.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he said we 

want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't 

sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company 

nonetheless does so? Can you get them -- can you hale 

them into court in New Jersey?

 MR. ROSS: I would say under those 

circumstances, yes, because the purpose that -- this 

particular manufacturer purposefully availed themselves 

of the entire U.S. market.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he said: But I 

have no intention of selling in New Jersey; I'm afraid I 

might get sued there, and I don't want to get sued

there. He is not entering the stream of commerce in the 

United States. He's entering a stream of commerce that 

detours around New Jersey.

 MR. ROSS: So every State with the exception 

of New Jersey -- is that the hypothetical, Your Honor?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. ROSS: Then I would say under those 

circumstances, yes, New Jersey would be excluded.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it would be 

excluded?

 MR. ROSS: Yes. If the manufacturer -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it depends on the 

intent of the manufacturer?

 MR. ROSS: I think it's the intent and the 

additional conduct of the manufacturer, Your Honor. I 

think, as Justice O'Connor said in the Asahi case -- she 

gave several examples. I think we'd meet all those 

examples under the circumstances of this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if a manufacturer 

tells a distributor: You have international 

distribution authority; you can sell my machine anywhere 

in the world, sell as many as you can anywhere in the

the world and had a distributor for the entire world and 

did -­

Jersey.

 MR. ROSS: Yes, it would.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Purposeful availment of the 

government of New Jersey?

to take some additional conduct.

mean much if that's all it means.

and additional conduct, Your Honor. In this case, 

that's what we have here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Additional conduct?

 MR. ROSS: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I have written down in 

my notes, which you can add to -­

MR. ROSS: Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that there are three 

things that happened. One -- it's the equivalent of the 

potter. One thing that happened, we have to take it as, 

I think, an independent company, whether you want to 

call them a distributor or not. I didn't see a 

difference there. An independent company goes to a firm 

somewhere in the world and says: I will buy your 

product and sell it in the United States. And the guy 

says good. And that's true whether it's a woman's 

cooperative in southern India or whether it's the 

biggest company in the world, okay? That's the first 

thing.

 The second thing is that an executive of 

that company went to seven trade shows in the United 

States.

 And the third thing is that two, three, or 

four machines ended up in New Jersey.

 Now, is there anything other than that? And

there's a lot of rhetoric, and there are all kinds of 

characterizations, but when I looked for facts, I found 

those three, and I want to be sure I have them all.

 MR. ROSS: You do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I do. Now, then my 

question following from that, if I have those are the 

three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of 

what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said. It 

said in worldwide markets this is a good thing. I think 

I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's 

cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese 

development, I'm worried about development everywhere. 

We have a lot of small businesses. And I'd worry -­

now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd 

worry about a rule of law that subjects every small 

business in every developing company -- in every 

developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50 

States simply because they agreed to sell to an 

independent company who is going to sell to America, 

plus your two factors.

 And really the third is none, because if it 

hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no 

accident.

concern here.

 MR. ROSS: I would say in -- in response to 

your hypothetical question, that because there was 

purposeful availment where they came to the United 

States, attended trade shows in an effort to sell their 

product to anyone who would come to that trade show 

throughout the United States, and those sales were in 

fact consummated, then in that case I think that the 

manufacturer has done more than just intend to sell. 

They have taken certain positive steps.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay, but you see 

what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that 

may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's 

going to work or develop if in fact every small business 

everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law 

of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here, 

rather than making the accident victim go there.

 Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but 

the other is also tough. So -- so that's -- that's sort 

of the -- I'm sketching out my concerns here. You -­

I thought because, in the hypothetical he 

created, it was they were availing themselves of the 

U.S. market because they were marketing. They went to 

seven trade shows. They did merely -- they did 

something more than the sale. So where's your -- what's 

your position?

 MR. ROSS: My position is exactly what Your 

Honor has just stated. They have to do something more 

than just sell. There has to be purposeful availment. 

There has to be some concrete action, attending trade 

shows, designing the product for the market.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What -- what difference does 

attending some trade shows in the United States mean -­

make? Suppose they're -- they didn't attend any trade 

shows. They just have a Web site that provides a 

description of the product.

 MR. ROSS: I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Would there be no 

jurisdiction then?

 MR. ROSS: Well, it depends on the Web site. 

But in my judgment, attending trade shows is a large 

factor that is unique in this case. As I pointed out in 

our briefs, they were -- they didn't just attend a trade 

show; they attended trade shows throughout the United 

States to sell this product.

JUSTICE ALITO: But not in New Jersey.

 MR. ROSS: Not in the State of New Jersey, 

but a lot of other places.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the New Jersey 

company that bought this machine find out about it?

 MR. ROSS: Well, Mr. Curcio, who was 

Mr. Nicastro's employer, went to one of these 

conventions, trade shows, in Las Vegas, where he saw the 

machine. And at that trade show the British 

manufacturer shared a booth with the -- its American 

distributor. And that's where Mr. Curcio, Mr. 

Nicastro's employer, saw the machine, and that's why he 

decided to buy it there.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What difference does 

it make that they go to a trade show somewhere other 

than New Jersey? We have the notion that they're 

availing themselves of the -- the entire United States 

market. That's -- I'll accept that.

 MR. ROSS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does the trade 

show in Nevada add to the jurisdictional ties to New 

Jersey?

 MR. ROSS: The difference for this case, 

precisely this case, is that we feel that under those 

circumstances there may have been minimum contacts, even

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With Nevada?

 MR. ROSS: With -- no, with New Jersey, 

because the British manufacturer was there. He was in a 

booth. A New Jersey person came to the booth and said 

that's a great machine. There was some kind of 

interaction. The record is unclear as to what it was,

selling its product -­

from New Jersey.

 MR. ROSS: It's more than -- it's more than

control of the British manufacturer, and there are

 MR. ROSS: He was -­

 MR. ROSS: He was prepared to sell to 

anyone. Whether it was from New Jersey or Massachusetts 

or Connecticut, it didn't matter as long as the sale was 

into the United States and the manufacturer got the 

economic benefit of it.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Ross, isn't the 

point that he was selling by using large convention 

sites in the United States, expecting that people from 

other States would show up to those large convention 

sites?

 I know that Justice Alito doesn't want to 

hear this, but New Jersey doesn't have all that many 

large convention sites like Las Vegas does. Newark -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Newark is not such a hot 

place, but they're expecting people from Newark to go

worker is over in New Jersey and comes back to his home 

in Montana, and he's been injured. Do they avail 

themselves of the market in Montana when there's no 

market for their products there?

injured by one of the machines somewhere else, but he's 

from Montana. Can he sue in Montana?

your theory to say that in areas where you don't expect 

to be haled into court because your machine is not going 

to be used, you can't be.

 What I'm trying to get at, obviously, is 

we're talking about the stream of commerce in the United 

States, but the stream doesn't wash over the United 

States evenly. The manufacturer, as I asked earlier, 

may decide I don't want to sell New Jersey.

 MR. ROSS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The manufacturer may 

reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in 

Montana because there's no scrap metal business in 

Montana. So I'm just trying to see if there are 

limitations to your theory about the stream of commerce 

covers everything.

 MR. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor. The answer is 

yes, there are limitations. There are those 

limitations, and I think the best way of -- of stating 

it would be if there is purposeful availment of entering 

a market and you sell the product into that market, you 

take these additional steps plus the intent, plus the

this -- this area of law has treated States as if 

they're foreign countries, in a certain way analogous

you said at one point, that if an independent company 

comes to a business, however small, in the United States 

and says give us some of your product, we're going to 

sell it everywhere in the world we can, fine. And they 

do.

 A couple go -- get into some very -- Burma 

or whatever, Myanmar. And right now, it's the law that 

consumers in all those countries sue in that country if 

they're hurt. Is that really the law? Is there 

something you can cite me to on that?

 MR. ROSS: Well, there are conventions. 

There's a Brussels convention and a Uganda convention.

does it say?

to my understanding, that where the -- where the tort

 MR. ROSS: That -- then in those cases, 

where the tort occurred there would be jurisdiction over 

the foreign manufacturer. For example, if there's an 

injury in Belgium and the machine is manufactured in 

Britain, someone is hurt in Belgium, according to those 

conventions, then the person in Belgium could sue the 

British company in Belgium.

machines, but the part then -- and then the facts are 

the same: It goes to the Ohio distributor and New 

Jersey, but the part is what causes the injury.

component manufacturer under those circumstances, unless 

the component manufacturer was deliberately 

manufacturing a product for sale into a State in the 

United States -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's like Justice 

Breyer's hypothetical. He wants to sell to the entire 

universe if he can.

 MR. ROSS: That's correct, but the 

manufacturer in your hypothetical did not purposefully 

avail itself of the United States market. He simply 

sold a component part.

than you do for the finished product manufacturer. The 

component manufacturer may well know to a certainty that 

his component is going to be used in a product that's 

sold in the United States.

a small component, a spring, a small part for a large 

machine like in the Asahi case, he may not -- he may 

have known. It's foreseeable that this product will go 

there, but -­

insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment,

seek the market. And -- and I understand that, on your

how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if 

the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only

blade did not specifically target the United States 

market. He -­

States can press several buttons on its computer and 

interact and make -- consummate the transaction, if you

 MR. ROSS: Yes, you can.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they don't even 

have to send the Web site to the United States? They 

just have to have a Web site?

 MR. ROSS: If it's an interactive Web site 

where you can sit in New Jersey, order a product, the 

product is then delivered by the foreign manufacturer 

into New Jersey, and the product then chops off four 

fingers of someone's hand -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it has to be 

interactive?

 MR. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor.

if it says, here, we're McIntyre -- on a Web site -- we

make these machines; give us a call at this number if 

you want to buy one?

 MR. ROSS: Not enough.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not enough?

 MR. ROSS: That's like a billboard. That's 

not enough. That's just a pure advertising; not enough. 

But if the additional steps that I just mentioned are 

taken and a sale occurs -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this distinction 

is somewhere in the Due Process Clause?

 MR. ROSS: I believe that the Due Process 

Clause requires the additional conduct. The purposeful 

availment, which is what we have in your hypothetical, 

and the actual transaction, the sale, then we have 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But was the sale here 

negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in 

Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer 

just was interested in the machine and then later 

contacted the Ohio distributor?

 MR. ROSS: In this case, the manufacturer 

said that they own the machines until they're paid for 

in full. The machine was not paid for in full.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I'm -- I'm trying to 

relate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical.

MR. ROSS: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Internet hypothetical 

where there's just an advertisement.

 MR. ROSS: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, at first, I thought 

you were saying that's sufficient. Now you say no, 

because they have to be part of the contract. I'm 

trying to make the Internet equivalent to the trade 

show.

 MR. ROSS: If the Internet Web site is 

interactive, so you can sit in New Jersey, order the 

product, complete the transaction, send money, and in 

response to the money coming, you get a product -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. But not just an 

advertisement?

 MR. ROSS: Not just an advertisement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though that's the 

cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues -­

pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the 

information on the Internet, but he phones the Ohio 

distributor?

 MR. ROSS: It's not enough, in my judgment,

Jersey can press buttons on his computer and complete 

the transaction with the result that the product comes 

to New Jersey, under those circumstances, I would say 

there is jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Complete? He's got 

to complete the transaction?

 MR. ROSS: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's -­

MR. ROSS: I don't -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you know, punch 

these numbers, and we will send you an application for a 

machine? Is that not enough, because he's got to 

complete the transaction?

 MR. ROSS: I would say, under those 

circumstances, that that's part of what the manufacturer 

requires, but the end result is that the machine winds 

up in New Jersey through this contact between the person 

and the manufacturer. Then I would say that would be 

enough for jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if they say 

fill this out, and contact this person, McIntyre, 

whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our 

machines -- that's enough?

 MR. ROSS: I would say, in that case, they

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR F. FERGENSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Justice Breyer, I would -- in response to 

your concern, I would ask you to look at page 29 of the 

States' amicus brief: "Ignorance of the fact that New 

Jersey is a State within our union, or of the specifics 

of New Jersey products liability law, should not allow 

Petitioner to avoid jurisdiction. Its own lack of 

research prior to embarking on a nationwide marketing 

campaign is no defense." I think that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- could I ask you a 

question?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Could you -­

just one quick point of clarification.

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a point that your 

adversary raised in passing. I'm not quite sure, do you 

sell outright to the American company? Do you ship a 

product and they pay you, or they only pay you when they 

receive the money from their customer? There appears to 

be some suggestion of the latter.

 MR. FERGENSON: And the New Jersey Supreme 

Court said that there was a suggestion that some trades 

could have been by consignment. I believe that that is 

outside of this -- taken out of this case by an 

admission in the brief -- at least for this sale -- in 

the brief in opposition to defendant's motion to 

dismiss, at 19-20, filed October 11th, 2006, where they 

state -- where Respondent states it was sold by us to 

MMA, and it was sold by MMA to Curcio Scrap Metal.

 So, there is no consignment. There's no 

consignment under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's a different 

question than I asked. There was no consignment on this

machine?

 MR. FERGENSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not claiming 

that there might not be on others?

 MR. FERGENSON: The evidence in the record 

under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted, I think can only be 

reasonably viewed -- and this Court obviously treats it 

as de novo, on a jurisdictional review -- can only be 

viewed as not a consignment because MMA was in the 

business of selling the products to others.

 Let me say that for the -- there was no 

interaction in the record with anyone from New Jersey by 

MMA or by J. McIntyre. It was the booth, and then there 

was an order. And if you look at the invoice, it says 

verbal order. There was an order by the son of the 

owner of Curcio Metal Works, and that's it. The order 

was fulfilled.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, Toyota, 

Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many 

millions of cars to the United States. They start 

blowing up here. They operate through independent 

distributors only. Can they be subject to jurisdiction 

in any of the States?

issue of this as a scheme. Most sophisticated 

distribution networks, such as the manufacturers you're 

talking about, there is -- there is recourse to remedies 

throughout the United States, whether against the
