CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 08-1402, Berghuis v. Smith. 

Mr. Restuccia. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

This is really a case about the law of 

habeas corpus for this murder conviction that was 

obtained in the Michigan courts. 

The issue was whether the Michigan Supreme 

Court unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme 

Court precedent in rejecting Mr. Smith's claim that 

his jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of 

the community. 

The Michigan Supreme Court did not act 

unreasonably in concluding that there was no 

unconstitutional underrepresentation and that there 

was no systematic exclusion. This Court's decision in 

Duren did not require a different result on either 

point, and this Court should reverse the Sixth 

Circuit. 

I think it's important to note that there

are two prongs at issue: The fair and reasonable 

representation prong and the systematic exclusion 

prong. And it’s also significant to understand that 

the disparities at issue here are relatively small, 

that the time period at issue runs from -- from April 

of 1993 to October of 1993, where there was 

information -- for those 6 months for which the 

processes at play were measured. 

And the percentage of African-Americans that 

appeared in the venires during that time period was --

they comprised 6 percent of the venires, where the 

jury-eligible population was 7.28 percent. So your --

so there was a 1.28 percent absolute disparity during 

this 6-month time period. That can also be measured 

as an 18 percent comparative disparity. 

Now, if you compare that to the disparities 

that are issue -- at issue in Duren, they really are a 

magnitude of difference, that the disparities in Duren 

involve the exclusion of women in Missouri, where they 

comprised -- women comprised 54 percent of the 

population and only 14.5 percent of the venires over 

an 8-month period of time. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The -- I don't know if this 

is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a 

course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School. I

was teaching, and they said the only way you could 

figure out what -- what's what here is you use 

something called “binomial theorem,” and you have to 

have, like, urns, and you imagine that there’s an urn 

with 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are 

black, and then you select them at random, and -- and 

12 at a time. You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred 

with 12 in each. 

And when we tried to do that, just for the 

interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect, 

with these numbers, something like a third to a half 

of juries would have at least one black person on it. 

Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a 

mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it 

looks as if there is a pretty big disparity. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: On the other hand, that 

isn't what they testified to, so I guess you’re going 

to tell me just ignore it and forget it. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, if you’re looking at 

the Michigan Supreme Court decision, I think it's 

important to note that it's not just that it would 

have to be incorrect; it would have to be objectively 

unreasonable under the AEDPA standard, that what’s at 

issue here is did the Michigan Supreme Court

the only way to do it, that the statistician stays

programs for. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I don't know, in other 

words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write 

something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't have any urns 

here. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. You can skip it, if 

you want. If there's any comment, fine. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think your point was 

that Duren was quite different in the numbers --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- starting out with 

women 54 percent of the population, and then dwindled 

to 14.5 percent of the -- of the jurors, available 

jurors. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess the point 

is, just following up, it's not that you’re going to 

say 2 plus 2 is 6. I suppose, under AEDPA, all you

have to do is say 2 plus 2 is somewhere between 3 and 

5, right? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. That it’s not 

unreasonable, and I think the best evidence of the 

fact that this decision was not unreasonable is I --

in the blue brief, I put together a table of what the 

other circuits have done with comparable statistical 

disparities. 

And it runs -- from the First Circuit 

through the Tenth Circuit, I have seven circuits' 

worth of opinions, and of course, there really are 

additional cases, if you examine this. And if you 

look at the kinds of disparities that have been 

examined by other courts on --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with this 

question that goes both to what Justice Ginsburg asked 

and the other? Should we treat all areas the same, 

depending -- say it's -- the disparity between a 

jurisdiction which has only 3 or 4 percent of a 

minority should be treated similarly to a jurisdiction 

where they have 30 or 40 percent? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, the -- in my view, 

this Court really didn't provide guidance in Duren 

about how this should be measured. In fact, Duren 

doesn't specify what kind of measurement tools should

be used for examining disparity. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it perfectly 

obvious that you’re going to have dramatic differences 

where you only have a very small percentage, as in --

in Grand Rapids, for example, and where you have a 

major percentage as you did in Duren. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think that's right. 

And that's one of the reasons that on direct review 

the courts are virtually unanimous in rejecting these 

kinds of small disparities. So if you look at the 

table on pages 32 and 33, the circuits, on direct 

review, that were most comparable were the Second 

Circuit decision in which the percentage of the 

distinct group in the community was 7.08 percent and 

in the jury pool it was 5.0 percent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I suppose the 

thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you 

have a very small population that we are concerned 

with, then the disparity can be very substantial, 

especially if you use the comparative disparity. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. At the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think -- at least, I 

was interested in that aspect of his question. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, as kind of the first 

matter, it seems like this Court doesn't have to

really reach that hard question, insofar as the 

Michigan Supreme Court's decision is entitled to 

deference under AEDPA, meaning --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but we have a half­

hour. I’d kind of like to know how to --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Okay. No, I understand. I 

understand. I just want to make that as kind of a 

first point. Now, for the second point, it seems to 

me that the absolute disparity test is the better 

measure for examining -- examining these questions. 

And the reason for that is that it objectively 

captures the number of missing jurors that are part of 

the venire, whereas the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but your test 

is 10 percent. And if you have a minority, what is it 

here? 7 point -- whatever it is. 7 --

MR. RESTUCCIA: 7.28. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's under 10 percent. 

That would mean that a district is free to just 

disregard all the people who are under 10 percent of 

the population. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: The 10 percent test is not 

really necessarily tied to the absolute disparity. In 

other words, this Court could conclude that the 

absolute disparity test is the better test without

using that 10 percent threshold. The reason I suggest 

the 10 percent threshold is that's really what's 

happening on the ground in the Federal courts. It's 

very hard to find a case in which there’s a --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You would suggest that 

in a population that has 9 percent of any group, 

protected group, that if they didn't have one person 

serve on a jury per year of that group, that that 

would not -- under an absolute disparity test using 

the 10 percent figure, that would not give rise to any 

kind of suspicion? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. Under -- if 

this Court adopted it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It would not meet the 

Duren's second prong. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. If the Court 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that make any sense 

to you? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: It reflects the actual 

practice of the courts because of the -- if you look 

at the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't think that 

-- that any court has suggested that the complete 

absence of the protected group in that kind of number

wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim. 

That's why this Court, the Michigan court, and many 

others have said that the absolute disparity test just 

can't be used in every circumstance. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, the -- it seems --

looking at what the Federal courts have done, they’ve 

all -- they’ve generally used multiple tests. Now, 

there are several circuits that have relied on this 10 

percent threshold, but it's not necessary for the 

State to prevail in order for this Court to adopt the 

10 percent threshold. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't. The question I 

have you for you is -- that's what you have been 

advocating, or at least your brief suggested we 

should. Wouldn't it be better for to us leave this in 

the hands of the courts to sort of figure out what 

test is better under what circumstances than us 

announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like 

the example that I just used? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I -- I understand that 

point. The reason that I'm suggesting a threshold 

also is it corresponds to a practical aspect of the 

application of these rules. The -- if you have a 

sufficiently small absolute disparity, as a matter of 

probability, it’s not likely to affect the actual

composition of the petit jury. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I agree that if a 

protected group is 1 percent of the population, that 

it’s not likely that their absence is going to give 

rise to any flags. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I think there is a 

difference. I don’t -- I just don't know 

statistically where. And we have to leave this in the 

judgment of the lower courts as to where between 1 and 

9 or 1 and 10 a difference makes sense. And that's 

what the courts are saying, is: We can't use one test 

to determine that. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well -- and one of the 

concerns I have is I -- for example, I know in Kent 

County that if you look at the other distinct groups ­

- you look at the 1990 census for Kent County, it was 

comprised of 2 point -- 2.9 percent Latino-Americans, 

1.1 percent Asian-Americans, and 0.6 percent Native 

Americans. 

Now, if you look at the one month that's 

been placed at issue, in which Mr. Smith is indicating 

that there was a 35 percent comparative disparity for 

that one month, if that becomes the threshold, the 

standard used, which the Sixth Circuit concluded was ­

- established a violation of the second prong, then if 

you think about the practical application that -- for 

Michigan, for Kent County, if you take your 158 jurors 

in that jury pool, you’d expect for that one month for 

there to be four or five Latino-Americans, two Asian-

Americans, and one Native American. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's wrong --

MR. RESTUCCIA: What’s missing -- I’m sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. What's wrong with a 

rule? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: What's wrong with what? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: With a rule? With picking 

a number, rather than leaving it up to the courts of 

appeals or the district courts to use different 

numbers, different times? I don't have to review all 

of these cases all the time. Why don't we pick a 

number? You want 10, right? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That what was I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --

MR. RESTUCCIA: That has been the practice 

of the courts below. That's why I'm -- I'm advocating 

it. But it does correspond to this idea that below a 

certain point, absolute disparity will have no 

practical -- for example, in this case, the venire at 

issue, according to the State trial court, included 60

prospective jurors, and there were three African-

Americans, which would then constitute 5 percent. 

Now, in order for that percentage to 

correspond exactly to the jury-eligible population, 

there would had to have been one or two more African-

American jurors as part of that venire. Well, as a 

matter of probability, if you have 12 being selected 

from 60 -- this is kind of your point, Justice Breyer 

-- that it's not -- it's more likely than not that 

would have no effect on the actual selection of the 

petit jury --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. The one 

thing I learned from the urn business is it never 

turns out the way you think. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: For example, it had the 

example of, like, the eight: There are eight out of a 

hundred, and you run this thing a thousand times, and 

you’ll discover that there is one black juror on about 

half the juries, or a third, anyway. That's much more 

than I would have thought intuitively. And I might 

not have even read the example correctly. So you see 

why I -- I’m at sea, as soon as you tell me to be a 

statistician. I even got a book called Statistician 

for Lawyers. That didn't help me very much.

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's 10,000 of 

these balls and you are going to go through it 10,000 

times, it's more likely that you are going to get a 

sample that reflects the overall percentage, correct? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that's right. One 

of the -- one of the reasons, also -- talking about 

this 10 percent as a rule -- is that if you look 

through these cases, you’ll see a lot of -- a lot of 

the courts, on direct review -- and I think -- I'm 

going to come back to this point, that this, of 

course, is an AEDPA case, so the question is whether 

the Michigan Supreme Court acted unreasonably. And so 

I think there’s a different standard, that it doesn't 

have to have gotten it right; it had to have been 

objectively unreasonable. 

But setting that aside, you’ll find many 

cases in which there are disparities of 5 percent and

7 percent which have been rejected. And the reason is 

you have neutral processes, processes that everyone 

would agree are reasonable on their face, which result 

in disparities for distinct groups. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying 

that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good 

faith, no intent to discriminate --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that systematic 

exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No. I'm making just the --

the opposite point, that under the third --

to answer, of course, but --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Please. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If not, how do we show 

systematic exclusion? Again, assuming good faith, no 

intent to discriminate. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: The Duren case involved a 

categorical distinction, meaning women were exempted 

in a different way than men. Women had an automatic 

exemption. This Court didn't delineate in Duren that 

if you had just a disparate impact based on a neutral

process, that that would be sufficient to give rise to 

systematic exclusion. And that's really been the way 

the Federal courts have applied it on direct review, 

that there --

JUSTICE ALITO: The statistical issue is 

very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not 

looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court 

should necessarily have to start with the question --

with the elements of the prima facie -- with the 

question of whether there is unconstitutional 

underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand 

Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of 

the jury selection process that has a disproportionate 

impact on the group involved and is unreasonable? And 

unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle 

with these statistics? 

Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the 

jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought 

was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing 

the jurors first for the district courts, the 

misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts, 

the -- the felony courts. But the -- the trial judge, 

it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very 

thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof 

that this old system had that effect.

And it's hard for me to see how it could 

have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors 

chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was 

disproportionate to the number chosen for the district 

courts in the other jurisdictions within the county. 

So that seems to me to be the end of the case. 

And why does it make sense to -- to struggle 

with this rather complicated statistical problem, if 

at the end of the day, it's going to come down to 

something of that nature? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that may be the 

easiest way to resolve this case, because under the 

third prong, the Michigan Supreme Court on the 

question of jury assignment concluded that Mr. Smith 

had failed to factually show that there was any 

underrepresentation that arose from that process. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't the Michigan 

Supreme Court do essentially what Justice Alito 

suggested, that they said: We’ll give you the benefit 

of the doubt, go on to the third. 

But on that third, it seems to me there’s 

nothing that shows us what was the representation in 

the district before they made the change vis-à-vis the 

circuit courts, was there?

Mr. Smith's expert provided is he -- he had -- there 

are two jury terms that were described, one for 6 

months, in which this juror assignment to the local 

courts first occurred, and then 1 year for the 

following year, in which the jury assignment did not 

send them to the local courts first. So you have two 

different pools that are being compared. 

The -- if you look at page 13 of the blue 

brief, it outlines what the disparity was according to 

Mr. Smith's expert for the time which the assignment 

to local courts occurred. And in that diagram, it 

shows, at the end, that there was an 18 percent 

comparative disparity. And that's the final column in 

the totals. 

Now, that's what occurred at the time of 

which the jury assignment to the local courts occurred 

first. The following year, the comparative disparity 

was 15 percent, where the -- where the jurors were not 

sent to local courts first. In other words, there was 

a difference of a 3 percent comparative disparity. 

Now, no one suggests that a 3 percent 

comparative disparity could -- could justify a claim 

of a violation of Duren. It's -- it's not 

statistically significant, because when you talk about 

3 percent comparative disparity or 4 percent

comparative disparity, you are talking about two or 

three jurors over the entire time period --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that's in the --

in the circuit court. Do we know what the figures 

were just for the district court? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No. There -- there was no 

information -- the reason -- the Michigan Supreme 

Court ultimately rejected the claim on the jury 

assignment process because there was no evidence other 

than anecdotal testimony about how sending jurors to 

local courts would result in a deficiency of African-

Americans in the circuit court or the felony court --

courts. So that was the basis. 

They -- so in a way, this touches on Wood v. 

Allen. It was a factual determination, whether it’s 

under 2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1). The Michigan Supreme 

Court's conclusion that Mr. Smith had failed to show 

factually that there was any underrepresentation that 

arose from the jury assignment process is entitled 

deference. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it possible --

it's awfully hard to get these percentages when you 

get small numbers, as you do. But doesn't it seem 

intuitively obvious that if you give the district 

courts first crack of -- of the size of the pool that

it than the other, that it's -- it's bound to have an 

impact? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No. There’s -- there’s no 

logical necessity that sending courts -- because you 

understand that you have the entire county, and the 

county is then broken up into districts? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: And the districts are the 

local courts, and they are misdemeanor courts. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but there’s a much 

higher percentage of African-Americans in Grand Rapids 

than there is in the county as a whole. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. But all those 

other outlying areas also have to send their jurors to 

the district court first, too. It's not like it's 

just one segment gets sent to the district court. All 

of the jurors get sent to the district courts first. 

The only -- the -- the proof required to show that 

somehow the district court for Grand Rapids went 

through more jurors than did the other local courts 

proportionately --

served on the district court, were they -- were they

Rockford, all of these small municipalities -- drew 

from the circuit court pool. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the district court 

jurors could -- could include as many jurors who are 

not from Grand Rapids as they could from Grand Rapids? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Exactly.

I'm confused. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That’s all right.

Grand Rapids people back? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: It does take Grand Rapids 

people, that's right. That’s how it happens. You’re 

drawing from the entire county. 

I'm sorry if I -- if I've -- if I've stated 

it in a way that's misleading. I apologize.

court. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: It all depends on the local 

courts and their usage of jurors. If -- if Grand 

Rapids actually required fewer jurors, it would -- it 

would result in a larger number of African-Americans 

being present on the circuit court. 

The whole concept underlying the claim that 

-- that this had a disproportionate effect is the idea 

that Grand Rapids must have needed proportionately 

more jurors than the other local courts might. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, is there anybody 

who said whether -- if all -- they all take their 

jurors first, the districts, and Grand Rapids uses a 

higher percentage of jurors. So now there -- and they 

have more of the black jurors, so that there are fewer 

left over --

MR. RESTUCCIA: That would be the argument. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That could be. Now, is 

there any -- in this record, does anybody say whether 

that's okay or not? I mean, to -- to have people 

serve jury duty near where they live or nearer where 

they live, on its face, is not so bad. Did -- did 

anybody say whether this is good or bad?

testimony whether it was good or bad. The -- the 

anecdotal information was that it -- it took African-

American jurors out of the larger pool. The anecdotal 

information from the court administrator was: We were 

afraid this process was draining -- “siphoning” was 

the language -- siphoning jurors from the circuit 

court.

not in effect, and if Grand Rapids had to take white 

jurors from other counties as opposed to a larger 

percentage of black jurors from Grand Rapids, then 

you’d have a claim in Grand Rapids, wouldn't you? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: It would create a problem in 

Grand Rapids. That's right.

Smith is a very small correlation. I mean, you’re

it's routine and it's predictable and it's constant, 

isn't that always due to systematic exclusion? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: And that's the argument 

being raised by Mr. Smith. No, I think the answer is 

no. And the reason I say that is this: You have --

the Federal courts, on direct review, have looked at 

voter registration and challenges to voter 

registration. Voter registration may have a disparate 

-- or affect distinct groups differently. 

In the same way that the Second and Tenth 

Circuit have looked at cases where they failed to 

follow up on non-returns, that -- if you don't follow 

up on non-returns, it may affect distinct groups 

differently. The analysis of the Federal courts on 

that issue has been that the decisions to exempt 

yourself from jury service or the failure to respond

to an invitation for jury service is outside the 

system. Even if it occurs regularly and is 

persistent, it's still not inherent in the process. 

That's what the Michigan Supreme Court said 

here about the excuses for hardship and transportation 

-- for the excuses. But it's also true that the 

process by which you select jurors in district courts 

is not something that is a systematic exclusion of 

anyone. It's -- on its face, it is neutral, and if 

you -- if this Court concludes that neutral practices 

like sending out -- using a certain body, whether 

voter registration or if it's driver's licenses and 

Michigan identification cards, or not following up on 

non-returns, or allowing excuses for hardship, or --

or assigning jurors to a district court first, if that 

is -- can result in systematic exclusion, what's going 

to happen is that all these neutral processes that 

Michigan has may result in disparities. 

And so, as it stands now, Kent County 

doesn't identify the race and ethnicity of all of its 

jurors. Well, it's going to have to if it's going to 

have to have this perfect correspondence of the jury­

eligible population. It will no longer have this kind 

of blind neutrality --

systematic doesn't mean that the defendant wins. It 

just means that the State has to -- has to justify the 

-- the mechanism that's causing -- that's causing this 

-- this situation. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's true. There is --

there is then the rebuttal. But then what happens is 

you are subject to these challenges. The question is: 

Does the court -- does the State ever wish -- ever 

wish to be in a position of having to be subject to 

the challenge? 

But -- but I think I want to come back to --

one of the prevailing points of all of this is that 

this is also the Michigan Supreme Court. There’s no 

question that it had reached the merits and was 

entitled to AEDPA deference. And the -- the question 

was: Was there adequate guidance to the State of 

Michigan to know that this was both systematic -- that 

this was systematic exclusion and inherent in the 

process? And Duren was not clear on that point. 

The -- the analysis of the Michigan courts 

really corresponds quite closely to what the Federal 

courts have done, so it cannot be objectively 

unreasonable. And if there --

it happens in Grand Rapids, that's every minority. 

The Petitioner's goal is to have this Court enshrine 

into law a rule that the two situations are exactly 

the same. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you had a 

community with one African-American, your argument 

would be the same, if that's the disparity? That 

means every -- every minority is left off the jury. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I think that certainly 

if you adopt the Petitioner's test for 60 percent of 

the country, Duren would not apply regarding African-

Americans; 90 percent of the country, wouldn't apply 

to Hispanics; and Duren protections would never apply 

to Native Americans anywhere. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I'm -- I 

guess I’m echoing Justice Stevens’s question of 

whether or not this type of statistical analysis 

really works when you’re dealing with relatively small 

numbers. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I would make this 

observation: That in Duren v. Missouri, on page 366, 

the Court stated, "His undisputed demonstration that a 

large discrepancy occurred, not just occasionally, but 

in every weekly venire for a period of nearly a year, 

manifestly indicates that the cause of the

representation was systematic -- that is, inherent in 

the particular jury selection process utilized." 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but there you were 

dealing with an express exemption. There was an 

exemption for a woman, and also in the record was that 

the jury clerk was sending out notices saying: Women, 

if you do not wish to serve, return the summons to the 

judge named on the reverse side as quickly as 

possible. And then, further -- systematic -- if the 

card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was 

not returned, it was automatically assumed that she 

did not wish to serve. There was no follow-up. 

So there was all kinds of evidence of 

systematic problems in Duren that are not present 

here. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, first of all, that's 

completely correct; however, the rule in Duren, the 

U.S. Supreme Court stated that the numbers alone prove 

systematic. Then the Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the Court say 

that? 

MR. LAWRENCE: On page 366. And then in --

the Court went on to say that the State is arguing 

that there's various neutral, benign reasons for the 

underrepresentation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You -- if that 

statement is true, then -- then there is -- there’s no 

third part to the three-part test. I thought Duren 

established a three-part test. 

MR. LAWRENCE: It did. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the third one was that 

you had to establish -- after having already 

established the disparity, you had to establish that 

there was a selection process which caused the 

disparity. And you are telling us that you don't have 

to proceed to step 3. Once you show the disparity, it 

is assumed that it is the product of the system. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, Justice Scalia, my 

reading of Duren does indeed include that third test, 

but the problem is, is that Duren puts the burden of 

proof on that test on the State. They said at pages 

368 to 369 that the State is claiming there were all 

sorts of neutral, legitimate reasons for the 

underrepresentation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, that was after --

that was after showing the systematic factors. It was 

the plaintiff's burden -- or the defendant in the 

case, Duren -- burden to show there was a systematic 

factor. That was the automatic exception for a woman 

and how it worked in practice. After all of that,

then Justice White tells us, the State could still 

come back and say yes, that's true, but there were 

other reasons why women didn't show up. Maybe they 

were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were 

involved with child care. 

That's what -- that's what Duren said, that 

the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's 

burden, and then the State could justify why the 

numbers came out that way. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, we did show a number of 

systematic factors, but if you look at Duren itself, 

on page 366 it says, the numbers alone proved it. On 

-- further on 366, they stated that Duren --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you reconcile that 

with the third test? Please tell me how you reconcile 

that statement with the fact that it did set forth a 

three -- a three-prong test. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I believe that we met 

the three-prong test, but I feel that it is an error 

in reading Duren to say anything other than that: The 

State must show how this came about, not the 

defendant.

obligation to go through every factor that may cause 

the disparity and justify every one? Or is it the 

defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the 

selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the 

disparity? Then once the defendant identifies that, 

then the State can show if it -- can try to show that 

there's a good reason for it. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I would read one 

sentence from Duren, if I could: "Assuming, arguendo, 

that the exemptions mentioned by the court below would 

justify failure to achieve a fair community cross­

section on jury venires, the State must demonstrate 

that these exemptions caused the underrepresentation 

complained of."

have overlooked that important principle.

siphoning theory to depend upon Grand Rapids drawing a 

disproportionate number of jurors from the pool? 

MR. LAWRENCE: That is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That results in 

fewer minorities going up to the county court, right? 

MR. LAWRENCE: That's right. Because those 

jurors that were pulled out for district court, many 

of them did not serve in district court. The majority 

did not, but they were still removed from --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Removed from the 

county --

MR. LAWRENCE: -- from the overall pool. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where in 

the record is it established that Grand Rapids had a 

disproportionate need for jurors from the pool? 

MR. LAWRENCE: I don't believe either side 

established that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's -- if 

your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing a 

disproportionate number and it is not in the record 

that Grand Rapids drew a disproportionate number, I 

think that means you lose. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I would respectfully 

disagree with the Court because it is not necessary, 

in our view, that each specific item that led to

underrepresentation be, itself, something that's 

unconstitutional, but rather, the collective nature of 

it, that 15 out of 17 months persistently and 

repeatedly came up with substantial 

underrepresentation. You are talking about 34.8 

percent here. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But that's the only factor 

that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was 

this -- was this siphoning system. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I feel that --

JUSTICE ALITO: It rejected everything else, 

didn't it? 

MR. LAWRENCE: I feel that there are a 

number of factors. I suppose that we could do it on 

the basis of height and then be surprised when there's 

fewer women on the jury. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, why is it -- I’m just 

not clear in my mind. Why is this siphoning bad? My 

impression, which may be wrong, is you -- you have a 

thousand people in the room, let's say, and if you let 

the district courts choose first, people will serve 

nearer where they live. 

Now -- and so most of them would rather 

serve nearer where they live. And the result of that 

could be, for the reasons that were stated, that then

there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors 

that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about 

the merits of that. 

I mean, I see a negative, and I see a 

positive. So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously 

bad, nor is it obviously good. So what should I do? 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, the record showed --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 

MR. LAWRENCE: -- that the people who were 

actually showing up for the jury panels at circuit 

court were very heavily overrepresented in the rural 

areas of Kent County and heavily underrepresented --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but -- but that's 

just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Right. Well, I guess --

JUSTICE BREYER: The problem we're seeing is 

that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization 

rate and they have a higher minority population, then 

you will end up with the leftover juries having a 

lower minority population. 

Now, the explanation for that is that you 

choose the district judges -- you choose the district 

jurors first. My question to you is: I -- if you're 

just a -- I'm not instructed in this area. If you 

were just to tell me, what do I think of that, I would

I think you have fewer minorities, that's 

true, but people get to serve closer to home. Now --

now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this? 

MR. LAWRENCE: Yes. Well, first of all, 

Grand Rapids has several district courts, and the 

largest one is the district court for the city of 

Grand Rapids. And as one would predict, the judicial 

business of a large city is certainly going to be more 

extensive than the judicial business in rural areas. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course. Of 

course, but we have to look at this on a proportional 

basis, right? Grand Rapids is also sending a higher 

number of jurors to the pool than -- than the small 

rural county. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your theory 

depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a 

proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent 

and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon 

Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and 

drawing 40 percent. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I guess I would simply 

say that the court administrator testified and the 

district judge found that they had substantial

underrepresentation that was very noticeable, very 

visible, a severe problem, and after my client's 

trial, they -- they concluded that the best way of 

dealing with this was to end the siphoning process, 

which they did. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, what -- what did 

it result in? It resulted over a 6-month period and a 

difference between 18 percent underrepresentation and 

15 percent. And your adversary says that's not 

statistically meaningful difference, that 3 percent, 

because it only takes a difference of a couple of 

people to change it from 18 to 15. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's -- what's 

unreasonable about that argument? 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I have two answers to 

that. The first one being that what -- one thing that 

was eliminated was the spikes, like we had in my 

client's month, 34.8, even though the average 

underrepresentation was only 18.1. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't -- you are 

comparing apples and oranges, because your pre-spike 

was over a year and your post-spike was over 6 months. 

We don't know what would have happened -- or didn't 

have statistics of a year or longer.

MR. LAWRENCE: Okay. Well, in the case of 

Duren, you’re talking about -- they had a 10-month 

period that was involved, but as for the numbers being 

small, I can only refer you to cases that I very much 

disagree with -- United States v. Sanchez-Lopez, cited 

in my brief, where Hispanics comprised 5.59 percent of 

the southern district of Idaho -- and the court 

basically said: Since that's less than 10 percent, 

who cares if there are Hispanics on the juries? The 

same in United States --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I wouldn't say that, 

but I still haven't -- I will try again. Forget the 

cases. 

As I’m hearing this, all I’m hearing is: 

Well, if you let the -- if you say that the wider area 

should choose first, you will get a higher number of 

minorities, but very tiny number; I mean a very small 

addition, one or two people. And if you do it the way 

they’re doing it, you'll lose those one or two people, 

but you will let people serve closer to home. 

So I just think -- as a person, not as a 

judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a 

judge -- but I mean, I’d say, well, it doesn't sound 

like much of a big deal. And -- and I do see an 

advantage in this, of the way they are doing it, so,

now, you tell me what's -- what's wrong with that? 

MR. LAWRENCE: Okay. Well, first of all, 

Kent County is not really that big. It's -- anybody 

can drive from the farthest end of the county to 

downtown Grand Rapids in approximately 20 to 30 

minutes. It wouldn't be that difficult to get there. 

I bet members of this Court have a longer commute. 

But, more importantly, the -- the fact that 

you're only talking about 25 people out of 2,250 

people simply means that the problem will be easy for 

court administrators to solve, if they have an 

incentive to do it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that? Don't 

those people then have to become professional jurors? 

They have to serve on every jury, or you’re going to 

have the disproportion that the statistics show. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, the statistics showed, 

for example, that African-Americans had a much higher 

rate of not having an automobile. And so if you say, 

well, if you have trouble getting a ride, you could 

tell somebody, come on down anyway; or you can say, 

that's all right, take the day off. 

And if African Americans have a very 

substantial higher rate of single-parent households, 

well, then, of course, it's going to be harder to get

a babysitter. Now, you can tell those people, well, 

that's okay, stay home; or you can say, try to get 

down here anyway. 

And the court -- and if somebody simply 

didn't show up, statistics have shown, in the brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I stop you there for 

a moment? Because one of the things that was in the 

Duren opinion was that a child care excuse would be 

okay. I think Justice White said at the end, now, I'm 

not touching the typical hardship excuses, and one of 

them was child care, and that is -- certainly, in the 

early '70s, was going to disproportionately affect 

women. You have far fewer women if you give a child 

care exemption. 

MR. LAWRENCE: No doubt that that's true, 

and I am not saying that it is wrong to give real 

hardship exemptions. Here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- he wasn't 

talking about individual cases. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, in this case, one of 

the things that happened is that, if somebody didn't ­

- simply didn't show up, that's it. Now, judges --

the court administrator said, yes, we tried. The 

judges would issue orders to show cause, but the 

police department made a decision that they were not

going to have anything to do with the serving or 

participation in these orders to show cause, orders to 

show up. 

And isn't that police department decision 

part of the system? It is systematic. When the 

police --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just --

MR. LAWRENCE: -- tell the courts what to 

do, shouldn't the courts tell the police what to do? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me make sure I 

understand your position. Assume that there is an --

an identifiable disparity of 2 percent or 3 percent, 

or whatever it might be to get to the threshold of 

being significant, that’s entirely caused by the fact 

that the members of the minority have personal excuses 

that justify non-service. What do you do with that 

case? Do you find that it was -- it’s 

unconstitutional, or don't you? 

MR. LAWRENCE: If you find that it is 

persistent, month in and month out --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is. It's assuming --

MR. LAWRENCE: -- then you have a problem 

because society benefits when jurors are drawn from 

the broadest spectrum of the system.

Society benefits because -- if you make them serve; 

the society benefits if you grant the excuses, too. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, overall, there's 

nothing wrong with granting excuses for genuine 

hardship; however, when you have this factor and 

factor 2 and factor 3 and factor 4, and they 

persistently come up with all-white juries, that's 

what Richard Hillary testified to, 98 percent of the

Is there a Federal district court that would be

me; and they say, no, you have to find some way of

decided, no, we’re not going to have anything to do 

with that. 

And I feel that that's part of the system 

because the police are part of the system. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Sterling, I don't --

you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you 

have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the 

pool a disproportionate number of people. 

Why -- why do you have to prove that? If 

Grand Rapids contributes to the pool an inordinate, 

disproportionate number of the minority -- blacks in 

this case -- even if Grand Rapids simply took back a 

proportionate number from the pool, it would still 

have a disproportionate effect on reducing the number 

of blacks in the overall pool, wouldn't it? 

MR. LAWRENCE: In order to solve this 

problem, all that Kent County would have to do is to, 

if you take people to district court, put back the 

ones that aren't being used. That would certainly 

help, but, instead, they take an excess number, like 

any court does, but the excess people are totally 

removed from the system.

Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right? Because 

the idea is, if Grand Rapids sends up a pool that’s 30 

percent minority and if it takes back the same number 

as everybody else, it's going to get -- the county is 

going to get the same proportion. 

It's only when they take back more. They 

have the more heavily African-American pool, and they 

are going to draw from it more than everybody else is 

drawing from theirs, so there will be fewer African-

Americans to go to the county. 

MR. LAWRENCE: That is what's happening, but 

I don't believe --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have no 

evidence that Grand Rapids takes back more than its 

share, proportionally, than anybody else. 

MR. LAWRENCE: We know that the -- as soon 

as they stopped doing it, this created a substantial 

increase in the number of African-Americans on the 

juries, and I think that that’s --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At the county level?

the time, it was said, we have two or three African-

Americans within this group, that was either 60 or 

100. 

And I'm sorry that the record is less clear, 

but even if it is 3 out of 60, you’re talking about 5

American, what would the percentage be? Pretty close

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to your 

point about -- that there was a big change when the 

draw came from the circuit first, before the 

districts. I thought it was agreed that, before, 

there was an 18 percent, on average, comparative 

difference and, after, 15 percent. That doesn't sound 

like a big change. 

MR. LAWRENCE: But it's a step in the right 

direction, and what we want to do is we want to 

promote more minority participation on jurors --

juries, instead of creating a rule that tells court 

administrators all over the country, the heat's off, 

you don't have to do anything. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But a step -- a step in the 

right direction is not enough. You were adducing that 

to prove that the prior system had a significant 

effect, and it turned out, it didn't have a very 

significant effect. It doesn't prove your point to 

say, well, it's a step in the right direction. 

If it's insignificant, it's insignificant. 

Whether it's insignificant in the right direction or

and Duren says they have to show what caused the 

underrepresentation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I still don't -- I don't 

understand this problem of -- of you have to show that 

they took back more than they contributed. 

Let's assume that Grand Rapids is -- is 

entirely black, and its entire delegation that goes to 

the pool are all black, okay? And let's assume that 

those blacks are 10 percent of the -- the totality, 

and there are no blacks from anywhere else, okay? 

Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of 

people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10 

percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the 

blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents. 

All of the other districts would thereby 

have zero percent blacks instead of 10 percent, which 

is what they ought to have. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Each district, the jurors are 

acquired from that district --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 

MR. LAWRENCE: -- and the circuit is 

acquired from all the districts of the county.

there’s a requirement for each district to have 10 

percent blacks, right? But if Grand Rapids takes back 

its -- its -- the people it sent, there are no more 

blacks left to go around. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I don't expect those 

outlying districts to have more -- a larger percentage 

of blacks than the population; I'm only expecting that 

from the county. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that the case --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what if --

Rapids uses a disproportionate number of jurors in its 

district courts, then you are going to have this 

problem -- the only way to fix the problem would be to 

have a separate jury system for the district courts. 

If you have the -- the circuit courts going first, 

then the people in the district courts are going to 

have the problem that you identify. 

If you have a system in which it's all done 

randomly -- circuit court, district court -- the 

people who come toward the end are going to have the 

problem. So I don't see any way out of this, if in

having a separate selection process for the district 

courts. Is that what you think is necessary? 

MR. LAWRENCE: I think that we should allow 

a great deal of flexibility to local court 

administrators. As I mentioned in the brief, in the 

Parents Involved in Community Schools case, there was 

a discussion in the concurrence by Justice Kennedy 

about exactly what local governments --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So is --

MR. LAWRENCE: -- can do to -- to get an 

appropriate representation of minorities without using 

racial classifications. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a question of 

what was permitted. Here you’re trying to say this is 

required. The school’s case was, these are measures 

the district could take if it wanted to. But you are 

saying these are measures the district must take 

because the Constitution requires it. They are quite 

different settings. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, I admit that it is a 

different setting. However, I feel -- well, no, I 

won't say “I feel.” Duren holds that there must be a 

reasonable connection between the African-Americans 

that appear on the jury arrays and the population as a 

whole.

JUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- the more 

I listen, the more I think you think there are a lot 

of things people could do. They could send three 

letters; they could explain in the letters why it's 

important to come; they could try reversing the thing 

a little bit with the districts first or not first --

all kinds of things. 

But what -- but now you’re forcing them into 

this legal rubric. So what about a decision, which 

you wouldn’t like, probably, but it would say we can't 

say that they’re unreasonable in respect to not having 

all of these, but there -- who knows? You know, when 

they get around and others try them, et cetera. 

In other words, unreasonable/reasonable is 

one standard, and ambiguity plays a -- a role here, 

too, that might be helpful. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Well, you are certainly 

correct, and I would simply say that the people of 

Grand Rapids looked up at the juries; 98 percent of 

the time they saw nothing but white faces. I think 

that Duren requires that the local system do something 

about it. There's a lot of options. So you should 

give them flexibility. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. LAWRENCE: Thank you, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Restuccia, you 

have 2 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA, 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I just have two brief 

points. One is that -- I want to just remind the 

Court that this is a case under AEDPA review, so that 

the Michigan Supreme Court has to be not just 

incorrect; it has to be objectively unreasonable. 

And its conclusion, I think probably the 

easiest analysis here is the conclusion that there was 

no showing of systemic exclusion, because Mr. Smith 

failed to show that there was any underrepresentation 

that arose from the jury assignment process, is 

probably one of the strongest points, because if you 

look at the 3 percent comparative disparity, that's 

less than half of 1 percent absolute disparity. No 

one claims that that’s statistically significant. 

So I think whether it's reviewed under 

2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1), this Court should reverse. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
