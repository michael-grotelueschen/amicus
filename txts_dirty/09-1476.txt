 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-1476, The Borough 

of Duryea v. Guarnieri.

 Mr. Ortiz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ORTIZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In asking this Court to cabin Connick v. 

Myers' public concern requirement, Respondent would 

constitutionalize, under the Petition Clause, large 

parts of the law of public employee discipline, and 

thereby grant to public employees a broad constitutional 

employment right that private employees do not enjoy. 

Two independent reasons, however, argue strongly for 

applying the public concern requirement to discipline 

claims brought both under the Free Speech and the 

Petition Clauses.

 First, the constitutional framework 

principles this Court has repeatedly identified in its 

public employment cases argue strongly for requiring it. 

And second, McDonald v. Smith's principle of parity 

argues strongly for creating no hierarchy between the

Free Speech and Petition Clauses.

 When -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You agree that the Petition 

Clause is -- is different and does have a separate 

content?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, we agree that the 

Petition Clause -- that when the Petition Clause and the 

Free Speech Clause cover the same activity, they 

apply -- they cover it under McDonald in the same way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the Speech Clause, in 

the employment context, has been interpreted to cover 

the content. Whether it -- whether it applies or not 

depends upon the content, right?

 MR. ORTIZ: One part of that inquiry turns 

on the content.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you want the Petition 

Clause also to turn on the content?

 MR. ORTIZ: Part of the inquiry, yes, Your 

Honor, should turn on the content.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it seems to me you're 

either petitioning the government or you're not 

petitioning the government. Why -- why shouldn't the 

line be, if you're petitioning the government as 

employer is different from petitioning the government as 

ruler? Why shouldn't that be the line that we draw?

MR. ORTIZ: Well, the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which wouldn't necessarily 

break out the same way as whether it's a matter of 

private concern versus a matter of public concern.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, this -- under the 

constitutional background principles this Court has 

developed, this Court should look at -- looks at how 

close to the core a particular example of employee 

activity is, and then talks about how much of a burden 

that kind of activity poses to the efficient operation 

of the workplace.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the core -- the core of 

the Petition Clause is petitioning. The core of the 

Free Speech Clause is political speech, of course -­

speech in public interest -- but the core of the 

Petition Clause is quite different. It's simply whether 

you're petitioning. Surely you -- you could petition 

the -- most of the petitions in the early years were 

regarding private matters; isn't that right?

 MR. ORTIZ: That is right, Your Honor, just 

as most examples of speech concern private matters, too. 

Yet that does not define the core of the Free Speech 

Clause. There's not an empirical inquiry. That depends 

upon the purpose of the clause. And as this Court 

stated very definitely in McDonald, the core of the

Petition Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, was -- was 

aimed at promoting democratic self-government.

 Petitioning is a particular form of speech. 

It is speech directed to a particular audience, the 

government, some arm of government, some individual in 

government, and it is speech that has a particular 

purpose: Asking for a change of some sort in government 

policy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, and it seems 

to me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking 

for a change. And it seems to me that the key 

distinction, if there is one, is whether you're asking 

for a change in -- by your employer in your employment 

conditions or a change by the government in some matters 

over which the government has control as -- as 

sovereign.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, in practice, 

that inquiry would not align much differently than the 

Connick inquiry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It may well be, may well 

be.

 MR. ORTIZ: And in this particular case, 

designing a kind of threshold inquiry along those lines 

would actually advantage Petitioners.

 One difficulty in application, though, is

that this Court has always identified the purpose of the 

Connick threshold test as categoricalizing in a way the 

Pickering balancing inquiry. And if you had a threshold 

test that basically did not match, was a little oblique 

to the Pickering balancing inquiry, it would create much 

more work for the lower courts along the way. Or 

perhaps this Court would want to change the Pickering 

balancing inquiry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would they have to do both? 

Would they have to do both?

 MR. ORTIZ: They might well, Your Honor. If 

the Pickering balancing inquiry still aligns with the 

traditional framework that this Court has described in 

its employment cases, what I describe, and this other 

inquiry, which you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, was 

somewhat oblique to it, then it might conceivably be 

necessary to do both. One -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you're proceeding with a 

claim under two separate provisions of the Constitution, 

it should not be surprising that you might have two 

different tests.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, then that 

might argue for more reengineering of the rest of the -­

the enterprise as well, a step that this Court has not 

identified as appropriate under -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would it make -- why 

would it make a difference at what you call the 

balancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction 

is between public speech and private speech on the one 

hand or government as employer and government as 

sovereign on the other? Why would there be any 

difference?

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if at the 

first stage the Court is running an inquiry that is 

something different from Connick, that is not going to 

map onto traditional Pickering balancing, at least as 

this Court has described it, at the second stage.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?

 MR. ORTIZ: Because, Your Honor, Pickering 

balancing has gone to things like how -- how -- how 

important that particular example of speech is, how 

close it is to the core of what the First Amendment 

protects, and then that is weighed against the kind of 

burden it would place on the government to have that 

activity protected in a very strong way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think all you're saying 

is that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is 

the element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I 

suggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in 

Pickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what

the individual was asking for a change in employment 

conditions? That would be one of the questions. If so, 

it was a private matter, and then you go on to the rest 

of the balancing.

 But it seems to me you have to make that 

determination under Pickering balancing anyway, and once 

you make it, you've answered the -- the Petition Clause 

question.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if this -- if 

this Court were to proceed down that road, Petitioners, 

I believe, would still end up victorious. This is a 

case, as I understand your -- your approach, where the 

petition does concern purely employment matters. It is 

not a petition aimed at or directed at the government in 

its capacity as sovereign, so under that kind of 

analysis, that is where the initial trigger, this case, 

would have not been constitutionalized.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What kind of case, 

hypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a 

petitioning case to the sovereign? Would a claim of 

retaliation because of a termination based on race 

qualify?

 MR. ORTIZ: It would depend upon the 

particular claims involved, or statements in the 

petition. If it were a statement that there was a

policy, involved a petition against a policy in a 

government department involving race, that would 

certainly qualify. That would be like the Gibbons case 

under the Free Speech Clause, Your Honor.

 If, however, it were a one-off allegation 

that a particular, say, low-level governmental 

supervisor had engaged in a form of discriminatory 

activity -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that get to 

the -- to the merits of the case? You have to from -­

you can't invite a question as to whether the sovereign 

is responsible until you litigate the issue.

 So what is the -- addressing Justice 

Scalia's question to you, what would qualify as a 

petition to the employer as opposed to a petition to the 

sovereign and why?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, a petition to the 

employer about changing the hours of employment -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are clear cases.

 MR. ORTIZ: -- for overtime -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was asking the flip.

 MR. ORTIZ: The flip. A petition, a 

complaint to an employer about the employer's pervasive 

or apparently pervasive policies in violation of the 

law, would certainly qualify as something to -- a

petition to the sovereign.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you have to 

wrestle with the same problem if you apply the other 

test that you -- you were proposing.

 MR. ORTIZ: For sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Namely, whether it's a 

private matter or a matter of public concern. You 

confront the same difficulty, don't you?

 MR. ORTIZ: You certainly do, Your Honor, 

and presumably this Court would look at some of the same 

factors involved there: The form, the content, and the 

context of the communication. All of those things are 

relevant. This Court has admitted that that inquiry is 

sometimes messy, that there are some -- many cases where 

the line of distinction is not clear. But it is -- this 

Court has not hesitated to apply that test because of 

its importance to the public employment environment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, you're not 

drawing any line depending on the branch of government, 

in other words, executive, legislature. Those are 

certainly branches of government to which one can 

petition. But access to court you agree comes within 

the Petition Clause?

 MR. ORTIZ: A lawsuit, pursuing a lawsuit, 

is definitely a form of petitioning activity, Your

Honor. Petitioners do not contest that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- this as 

I understand it, came up originally as arbitration under 

the -- wasn't it under the collective bargaining 

contract?

 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor, that is the 

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that count also, 

because it is a mechanism set up by a government 

employer?

 MR. ORTIZ: It would qualify under the 

original conception of what a petition is all about that 

was in this case. It is Petitioner's view that it would 

not qualify under the access to courts definition or 

conception of petition that Respondent has developed 

since the case was first before the district court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if lawsuits are 

covered by the Petition Clause, why is it that in the 

innumerable cases this Court has had concerning what due 

process of law consists of, we've never mentioned what 

the Petition Clause requires. I mean, if the Petition 

Clause guarantees access to the courts, certainly there 

are some minimum requirements that it imposes as well, 

and I don't recall any of our cases dealing with 

lawsuits that mention the Petition Clause. That's

rather extraordinary if indeed it governs all lawsuits.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, that might be 

explained by the fact that the Due Process Clause has 

been interpreted more robustly and supplies a certain 

floor of constitutional protection for lawsuits. And 

the Petition Clause, since it is directed at petitions 

generally and in particular the framers, the evidence 

is, had in mind not petitions to the courts, but 

petitions to the legislature, if lawsuits -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's all they had 

in mind, or petitions to the executive as well. What -­

what evidence do you have that it applied to lawsuits?

 MR. ORTIZ: The evidence is that developed 

by Professor Andrews, and the argument is a somewhat 

slender one that goes as follows: At the time of 

founding, Congress was the central sort of clearinghouse 

for petitions and handled both what we think of as the 

stereotypical paradigmatic petitions, pleas to Congress 

to sort of change the law, and also handled a lot of 

private bills. Over time, Congress handed over much of 

the responsibility for handling the things that came 

through private bills to the courts, and so to the 

extent -- this is Respondent's argument -- that the 

courts handled, took over those things, the lawsuits are 

protected.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with you that 

that's slender.

 MR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are not 

challenging that, as I understand.

 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. In the district 

court it was conceded that the grievance activity would 

be -- was protected. However, Petitioners do contest 

quite sharply that under Respondent's new view of the 

Petition Clause that the things of central importance 

are lawsuits and other communications that would be 

protected, perhaps be protected, otherwise under the 

access to courts doctrine, that arbitration, the 

arbitration involved in this case, does not count and 

should not receive any kind of heightened protection. 

The problem, much of the problem here, is the theory of 

what is a petition from Respondent's side has changed 

from the district court to this Court.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Ortiz, can I try a 

hypothetical on you? Suppose that there is a city 

employee and unrelated to the fact that he is a city 

employee the government takes some part of his property 

without just compensation. And he sues the government, 

and the government says, somebody says, his employer, 

that his supervisor said: Do you know what he's just

done? He's just sued the city; I think we should fire 

him. And he brings a retaliation claim. Is that 

protected under the Petition Clause?

 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor, it would be 

protected for two different reasons. First, that would 

-- similar activity would be protected under the Free 

Speech Clause, so that would preserve the principle of 

parity.

 Second -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Really? What has he done 

that's protected under the Free Speech Clause? He has 

brought a suit saying: I'm entitled to just 

compensation. It seems to me -- the reason I ask is 

because this seems to me a purely private matter which 

would not get protection under your test.

 MR. ORTIZ: It's not employment-related or 

related to his particular job, and this Court has always 

drawn the distinction there. For example, in National 

Treasury Employees Union this Court applied that kind of 

analysis.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I see, so that goes back to 

Justice Scala's difference test, which is it's not a 

matter of public concern versus private concern, but 

it's a matter of employment-related versus not 

employment-related, correct? Is that correct?

MR. ORTIZ: Well, that shows how closely 

those two things have been related in this Court's 

approach. In -- but certainly something that is 

privately-related, a public employee is complaining 

about tax assessment or something like that and tries to 

sue for retaliation under, under that theory, not for 

anything related to his or her job, this Court -- under 

this Court's and the lower court's application of the 

Connick principles, there would be no problem there 

treating it as speech or as a petition.

 So it is only when the lawsuit or the 

petition involves something related to the person's 

employment that these particular -- this particular test 

would kick in. And that's consistent, Your Honor, with 

this Court's twin background constitutional framework 

principles, one that you look at how much disruption 

something is likely to pose to the workforce and how 

central it is to the particular constitutional provision 

involved.

 In this case, if in general it's not 

employment-related the government has much less interest 

in worrying over it this way and applying the Connick 

threshold test is much less justified. You would have 

to do Pickering balancing, proceed directly to Pickering 

balancing in that case.

Now, Your Honor, Respondent's view presents 

several problems of sort of practical application, or 

would, to this Court. First, it would allow for the 

easy circumvention of Connick, which is a test that on 

the free speech side this Court has long held is very 

important for the public employment field to work 

efficiently. It would be very easy for a particular 

employee to take activity that Connick would not allow 

to proceed, to turn into a lawsuit on the free speech 

clause, and just by rephrasing it, respinning it, 

whatever, to turn it into a petition where under 

Respondent's rule the result would be very different.

 It also would require the Court to create a 

hierarchy between speech claims and petition claims, 

and, more importantly, if the Court were to go down the 

particular road that Respondent describes and see the 

center of the Petition Clause as defined by the access 

to courts doctrine it would create a hierarchy among 

different forms of petition. All of a sudden, petitions 

that at the founding were thought to be at the 

periphery, if there, of the Petition Clause would define 

its center, and a paradigmatic petition of a letter to 

Congress asking it to change its position on something 

would not be covered at all.

 If there are no further questions, I would

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PALMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Third Circuit rule here at issue is 

flawed for two fundamental reasons. First, contrary to 

this Court's admonitions, it quite literally 

constitutionalizes the employee grievance process by 

supplanting carefully calibrated nonconstitutional 

safeguards and by providing a potential First Amendment 

claim in Federal court to any employee who has filed a 

grievance on a matter of only private interest. And

 MR. PALMORE: Well, it's a hard hypothetical 

to answer, of course, because the grievance was filed 

pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Putting it aside. 

You -- you were talking about constitutionalizing a 

grievance process. I'm going more broadly and saying 

how much of your argument depends on that fact?

 MR. PALMORE: Well, I think that's an 

important part -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the meaning 

would -- it is harder if all they have access to is a 

court proceeding.

 MR. PALMORE: I think that's an important 

part of the argument, for this reason: If you look at 

the Third Circuit's case in San Filippo, the court had a 

kind of a doctrinal basis for its ruling, but it also 

had a practical concern that not affording protection 

for this kind of petitioning activity would be a trap to 

the unwary. But there was really no basis for that 

concern, because the issue here is when a sovereign 

provides a remedial mechanism or enters into a 

collective bargaining agreement that provides a remedial

 MR. PALMORE: It typically -- well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about if they don't? 

That's my point. Then what happens to the Third 

Circuit's definition?

 MR. PALMORE: Well, then I think the -- the 

result is the same, and -- and our position is you -­

you still apply Connick, just as speech on matters of 

private concern is protected by the First Amendment, yet 

under Connick, an employee who engages in speech on a 

matter of private concern is not going to be protected 

in the employment context in all respects.

 And that reflects a very important balance 

that this Court has struck between its view of how the 

Constitution applies to the government as sovereign 

regulator of the general public and how it applies to 

the government and its proprietary status as an 

employer. And in that latter situation, Connick has 

been critical in providing a bulwark against allowing 

run-of-the-mill employment disputes from becoming 

constitutional cases in Federal Court.

 And the second main problem with the Third 

Circuit's approach, and it's one that Mr. Ortiz 

highlighted, is that it privileges petition activity

over speech activity, contrary to this Court's numerous 

statements that there is no such hierarchy in the First 

Amendment. So going back to Thomas v. Collins in 1945, 

the Court called the two rights inseparable.

 In the United Mine Workers case, which is a 

case relied on by the other side, it's an access to 

courts case, the Court interchangeably applied the 

speech right, the petition right, and the assembly 

right, and it said they were intimately connected in 

origin and purpose. And, of course -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore -- I'm sorry.

 MR. PALMORE: No, please.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose a State legislature 

passes a law depriving all State employees of collective 

bargaining rights, and a State employee files a lawsuit 

saying that this law violates the State constitution, 

and the State employee is thereupon fired. Is that a 

matter of public concern or not?

 MR. PALMORE: It -- it likely would be, and 

I think this -- this goes to some of the questions 

Justice Scalia was asking. But as this Court said in 

Connick that the question about -- of whether speech is 

a matter of public concern is assessed not only by the 

content, but by the form and the context.

 So in the case that Your Honor is positing,

the content of the -- of the speech, which was that an 

act of the legislature was illegal, would suggest that 

it was a matter of public concern, the form, the form of 

a lawsuit is relevant to the consideration, and the 

context that it came in part of a larger political 

debate would likely be relevant, too.

 The problem with the Third Circuit approach 

is that it never engages in that kind of inquiry.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And suppose -- now going 

back to Justice Sotomayor's example, suppose that there 

were a -- a class action alleging systemic 

discrimination in some governmental workplace. Would 

that be a matter of public concern?

 MR. PALMORE: It very well might be. That's 

similar to this Court's decision in the GiVon case. So 

that was a case where a teacher went to complain to her 

principal about the school's general policy of 

discrimination, and this Court held that that was speech 

on a matter of public concern, that it affected more 

than just that individual employee's employment status.

 So many of these hypotheticals and many 

submissions and petitions to the government as sovereign 

will, in fact, satisfy the public concern test, and then 

you'll get into Pickering balancing.

any instance where speech by the employee would not be 

protected under the Pickering-Connick free speech 

calculus but would be protected under the Petition 

Clause?

 MR. PALMORE: I think that, no, if you put 

it in that way; this Court has never separately analyzed 

the two. But I think it is important to note that I 

think the Connick test already takes into account the 

distinction between what might be deemed petitioning 

conduct and non-petitioning conduct because of its use 

of the term "form." So, again, the Connick test calls 

on courts to look on the content, the context and the 

form. So if the form of an employee complaint takes the 

form of a lawsuit filed in Federal court, that's 

something that -- that should be taken into account.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- wouldn't a -- a 

written letter to -- to the employer, the government 

employer, similarly be a petition? Is a lawsuit any 

more of a petition, if indeed it is a petition at all, 

which I doubt? Surely filing a statement with the 

employer is a petition as well. So how does the form 

make any difference?

 MR. PALMORE: I -- it's -- I think it's a 

serious question about whether a letter submitted to an 

employer as an employer, not as a sovereign, is a

petition. But that's the kind of line-drawing that the 

Third Circuit approach requires.

 This Court has had a very broad conception 

of what counts as petitioning activity, so in Edwards v. 

South Carolina the Court said that a march to the 

grounds of the State capitol in South Carolina to 

protest segregation was an example of petitioning 

conduct in its most classic and pristine form.

 The Third Circuit doesn't -- doesn't 

count -- wouldn't count that as a petition for this 

purpose. It has kind of a gerrymandered view of what 

will count as a petition, basically a lawsuit and an 

employee grievance.

 Now, the -- the approach followed by the 

majority of the circuits and the approach we advocate 

today doesn't require that kind of line-drawing, because 

whether, for example, the grievance filed in this case 

is a petition or not, it's certainly speech, and so we 

would agree that it's susceptible to analysis under the 

normal Connick v. Myers framework.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, what about 

the distinction that the other side brings up that 

Connick is about what happens inside the workplace -­

you don't want to disrupt the routine by the kind of 

activity in which Myers was involved -- but the Petition

Clause, they're talking about conduct outside the 

workplace, that is a complaint filed in court, nothing 

that's happening in the workplace.

 MR. PALMORE: Well, I think it's workplace­

related and I think that's the test. So I don't think 

it -- you know, where an employee physically was when he 

or she filed the petition isn't really relevant. The 

question is the connection to the workplace and the 

connection to the employer-employee relationship.

 So as Mr. Ortiz answered before, the NTEU 

case provides a separate set of protections under the 

First Amendment, under the speech protection for 

employees who engage in speech conduct that has no 

connection to the workplace, and it would limit the 

ability of a government employer to take action against 

such an employee.

 But the conduct here is the -- the 

grievances that were filed here were obviously 

intimately connected to the workplace relationship 

between Chief Guarnieri and the Borough Council. This 

was not a case like NTEU, where someone wanted to go out 

and give a speech on something that had no connection to 

their job or go out and file a lawsuit or some kind of 

petitioning activity on something that had no connection 

to the workplace.

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, on that matter, 

one last hypothetical. Suppose the New York City 

council passed a resolution that said a precinct house 

would be closed all night long from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., 

and the chief of -- of that precinct filed suit saying 

that this was micromanagement and it was going to affect 

the public safety of the citizenry, and then that chief 

of police was fired.

 Is that a matter of public concern?

 MR. PALMORE: It very well might be. It's 

hard to answer in the abstract, because what this Court 

has said is that the question has to be analyzed in 

light of the whole record and in light of the context -­

content, the context, and the form.

 It's not necessary for this Court in this 

case to decide whether the petitioning and speech 

activity here was on a matter of public or private 

concern. The question presented says that it was on a 

matter of private concern. So all the Court needs to 

decide is -- is whether that makes a difference or not 

in terms of the constitutional analysis. And then the 

Third Circuit on remand could -- could decide, assuming 

the arguments were preserved, could look at the whole 

record and decide whether the speech activity here was 

on a matter of public or private concern.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Neither the text, history, or purpose of the 

Petition Clause nor the interest of a government 

employer in an efficient workplace provide a basis for 

distinguishing and giving less protection to a petition 

because it didn't involve a matter of public concern.

 The text of the Petition Clause certainly 

draws no such distinction. The subject of the petition 

must be a grievance and a grievance I think is measured 

by whether the matter is of concern to the petitioner. 

If it's a problem of concern to the petitioner, that 

satisfies that constitutional element. It does not 

matter whether the public cares a lot, it doesn't 

care -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But all of our cases 

have equated the Petition Clause reach with that of the 

First Amendment, and our cases under the First Amendment 

have made clear that we don't want to constitutionalize

the -- the employee grievance procedures.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, with all respect, Mr. 

Chief Justice, I don't think this Court is committed to 

the view that the Petition Clause and the Free Speech 

Clause cover exactly the same things. In fact, 

emphatically they -- obviously they don't because the 

Free Speech Clause covers many things that the Petition 

Clause would not. It covered, for example, the 

remark -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the Petition 

Clause cover anything that the First Amendment does not?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I believe so, Your Honor. 

This Court's decisions in the antitrust area and under 

the National Labor Relations Act with regard to -- an -­

access to the government or -- or the courts, they've 

always been framed solely in terms of the Petition 

Clause, not the Free Speech Clause. It would be at 

least very awkward to characterize those -- those 

problems as free speech cases, particularly where, as is 

typically the case, the -- the underlying activity was 

on the part of, say, a lawyer rather than an individual 

who -- who is asserting the petition right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, getting back 

to the second part of my question -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in the First 

Amendment cases we were concerned about, as I said, 

constitutionalizing employee grievances. If you 

constitutionalize it under the Petition Clause, how is 

that any less a problem of constitutionalizing it under 

the First Amendment?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it -- it's our view, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that -- and in this respect to some 

extent I think we agree with a statement made by 

Petitioners -- that every gripe that an individual 

employee might have, indeed most of them, wouldn't be 

covered by the Petition Clause. In the petition reply 

brief, the Petitioners state, and we agree with this, 

that the ordinary, routine e-mails, give and take within 

the office, that's not covered by the Petition Clause. 

We would agree with that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All you have to do 

then is add a sentence to your complaint saying: This 

is an example of how the government employer mistreats 

its employees?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No.

more generalized?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What if added to that is 

"and I'm going to sue" or "I'm going to file a

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor, saying that 

wouldn't have that effect. The case to which they refer 

is one in which an employee indicated, as indeed 

occurred, that he was going to file a lawsuit, and the 

employer retaliated in a peremptory fashion because of 

that. That -- that's been the rule in the Third 

Circuit, it has only come up twice, but if I might point 

out, that's the rule under any -- any number of Federal 

statutes which protect filing a charge with the EEOC or 

filing a lawsuit. The lower courts have agreed -­

First Amendment speech clause -­

MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have said that an

what the State could do for a nonemployee. Are you

there is no right to restrict what the -- employer does?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you have to offer a 

test and you don't want the public concern test, so 

what's your test?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: The, the -- that it, the 

government's interest as an employer is part of the 

calculus if -- if this issue arose under the Petition 

Clause, and under ordinary balancing one would look at 

the nature of the government's interest and the degree 

of burden that's imposed, and that's the way the Court 

has administered the Petition Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you would be content 

to apply that analytic, broad analytic framework to the 

Petition Clause?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, that's what the Court 

has done. Now, that said, I think there are 

circumstances where the government would be hard pressed 

to argue that it had a generalized interest in stopping 

a particular form of petition. For example, the 

Petitioners express a considerable unhappiness that 

they're subject to suit under section 1983. It's 

expensive, it requires lawyers, they could have to pay 

counsel fees. Those are judgments that the Congress of 

the United States made in 1871 when it adopted section 

1983. It knew the government was -- local governments

balance, and -- and of course, section 1983 is a very 

complicated piece of machinery -- the balance Congress 

struck is -- is ordinarily going to be controlling -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's talk about it. 

I find it difficult to believe that lawsuits are covered 

by the Petition Clause when it is very clear that the 

Congress can prevent all lawsuits against the Federal 

Government by simply refusing to waive sovereign 

immunity. Now, you know, how can you have a 

constitutional guarantee of the right to petition the 

government, which you say includes the -- the right to 

-- to be in law court, and yet the Federal Government 

can exempt itself from suits in law courts?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, the -- the 

Federal Government is not obligated to provide a -- a 

lower court system for -- authorized to hear suits 

against it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about just 

a lower court system. I'm talking about all suits, 

right up to the Supreme Court. The Federal Government 

can say: You can't sue us.

up a court system and then punish government employees 

for using it. They are not -- historic -- if I might

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the 

Petition Clause only covers those petitions that the 

government chooses to allow; is -- is that what the 

constitutional guarantee is? If you choose to allow a 

certain kind of petition, it is constitutionally 

guaranteed. That's not much of a guarantee.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, I think -- I think 

historically that -- that's a fairly accurate 

description of what has happened with the emergence of 

the Petition Clause over the last 6 or 700 years of 

Anglo-American history. There were no courts to which 

people could seek redress against the crown at the time 

of Magna Carta. Over time the courts became available 

to do that. Insofar as they did, on our view, the 

Petition Clause would now apply.

 And if I might turn to a question you asked 

earlier. You expressed some skepticism about whether 

the Petition Clause applies to lawsuits. I note that in 

at least half a dozen decisions that this Court has held 

that, and I think that was the premise of your 

concurring opinion in the BE & K Construction case a few 

years ago.

Clause is sufficient on its face. It doesn't say 

petitions to the legislature. It says petitions to the 

government, and that was clearly a deliberate choice, 

because the States -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, you can 

write a letter to the president, you can write a letter 

to your congressional representative, but getting to a 

court, you have to pay a filing fee. And since this 

would be a civil case, this Court has held if you 

haven't got whatever is the filing fee amount, too bad, 

you don't have access to the Court.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor, and I think 

those cases are clearly distinguishable. The -- the 

core historical purpose of concern of the Petition 

Clause was reprisals by the government against people 

for -- for petitioning the government. There's a 

fundamental difference here between what's at stake 

here, where the Borough is asserting a right to punish 

people for going to court, and the question about 

whether the government has an affirmative obligation to 

remove the incidental barriers that may exist to 

bringing lawsuits.

cases are distinguishable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting that 

in one of these suits you wouldn't have to pay the 

filing fee?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, no, precisely to the 

contrary. We are asserting only that the government 

cannot punish Mr. Guarnieri for filing a lawsuit. We 

are not suggesting the government has to pay his filing 

fee, any more than if -- if the -- if Mr. Guarnieri 

wants to go to Harrisburg and meet with his or her 

representative, the government, our view, Duryea, can't 

punish him for doing it, but they don't have to give him 

gas money, and if he doesn't have enough money for gas 

that's just too bad.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the Borough here 

bought something from a company under a contract that 

included an arbitration clause. Would that, would the 

right of the company to engage in arbitration be 

protected by the Petition Clause?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. The -- we believe the 

Petition Clause applies to government-created mechanisms 

for redressing grievances; and if the government sets up 

an arbitration procedure like that, we think that that's 

covered. An arbitration agreement between two private 

parties would not be, be covered by the Petition Clause,

because the government wouldn't have been involved in 

standing that up. And that distinction really has its 

roots in history. The petition started out; back at the 

time of Magna Carta petitions only went to the king. 

Over time the British government and ultimately the 

American government developed other mechanisms that were 

simply more efficient.

 So that, for example, at the time the 

Petition Clause was written, Congress received a large 

number of petitions from wounded veterans, and after 

several years of dealing with that it adopted the 

Invalid Pension Act and turned that over to a somewhat 

unusual combination of administrative and judicial 

officials. So I think the creation of -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So for a couple hundred 

years, nobody -- nobody connected the two?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Many of the constitutional 

issues this Court deals with were not raised for -- for 

a very long period of time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the Garcetti case, the 

district attorney was disciplined for sending a memo 

because he disagreed with how the trial strategy was 

supposed to unfold, and then he actually made that 

argument in court and was disciplined for that.

 Would he have been protected if he had just 

gone to court to sue the office of the district attorney 

on some sort of a prospective injunction saying, with 

reference to all search warrants you should follow the 

following procedures? Would that have been protected, 

even though the memo was not?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it would have been a 

petition. It would not necessarily have been protected. 

The government has an interest in such matters as an 

employer, and that might indeed outweigh -­

opinion?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: The question I take it 

you're asking is -- is whether the Garcetti principle 

would apply to a Petition Clause case where the 

government -- it was part of the official -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to know how the

the specific question is whether the Garcetti rule 

should apply in a Petition Clause case. I don't think 

we have a position on that. It's not raised in this 

case.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I 

ask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of 

a different way?

 In -- in the Connick inquiry, you have a 

threshold inquiry and then you have a balancing test. 

Now, you're suggesting that the threshold inquiry, the 

public concern inquiry, is kind of apples and oranges 

here; it's just not appropriate for the Petition Clause.

 But the question that then follows is, 

should there be a replacement threshold inquiry before 

you get to the balancing that Connick suggests is the

second stage of the process?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Probably not in the sense 

that you're asking. There would be a threshold inquiry 

as to whether what had happened was petitioning. If it 

were, this Court's decisions indicate that the Court 

might impose a threshold inquiry consistent with, say, 

the line of cases, most recently BE&K Construction, as 

to whether the underlying petition had a -- a reasonable 

basis or was -- had been pursued in good faith. But I 

think if you got past that, then there would be no 

further threshold.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if a number of 

municipal employees prepare a formal document called 

"Petition," and they say: We have a grievance, and our 

grievance is that the quality of the food in the 

cafeteria is poor? Now, is that protected by the 

Petition Clause?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: As you describe it, on our 

view, not so, because our view is that, putting aside 

the historical and somewhat unusual but less common 

instance of a petition directed to, let's say at the 

Federal level the Congress or the president, the 

Petition Clause ordinarily applies only where the 

government has created a specific remedial mechanism for 

addressing a particular kind of grievance. It's

something that's just outside the ordinary give-and-take 

of the office, something like, you know, a separate 

agency or an arbitrator or a court, something like that. 

And that -- there's an historical -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Where does that rule come 

from? It's drawn out of thin air?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. No, it isn't. That's 

the -- historically, that's the kind of distinction that 

was there. If you had a problem in England, if the 

undersheriff took your cow, you could go to the sheriff, 

but historically, that wasn't called a petition. If you 

went to the king, that was a petition. It was not going 

to the local.

 So we -- we do have a great deal of 

historical material, as Justice Scalia points out, about 

individuals, including Federal Government officials, 

petitioning Congress. And I -- we think the framers 

would have regarded those as petitions. I don't think 

they would regard a beef with the Secretary of the 

Treasury as -- as -- so we would -- there's no -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, this is 

not -- if you're -- if you're talking about the 

practical significance, Myers in Connick was going 

around the office, collecting signatures. She was 

taking a poll. She was taking a poll and the poll was

going to be presented to the employer. That sounds much 

more petition-like than filing a grievance pursuant to a 

collective bargaining agreement.

 So the -- the distinction between Connick, 

who was taking a poll -- why wasn't that a petition? 

Maybe -- did she just put the wrong label on it? If she 

called her case a petition case, it would have been all 

right?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. No, Your Honor. Our 

view, as I indicated to Justice Alito, is that a gripe 

within the office, whether you label it a petition or 

not, would not, except in maybe some extraordinary 

circumstance, constitute a petition.

 But if I might respond, I think your 

question raises a second important linguistic point, 

which is the word "petition" today has acquired a 

somewhat different meaning than it would have probably 

had in the 18th century. We think of petitions as the 

things you see out on tables, along the street; people 

say, come on, sign my petition to do this, that, or the 

other thing.

 That was not a common phenomena in the 18th 

century. Petitions were ordinarily things from one 

individual or a couple of people. There were some 

exceptions, but that was -- that was not the normal -­

the normal practice. In fact, the very idea that you 

could have large numbers of people signing something 

called a petition was much controverted at that time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're the expert in 

this area, but that -- that surprises me. I thought it 

was quite common in the early 1800s for you to go to all 

your neighbors -- and the book "Quarreling About 

Slavery" explains this, where there were petitions 

signed by many of the constituents in the congressman's 

district.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: There -- there were. It 

came to be used that way as -- that is largely a -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there were scores, 

scores of -- of signatures on these petitions. So 

that's like your card table.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It is, but what I'm 

suggesting is that is a 19th and 20th-century 

phenomenon. You see very little of that in the 18th 

century or earlier. And I'd note, although -- I mean, 

I, I think that if that's done by private individuals 

and directed to the government, it would be protected by 

the Petition Clause.

 I note, just to give you a sense of the 

history, that at the time that happened, its legitimacy 

was challenged, and the argument was made by the

proponents of slavery in support of a gag order adopted 

by Congress that this was not really a legitimate 

petition. The legitimate petition ought to be something 

about your personal problems; an abolitionist really had 

no business signing these things; it wasn't a personal 

grievance.

 Now, I think that's wrong. I think it's 

certainly not consistent with current case law. But it 

illustrates how the position advanced by Petitioners 

stands on its head the historical evolution of the 

Petition Clause, which starts as about private matters, 

and only over time and after a good deal of struggle is

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, let's come 

to the century in which we are now living. We have 

Title VII. Title VII has this provision, an explicit 

provision against retaliation. But suppose it didn't. 

Suppose it just prohibited discrimination and it didn't 

have a retaliation clause. It's the thrust of your

arguments that the government employee would have a 

claim for retaliation, although someone in the private 

sector would not?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Exactly. Exactly. And here 

we part company with -- I think the government expressed 

the concern in its brief and perhaps at oral argument --

I guess it was Petitioner that made this point -- that 

there was something amiss about government employees 

having rights that private employees don't. That 

distinction exists because the Bill of Rights and the -­

and the other constitutional guarantees, with the 

exception of the Thirteenth Amendment and the right to 

travel in interstate commerce, those rights don't apply 

to private -- to people dealing with private employers. 

That's just -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but that's 

the basis of our law in this area is that when the 

government is actually the employer the rights of the 

individuals are somewhat different, and they're closer 

to the rights that private employees have. So simply 

saying that these constitutional provisions apply 

against the government and therefore, you don't have to 

worry about the distinction between private employers 

and government employers doesn't seem to be -- me to be 

completely responsive to our precedent.

MR. SCHNAPPER: And -- and we're not taking 

issue with the assertion of the government that the 

government as an employer has interests which are 

different than it -- it -- those it has just as a 

sovereign. But that distinction has nothing to do with 

the distinction they propose in this case between 

matters of public concern and matters of only private 

concern.

 Indeed, to the contrary. To the extent that 

the government's -- the government's interests might be 

greater, surely a petition that deals with a matter of 

public importance is going to cause the government a lot 

more trouble than a purely private matter. A lawsuit 

alleging systemic employment discrimination on the basis 

of religion or even an individual, if -- if 

Mr. Guarnieri had alleged and a court had found that he 

had been fired because he was Catholic, the 

ramifications politically and in terms of just -- the 

ramifications in terms of the workplace would have been 

far more serious than the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schnapper, isn't the 

real question in these cases whether the employee is 

acting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is 

acting as an employee? And in the speech cases, that 

distinction suggests a public concern threshold inquiry.

Maybe in the petition cases it suggests something else, 

but that that's really the question we should be asking 

is, is this employee acting as an employee or as a 

citizen?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: With all due respect, our 

view is it depends whether or not the -- the employee is 

acting as a petitioner within the meaning of the 

Petition Clause. The petition Clause was not adopted, 

like the Free Speech Clause, to foster a vigorous public 

debate. The purpose of the Petition Clause, as the 

Court said in Christopher v. Harbury, is to enable an 

individual to seek relief for a wrong. And that has -­

that's not the same as the -- the free speech interests 

that -- that might exist to engage as a citizen in a 

robust public debate.

 Mr. Guarnieri didn't file his complaint in 

Federal court, for example, looking to the second 

petition, in the hopes of a robust debate between 

himself and Judge Caputo. He -- he filed that complaint 

to get redress for an alleged violation of his 

constitutional rights.

 So -- so the citizen versus employee 

distinction in -- in Connick is inapt here. It's -­

it's -- it's rooted in the purpose of the -- of the Free 

Speech Clause, which is protecting vigorous public

debate on matters of public concern. The Petition

doesn't guarantee redress, but it protects the ability 

to ask for it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do, I think, 

recognize that it would be possible then to circumvent 

Connick if you could turn around and file a pleading and 

say: Now I have a petition, not just a grievance.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, we don't think 

that that is a serious problem for three reasons. First 

of all, the Petitioners have in -- in highly expressive 

language described the decision in Filippo as one which 

would lead to an avalanche, tsunami, an overwhelming 

number of new lawsuits.

 We pointed out in our reply brief that they 

had not adduced any evidence that any such thing had 

happened in the 17 years since San Filippo. Their reply 

brief does not purport to have any information to -- to 

support that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but things 

will be a lot different if we give the sanction to your 

theory. I think the idea that it hasn't happened in 17 

years in the wake of San Filippo is a little bit -- it's

not very compelling.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think your -- I 

think there are two -- two other reasons why this is not 

a -- a major concern. The first one is it simply isn't 

the case that you could take any beef, write "Federal 

complaint" at the top of it and file it in Federal court 

and be protected. Most internal gripes don't raise a 

colorable claim under Federal or State law, and this 

Court's Petition Clause cases make it clear that a 

petition, particularly a lawsuit, that doesn't have a 

reasonable basis simply isn't going to be protected.

 It's also, to be frank, based on my contact 

with private petitioners, it's highly unrealistic to 

suggest that if an employee, government employee, took 

some gripe and went to a lawyer and said, let's file 

this in Federal court, I want to get it off my chest, to 

find a lawyer on a contingent fee basis that is going to 

do that. If a chance case has no chance of success, 

you're not going to find a lawyer who will do it; and on 

a police officer's salary, you're certainly not going to 

be able to hire one.

mean, the employer doesn't want to spend -- I mean, 

that's part of the reason our doctrine developed under 

the First Amendment. The employer doesn't want to have 

to worry about spending time and money in court to 

resolve what is essentially an employee grievance.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Few -- few private lawyers 

who aren't independently wealthy are going to take a 

baseless case on the theory that they're going to get 

some umbrella settlement. It's just -- it simply 

doesn't happen. It -- it -- and realistically, we don't

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it defies the 

imagination that the radical Republicans and the framers 

understood that the Petition Clause would 

constitutionalize public employee grievance, and as 

academic commentary that Respondent cites suggests, 

their -- Respondents long-centered view of the Petition 

Clause would call into question, sovereign immunity 

doctrine, parts of Rule 11, suggest a right to appeal 

and a right to judicial review whenever anyone has 

agreed to government action.

 There is also a danger that it would 

constitutionalize the arbitration process whenever the 

government is a party.

 If I can just answer one question. Connick 

is focused not on where speech happens, as Respondent 

insists, but rather where its effects occur. As this
