 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Vaden v. Discover Bank.

 Mr. Ortiz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This case poses two substantive issues: 

First, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act 

impliedly repeals section 1331's "well-pleaded 

complaint" requirement? Only if it does can a district 

court look through a petition to compel arbitration that 

itself contains no Federal question to ground Federal 

subject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question 

lurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be 

arbitrated.

 And, second, if section 4 does repeal this 

part of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted 

State-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit 

furnish look-through jurisdiction?

 Your Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute 

between two radically different conceptions of Federal 

question jurisdiction. One view, Respondents', is so

broad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in 

Federal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit 

card debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined 

subject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the 

arbitration agreement itself arguably arises under 

Federal law.

 But, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original 

meaning of section 4, the structure of the overall 

Federal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal 

Arbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the 

Petitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here. 

First, the language. The words "save for such 

agreement," Your Honors, as the words "save for" 

themselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement 

exerts some negative effect on otherwise existing 

jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That simply means 

that you can't bring an action in Federal court because 

the agreement says you can't. The agreement says you've 

got to arbitrate. So if you throw the agreement out 

save for such agreement, the question is whether or not 

you could then bring the action in Federal court.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, the -- those words 

"save for such agreement" were originally intended to 

refer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the

Federal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such 

suits. The words "but for" suggest that the agreement 

itself somehow impairs jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, why isn't 

section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care 

of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of 

it?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 says that 

an arbitration agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, 

and enforceable. At the time when section 2 was 

enacted, the Federal courts were still split between law 

and equity. Section 2 by itself could well have made 

such arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in 

law. Section 4, "save for such agreement," makes clear 

that there is no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I 

follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this 

doctrine of ouster come from? It came from the court. 

The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration 

agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction. Why 

would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule 

never made any sense in the first place, so we're not 

going to follow it? It's not any rule that Congress has 

imposed on the courts.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 by itself

would not have made clear that in -- such agreements 

were enforceable in equity. As Justice Story wrote in 

Tobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought 

in the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of 

jurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration. 

And so although under section 2 such an agreement might 

be enforceable in law -- damages might be available, 

penalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might 

also be able to recover the expenses incurred in an 

arbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came 

to its conclusion -- that would not be clear that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That may have been the 

historic model. This was never a notion that Congress 

enforced on the courts. They imposed it on themselves.

 So my question remains why shouldn't the 

Court then say this agreement has been declared 

enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to 

recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any 

more; we can change it?

 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. It is true that 

Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act abrogated the 

ouster doctrine. The only question is whether section 2 

would do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary 

because of the division between law and equity at the 

time.

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm just not getting the --

I have never understood this argument and I still don't 

understand it now. What is it in the text of section 2 

that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity 

as well as law?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 says that 

arbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable and 

enforceable, but it does not say how they could be 

enforced.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. And why, 

therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing 

distinctions as to how? It would be enforceable in any 

way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in 

the courts of the United States at the time -- or any 

courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, if Congress wanted 

to be very clear that ouster in all of its forms was no 

longer any kind of issue in enforcing arbitration 

agreements, it took the extra step in section 4.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it made a categorical 

statement in section 2. Why did it need to be any 

clearer than that?

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, because, Your Honor, it 

would be the case that arbitration agreements could be 

enforceable, but just not enforceable in the way that

might be most helpful.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it could be, but why 

in the world would anyone draw that inference?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, because there were 

separate bars at law and equity at the time -- at the 

time of ouster. Under law, there was some room in some 

jurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across 

the board. In equity there was an even higher standard 

at the time against jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have the same problem 

that Justice Souter does, especially since section 2 

refers to equity. It says they will be irrevocable and 

enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or 

in equity for the revocation of any contract.

 Obviously this -- this section was meant to 

apply to equitable actions. You wouldn't dismiss them 

in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?

 MR. ORTIZ: But that particular section, 

Justice Scalia, is meant to refer to ordinary State 

contract doctrines in law and equity, which would make 

the overall contract unenforceable. The "save for" 

language is specifically directed at ouster, which is a 

jurisdictional doctrine rather than one of substantive 

contract law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know. When it says

they are enforceable and makes an exception only for 

grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I 

would -- I would think that the general command was 

meant to apply to both law and equity.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, the Respondents' 

view also doesn't take into account the other provisions 

of the Federal Arbitration Act itself. Under their 

view, the "save for" language is literally read out of 

section 4 of the agreement, since the rest of section 4 

would accomplish exactly what they think the 

look-through doctrine that they are arguing for without 

those four critical words.

 Also, sections 203 and sections 205 show 

that when Congress wanted to expand subject matter 

jurisdiction, it knew how to do so clearly and 

unequivocally. And in fact, when Congress adopted 

Section 205 in 1970 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I hate to interrupt you 

here, but would you explain why the words "save for such 

agreement" cut back on the jurisdiction? I didn't quite 

understand your point.

 MR. ORTIZ: Justice Stevens, the point is 

that "save for such agreement" instructs a court to jump 

over the historical ouster doctrine.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it just instruct

the court to decide whether, if there were no such 

agreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the 

underlying dispute?

 MR. ORTIZ: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So in this case there 

would be.

 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor, because the 

underlying dispute between the parties in this case is 

a -- concerns the arbitration agreement, not the 

underlying bank debt.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's not the 

underlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute 

over which this Federal -- if you had brought your class 

action as an original case, there would have been 

Federal jurisdiction.

 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So then why doesn't the 

language read on this case?

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, the language 

in -- the language -- the particular language of section 

4 is meant to say, save for such agreement but for the 

doctrine of ouster, setting aside the ouster doctrine 

whether there would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The text says nothing 

about the ouster doctrine.

MR. ORTIZ: No. But read in its historical 

context, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Rather than literally.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, literally at the time it 

would have been understood to refer -- to refer to that, 

because ouster was the whole problem against which FAA 

itself was first enacted. FAA --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a tough --

it's a tough sell. When you say "save for such 

agreement," which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to 

me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right 

away then you look at the agreement to see if there is 

Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through 

that. So you're throwing it out and then you bring it 

right back in. It seems --

MR. ORTIZ: Not quite, Your Honor. What --

the rest of that sentence in section 4 instructs the 

court to look at a suit concerning the subject matter in 

controversy, which would be a suit seeking specific 

performance of the arbitration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the arbitration 

agreement?

 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, sir. So you are -- what 

the court is instructed to do under the "save for such 

agreement" clause is to ignore the historical problem of

ouster and then to see whether in a suit brought to 

specifically enforce the arbitration agreement, there 

would be Federal subject matter jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I guess 

it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic 

doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and 

then you look at the arbitration agreement. But it says 

"save for such agreement" and then you look at the 

agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, you're not quite looking 

at the agreement. And this makes clear, I believe, that 

ouster was the problem being referred to in those four 

words in section 4. It says a suit arising out of a 

controversy. It's instructing the Federal courts to 

determine Federal subject matter jurisdiction for a 

section 4 proceeding, which was completely novel at the 

time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You just -- you just used 

the words "arising out of the controversy." "The 

controversy" is used in several sections of the 

Arbitration Act, and "the controversy" in other contexts 

means the underlying dispute between the parties. "The 

controversy" is not over the enforcement of the 

arbitration agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ: With all respect, Justice

Ginsburg, it's a little bit more complicated than that. 

The Federal Arbitration Act uses the word "controversy" 

four times, twice in section 2, once in section 4 and 

once in section 5.

 In section 2, the word "controversy" is 

embedded in a larger phrase: "Controversy arising out 

of such contractor transaction." It is that context for 

the word "controversy" that makes clear that in section 

2, both instances in section 2, it is referring to the 

dispute which is sought to be arbitrated.

 In section 5, by contrast, the simple word 

which appears the middle of 4A of the Petitioner's 

brief, either -- section 5, which deals with the 

appointment of arbitrators or umpires, it says "either 

party to the controversy", it's clear in the section 5 

context that the word "controversy" by itself refers to 

the controversy over arbitration, not to the underlying 

dispute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In Moses H. Cone, didn't the 

court say that the controversy was the underlying 

dispute?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, that -- this Court, 

in that footnote 32 of Moses H. Cone, mentioned language 

that refers to the underlying dispute. In the context 

of both the sentence, the footnote itself, and the

overall case, it is clear that the Court could not have 

meant that.

 That phrase is followed immediately by a 

semicolon and then the word "hence." And after the word 

"hence" in that same sentence in the same footnote, this 

Court says, "Hence an independent basis for jurisdiction 

needs to exist," which in context makes it clear that 

it's not referring to look through.

 Also that sentence cites a Fifth Circuit 

case, Commercial Metals Company, and the other -- points 

to the other cases in it. They basically show that an 

independent -- stand for the proposition that an 

independent basis of jurisdiction exists, not that there 

is look through. And, in fact, one of them dealing with 

Federal-question jurisdiction says that the Federal 

issue has to appear on the face of the complaint.

 The rest of footnote 32, Your Honor, is all 

directed towards -- towards the jurisdictional inertness 

of the FAA overall. And the case of Moses H. Cone, 

itself, if look through had been rigorously adopted 

there, it would have defeated subject-matter 

jurisdiction because there would not have been complete 

diversity among the parties.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you do think --

you do think we should look through to determine

diversity and the amount in question? In other words, 

not in the Federal-question context, but if it's 

diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration 

agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, that seems a 

somewhat different sense of look through; but, to the 

extent that ordinary, background 1331 or 1332 principles 

authorize such look through, that is appropriate in 

arbitration cases as much as it is appropriate outside 

of arbitration cases.

 It is Petitioner's contention that section 4 

has no independent look-through force. To the extent 

that look through is appropriate, it is because it is 

appropriate under section 1332, itself. If under 

Respondents' view section 4 operates independently to 

authorize look through, then it would presumably 

override 1332's normal principle that you do not look 

through in determining complete diversity. And it would 

have the overall effect of paradoxically reducing the 

number of petitions to compel on the diversity side that 

could be brought in Federal court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't 

follow that.

 MR. ORTIZ: The -- the point is a simple 

one, but it's sometimes hard to express. If you -- if

this Court says that section 4 operates independently to 

authorize look through in section 1331 and section 1332, 

the courts, district courts, will be in the position of 

looking through section 1332 petitions to determine 

whether the parties are completely diverse.

 It will not be basing the complete diversity 

determination on the parties before it in the 

arbitration -- in the petition to compel, itself, but it 

will be looking through to the underlying dispute.

 Now, in Moses H. Cone, if the Court had done 

that, it would have picked up the architect who was 

dropped from the actual -- between the actual underlying 

lawsuit and the petition to compel arbitration, and 

completeness of diversity would have been defeated 

there.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that point argued in 

Moses -- Moses Cone? Was that point argued in that 

case?

 MR. ORTIZ: I do -- I do not know, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why wouldn't 1332 

require complete diversity and require the court to 

assure itself of that anyway?

 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. The question --

1332 does not authorize look through for purposes of

determining completeness of diversity, so if section 4 

independently authorizes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said it did 

have a look through, an automatic look through, itself.

 MR. ORTIZ: Not under the completeness of 

diversity, Your Honor. To the extent it has anything 

equivalent to look through, it's on the amount-in-

controversy side of Section 1332.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see. You are --

you are -- you are limiting it to the amount.

 MR. ORTIZ: Yes. So, under Respondents' 

view, there would be -- section 4 would authorize a look 

through one part of section 1332 and not with respect to 

another part of section 1332 under --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I am not -- I mean just --

I have to be sure I follow. Why couldn't it require the 

same look through in a diversity case as it does in a 

Federal-question case?

 MR. ORTIZ: Because, Your Honor, if this 

Court authorizes look through in Federal-question cases 

through the arbitration agreement, itself, to the 

underlying dispute, then if that look -- and that look 

through comes -- authorization comes from Section 4 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Complete diversity.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What's wrong with that?

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, that would have the 

effect, Your Honor, of not allowing the petitioner to 

define the contours of the lawsuit and would actually 

reduce the number of section 1332 petitions that could 

be brought in Federal court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe it would. So what?

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if that is --

that is an implication that is -- is lurking in 

Respondents' position, and it is also -- in a case like 

this it is a little bit worrying as to why ordinary 

section 1332 principles should not apply.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There is a dispute between 

people. You look at their underlying dispute, the 

underlying one, and you say: Is there diversity? 

What's the problem?

actually the way you use Federal -- lower Federal court

what this dispute is about. And if it's about something 

that happens to involve all people from one side in one 

State and from another State on the other side, there is 

jurisdiction. Why is that a problem? I don't 

understand.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it -- it removes the 

Petitioner's ability or the plaintiff's ability or the 

-- similar to the plaintiff's ability in an ordinary 

lawsuit to define --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

 MR. ORTIZ: -- the parties.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, because, Your Honor, 

someone could not bring a section 4 petition in Federal 

court against maybe one party seeking to force that 

party into arbitration if there are other parties 

involved in the underlying dispute where there is no 

diversity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So you define 

"look through" as -- under our hypothetical here as 

looking through to all people who might potentially be 

parties under this arbitration agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, that would be the

implication of taking the kind of look-through theory 

that Respondents are arguing for in this case and 

applying it evenhandedly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I will think about that. 

I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that 

that was so.

 MR. ORTIZ: But, Your Honor, there are also 

several jurisdictional gaps in the act that are created 

under Respondents' view. The critical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I hold up just a 

second to make sure I understand it. You are saying 

that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement 

that implicates Persons B and C. C is diverse, but B is 

not. They could decide to compel arbitration with 

respect to B and leave C out of it. But if you follow 

the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the 

dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be 

depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint 

in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.

 MR. ORTIZ: Exactly, Your Honor, and that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not quite so, 

because the -- the action could proceed with just A and 

C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment 

as to them. In the look through for the -- the claims 

that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed

without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the 

Federal -- the Federal claim.

 You couldn't -- you could decide the case 

completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. 

2. So there -- so there is a difference. It's true, 

you don't decide it completely as to all parties.

 MR. ORTIZ: When the -- no, Your Honor. 

But there -- there could under your situation be large 

parts of the underlying dispute that are not covered 

under -- and still left to be decided. It is, you know, 

not the case that necessarily everything would be 

subject to arbitration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, I suppose 

how that works depends on what the rules are about how 

you frame the dispute once you do look through.

 I mean, if there is a pending State suit 

between A and B, even though C may -- you could have 

sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am 

only going to look through to what the -- the actual 

litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a 

Federal case. And -- and -- and so your position 

follows.

 MR. ORTIZ: This Court could; and, 

interestingly, that wasn't the situation in Moses H. 

Cone, itself. There, there was a preexisting lawsuit,

and this Court did not look through. The court found 

that there was no problem with the architect being 

absent from the petition to compel arbitration, itself.

 Well, Your Honors, there is also, as I 

mentioned, strange jurisdictional gaps that are created 

under Respondents' view of this case. Section 4 is the 

only section of the arbitration -- in the Federal 

Arbitration Act that has the critical "save for such" 

language, which under Respondents' view authorizes 

look-through jurisdiction, in particular, Sections 7, 9, 

10, and 11, which allow a court, a Federal court, to 

compel the attendance of witnesses at ab arbitration. 

That is Section 7; and then 9, 10, and 11, which 

respectively allow a Federal court to confirm, vacate, 

or modify an arbitration once it has happened.

 None of those sections contain language 

which under Respondents' view or the Fourth Circuit's 

view are necessary for there to be look through.

 In all those cases -- situations, Your 

Honor, the Federal courts would be in the position of 

being able to compel arbitration under section 4 but not 

being able to compel the attendance of witnesses at the 

arbitration or to subsequently confirm, vacate, or 

modify an award coming from an arbitration that they, 

themselves, compelled.

Coming from an arbitration that they 

themselves compelled. The closest Respondent comes to 

sort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over 

this gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue 

that this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter 

jurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an 

emanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which 

actually has the necessary "save for" language.

 Also, Your Honors, this look-through 

approach to Federal subject matter jurisdiction violates 

the core purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act. The 

Federal Arbitration Act was meant to get things to 

arbitration quickly and to have arbitrators, not judges, 

decide them. These -- sometimes often complex 

jurisdictional inquiries undermine both those aims.

 Here this case has been pending in Federal 

court just at the jurisdictional stage for many years 

now. In the Strong case which is now en banc before the 

Fifth Circuit -- I'm sorry, the Eleventh Circuit --

Justice -- Judge -- excuse me, Judge Marcus wrote a 

32-page opinion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and what really 

leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the 

end, I think he basically presents your position and 

then he says: Thus, on my reading the relevant portion

of section 4 could be rewritten this way.

 Well, I mean that to me is a confession of 

error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your 

position.

 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, he didn't say 

it had to be rewritten. He said if you wanted to make 

it even clearer what was originally intended under 

section 4 that is how you would do it. That's a far cry 

from saying that you need to do violence to the statute. 

Here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, his rewriting 

doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, if his rewriting, 

given the disappearance of the ouster doctrine -- he's 

trying to make it clear to present context what was 

originally understood at the time the Congress 

originally enacted the FAA. There is no memory, 

historical memory or otherwise, of the ouster doctrine, 

no realization how it actually played out; and against 

that absence of knowledge, Judge Marcus is trying to 

educate his readers and the lower courts as to how 

things need to be done.

 But certainly the language as originally 

understood would have -- that save-for language would 

have been all about, which it is clear from the time was

thought by Congress to be the major obstacle to 

arbitration.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the fact that 

that was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was 

it included in -- was it included in the Uniform 

Arbitration Act?

 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. Now --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the explanation for 

that?

 MR. ORTIZ: The explanation, Your Honor, is 

that in New York law and equity have been merged.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I know. And you're saying 

New Jersey; it was, you know, a very complicated 

argument about the status of it. What about the Uniform 

Arbitration Act?

 MR. ORTIZ: By the later times it appeared 

that it was closer, coming -- the law and equity across 

many jurisdictions was coming closer, but at the time in 

the Federal court system at least, if only because of 

Justice Story's hostility towards jurisdiction, finding 

jurisdiction in the Tobey case to build equity seeking 

specific performance kinds of things, that language is 

necessarily clear.

 Your Honors, if there are no further 

questions I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 It seems to me that if the argument that 

just ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that 

perhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient 

of read the statute as it's written, apply it as written 

and come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably 

easy resolution of this particular case.

 The statute says that a party aggrieved by 

the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that 

precisely in this case because the other side has filed 

a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an 

underlying dispute -- may petition any United States 

district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's 

pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context 

you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you 

say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil 

action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of 

the controversy between the parties.

 It seems to me reasonably clear to interpret

that language as saying you look to the underlying 

dispute between the parties.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the question 

that I have, Mr. Phillips. What is the underlying 

dispute between the parties?

 It seems to me that your look-through 

argument is look-through only halfway. That is, if you 

look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that 

was brought in the State court, the controversy is here 

we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. 

So we have a suit on a debt. Why isn't that the 

controversy? You have to make the counterclaim the 

controversy, which comes up only defensively. It wasn't 

brought as a lawsuit.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, the 

language of section 4 actually talks about the subject 

matter of a suit arising out of, not the existence of a 

suit; and section 4 doesn't require that a lawsuit have 

been filed. So it's not appropriate simply to say to 

yourself look at what litigation actually exists, 

because in as many cases as not there is not going to be 

any litigation ongoing. So the court has to make the 

hypothetical: would the court have had jurisdiction 

over the subject matter of this dispute? And the 

dispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very

explicit about -- he said specifically that if he had 

brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have 

arisen under Federal law.

 It seems to me that's as clear a concession 

that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal 

law. And therefore --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who gets to frame --

who gets to frame the complaint? Normally if you're a 

party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal 

law, you have control over the complaint. You don't 

have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a 

way that implicates a Federal question. You can go out 

of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a 

Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you 

could not bring it in Federal court.

 Just as in the diversity example, you can 

specifically avoid suing people who would create 

diversity. But in your position the judge has to in his 

mind write a complaint and see whether there is 

jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide 

whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse 

parties?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think what the judge has to 

do is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section 

4 complaint the benefit of his allegations. And we have

made an allegation here that the subject matter of this 

dispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not 

just based on our own assessment of the situation in the 

abstract, but we did that on the basis that she had 

filed a very specific claim against us asserting that we 

had violated essentially section 20.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but she chose to 

assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint --

the counterclaim if it had been brought as an 

independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for 

Federal jurisdiction. But the litigant who has this 

claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that 

you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Ginsburg, I think 

the difference is that we are not seeking to remove her 

original lawsuit. That's not -- if that were the case, 

then I think the argument you're making is a legitimate 

one. All we are seeking to do is to assert our 

independent section 4 rights and that's not at all 

dependent on the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the practical 

effect, what happens? Now you have asserted that you 

can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts --

that arises under Federal law. But you say it's is not 

the same as removal because the underlying claim, your

suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State 

court; but what happens to that claim once you have this 

arbitration?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are a couple 

possibilities. I mean, first of all, the arbitration 

agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you --

if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent 

claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have 

the right to enforce the arbitration as to that 

particular claim. So that's specifically what we did in 

this particular case.

 So in theory, at least the collection action 

would remain in State court as a State cause of action, 

although it would certainly be available to the 

Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're 

going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm 

content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well. So 

they could do it that way or we could arbitrate the 

Federal law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Clear up one thing for me. 

Is it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the 

counterclaim was purely defensive? Didn't it ask for 

additional relief? The counterclaim, wasn't it a class

action?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, right. Yeah -- no --

exactly. That's absolutely true.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it was not merely an 

defense to the action, the State court action.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I meant -- I didn't mean 

to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a 

counterclaim. Of course you could. But this --

MR. PHILLIPS: But I couldn't -- I couldn't 

remove it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Chose not to --

MR. PHILLIPS: I think that was the point 

she was trying to make.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- chose not to litigate 

the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going 

to bring up this claim. It wasn't as an original 

matter.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I -- I understand 

that, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point 

I am trying to make here is that the language of section 

4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy 

between the parties. It doesn't specifically talk about 

an existing lawsuit, and frankly it doesn't envision the 

existence of a specific lawsuit.

the parties is the credit card company says, customer, 

you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if 

that's so, then I have certain offsets because they 

charged me too much interest. How do you --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how do you -- it's all 

part of the same controversy, isn't it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- no -- well, I mean you 

could -- you can certainly view it as part of the same 

controversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the 

question is: Would a Federal court have jurisdiction 

over the dispute that arises under Federal law between 

the Petitioner and the Respondents? And the answer is 

clearly yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the dispute? You 

say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been 

brought in a complaint.

 MR. PHILLIPS: It's defined by our complaint 

in section 4.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- from your 

argument, I would gather that a court would be able to 

imagine a counterclaim. Once it finds out, you know, 

what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about, 

the court could imagine that there would be a

counterclaim for interest or for something else.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's very strange to decide 

Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined --

imagined complaints.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean the problem 

with that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice 

Scalia, because the language of the statute does say 

that the court has to determine whether it would have 

jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. 

And then that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the problem with his --

I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to 

imagine anything.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, with his 

interpretation, you have to imagine everything. In 

point of fact, you have to imagine that this had 

something to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word 

"ouster."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. PHILLIPS: It has to do with equity and 

law when it uses "equity" and "law" in other contexts.

complaints. You -- you don't have to invent litigation.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. That's true, but 

what it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this 

is a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal 

Arbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide 

a basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian 

Tribe claims. It seems inconceivable to me that 

Congress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4 

in mind when it passed this particular law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's close to inconceivable 

to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct 

litigation that is not yet in existence.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But I think all of this 

really is talking -- I mean this is not significantly 

different --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- answer that the 

litigation does exist.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but your position is it 

doesn't have to exist. Had that litigation not been 

brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before 

a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to 

consider what is the dispute between the parties and 

what kind of complaints could that dispute have 

generated.

MR. PHILLIPS: And it may well be, Justice 

Scalia, that in that context the answer is that the 

court will say that the claim is unripe; that we don't 

know for sure whether or not this is going to congeal 

into a real dispute between the parties. And if that's 

the case, obviously, then the court does not have to go 

forward. But you don't have to worry about that in the 

context of this particular litigation because that 

dispute has congealed. The parties are at loggerheads 

over the particular issue in this case. And -- I'm 

sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There would be nothing 

inappropriate about a State court entertaining that 

excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to 

it. I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs 

the interest --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not state usury law. So 

you could have this case going on in State court.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the State court would 

be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Although, you know, 

that's to the -- obviously, that sets aside the 

arbitration agreement completely.

tacit assumption seems to be that you in fact are going 

to get shortchanged on your arbitration right if you 

have to bring your arbitration claim in a State court. 

And I don't see that.

enforce the arbitration agreement.

Federal court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Speaking of gymnastics, 

can I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could 

you have brought a declaratory judgment action to 

establish that your Federal claim --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- controls this dispute 

and could you have then said that you wanted this 

arbitrated?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I 

believe we could have done both of those.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why didn't you do that? 

Why are we here?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because we brought the 

action under section 4, which I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, could you still do 

that after this case?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Assuming there's no statute 

of limitations issue, and I don't know that there would 

be, but that would available. But it still seems to me 

that the bottom-line question is: Are you entitled to 

bring an action under section 4?

 JUSTICE BREYER: So your theory -- I mean 

basically I think you concede that the other side has a 

point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the

dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know 

if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that 

you can get into Federal court on. For example, it 

hasn't even arisen. You know, there is no lawsuit. And 

I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is 

they should say to you you'd like to have this in 

Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute? What's it 

about?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And once he says what's it 

about, both sides will say, well, basically it started 

off -- it's just about collecting some money from 

in-state parties. So that's not Federal.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So that, you know, 

something could happen here. It could happen that they 

could decide they want to sue in a big class action and 

get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State 

which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC 

reg, and then it could be Federal. And the judge might 

say to you: "What? You're just imagining." And that 

would be up to the judge.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the judge would 

have the discretion to decide --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's a kind of a defense.

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you'd say then it might 

be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. There could be a 

letter that says, look, what you're doing here violates 

Federal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to 

take action against you. And then we have to sit there 

and wait.

 JUSTICE BREYER: A real suit. And --

MR. PHILLIPS: But they are here. They are 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And in a real suit, there 

is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one 

you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where 

they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are 

going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's 

what we want arbitrated.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And that's precisely what 

we've asked for here, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So this one is not so hard 

to figure out.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There might be some that 

are.

question about that, and it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's hard to 

figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you 

have a dispute with the franchisor. And the franchisee 

says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue 

you under the California antitrust law, and he does. 

And the Federal court says, we've looked through and 

says, well, you could have sued under the Federal 

antitrust law. And you -- yes, I could have; I 

deliberately didn't. And then they say, well, this is 

something that could have been brought in Federal court. 

And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to 

frame his complaint as he sees fit.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And I understand that, 

Mr. Chief Justice. And in the right case, you know, I'm 

not sure how I would come out in that particular --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in his case, in the 

Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get 

into court, probably don't because they are bringing 

this under a State law?

 MR. PHILLIPS: You see, I would comply with 

the original complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But you just 

say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in 

Federal court?

what the Eleventh Circuit held.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a violation of 

the Sherman Act.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it could 

be brought in Federal court.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- and in the right 

case, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far, 

I might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but 

in this case I don't have to go that far. And I think 

all the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where 

the parties have a very concrete dispute between them, 

one that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a 

party seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section 

4 pursuant to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That claim doesn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me get one fact.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the State court suit 

still pending?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, the State court suit is 

pending.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there are two separate 

underlying actions.

MR. PHILLIPS: The State court has stayed 

its hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation. 

So we'll see what happens. But, obviously, as I say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there could be 

nothing left for the State court to do after you have 

the arbitration. I mean, not that you arbitrate about 

interest due on a nonexistent debt. I mean, you have to 

have the two things together.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, in some ways, 

as I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or 

potentially -- or ours. I suppose either side could ask 

to have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I just can't envision a 

case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a 

debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you remove the State 

court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal 

court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the 

arbitration. It just seems to me you have effected --

accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the 

-- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on 

the basis of a counterclaim.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But see, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think that's not right. I think that actually what

happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the 

Federal question in this through the arbitral process.

 You still have the underlying collection 

action. If the Court says, no, there is no violation of 

the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not 

made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim 

on the debt and her obligation to pay it.

 Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in 

State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral 

process, that's really up to her as far as how that 

goes. But the arbitration agreement could not be 

plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for 

purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit 

perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a 

specific claim here that arises exclusively under 

Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our 

arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right.

 And that's, frankly, all we are trying to 

accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg.

 The second part of the statute which is 

the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the 

greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know, 

"would have jurisdiction over the subject matter." 

Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the 

Court is going to face in this area, because here is one

where there is no question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what worries me. 

That's what worries me.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If we accept your theory, 

this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that 

are further down the line?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what's going to 

happen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come 

up that much, in part because these issues have been 

around a long time. You know, it's not like there have 

been dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time. 

I don't think it's likely to be that big a problem.

 But again, it seems to me that district 

courts have the authority to resolve this, because if 

they don't believe that there really is a Federal claim 

that would justify exercise of section 4, they can say 

that. If they do, then they will -- then they will send 

it.

 I mean, look -- the other thing about this 

is, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about 

federalism, but we are not asking to take the issues 

away from the Federal court -- from the State courts to 

the Federal courts. What we are asking for is what 

everybody has agreed to here, which is to have these

disputes resolved by arbitration.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could have asked 

for that in the State court as well, and --

MR. PHILLIPS: There is no question about 

that, Justice Ginsburg. The problem is that there is 

some lack of confidence in the State courts that we will 

get the same treatment under section 4 that we would get 

in Federal court. And Congress created that right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then bring that up here on 

appeal from the State court.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I wish it were that 

easy to get this Court to grant review of everything 

that I bring up here in the first place.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have any 

trouble.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: I appreciate that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not really -- of 

getting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators 

can decide this question.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The arbitrator might 

decide there is no preemption.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the -- and that's 

fine and we have to live with that. And obviously,

since we can't change the standards of review on the 

back end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be 

pretty much stuck with that -- with that determination. 

But the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial 

judge, the State court will not send it to arbitration.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, I haven't 

reread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary 

correct in saying that there would have been no 

jurisdiction in that case it we followed your view?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the arbitrator was 

not of diverse citizenship from the other parties?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, It wasn't litigated. 

It's not clear on the face of the opinion. So if there 

is something he knows that I don't know, maybe. But 

I -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects 

that -- that view of the world.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- if, in fact, were a 

nondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have 

been no jurisdiction?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, now, the nondiverse 

party issue, it depends on how you read section 4. You 

know, section 4 talks about the parties. And the 

parties there I don't think means parties to the 

underlying controversy. I think there parties refers

specifically to the dispute in front of the court.

 So I don't think the pass-through problem 

for 1332 applies in that particular context for complete 

diversity.

 I don't think Congress envisioned you would 

look beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see 

whether there are additional parties, except to the 

extent, obviously, that you would have necessary and 

indispensable party litigation that might bring them in.

 I think the assumption is you take the 

complaint as it's written, and then you look to see 

whether or not there is amount of controversy. For that 

you have to go beyond because the dispute with respect 

to arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near 

that number. And you have to look beyond for Federal 

questions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue 

there to be enforced.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm asking 

if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good 

response in rebuttal.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm not going to give a good 

response?

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you read it the other 

way -- if you read it the other way, the way the 

Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?

That then you look to see if there is Federal 

jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that 

right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Under their interpretation?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, under their 

interpretation.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what you could have is 

you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement 

that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between 

them, and one is from Vermont; the other from 

California.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So there is jurisdiction. 

And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters 

of -- that never could come into Federal court. I mean 

there are such matters you could argue about.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure. Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But nevertheless, we have a 

Federal court issuing this injunction, under their 

theory.

of --

controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see. The arbitration 

agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. It has to have an 

independent basis for Federal jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then 

probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the 

amount.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's exactly our 

point. That's why you have to look through.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So if you didn't look 

through, then this would apply to nothing?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Pretty much that's our view 

of the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If the arbitration --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I'm sure my opponent 

will say something different than that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The arbitration agreement 

has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, 

then you could have really important Federal questions 

in substantive issues --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that couldn't come in 

because the arbitration agreement doesn't? Or you could 

have State questions that would suddenly come in because

the arbitration agreement does. The arbitration -- but 

now you're saying, well, that second case is never going 

to arise.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Probably not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Probably not, because no 

arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a 

nullity of the statute?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Except to overcome the 

ouster. Okay. We've got your side of it.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it makes a nullity of 

it, except that it gets into the Federal court the 

decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the 

object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the 

underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or 

not.

 As I understood the purpose of the 

Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration 

was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in 

State cases as well. And it's entirely compatible with 

that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct 

arbitration in a case this involves an underlying 

controversy that's purely non-Federal.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh absolutely. I mean, you

know, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret 

it. If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner 

does in saying that you can't have any look through --

now he softens that and says, well, no, you can have 

look through for diversity.

 But if you accept the idea that section 4 

only makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration 

level, then the reality is you're going to have no cases 

that are going to be covered, because you're never going 

to satisfy the amount in controversy.

 And then the issue is why do you get to look 

through for diversity purposes and never get to look 

through for Federal question purposes? And it -- it 

seems to me the much easier way to reconcile the 

language of the statute is to say, of course, you look 

through to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned 

Federal question dispute that's being litigated between 

the parties; we know that; there is not an issue before 

us. In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court 

today.

 And so, it seems to me that's the solution 

to this case. Now admittedly, there will be other cases 

where you may have right in these questions, and there 

will be other cases where the parties will have to fight 

at the Federal district court level as to precisely

what's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to 

be fighting over. And it may be in some instances you 

won't get an order that directs arbitration. But that's 

not this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it proper to 

look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a 

dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor. 

Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your 

case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal 

jurisdiction, fine. But we are not going to look to see 

what the defendants cases is or might be. We'll just 

look at your case and that's how we will define the 

controversy.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two problems 

with that. First of all, the statute talks about the 

subject matter of the controversy. It doesn't talk 

about the specific controversy.

 And second of all, the statute clearly 

envisions that there are going to be situations where 

there is no complaint, there is no underlying State 

court cause of action, and it still envisions in that 

situation that a district court is going to have to 

determine whether or not it would have jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you'll have not 

only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been

brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of 

counterclaim to that claim.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But it seems to me that's 

precisely what the language "would have jurisdiction 

over the subject matter of the controversy" asks this 

Court to make a determination of.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would come into 

the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere, 

but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the 

defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim? 

That's a lot of hypothesis.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But it seems to me, Justice 

Ginsburg, the better way to think about this is what if 

we were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you 

are engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you 

got to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a 

class action against you, you had better change your 

behavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't 

sue us, and they don't sue us?

 And then the question is are we entitled to 

go to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to 

have the resolution to that issue as a matter of 

arbitration?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, the answer 

to a better hypothetical is what if there had been no

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's --

actually, you're right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the case you're 

really saying. You're saying that is like this case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That is this case.

suggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of 

a different -- quite different dispute.

question absolutely nailed it because you said, would

would you, and the answer is yes, you could, and 

therefore you know as -- without any question that it's 

a Federal suit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Excuse me --

opponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction 

even in that case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's no 

doubt that that's their position.

could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the 

arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would 

not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the 

award?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean the interesting 

thing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is 

broader than our language. If we didn't have the "save 

for" and "would have jurisdiction under," this would 

clearly be an action that arises under Federal law, 

because the question, you know, section 4 says have you 

been aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do 

you have a remedy for that action?

 I mean, without this rigamarole that we've 

been talking about this whole time, we would have -- we 

would easily have a 1331 action. So if anything you 

would argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law 

regardless. Now if you don't want to go that far, then 

it seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and 

11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4 

and you wouldn't read it any broader than that.

 But there is no basis for taking the 

unlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow 

distorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that 

we have under Section 4. So I --

never clearly clarify the particular Federal on which 

the jurisdiction rests on this case. What -- can you 

clarify that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. This case arises under 

section 4 through Section 27.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Section 4 creates the 

Federal --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it does create it, 

because section 4, without the "would have jurisdiction" 

language clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in 

my judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an 

additional requirement on you.

 You can't just use the contract that gets 

you into Federal court. You have to then look to see 

whether you would have had an underlying cause of action 

or an underlying Federal claim or whether there would 

have been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying 

claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can't you have 

sort of modified look, through like a modified limited 

hangout or whatever it was? That is to say, you can 

look through for the purpose of determining whether the 

arbitration agreement raises a Federal question. But 

that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine 

whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal

question.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because I think -- I think 

the reference in the statute to controversy clearly 

envisions the underlying dispute between the parties, 

because it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's 

not even just the controversy; it's the subject matter 

of the controversy, and you compare that to section 2 

and it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there 

is the underlying dispute between the parties.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the Petitioner's -- I'm 

sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is 

the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through 

compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which 

allows removal if there is a Federal defense?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I don't know if 

it's compromised by it. I think it -- the Beneficial 

case makes it absolutely clear that we have here a 

Federal claim and therefore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's of course in the 

context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But again I don't 

think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to 

make that determination. I think what section 4 is 

asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the 

controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a 

few quick points.

 I think this Court should be exactly clear 

how much Federal question jurisdiction the look-through 

theory would create. So long as a Federal issue can be 

imagined anywhere in the lawsuit, there would be Federal 

question jurisdiction under this theory, and this is 

almost by definition going to be the case in any dispute 

concerning credit card debt, either because of the 

theory of complete pre-emption from the FDIA, or because 

of the theory used in the Strong case before the 

Eleventh Circuit that RICO's prohibition on the 

collection of unlawful debt --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a Federal 

defense?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That isn't quite true, 

because here there is a definition in the Federal claim

in your counterclaim.

 MR. ORTIZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There is a definition of 

the controversy in your counterclaim and in their 

response.

 MR. ORTIZ: No -- there -- in general, if 

you accepted their theory, as long as there is an issue 

that could be spun as a Federal issue which there will 

always be in a credit card debt collection case and 

just -- in most States, that on look-through theory 

would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You're suggesting that 

every credit card debtor would have a class action?

 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, every -- it does not 

have to be a class action to establish what would serve 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's your view, but I 

mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under 

control. That was your original point. I see the 

point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have 

some rules that cabin it.

 Assume I got that under control; maybe I 

don't. This is a case of "well, his brother was worse." 

What do you want to say about the criticisms of the 

horrible things that happen if we adopt your position?

MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, Respondent 

argues that this is an easy case, or at least over time 

the courts will decide these things to make the 

jurisdictional inquiry -- inquiries clear. Petitioner 

does not believe that is true.

 For example, here the real party in interest 

dispute consumed much of the court's time. The lower 

courts have gone both ways on this issue. It's 

incredibly fact-dependent. There is no easy answer for 

it.

 Also, Your Honor, Petitioner does not 

believe that the Declaratory Judgment Act would have 

been appropriate in this case. Declaratory judgments 

are discretionary and in this context of where you have 

a pending State court lawsuit Petitioner believes that a 

Federal district court would be very cautious before 

permitting one.

 Also Your Honor, if in the context of 

declaratory judgment action presumably the district 

court would have to take the State court admission into 

account, and in particular here it was admitted that the 

account was with Discover Financial Services not with 

the bank.

 Also, Your Honors, this -- Respondents try 

to portray Petitioner's position as siphoning off all

Federal question jurisdiction. That is not true. Under 

Petitioner's view, a lot of Federal question 

jurisdiction -- some would remain. It would just be 

that the arbitration agreement itself would have to 

sound in Federal law. ERISA arbitration agreements 

would still be covered. Some labor agreements would 

still be covered. There would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, what do 

you mean would still be covered?

 MR. ORTIZ: Would still be covered under 

Petitioner's theory of what section 4 means. So for 

example, Mr. Chief Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which would still be 

in Federal court.

 MR. ORTIZ: Would still be in Federal court. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
