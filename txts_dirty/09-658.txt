3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next this morning in Case 09-658, Premo v. 

Moore. 

6  Mr. Kroger. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL JOHN R. KROGER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The court of appeals held that Arizona v. 

12 Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to 

13 control and govern the outcome of this case. This was 

14 an error, because this Court has never applied 

Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard, 

16 which places the burden of proof on the government, to a 

17 collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim, 

18 where the burden of proof is on the inmate. 

19  In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no 

trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded 

21 no contest or guilty before trial. The court of 

22 appeals' decision conflicts with both 

23 Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will 

24 have grave negative consequences for our criminal 

justice system.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't -- isn't 

2 Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that 

3 a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight, 

4 leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in 

Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime, 

6 that carries heavy weight? 

7  MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, I think it's 

8 relevant to that extent, that a confession from a 

9 defendant is significant evidence. However, it 

certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals 

11 proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice 

12 prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of 

13 review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of 

14 proof onto the government, or that it limits the 

prejudice analysis to that question of the potential 

16 impact of the confession at trial. 

17  And so for all those reasons, I -- I think 

18 the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any 

19 potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it -- if I am 

21 understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred 

22 in assuming that if the confession had been 

23 suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against. 

24 I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position 

that we have to get to the question of what would have

1 happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all 

2 circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a 

3 defendant should never plead guilty. 

4  You are saying that that conclusion is what 

the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong? 

6  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, we're -- we are 

7 suggesting that the court was wrong both in stating 

8 Fulminante provided the standard of review, as well as 

9 holding that you can, in effect, assume prejudice simply 

because defense counsel failed to file a motion which 

11 defense counsel believed was not -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's another way of 

13 saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead 

14 guilty if it's a suppressible confession?

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 

16 That is correct, Your Honor. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So now, what 

18 is the other information that would have made a plain 

19 guilty in this case inevitable? However, that's a 

higher standard than you need to meet, but -­

21  MR. KROGER: As -- as Your Honor noted, that 

22 is a much higher standard than we have to meet under 

23 Hill v. Lockhart. There were very good reasons why 

24 defense counsel's advice that this defendant plead 

guilty was sound and reasonable advice.

1  First of all, the defendant faced a very 

2 strong government case, even at that stage of the 

3 investigation. 

4  Second, there was a potential charge of 

aggravated murder that could be brought if the case were 

6 taken to the grand jury. 

7  Third, the plea offer that was extended to 

8 the defendant and which the defendant took was very 

9 favorable to the defendant, both in terms of -- of 

capping the amount of time that the defendant would 

11 serve, as well as dismissing two additional mandatory 

12 minimum charges of assault and kidnapping. So -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were those higher than 

14 the minimum he pled to? Were those mandatory minimums 

higher? 

16  MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, but they could 

17 have been run consecutive rather than concurrent. 

18  I -- I think more significant is the fact 

19 that when the defendant himself testified about the 

reasons he pled guilty, none of the reasons he provided 

21 had anything to do with the strength of the government's 

22 case or the failure of counsel to file the motion. 

23  What the defendant said motivated his guilty 

24 plea was a concern about an aggravated murder charge, a 

desire not to have to testify against his brother, which 

6

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 he believed would be the outcome of a guilty plea. And 

2 those factors were in the defendant's mind when he 

3 decided to take the guilty plea. 

4  So in this case, even if one were to shift 

the burden onto the government -- and I do not believe 

6 that -- that that is consistent with Strickland -- the 

7 government would prevail here. 

8  This case raises, I think, significant 

9 consequences for application of Strickland and 

Hill v. Lockhart. Strickland and Hill clearly place the 

11 burden of proof in a collateral proceeding on the 

12 inmate. 

13  The court of appeals here shifted the burden 

14 of proof, pursuant to Fulminante, onto the government. 

One can see this in the petition appendix at page 48 

16 where the court states that there is not enough evidence 

17 in the record to prove that the defendant would have 

18 pled guilty had the confession been denied. 

19  As I stated to Justice Sotomayor, I believe 

the government actually could meet that burden, but that 

21 is certainly not the burden that either Strickland or -­

22 or Hill requires. 

23  Second, the Court's application of 

24 Fulminante transforms the Hill v. Lockhart analysis. It 

narrows it to one degree, because it's focused on one 

7

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 issue, what the government's evidence would be at trial, 

2 rather than looking at the broad array of issues which 

3 might motivate a defendant to plead guilty which the 

4 courts will look at under -- under Hill v. Lockhart.

 For example, under Hill v. Lockhart the 

6 court will not only look at the defendant's testimony 

7 with respect to the estimate of the strength of the 

8 government's case, but also look at the potential for an 

9 additional sentence that is higher or additional charges 

that carry a higher sentence if the defendant proceeds 

11 with litigation rather than pleading guilty. 

12  It will look at the investigation risk that 

13 additional evidence would be found in, if the case 

14 continued rather than terminating in an early plea. And 

it will look at personal factors such as the ones that 

16 were evident in this case that might motivate a guilty 

17 plea. 

18  For those reasons, the Hill v. Lockhart 

19 standard encompasses a broader array of factors in 

determining whether there is prejudice than a simple 

21 application of Fulminante's direct appeal post-trial 

22 standards. 

23  It is also the case that the application of 

24 Fulminante will substantially increase the amount of 

speculation which courts have to engage in compared with 

8

1 applying the proper Hill v. Lockhart test. 

2  Hill v. Lockhart limits the amount of 

3 speculation by focusing on the defendant's motive in 

4 pleading guilty and whether the ineffective assistance 

could have influenced that decision to plead guilty. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about Judge Berzon's 

7 test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common 

8 sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you 

9 have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea 

bargain? The confession certainly -- it -- this serves 

11 the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on 

12 the prosecution's side. 

13  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I would say two 

14 things: First, the test which is proposed by Judge 

Berzon in the concurrence has never been recognized or 

16 promulgated by this Court. So in a collateral 

17 proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2254, it would not 

18 be clearly established law that the State court was 

19 required to follow.

 And second, application of that standard, as 

21 Judge Bybee noted in his concurrence, would require an 

22 immense amount of speculation. In this case, the 

23 majority in the Ninth Circuit hypothesized that filing 

24 the motion to suppress the confession would strengthen 

the defendant's position in negotiation vis-à-vis the 

9

1 Government. 

2  It is also very possible, however, that the 

3 Government would respond to filing a motion as opposed 

4 to taking an early offer of guilty plea by taking the 

case to the grand jury, seeking an aggravated murder 

6 charge, and thus, putting the defendant in a worse 

7 position in the case. And, in fact, as Judge Bybee 

8 noted, he questioned whether the courts have the proper 

9 tools to be able to speculate years after the guilty 

plea whether a particular motion may have increased or 

11 may have decreased the amount of leverage that a 

12 defendant has, or what kind of response that that motion 

13 might have drawn from the prosecution. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: But you have to, don't you? 

I mean, what's the alternative? I mean, imagine a case 

16 where it's clear there was a malpractice or an 

17 inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago 

18 and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or 

19 not? It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he 

would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded 

21 guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to 

22 figure out whether that's so? 

23  MR. KROGER: Your Honor -­

24  JUSTICE BREYER: It can't be the State 

always wins and it can't be the defendant always wins.

1 So -- so what's the alternative? 

2  MR. KROGER: I think the alternative, Your 

3 Honor, is application of Hill v. Lockhart, which looks 

4 not at speculation about how this could or could not 

have affected the plea bargaining process, but looks 

6 very concretely at the defendant's pretrial 

7 decision-making process and examines the record to 

8 determine why the defendant pled guilty and whether they 

9 can prove with a reasonable probability that he would 

not have pled guilty -­

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but that is -- isn't 

12 that -- sorry, maybe we are just quibbling. I -- I 

13 don't quite see it. That would seem to me to be going 

14 into the plea bargaining process. Would he have pleaded 

guilty, what would have happened? 

16  MR. KROGER: I -- I think the difference, 

17 Your Honor, is that when you are applying 

18 Hill v. Lockhart, you almost always have at least three 

19 very concrete pieces evidence to show the defendant's 

state of mind. You have the defendant's own testimony 

21 or deposition, or in this case both. You have the trial 

22 counsel's affidavit for testimony about the 

23 decision-making process his client engaged in, and then 

24 you have the guilty plea colloquy itself.

 So you always have a -- a concrete record

1 that the court years later can review in order to 

2 determine what motivated the -- the decision to plead 

3 guilty. 

4  If one were applying Judge Berzon's proposed 

alternative prejudice finding, one would have to engage 

6 in a great deal of speculation. One would, I presume, 

7 have defense counsel and the government make claims 

8 about what they might have done in response to 

9 hypotheticals, which does not seem to be a -- a -- a 

reasonably judicable standard. As a -­

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Without any 

12 confession -- forget about the brother or the 

13 girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession, 

14 wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that 

without any confession whatsoever that the plea 

16 bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would 

17 have been appreciably higher and that the prosecutor 

18 would have had to offer something -­

19  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, if none of -- none 

of the three confessions -­

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: None of the three -­

22  MR. KROGER -- had been made. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whatsoever. I mean, 

24 if the brother's confession -- or the confession to the 

brother is a very big piece of why a plea would have 

12

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 been reasonable in this case. Let's assume no 

2 confession. 

3  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I still think 

4 taking, recommending a guilty plea and taking of a 

guilty plea would be a rational response to the 

6 remaining evidence. Even at this early stage in the 

7 proceeding, the police had uncovered certainly the body 

8 with the direct shot to the temple. It had recovered 

9 the -- the murder weapon. It had recovered the car 

which the defendants had borrowed and which had blood in 

11 the trunk where the victim had been locked and 

12 transported. 

13  They had four witnesses who were present 

14 when the plan to kidnap and assault the victim was 

hatched. So they would have testified very directly 

16 about the forming of the plot. 

17  There was an eyewitness who identified the 

18 defendant, Mr. Moore, at the trailer where the victim 

19 was abducted. And then, of course, there was a 

co-conspirator, Mr. Salyer, who was cooperating with the 

21 Government prior to the confession and whose -- whose 

22 cooperation was known to the defendant. 

23  So, with all of those pieces, even if one 

24 stripped the three confessions out of the case, you 

would still have a situation where the Government 's 

13

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 case was strong, where there was a very severe risk the 

2 Government would go to the grand jury and obtain an 

3 aggravated murder charge, and where there was 

4 significant advantages to pleading early and locking in 

a lower sentence to a felony murder charge. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kroger, from -­

7 General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take 

8 it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging 

9 the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate? 

You are not contesting that the confession was 

11 involuntary? You seem to be putting everything on the 

12 prejudice issue; is that right? 

13  MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor. We -- we 

14 concede and forfeited the issue that the -- the motion 

to suppress would have been meritorious, but believed 

16 the district court got it right when it held that on 

17 both prongs of Strickland, both on deficient performance 

18 and on prejudice, the defendant has failed to make 

19 his -- his -- meet his burden of proof.

 I think the -- the prejudice argument here 

21 is extraordinarily strong, but I think the deficient 

22 performance, even if one concedes that the motion would 

23 have been meritorious, the deficient performance prong 

24 is strong as well, because the defendant can't meet his 

burden of proof that defense counsel's representation 

14

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 was unreasonable, given the strength of the government's 

2 case, given the quality of the plea offer that was made, 

3 and given the defendant's own reasoning for why he pled 

4 guilty.

 The case has significant practical 

6 consequences for the criminal justice system. One is 

7 that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion stands, it will be 

8 much easier to challenge guilty pleas years after the 

9 fact on collateral challenge, and this will undercut the 

principle of finality. One would certainly expect to 

11 see fewer Government plea offers in cases like this, if 

12 the Government believed years later it would have to 

13 present all of its trial evidence in a collateral 

14 proceeding in order to rebut the presumption under 

Fulminante that there was prejudice. 

16  Second, it has severe implications for the 

17 freedom of defense counsel to exercise its discretion 

18 and represent its client using the wide latitude that 

19 Strickland recognized was necessary. Strickland itself 

stated that it's a mistake to hem in defense counsel 

21 with strict rules about what should or should not be 

22 done, because defense counsel needs that wide latitude. 

23 If there is a -- a virtual presumption that motions to 

24 suppress must be filed, even where defense counsel 

reasonably believes it will not resound to the advantage

4  JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if he had gone to 

trial, what's the sentence -- what's the range of 

6 sentence he could have gotten? 

7  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, if he had gone to 

8 trial on the charges that were pending, and these -­

9 these were not charges from the grand jury, he would 

have faced at least the mandatory minimum of 25 years 

11 that he pled guilty to, plus the potential of 

12 additional -- an additional sentence both on that charge 

13 perhaps as high as life, given the two other potential 

14 mandatory minimum sentences of -- of kidnapping and 

assault that could be brought.

17 to the grand jury, as the prosecutor I guess could have 

18 done, it could have gone to the grand jury?

23 gotten? 

24  MR. KROGER: It could have been a capital 

case, Your Honor. This could have been an aggravated

1 murder case because the facts involved a very severe 

2 beating to the extent perhaps of torture where a 

3 Defendant who was very vulnerable who had a protruding 

4 hernia that was in a truss was savagely beaten, his nose 

was broken, he was locked in the trunk of the car, taken 

6 to a remote location and shot in the temple with one 

7 shot of a revolver. 

8  It is distinctly possible that the state 

9 would have come from the Grand Jury as a capital case 

and at the very least have been an aggravated murder 

11 carrying a life sentence, not a 25-year sentence. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about his argument 

13 that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising 

14 out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he 

ended up getting that exact same sentence that this 

16 Defendant did? 

17  MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Salyer 

18 did receive the same sentence after he went to trial. 

19 His case, though, was very different from that of the 

Petitioner, because the Petitioner was the individual 

21 who cocked the pistol and fired the round into the head 

22 of the victim killing him. And so it is very unlikely 

23 that the other two co-conspirators would have found 

24 themselves charged with an intentional murder based on 

the facts of this case. But because this pistol could

1 only be fired if it were cocked and because the round 

2 went into the temple, it would have been a reasonably 

3 strong aggravated murder case against this Defendant who 

4 was the triggerman.

 The final point I would like to make to the 

6 Court is that this case involves or should involve 

7 significant deference to the State court decision. This 

8 was not a summary denial by the State court. The State 

9 court held a hearing at which it received all testimony 

that was available. It made very explicit findings of 

11 fact about the facts in the case. It made a credibility 

12 finding about the evidence that had been submitted by 

13 the Petitioner, and it ruled after citing the proper 

14 Strickland standard that the Defendant had failed to 

carry his burden of proof. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little hard when we 

17 take away the finding that the confession was 

18 admissible. We have to extract that. 

19  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, even if you -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure what to 

21 do with the State court's case, assuming we have to 

22 presume, because of the posture of the case, that the 

23 confession was inadmissible. 

24  MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I would say two 

things with respect to that. First of all, the State 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 court's decision, even if it were incorrect in its 

2 ruling that the confession would not have been 

3 admissible, the State court's conclusion that the motion 

4 would not have assisted the Defendant in any way, the 

finding that it would have been fruitless because of the 

6 other confessions, the other two confessions in the 

7 case, is a reasonable decision that the Court made and 

8 is dispositive and thus under AEDPA should receive 

9 deference.

 I would also suggest the case is somewhat 

11 similar to Yarborough v. Alvarado. There was a custody 

12 issue at stake and this Court explicitly held that one 

13 might come out one way or the other on the custody 

14 issue, that reasonable jurists might split, but that 

that fact alone rendered the State court's opinion on 

16 voluntariness or on custody in that issue as reasonable. 

17  And again, as here, though we are not 

18 asserting that this confession was admissible, should 

19 the Court consider it, it's clearly a close question on 

voluntariness and somewhat factually similar to 

21 Yarborough where even if the State court were was wrong, 

22 it was still a reasonable adjudication of the claims. 

23  If there were no further questions from the 

24 Court, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder 

of my time for rebuttal.

2  Mr. Wax? 

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN T. WAX 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. WAX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

6 please the Court: 

7  Mr. Moore established prejudice under Hill 

8 from his attorney's failure to recognize the 

9 involuntariness and inadmissibility of the lengthy tape 

recorded statement obtained from him by the police. The 

11 most critical type of evidence that the State can have 

12 in any case. 

13  The Ninth Circuit's conclusion to that 

14 effect was correct, and was correctly based on this 

Court's precedence of Strickland, Hill, and Kimmelman. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am having a little bit 

17 of trouble here with your argument for the following 

18 reasons. Assume we suppress the confession. Why is it 

19 unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded 

that the evidence showing your client's presence at the 

21 shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was 

22 solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense 

23 that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all. 

24  Once you put him in this shooting, then the 

only issue he seems to be confused about is that he

1 thinks that because it was accidental that that presents 

2 a defense to felony murder. And that's clearly an 

3 erroneous position on his part. 

4  So what made the case so weak that the 

Government was never going without the confession to 

6 prove felony murder? 

7  MR. WAX: Well, Your Honor, we believe that 

8 the case is not as the State would have it, a strong 

9 case in the absence of this confession.

 We also believe that the proper focus is not 

11 solely on the strength of the State's case, and that 

12 under Hill it is necessary to look at the totality of 

13 the circumstances, and look for the objective factors in 

14 this record that inform the decision of what Mr. Moore 

would have done or would have been likely to have done 

16 in the absence of his counsel's mistakes. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: What does your office do in 

18 this situation, all right, a client is indicted in 

19 Federal court and you anticipate that there are all 

sorts of motions that you might make if this case is 

21 going to trial, but at an early point the prosecution 

22 offers you what looks like a really good plea bargain. 

23 Now do you litigate all those motions? If you have, you 

24 know, you have a chance of winning, of suppressing some 

statements that your client made, suppressing physical

1 evidence, getting certain evidence excluded with a 

2 motion in limine, maybe you could win on a severance 

3 motion, do you think you litigate all those rather than 

4 grabbing a good plea deal when it's offered to you?

 MR. WAX: Your Honor, the answer is 

6 certainly no, we do not litigate all of the motions. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: So if you take the deal, 

8 then you want it later to be open to the Defendant if 

9 he's not, you know, after the Defendant has spent some 

time in jail, he's not too happy with the deal any more, 

11 he can now come back and say, well, the Federal public 

12 defender's office was ineffective because they could 

13 have moved to suppress my confession and the illegal 

14 search, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that is all 

open for relitigation years later? 

16  MR. WAX: No, Your Honor. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: No? 

18  MR. WAX: And the issue here is not as we 

19 have attempted to articulate in our brief solely and in 

the abstract the failure to file the motion. The 

21 problem is that Mr. Moore's attorney did not understand 

22 that the statement was suppressible. In the situation 

23 that you are putting to me, if I or an assistant in my 

24 office says to a client, look, there is a strong motion 

to suppress the confession, the drugs, what have you,

1 but here are other factors that we should look at. And 

2 at the conclusion and with that proper advice the client 

3 decides I will take the deal, then I have performed 

4 effectively, and the case is not one that could be 

subject to a collateral attack as this case is. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have been the 

7 defense? 

8  MR. WAX: Excuse me, Your Honor. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have been the 

defense absent the confession? You have one at trial on 

11 the confession, suppressing it, how would he have defend 

12 the this case? 

13  MR. WAX: Your Honor, he would have been 

14 able to defend this case first by articulating the 

Government's obligation to prove his guilt beyond a 

16 reasonable doubt. You take out the confession and you 

17 posit it in your questioning of Attorney General Kroger 

18 that the strength of his brother's confession is a 

19 given. We respectfully disagree. The brother Raymond 

is a police -­

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What motive would his 

22 brother have had to put him at the scene of this

accidentally -- this gun went accidentally off.

1  MR. WAX: At pages 205 and 206 in the 

2 appendix in the findings of fact and conclusions of law, 

3 there are 11 findings of fact. In one of those findings 

4 of fact, in findings of fact 8 and 9, the State court 

used the word fruitless in describing the motion to 

6 suppress. In the conclusions of law the State court 

7 solely addressed Strickland. And nowhere in the 

8 analysis is there any reference to the question of what 

9 Mr. Moore would have done.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't Strickland require 

11 that it be prejudicial? 

12  MR. WAX: Yes, of course. However, the 

13 analysis that was undertaken here never reached the 

14 question of what Mr. Moore would have done.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If I assume that the word 

16 "fruitless" and the reference to Strickland were a

1 general has identified. There is also as we perceive it 

2 no question but that the objective record showed that 

3 the brother's testimony would have been highly 

4 impeachable based on his prior work as an informant, his 

description of himself -­

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Impeachable how? What 

7 motive did he have to implicate his brother? You still 

8 haven't answered that question. All you keep saying is, 

9 he was a past cooperator, he had no pending charges, and 

now he has a motive to do this against his brother 

11 because of that? 

12  MR. WAX: Your Honor, I cannot point in the 

13 record to a motive. What I can point to is the fact 

14 that there is in the record his self-description of 

himself as the golden boy for the police, his working 

16 with the same detective who interrogated his brother 

17 years before when he completely avoided a murder charge. 

18  And as a defense attorney, in a case 

19 involving a group of men who are not necessarily as 

socialized and well educated as some other group, that 

21 his testimony would have been subject to impeachment. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Even without his testimony, 

23 isn't there a very strong case of kidnapping? Let's 

24 just take it step-by-step. What would have been the 

defense to the kidnapping charge?

1  MR. WAX: The defense to the kidnapping 

2 charge in the absence of the confessions could well have 

3 been a mere presence defense, that Mr. Moore did not 

4 participate in the kidnapping. He had every right to 

put the State to his -- to its burden of proof. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: He didn't -- that he didn't 

7 go to the -- to the victim's RV with the other men? 

8 That would have been the defense? 

9  MR. WAX: He could certainly have argued 

that he did not participate in the kidnapping. He's 

11 there, he's in the car, and he had no participation in 

12 it. But what I believe is being missed in this 

13 discussion, if I may, is the focus on the question 

14 required to be analyzed in Hill. Would Mr. Moore have 

gone to trial? Would he have accepted the plea?

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wax, just to clear 

19 out some of the underbrush, the Ninth Circuit did say 

that Fulminante was really established law controlling 

21 this case. I take it that you are not defending that?

23 established law that governs here is Strickland, Hill

1 other -- I've got -- the other reason I asked the 

2 question, to be clear about it, is that -- is that he 

3 wouldn't have gone to trial in my mind unless he had a 

4 pretty good chance of getting a better deal. And what 

he -- like getting off. And what he got was the
 

6 minimum. Okay?
 

7  One thing I've written down is that the
 

8 State would not have the confession. That's correct.

good brother. Moreover he's a rather dubious character 

11 there, and bring all that -- stuff. Was there anything 

12 else?

anything. 

16

 MR. WAX: Yes, Your Honor.
 

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to miss
 

MR. WAX: Yes, Your Honor. What we have in
 

17 this record is highly unusual combination of four facts 

18 appearing at three different stages in the proceeding. 

19 First, from his attorney, who articulated this in the 

sentencing -- it's in the supplemental appendix at page 

21 7: Mr. Moore had a very difficult time accepting the 

22 fact that this was a felony murder charge, or a felony 

23 murder offer. That leads directly to the fact that Mr. 

24 Moore did not plead guilty.

 This is only a nolo plea. And while in some

1 circumstances the court will equate a nolo plea with a 

2 plea of guilty, in these circumstances the fact that he 

3 entered a nolo plea only is highly significant on the 

4 question of whether or not he would have rolled the 

dice. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And a competent -- and a 

7 competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational 

8 client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let 

9 him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought 

against him, or a capital murder charge brought against 

11 him, and not -- and just go ahead? And try the case 

12 because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to 

13 trial, take the plea, because you're irrational? 

14  MR. WAX: Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's really what you 

16 are saying, that a competent attorney would not 

17 recommend to his client take the plea, and that his 

18 client wouldn't ultimately accept the plea, because the 

19 objective reality is his upside horrible and his 

downside is almost a given. 

21  MR. WAX: Your Honor, a competent counsel 

22 might advise his counsel to accept a plea. The question

6 and the court of appeals did not in fact apply the test 

7 of Hill, which you are asserting. The test is whether 

8 he would have gone to trial. I -- I didn't read the

4 courts almost always discount them. What we have here, 

we submit, is something more significant, and that is he 

6 did not want to enter a plea. He did not enter a plea, 

7 and then at the first opportunity that he learned that 

8 his attorney had been ineffective, he moved to undo the 

9 conviction. And we submit that the decision in 

Roe v. Flores-Ortega, in which this Court found it 

11 highly significant that Flores-Ortega moved to initiate 

12 an appeal at the first opportunity that he learned that 

13 the appeal had been lost, is applicable here.

currently before this Court, is a challenge to the 

6 admissibility of the eyewitness identification at the

16 understand that any admissions, statements, or 

17 confessions which I may have made or any evidence 

18 obtained by virtue of the search and seizure of my 

19 property may well be inadmissible against me in 

evidence, unless my constitutional rights have been

9  MR. WAX: Your Honor, he had previously been

11 was questioned in the post-conviction proceeding before 

12 the point of the prejudice under Hill, he says: I acted

19 agreement later -- later coming in and saying: Oh, my

 And while a plea petition form is standard

7 recognized this was an accident. 

8  This was a tragedy. The judge saying, 

9 Mr. Moore, the person who had led a good, law-abiding 

life, a person who had been a productive member of -­

11  JUSTICE ALITO: I have to say, I think 

12 that's a very aggressive reading of what was said here. 

13 It was not necessary for the plea to this offense to 

14 prove an intent to kill, and the statement that the 

intent that was necessary, which is lesser intent but 

16 sufficient to support this plea, was present is not a 

17 statement that a greater mens rea was absent. 

18  And I thought you argued to us that the 

19 prosecutor said this was not intentional. It was an 

accident. 

21  MR. WAX: Well, I believe, Your Honor, that 

22 is the portion to the record to which I am referring at 

23 page 228. He also described at the sentencing the facts 

24 of the case as facts involving and consistent with the 

slip and the fall.

1  His description of the incident is a 

2 description of Mr. Rogers falling back into the gun. He 

3 did that both at the plea, which I believe is on page 

4 227, and he did it again at the sentencing. And then he 

is followed by the judge, who articulates the 

6 circumstances of this case as involving two tragedies: 

7 To be sure, the death of Mr. Rogers, but also the 

8 tragedy of Mr. Moore having accidentally killed his 

9 friend.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL JOHN R. KROGER 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

17  MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

18 please the Court: 

19  The Court of Appeals here did not apply 

clearly established Federal law, but applied, for the 

21 first time in a way that is non-mandated by the 

22 decisions of this Court, Fulminante to a collateral 

23 proceeding. 

24  The State court's adjudication of this claim 

was eminently reasonable on both prongs of Strickland.

1 Accordingly, we would ask this Court to reverse the 

2 judgment of the Ninth Circuit and to affirm the judgment 

3 of the district court. 

4  I would be happy to answer any additional 

questions that the Court may have. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

7  Counsel, the case is submitted.
