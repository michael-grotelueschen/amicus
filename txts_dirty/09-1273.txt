 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 09-1273, Astra USA v. Santa 

Clara County.

 Ms. Blatt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 There are three reasons why section 340B 

entities do not have a cause of ation to enforce the 

pharmaceutical pricing agreement between the Secretary 

and manufacturers.

 The first reason is that this common law 

breach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an 

implied right of action to enforce the statute, a right 

Respondent concedes it does not have.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand that. 

A private contract is just that. Two parties go into 

the contract. They set the terms of their deal. No one 

forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal. So 

why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said: 

What was the intent of the parties to the contract? You 

want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private

deal between you. And Congress may have specified some 

terms to include, but -­

MS. BLATT: Yes. And the -- what is being 

challenged here is the contractual term that 

incorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling 

price obligations under the Act, and a third-party 

beneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the 

same right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the 

same disruptions as a right of action to enforce the 

statute.

 And another way of saying that is, if the 

case begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed 

340B entities from bringing an implied right of action 

through the front door, Congress did not leave the back 

door open to essentially the same suit.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you answer the 

point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure 

regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a 

contract? It would have just passed a statute that says 

anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States 

or to the 340B entities -- you can't charge more than 

this price.

 Why do we even need a contract, unless 

inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's 

administering it?

MS. BLATT: Right. Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Discretion that is 

consistent with normal contract principles.

 MS. BLATT: Right. Well, our position is 

obviously that the parties had no discretion to confer 

Article III power on courts to enforce an Act of 

Congress, and this is. But the -- the basic answer is 

that there has always been a huge difference between the 

settled rule that parties to a statutory contract are 

enforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce 

the contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously 

clear language that the parties could sue. That's the 

way statutory contracts must work. They must be 

enforceable.

 But your answer, sort of as a practical 

matter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a 

contract, and we do think that the Federal law of 

contracts and contractual remedies flow between the 

parties to the contract. It's a bilateral agreement, 

it's not a regulation, and the Secretary made specific 

enforceable promises. And there's obviously no even 

operation of the statutory mandate without the contract.

 But the reverse, in terms of the -- the 

long-settled rule that parties must be able to sue to 

enforce a contract, there's an equally settled rule that

beneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to 

enforce it unless there's a cause of action.

 Now, the test that I think Respondent 

advocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test 

this Court has long since discarded, which is: Well, 

I'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is 

sensible. Even if you don't buy our test of you have to 

imply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are 

neither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress 

intended. And here's why.

 And it is basically the second and third 

reasons. So no matter how you come at this case and the 

lens through which you look at this, I think everyone 

should come out to the same place, which is that neither 

Congress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed 

up to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000 

lawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the 

pricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary claims 

you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make 

the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary. 

Have you given up that argument?

 MS. BLATT: No. I think that the -- that 

the whole thrust of the petition -- and obviously the 

primary argument is that this flouts the implied right

of action jurisprudence and it -- it conflicts with 

congressional intent in all events. But one of the 

harms, and sort of illustrating just how bad the 

decision was, is this conferred rights that the parties 

never imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not 

intend.

 But I -- I think that, in our view, even if 

the Secretary had wanted to, it's not the Secretary's 

decision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go 

contract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar 

health care program that incorporates another, even 

bigger multi-billion dollar health care program -- we're 

going to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on 

the face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision 

by Congress to withhold -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Private enforcement.

 MS. BLATT: Private enforcement -- to 

withhold a private remedy in favor of 340B entities and, 

instead, channel exclusive authority to the Secretary to 

enforce it. And those three specifics, in addition to 

the disruption, are that Congress gave manufacturers, 

but not 340B entities, a private reimbursement remedy 

and a private -­

sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or

unusual that the agreement is between the Federal 

Government and private entities, as opposed to what I 

think is the more typical situation in which these cases 

come up, where it's, say, an agreement between the 

Federal Government and a State?

 MS. BLATT: Well, all your Medicaid cases, 

obviously, under State plans -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MS. BLATT: -- and a lot of your implied 

right of action jurisprudence is dealing with Spending 

Clause legislation as to State entities. But there are 

a number, a number -- the Rehabilitation Act, the 

Davis-Bacon Act, and a fair number of health care 

programs -- where the government contracts with private 

parties as a public welfare mechanism to get to what I 

think are conceded are beneficiaries.

 Here, there's a number of beneficiaries. 

It's not just the 340B entities. It's the patient 

population that's being served and, obviously, the 

Federal fisc. So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, would you 

explain the function that the contract mechanism serves? 

I mean, you could just have this -- you could just have 

the statute say: Thou shalt not charge more than the 

ceiling price. Period.

What -- what is accomplished by having the 

contract reflecting the terms of the statute?

 MS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's any 

different than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where 

Congress wants to specify the terms of the contract, and 

the contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory 

terms. And if there's a breach of that, there are 

contractual remedies that flow.

 But I agree with you that there's not a 

whole lot difference between our position and the 

Government, because the Government is absolutely correct 

that it's in haec verba and identical, and the statutory 

obligation that we're talking about that's incorporated 

into the contract is that a certain ceiling price must 

be charged.

 But the -- the other sort of practical 

function is only manufacturers who enter into this 

contract are subject to these price controls. So if 

they -- a pharmaceutical manufacturer doesn't want to 

participate in the program, they're not covered.

 And in a typical regulation and I think 

general sort of Spending Clause analysis, someone who 

accepts Federal funding has considered sort of implicit 

consent to the funding obligations because they're 

taking the money. But here's there's an express

manifestation both by the Secretary who signed the 

agreement and the contractors, the pharmaceutical 

companies who signed the agreement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Before the statute was 

amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there 

was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess 

penalties?

 MS. BLATT: Well -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- and the reason 

I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government 

had a contract remedy. It seemed to me it had a 

regulatory remedy.

 MS. BLATT: It has got a lot of remedies. 

It has -- but it -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the contract 

remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which 

was before the -- these mechanisms.

 MS. BLATT: Yes. They're -- right. We are 

still -- today is no different than yesterday, because 

nothing has happened to implement the 2010 health care 

reform except that there are now more civil monetary 

penalties than there were.

 But the government has statutory penalties, 

civil monetary penalties, a right of audit. It can 

bring suits under the False Claims Act and can terminate

both this agreement and the Medicaid rebate agreement.

 But as a -- the government has contractual 

remedies, too. I mean, why Congress, I think -- a 

sensible inference for why Congress picked contracts is 

that this is -- this piggybacks off the Medicaid rebate 

program, and that uses contracts. And that instead -­

that in turn, rather, used contracts because the States 

had negotiated rebate agreements with drug companies way 

before 1990. And so Congress continued the contract 

feature.

 And then, since the pricing components under 

this program are the same pricing components under the 

Medicaid rebate program, both programs are parallel and 

that both use agreement, one is the Medicaid rebate 

agreement. In this case, it's the pharmaceutical -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Blatt, you said that 

there's not a whole lot of difference between your 

position and the Government's. What is the difference 

between your position and the Government's?

 MS. BLATT: Well, the Government says a 

contract is not a contract even though it says it's a 

contract. Our position is this a contract.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make much 

sense, does it?

 MS. BLATT: The -- the Government sees this,

I think, as just a unilateral -- that the manufacturers 

walked in and said we're here and happy to be bound. 

But the agreement on its face says the Secretary makes 

the following agreement; the Secretary promises this.

 The most important promise the Secretary 

made to manufacturers is that the Secretary said that 

she would not terminate the agreement without good 

cause, 60 days' notice, and certain conduct that the 

manufacturer did would not constitute grounds for 

termination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did the manufacturer 

promise in exchange for a contract? You do need 

consideration. What did they promise that they weren't 

already obliged to do by law?

 MS. BLATT: Well, the billions and billions 

in price discounts they were not obliged to do unless 

they -- they signed the contract. But the contract goes 

through a ton of manufacturer responsibilities. The 

manufacturer -- if the Secretary thinks that there is 

reimbursement that's owed, the Secretary can order 

reimbursement, and the manufacturer has -- it's a -­

doesn't, but they do. So what are they supposed to do 

if they're right? How do they get the money?

 MS. BLATT: Well, the way they have been 

getting the money, and for better or worse until 2010, 

they have been at the mercy of the vastly larger 

Medicaid rebate program, which is run on behalf of the 

States. And because this program is so small compared 

to that program, all the enforcement activity, which is 

all the False Claims Act settlements that Respondent 

cites in his brief, that's how, as a practical matter, 

it's been enforced.

procedurally what are they supposed to do?

Secretary and say we would like the Secretary to order 

them to give us the money; they're violating this? They 

go to an administrative law judge. Is there an 

administrative remedy of some kind that would be 

reviewable in the courts for reasonableness?

 MS. BLATT: There's just -- right now, 

there's just an informal, non-mandatory -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it 

reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have 

entered into a contract which is going to benefit them 

and there's no remedy?

 MS. BLATT: Because the statute itself said: 

We're going to go out of our way to give manufacturers 

remedies, make this confidential; manufacturers have 

rights of audit, but 340B entities don't. The Secretary 

-- here's a vast arsenal of things at your disposal, and 

it's channeled through that regulatory regime.

from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong, 

there's a remedy.

administrative, could be judicial, et cetera. But

you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary, 

there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a 

False Claims Act.

 MS. BLATT: Well, it's not a private party. 

It's the private party who's assigned the claim. I 

mean, the case is brought in the name of, and it is a 

case by the United States. And that's significant 

because the United States has complete and total control 

over that case. Here, the problem -- it's bad enough -­

 MS. BLATT: Yes, that's right. It's still 

brought in the name of the United States with heightened 

pleading requirements, and they actually have to allege 

a knowing false statement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you emphasize 

that the contract has the language in haec verba of the 

statute. What if -- what if it doesn't?

 The statute imposes certain provisions. The 

pricing I guess is the key one. But in a private deal,

when you're arranging for the delivery of, you know, 

pharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions. 

It's got to be delivered by this much. You've got to 

have this much inventory. You've got to -- whatever.

 I mean, what if the contract here included 

terms beyond those in the statute? Could those be 

enforced by the third-party beneficiaries?

 MS. BLATT: Yes. And there is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?

 MS. BLATT: If it's not enforced in the 

statute -- only if -- and I think it's significant that 

plaintiffs always lose under a third-party beneficiary 

because the bar is so high. The government always 

enters into contracts on behalf of somebody, and the 

government rarely intends to confer enforceable rights, 

and the parties rarely do it.

 But if you had an express provision outside 

the statute that said we intend to confer enforceable 

rights on third parties, and it's not an enforcement of 

the statute at all, then all your jurisprudence for 

determining congressional intent aren't being subverted 

and aren't being undermined.

 I could give you an example. I mean, it 

could be anywhere from something just completely outside 

the statute. Together, the pharmaceutical companies

could say we hereby agree to make a contribution every 

year to the clinic or hospital for a holiday gift. That 

would be an odd contract. I don't see the Secretary 

entering into third-party beneficiary contracts. A much 

more efficient way would just be to contract with the 

entity itself.

 But I think this is just another way of 

saying that a lot of the energy and breath in the court 

of appeals would be saved in going through why the 

common law doesn't confer it because congressional 

intent, by and large, is going to line up with the 

Secretary, the party's intent.

 But when you're talking in haec verba, and 

this could not be more precise because it's the exact -­

it's actually not even 340B. The allegation is it's a 

violation of the Medicaid Rebate Act pricing reporting 

requirements. It's -- congressional intent is all that 

matters.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a contract with the 

Secretary or a contract with the United States executed 

on behalf of the United States by the Secretary?

 MS. BLATT: It is a contract executed by

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The pharmaceutical pricing agreement should 

not be construed to permit 340B entities to bring suit 

to enforce drug manufacturers' price reporting 

requirements for two reasons: First, the PPA is not an 

ordinary contract, and it does not transform the 340B

program from a regulatory scheme into a contractual one. 

Like a Medicare provider -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it a 

contract at all?

 MS. ANDERS: It's not an ordinary contract 

in that it doesn't give rise to contract rights in 

the -- in the regulated entities. This is very similar 

to Medicare provider agreements, in which a health care 

provider who wants to enter into the Medicare program 

and provide services agrees -- signs an agreement in 

which he agrees to abide by the statutes and regulations 

set forth in the Medicare program and, in return for 

that agreement, is given the opportunity to participate 

in the Medicaid -- in the Medicare program.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do we distinguish 

between what you call an ordinary contract and this sort 

of a contract, if it's any kind of contract?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think when the statute 

directs an agency to enter into an agreement for the 

sole purpose of memorializing the parties' opt-in to the 

regulatory scheme and directs -- directs what the terms 

shall be, so here provides statutorily what the 

reporting requirements will be, that's when the 

contract is simply a regulatory mechanism.

me you're taking -- then your -- then your co-counsel is 

right; you're agreeing with her totally. If Congress 

wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to 

give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement 

and enforce this, and the Secretary says I don't have 

the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a 

contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of 

action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it -­

you're taking the position that the Secretary is without 

authority to do this?

 MS. ANDERS: I think it would be a difficult 

question. I think it would be a difficult argument to 

say that the Secretary was completely without authority. 

I think what has happened here is the Secretary has 

reasonably interpreted the statute in providing for an 

agreement between the Secretary and the manufacturers to 

simply mark the opt-in.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs the 

question that Justice Alito asked you, which is: If we 

go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some 

sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference, 

and do we need to go that far? Isn't your position -- I 

thought half of your -- other half of your position was 

that this is not a third-party intended beneficiary.

 All the terms of the contract are between

the manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations 

to the Secretary, not the obligations to the third 

parties.

 MS. ANDERS: That's exactly right. I 

think -- to take the first part of your question, I 

think the Court can tell when this is a regulatory 

contract when the statute itself simply directs the 

agency to enter into an agreement that -- that contains 

the terms that are set forth in the statute. And when 

you look at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is a 

regulatory scheme.

 The government is not acting as a 

contracting party here. It's acting as a regulator. It 

has the authority to impose administrative penalties 

which would be reviewed under the APA. There's no 

transaction that's taking place with the government. 

The only rules governing the conduct are statutory. So 

that's why we think you can tell that this is not an 

ordinary contract. It's a regulatory one.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a different -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean -- you mean 

there's no negotiated element to it? It's what the 

statute -- it's the same as Ms. Blatt said? It's -- the 

contract repeats the words, the terms of the statute, 

and that's it; is that what you mean?

MS. ANDERS: That's right. This isn't a 

negotiated agreement. The Secretary has simply repeated 

the terms of the statute in the agreement. That's 

exactly right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could do this, I 

guess, by regulation, right?

 MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Issue a regulation 

saying manufacturers who participate in this program 

agree to do, you know, whatever your contract says.

 MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way 

to do it, yes. Throughout this area, though, Congress 

has often used agreements to mark entry into the 

regulatory scheme, including in the Medicare provider 

area, where you do have these agreements with health 

care providers. But it would be very odd, then, to say 

that the -- the entire area is regulated by breach of 

contract law rather than by the, you know, hundreds of 

pages of regulations and statutory provisions that 

govern the providers' rights there.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you tell us whether 

you agree with the Petitioner's argument in part D of 

its brief that private suits would seriously disrupt the 

comprehensive statutory scheme, in light of the position 

that the Government has taken in other litigation

involving actions brought by States, In re 

Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price 

Litigation in the District of Massachusetts?

 MS. ANDERS: We do agree with the 

Petitioners that -- that permitting third-party 

beneficiary suits here, if you construe this as a 

contract, would interfere with the government's ability 

to administer the statutory scheme. This is a national 

pricing scheme that's put together by the Medicaid 

Rebate Act, which has -- which is heavily regulated. 

Allowing 14,000 covered entities to bring individual 

suits in different courts without HHS consultation, 

without the benefit of the government's input, could 

lead to substantial dis-uniformity despite the fact that 

these are supposed to be national prices.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're walking away from 

your position in the District of Massachusetts? The 

States do not have, according to you, the right to 

enforce the rebate program?

 MS. ANDERS: No. That's actually an 

important point. I think in the Medicaid context the 

States have a cooperative relationship with the Federal 

Government. And so they receive some of these funds 

directly, and they have -- in fact, in the Medicaid Act, 

it is contemplated that they have their own enforcement

consult intensively with HHS. And so, in that respect, 

those suits represent the government's -­

reason you wouldn't say go ahead?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, in that sort of 

situation, you might be able to have a State law fraud 

suit -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to analogize it 

to the Massachusetts one. You say they can just go 

ahead and do it, and they say, you know, Santa Clara 

County is just as big as Rhode Island. And you say the 

AG of Rhode Island can bring the suit; am I right? And 

so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, in the covered entity 

context, the concern is that, because you have so many 

of them, if you -- if you start permitting covered 

entities to bring suit, you know, this is essentially a 

pre-emption question, but you then have 50 different 

State regimes, State court regimes, put onto -- grafted 

onto, the Medicaid rebate requirements.

 This is supposed to be a uniform pricing 

scheme. And so once the requirements become 

dis-uniform, it becomes very difficult for HHS to 

administer the scheme in the way that it's supposed to.

 I think it's also important to point out 

that the recently enacted Affordable Care Act will 

provide the exclusive administrative remedy for claims 

exactly like Respondent's once HHS puts that into

effect. So Congress, in looking at the scheme, to the 

extent it had concerns about enforcement by covered 

entities -- the way it reacted was not to create a 

private right of action or provide for breach of 

contract enforcement but was simply to give the agency 

enhanced authority in order to adjudicate the claims 

itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It identified the 

problem that the individual beneficiaries did not have a 

remedy? They -- or that courts had indicated that they 

didn't and they thought there should be a remedy?

 MS. ANDERS: There were -- there were OIG 

reports raising concerns with oversight and enforcement 

at a general level, and the way Congress reacted to that 

was to put in place this administrative remedy which 

will allow covered entities to bring these claims and 

will allow HHS to have the first opportunity to 

determine the meaning of the AMP and best price 

requirements, and to take into account -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt said nothing

but are there -- are there plans to implement it?

advanced notice of proposed rulemaking back in the fall.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I understand your 

position clearly, in a regulatory contract situation 

like this one the Secretary is without authority to 

decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer 

expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to 

the -- to the people receiving the benefit? That's the 

position you're taking?

 If the Secretary had written a provision 

into this contract telling 340B entities you can sue, 

that would have been, according to you, ultra vires?

 MS. ANDERS: I think it would be difficult 

to say that the agency would have been totally without 

authority to do that. It's not a question you have to 

answer here, because I think the PPA clearly shouldn't 

be construed to confer third-party beneficiary rights 

because that would be inconsistent with the statutory 

scheme.

MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 I'd like to start with Ms. Blatt's answer to 

your question about whether a provision of the agreement 

here could confer third-party beneficiary rights. She 

said yes, so long as the wording wasn't specifically 

prescribed by Congress. In so doing, she concedes that 

this is a contract, that normal rules of contract law 

apply, that the fact that the Secretary has entered into 

the contract is of no moment, and that third-party 

beneficiary rights are an inherent part of normal 

contract principles.

 So now we're left with the question, does it 

matter that Congress wrote the particular words that the 

Secretary used in the agreement?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Is the -­

MR. FREDERICK: We submit that the answer is 

no.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Third-party beneficiary 

rights are part of normal contracts, but the third-party 

beneficiary has rights under -- under the normal 

contract only when the parties intend him to have 

rights. It's not that every -- every contract which -­

which has a benefit for some person allows that person 

to sue. There has to be an intent. And I -- I have

trouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on 

the part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have 

had that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did 

not have the intent to allow private individuals to sue?

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, you find the 

intent in part II(a) of the agreement, which is set 

forth in the petition appendix. And in part II(a), the 

manufacturer who agrees voluntarily to enter into this 

agreement agrees that the entity -- that the entity will 

be charged only a set ceiling price.

 That is a voluntary agreement of a duty by 

the manufacturer that runs to the third-party 

beneficiary covered entities -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you didn't -- you 

didn't hear my question.

 MR. FREDERICK: -- who are specified in the 

agreement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: My question was the mere 

fact that there's a duty to a third party in the normal 

contract does not give that third party the right to 

sue, only if the contracting parties intend the 

third-party beneficiary to have a right to sue.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, that's not the 

standard, Justice Scalia.

MR. FREDERICK: The standard for a 

third-party beneficiary, as set forth in the Restatement 

and as recognized by this Court, is whether or not the 

parties objectively intended to create intended 

third-party beneficiaries whose right to bring the suit 

would enforce the contract. And that's precisely what 

we have here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me where -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought when this 

case went back to the -- to the district court, the -­

MR. FREDERICK: The 340B entities.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We never envisioned 

making them the beneficiaries and -- and allowing them 

to sue. That would be quite disruptive of our program. 

That, I thought, was the position the Government took.

 MR. FREDERICK: The Government cannot argue 

for subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years 

ago. This Court's decisions in contract have always 

held that the objective intent as expressed by the words 

of the contract are what courts are to construe.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I don't 

understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same 

as what you said. You said no, Justice Scalia, 

Restatement of Contracts. But what he said the question 

is whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an 

objective intent -- to confer these rights on a third 

person. And -- and you said no, no, that's not it. But 

then it seems to me that your answer that you gave was 

just what Justice Scalia said. I -- I missed something.

 MR. FREDERICK: Okay. Here's what I think I 

misunderstood perhaps from Justice Scalia's question. 

For third-party beneficiary rights to create an 

enforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the 

contract do not have to have a provision in the contract 

saying "and therefore the intended third parties get to 

bring a breach of contract claim." That's never been 

the accepted law.

 The law has always said if the parties 

intend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing 

of that suit to enforce the contract would be within the 

objective intent of the parties, such a suit is 

permissible.

 Now, I want to caution that what is 

different about this suit from the kinds of implied 

rights of action suits that the drug companies here

claim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for 

is the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to 

undertake.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could that be -- could there 

be -­

MR. FREDERICK: That bargain was -- was the 

discount. It's the delta between what the counties paid

the agreement.

Congress intended, to the extent it can intend 

something, for those beneficiaries to get the benefit of 

the price but did not intend for them to be able to sue?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So if there were -­

MR. FREDERICK: I think indirectly here, 

Justice Alito, that the patients here certainly are 

incidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't 

afford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the

county's expense. This is county money that we're 

talking about here. Or if they have some limited 

insurance, they're able to get the drugs at a discount.

 So they are certainly incidental 

beneficiaries, but because they are not named and 

because the intent of the program is to provide the 340B 

entities with discounted drugs so they can extend scarce 

dollars farther, they have no right to sue.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If there were a provision in 

the law saying expressly there is no private right of 

action under this statute, would you be able to make the 

same argument?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. Our argument rests on 

the silence of contract with respect to how enforcement 

would concur. It has long been the case, though, that 

where the parties intend to displace a third-party 

beneficiary's rights, the objective intent of the -- of 

the agreement is what is understood.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry. 

don't understand the distinction that you're ignoring in 

the law. I thought it was very clear that proof that 

you merely received the benefit in a -- by a contract is

enforceable right; is that correct? Is that the

statement of the common law?

 MR. FREDERICK: That is how the Restatement 

frames it. It's a -- it is a difficult line I think 

sometimes to understand the difference between an 

intended beneficiary and an incidental beneficiary. 

Certainly, the manufacturers here are incidental 

beneficiaries -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how -­

MR. FREDERICK: -- because they have access 

to this market.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how you want 

to draw this line, if the issue is what's the objective 

intent about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it 

makes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the 

government to provide the pricing information. It gives 

only the government the right to institute the informal 

dispute resolution system that the contract specifies. 

This is not the new law. This is the PPA as it existed 

at the time. It gives only the Secretary other 

enforcement rights.

 What am I missing? Where in the contract is 

there one provision, one sentence, one anything that 

requires the manufacturers, other than the price 

benefit, to do something that could be characterized as 

enforcement?

MR. FREDERICK: But that is the key, 

Justice Sotomayor. The price discount is where all the 

action is in this program. These prices, between 1990 

and 1992, were being raised by the drug manufacturers as 

against these entities, and the whole point of Congress 

enacting this statute was to confer the same discounted 

drug program to the covered entities as had been done 

through contracts to the State Medicaid rebate program.

 And that's why the provision in the 

amendment -- sorry, in the agreement that says thou 

shalt not charge the covered entities more than the 

ceiling price is exactly where you find the intended 

third-party beneficiary rights, because that's their 

money that's being spent. It's not Federal -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true -- that's 

true, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale 

price maintenance. You could -- the distributor and the 

manufacturer agree on the maximum resale price. Pretty 

unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended 

to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit. And I think, 

well, gee, I don't know. And what the Government is 

arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but 

they say there are two major points here that favor them 

about background. I want to hear what your reply is.

 One of them is Congress, in the statute that

it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be 

able to enforce it. And the second one is it's going to 

create a mess. All right? So they say those are two 

background features here that favor them.

 So what's your response?

 MR. FREDERICK: Number one, there's no 

evidence that Congress intended there to be a departure 

from normal operating contract principles, and this 

Court, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in 

Central Airlines -- all said that when Congress uses 

contracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the 

full cluster of the common law rights as they've 

existed. And third-party beneficiary rights have been 

recognized for 350 years, even before the founding of 

this republic.

 Now, as to the disruption, I think it's a 

canard, because what we're talking about here is one 

price that would govern all 14,500 covered entities. So 

if Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say, 

that is the best price, and it will be charged and 

chargeable to all of the 340B entities across the 

nation.

 So in terms of administrability, one suit 

actually can solve the deficiencies in the government 

enforcement program, and the government can participate

in this suit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does 

that cut? That seems to me to put an awful lot of power 

and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one 

lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit 

saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from 

this program; we think we should get less.

 And if they win, the whole country's -- the 

pricing of Lipitor under this program has changed.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That strikes me as 

an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the 

Secretary.

 MR. FREDERICK: No, I think it's an argument 

that may misunderstand some of the benefits that class 

action practice can provide, where there is a uniform 

way of analyzing the problem, because these prices,

exactly the same position as the other 57 counties of 

California and the other counties in the United States 

who are overpaying for drugs that the manufacturers 

are -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think 

about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here, 

but as I understand the development of this argument 

today, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go 

to the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit, 

okay? Or make us -- make me -- the lawyer says make me 

an assistant AG for this purpose. And I launch the 

lawsuit in the name of California, and then I can get to 

the same place.

 What do you think of that?

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't know that the 

State -- because these are entities that are not defined 

in the agreement. The -- this is a different agreement 

than under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set 

forth in the joint appendix, where the States are the 

third-party beneficiaries of those agreements.

 I'm not sure that the State actually has 

standing to bring these particular claims. That is not

something that has been tested. But what I would say is 

that if you reject our argument here, you are 

substantially undercutting the ability of the States to 

bring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug 

manufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program.

 That's what the States' amicus brief here 

makes clear. The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the 

very end of the Government's brief that does not set 

forth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B 

entities' third-party beneficiary rights are any 

different from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate 

program.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was because 

the States have been given a role in the statute itself, 

where the 340B entities have not. I thought that was 

the -- the Government's position, that the States have a 

role in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely 

different thing than this program, where these entities 

have no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and 

then HHS.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

think that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in 

the District of Massachusetts, which looked at the 

third-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving 

them a place at the table in bringing these kinds of

claims. And to the extent that that analysis bears out 

anything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's 

theory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that 

suggest a blurring of the normal lines between 

regulation and contract.

 That theory, the regulatory contract theory, 

has been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil 

Oil, where the Government tried to argue that because it 

was implementing regulatory policy through contracts, 

somehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this 

Court rejected that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the Government's 

footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract. It 

says that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis 

that the court applied in the District of Massachusetts 

case, but it was explaining why, in the Government's 

view, it's a different situation.

 And what it said, it's a different 

situation, not because of a different contract, but 

because in that other situation, Medicaid -- the 

Medicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, "a 

cooperative Federal-State program."

 I mean, their point is that the States are 

explicitly given authority for enforcement in that.

JUSTICE SCALIA: And here the entities 

you're representing are not.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, and that is 

why resort to the normal canons of construction that 

this Court has long applied to government contracts is 

what is most pertinent here. The Government, I don't 

think, can point to a specific provision of the 

cooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in 

any greater enforcement power than a normal third-party 

beneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to 

Central Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred 

years ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right 

to bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the 

absence of a specific enforcement power in the statute 

was not enough to deny the normal operation of law for 

the breached party to sue for that breach.

 That's common in the law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The big -- the big 

difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the 

States are sovereign. They can enforce their own laws. 

The entities at issue here are not sovereigns. They're 

not enforcing their own laws. They are trying to 

enforce Federal law. But under the -- under the 

Medicaid program, the States, using their own fraud -­

fraud actions, whatever else, have a role to play.

MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

think if you took that argument to its logical extreme, 

you would have come to a different answer in the Arthur 

Andersen case, where, there, you recognized a 

third-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to 

get an arbitration agreement upheld.

 And I think you would have come to a 

different result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in 

which the Court said that just because there is an FAA 

contract with a local airport authority does not deny a 

third-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an 

adverse effect on adjoining land because you would have 

said that, because the adjoining land owner had no 

specific enforcement authority, that person or entity 

would be out of luck. I think the -- this Court's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's Miree. 

That's 1977. And a lot of your argument, it seems to 

me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action 

jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last 

30 years.

 And what concerns me is when you are talking 

about the same language, the mere fact that the 

government has decided to go through a contractual 

mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to 

use that to get an end run around all of the implied

right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years. 

You're on stronger ground before that.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me address that 

directly, Mr. Chief Justice, because Justice Rehnquist, 

who was not any fan of implied rights of action, was the 

author for the Court's opinion in the Miree decision. 

And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was 

pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent 

with the established jurisprudence in this area then. 

But it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I 

think about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the 

other direction, to the point now where I think the 

jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to 

imply a private right of action at all.

 MR. FREDERICK: We're not asking you to 

imply a private right of action, Mr. Chief Justice. 

We're asking you to honor contract principles that have 

long -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The result is the same, 

Mr. Frederick. And that's -- I mean, it was a central 

point in this last brief. You can call it whatever you 

want. It's -- Congress has not provided for a private 

right of action to enforce the terms of the statute. 

The contract embodies the terms of statute. So it would

be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress, 

said we want private parties out of this; this is to be 

between the agency and the manufacturer to say. The 

same exact result. The same aim can be achieved through 

this third-party beneficiary route. And I think that 

said, that is the -- I mean, that is what stands out 

about this case.

 And so how do you respond to that? What's 

the difference between suing because the statute has 

been violated and suing because the contract has been 

violated?

 MR. FREDERICK: A contract is a voluntary 

agreement entered into between the drug manufacturer and 

the Secretary. The manufacturer can choose not to 

participate.

 So in every one of the implied right of 

action cases that you have dealt with, a -- an outside 

entity has been forced to comply with a statute or law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the statute wouldn't 

apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.

 MR. FREDERICK: But the -- Justice Ginsburg, 

those cases all involve the imposition of duties on the 

part of an entity or actor out in society.

 Here we're talking about voluntary action. 

The drug manufacturers can decide not to participate and

not sign the agreement.

 And they have the right, under the 

provisions allowing termination, to terminate the 

agreement at will with no reason whatsoever. But -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But so do the -­

it's the same situation with the States under Spending 

Clause legislation. They don't have to sign up, but if 

they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of 

action on the beneficiaries? And our cases for the last 

25, 30 years have said no.

 MR. FREDERICK: But the remedy is different, 

Mr. Chief Justice. And that is a key difference. All 

we're talking about here as a remedy is the difference 

between what they promised to charge and what they 

actually charged. The remedies -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that 

whatever you say -- that's all we're talking about. We 

are told that computing the price is a very intricate 

business and that many of these disputes have been about 

what is -- what should the ceiling price be.

 MR. FREDERICK: There -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There would not -- the 

ceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about 

it. It's just a question of getting the manufacturers 

to charge that price and not a higher price. The

question is: What is the ceiling price?

 MR. FREDERICK: And there are two ways to 

calculate it. Under the more complicated formula that 

is designed to enhance the profits of the drug 

companies, it is a more complicated endeavor.

 All of these cases, Justice Ginsburg, all of 

them, have been with the simple formula, which is has 

the drug company given its best price to some other 

purchaser in the market. That's where the False Claims 

Act cases that they acknowledge do not create such an 

intrusion into the program that somehow they can't be 

brought -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- and then 

they have control over them. And they don't have 

control over these suits.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, the difference in 

a qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague 

earlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the 

government doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims 

Act case.

 What's different there is that there has to 

be some inside whistleblower who can pass through the 

very difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case; 

whereas here we're talking about benefit of the bargain.

going to charge a ceiling price, and we assert, based 

on, you know, quite extensive reports by officers of 

Inspectorate General that they have not been charging 

that price. They've been charging in excess of that 

price, and all we're asking for is the delta.

 And the Government in its Massachusetts 

submissions has acknowledged that this type of best 

price litigation is not so complicated because all one 

needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell 

the particular drug to some other entity for a lower 

price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply 

across the board to all the 340B entities.

 The argument about distraction and 

intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully 

submit, is a gross overstatement of what actually 

happens in this type of litigation. And to the extent 

that there are complexities, the complexities are 

introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of 

masking what price they are charging to the 340B 

entities. Because all these various mechanisms, the 

bundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to 

purchasers are all designed to mask what the true price 

of the drug is.

program, and in getting the Secretary to implement this

program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities 

who are providing drugs and medical service to the 

poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the 

benefits of the collective market created by these 340B 

drug purchases. And that's all that we're asking for 

here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take the position 

that nothing has changed as a result of the new 

legislation? That is, Ms. Anders told us that this 

statute is going into -- to become effective. There's 

going to be procedures, better procedures than there 

were before. Is there still this third-party 

beneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to 

the agency?

 MR. FREDERICK: We don't know, Justice 

Ginsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give 

you. And the reason we don't know is because the 

Secretary has already missed the first statutory 

deadline for issuing implementing regulations.

 There was no statement of rules in the 

notice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case 

for agencies. The Secretary simply put out for comment 

that we are going to develop procedures and rules. So 

we don't know whether or not the Secretary will express 

some further intent as to how these new rules are to

apply.

 But I would submit that this Court's cases 

are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is 

not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and 

the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled 

with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary 

presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of 

common law rights to be associated with the agreement.

 And that's certainly been the way this Court 

has enforced contracts involving the government itself.

 If there are no further questions, we'll

clinics.

 And I'd also -- probably even a better 

response is you can look at any rebate release issued by 

the Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if 

you think it's simple, I would be shocked.

 On Lipitor, it's not the case that the 

Central District of California decides nationwide what 

the price of Lipitor is. The -- under the other side's 

view, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern 

District of New York, and the District in Alabama would 

all decide.

 And what's really bad -- it is bad enough to 

have 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs, but what he's 

talking about, best price and average manufacturer price 

that determines the State rebate program -- because the 

rebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price 

program is a ceiling price, when one of the pricing 

components goes up, such as average manufacturer price, 

the States benefit. They get more money. But, 

generally, 340B entities -- their ceiling price goes up. 

So what's good for the 340B company -- or entity is bad 

for the States.

 And that's not disputed. He just says it's 

hypothetical. But he's asked for millions and millions 

and millions and millions and more millions of

transactions that go to that very pricing component.

 Common law. On pages 9 to 11a of the 

petition appendix is a good three or four citations to 

the third-party beneficiary Federal common law. And the 

courts go out of their way to say it's not enough to be 

a direct beneficiary. The analysis is exactly the same 

under implied right of action. Is there clear and 

unambiguous intent to confer enforceable rights? It's 

the same.

 We just think because it's in haec verba 

with the statute, it's congressional intent that's 

controlling, not the parties.

 I could talk about States if you want. 

Otherwise, I'm happy to just ask for the decision to be
