 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in case 05-1629 Gonzales versus 

Duenas-Alvarez. 

Mr. Himelfarb.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court.

 The Ninth Circuit held that the term theft 

offense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and 

Nationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting. 

That holding is incorrect. Indeed, it is so clearly 

incorrect that even respondent does not defend it. 

Respondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his 

violation of the California vehicle theft statute is not 

a theft offense under the INA, not because the 

California statute covers aiding and abetting and the 

theft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but 

because the California statute covers a certain kind of 

aiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable 

consequences rule, and a theft offense does not.

 That theory is slightly narrower than the 

Ninth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same

reasons. One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's 

holding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit 

the number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated 

felons based on a conviction obtained in any 

jurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes 

between principals and aiders and abetters and it is 

ordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a 

particular case was not convicted as an aider and 

abettor. Respondent's theory would have the same effect 

when a conviction was obtained in any jurisdiction that 

obtains the natural and probable consequences rule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Will you help me out on one 

mechanical point? As you probably know from your brief, 

I don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and 

I'm just not used to it. I had thought -- and I guess 

I'm wrong -- that if the natural and probable 

consequences theory were used to prove, let's say, 

ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out 

as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate 

charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be 

the natural and consequences extension of aiding and 

abetting so that there would at least be on the record a 

charge of assault.

 And I take it that's not the case.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I -- I don't think it is.

I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Otherwise, you wouldn't 

have this problem.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it is the case that 

the aider and abettor has to intend to aid and abet what 

is sometimes called the target crime. It also has to be 

the case that the principal has to then go on to commit 

some other crime, a subsequent crime. The issue then 

arises whether the aider and abettor who intended to 

assist the target crime is held liable for the 

subsequent crime.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in any case in my 

example of -- of theft, and the further offense under 

natural and probable consequences being assault, the 

only charge against the defendant who aided and abetted 

would be a charge of theft; is that correct?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: It could be. It could be. 

But in the course of proving the aider and abettor 

guilty of the subsequent crime on this natural and 

probable consequences theory, there would have to be 

proof that bore upon the target crime to show what his 

intent was with respect to the target crime and also 

whether the subsequent crime was a foreseeable 

consequence of the initial crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand it. How

can he be convicted of -- of the consequential crime if 

he is never charged with the consequential crime? You 

charge him with the -- with the theft and convict him of 

assault?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Scalia. He 

would have to be charged with the subsequent crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, well I thought you --

I thought you answered --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Me too.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I didn't mean to say that. 

I meant to say he didn't have to be charged with the 

initial crime. In fact, even the principal wouldn't 

have to be charged with the initial crime or for that 

matter, any crime. The aider and abettor could be 

charged only with a consequent crime but in the course 

of proving that under the natural and probable 

consequences rule, there would have to be proof with 

respect to the target crime, because the elements of the 

natural and probable consequences rule depend upon what 

happened.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The theory being that 

anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which 

naturally leads to another crime intended the other 

crime as well.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's the basic principle.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Himmelfarb, does the 

government urge that we consider the point that you're 

now arguing and the other points? You started out by 

saying everyone agrees that the rationale of the Ninth 

Circuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we 

are deciding the question as a matter of first view 

instead of review.

 Does the government urge that we dispose of 

those issues anyway, even though they were not disposed 

of by the Ninth Circuit?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: We think that the aiding 

and betting argument that respondent raises is fairly 

included within the question presented and that it 

should be resolved. We don't think the other two issues 

are fairly included within the question presented.

 We think that this issue is fairly presented 

within the -- fairly included within the question 

presented and should resolve --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't discussed 

by the Ninth Circuit, was it?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: It wasn't, 

Justice Ginsburg, but it bears upon the question of what 

it means to say that an aggravated felony encompasses 

aiding and abetting. If the Court simply holds contrary 

to the Ninth Circuit's holding that aiding and abetting

is included in an aggravated felony, it will leave open 

a very important question which we think the Court 

should provide guidance to the lower courts on. It 

would leave open the question of whether that means that 

there is some general Federal immigration law definition 

of aiding and abetting with which the law of aiding and 

abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction would have to 

be compared in every single removal case, at least 

potentially, or rather as we would submit, that Congress 

intended to cover the entire range of aiding and 

abetting under whatever formulation was used in any 

jurisdiction at the time the aiding and abetting 

provision was added to the Immigration and Nationality 

Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what about the 

remaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth 

Circuit?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, certainly the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we remand for those or 

what?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Yes. It's open to -- it 

would be open to the Ninth Circuit. Assuming the Ninth 

Circuit were of the view that they were fairly raised in 

the Ninth Circuit, and also that they were fairly raised 

in the agency, it would be open to the Ninth Circuit to

resolve those questions in the first instance. Let me 

just add that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would it have to be 

raised in the Ninth Circuit? I thought this case was 

controlled by a prior decision of the Ninth Circuit. 

Therefore, there was nothing more that was needed to 

take care of this case.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's true. The Ninth 

Circuit didn't pass upon any issue except the question 

whether aiding and abetting as a general matter is 

included in a theft offense. Relying on a prior 

decision, it held that it wasn't, and sent the case back 

to the Board of Immigration Appeals. But there, I think 

it would still be fair for the government to argue that 

a particular theory that may be raised here in defense 

of the judgment wasn't properly raised either in the 

Ninth Circuit by respondent, or before the agency, such 

that that claim was not properly exhausted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Himelfarb, you point 

out these last two issues are not, and probably 

correctly, that they are not fairly included within the 

question presented. Well, that would be disabling if 

indeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise 

those two additional issues. But here it is the 

respondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if

we want to.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Of course. Of course.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The respondent can seek to 

uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Of course.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So we can reach those other 

issues if we wish.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: It's ultimately a matter of 

the Court's discretion. Our submission is that the 

wiser exercise of the Court's discretion would not --

would be not to address the issue, particularly the last 

issue raised in respondent's brief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the only thing 

that the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a 

theft offense in California is broader than the generic 

definition of theft. All of these arguments that are 

being discussed are ways in which that particular ruling 

is supported. I don't know why they wouldn't be 

considered subsumed under the Ninth Circuit's decision.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we 

don't read the Ninth Circuit's order that way. We think 

the Ninth Circuit simply reversed on the strength of its 

prior decision in Penuliar. And in Penuliar, the Ninth 

Circuit clearly held the reason this California statute 

was not a theft offense was that conviction under it is

possible under an aiding and betting liability theory. 

So insofar as the order relied on Penuliar, it was 

saying nothing more and nothing less than that 

respondent's conviction was not a theft offense because 

it is theoretically possible he was convicted as an 

aider and abettor and the definition of theft offense 

under the INA does not include aiding and abetting.

 Now as I was saying, I think it's important 

for the Court to make clear what it means to say, that 

aiding and abetting is included in the aggravated felony 

definition. And this -- the type of argument that 

respondent raises here, I think is important to keep in 

mind, is not limited to the particular aspect of aiding 

and abetting law on which he relies.

 There are a great many different 

formulations of the basic requirements of aiding and 

betting. Not only that they -- they vary not only from 

jurisdiction to jurisdiction but even within 

jurisdictions. So in the next case, you could imagine 

an alien or removal case arguing that because some other 

requirement of aiding and abetting law in the 

jurisdiction in which he was convicted is broader than 

the more typical formulation, that even though he was 

clearly convicted of, for example, murder, and even 

though the elements of murder in that jurisdiction

perfectly match up with the federal definition of murder 

in the immigration statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you're 

ahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question, 

but I take it your rationale for not reaching these 

other grounds would also apply to your argument that 

whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant 

was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the 

charging documents. That wasn't a basis for the Ninth 

Circuit's decision either.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Mr. Chief 

Justice. Our main submission is that the Ninth Circuit 

relied on an issue of aiding and abetting. We 

petitioned on that question and the Court granted 

certiorari on that question.

 The three grounds on which respondent relies 

on defense of the judgment, even though they all vary in 

some sense from the Ninth Circuit's ground, two of them 

simply have nothing to do with aiding and abetting. The 

first ground is an aiding and abetting argument. It's 

slightly different from the one, slightly narrower than 

the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied, but we think 

it's fairly included and we think the Court should 

address it. We think the Court should reject it for the 

reasons I am attempting to articulate now.

If you have a jurisdiction with a law of 

aiding and abetting that is broader, it can be 

characterized as broader in some sense than what might 

be thought to be the general notion of aiding and 

abetting, under the premise of respondent's theory, you 

could conceivably have this kind of argument in any 

removal case --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if a particular 

jurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally 

different theory of aiding and abetting? Is it simply 

sufficient that it is labeled aiding and abetting?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Alito, we 

think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to 

leave open the question that if at some point in the 

future, some entirely novel radical far-reaching theory 

of aiding and abetting were adopted, that would not be 

sufficient. I don't think as the law currently stands 

there is any such theory in any jurisdiction; and I 

think that Congress should be presumed when it enacted 

the aggravated felony provision, to be covering the 

field of possibilities. But if at some point in the 

future some jurisdiction decided that, you know, 

somebody could be strictly liable --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Himmelfarb, what about 

accessory after the fact, do your comments apply to that

argument as well?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think that that's 

not fairly included within the question presented. We 

think that's just a -- accessory after the fact is a 

separate crime

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it may not be fairly 

included but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument 

asserted to defend the judgment.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. We think 

that the Court could resolve that issue along the lines 

we've suggested in our reply brief. Respondent's basic 

submission on that point is that the term -- the phrase 

in the California statute, any person who is a party or 

an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or 

unauthorized taking or stealing, that in that phrase the 

term accessory means accessory after the fact. An 

accessory after the fact is not included in the 

definition of the theft offense. Therefore, the 

California statute is broader than a theft offense. 

It's our submission that the Court can assume that he's 

right about that but still rule for the government on 

the accessory after the fact issue, because whatever the 

statute might say, he was charged as a principal. And 

the law is clear that somebody charged as a principal --

was looking at, what is it, 13-A? How do we know that 

that charge is as a principal? In the appendix to the 

petition.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it 

tracks the language of the statute up to the point where 

the statute uses the phrase I just read.

 So it's principal language. It's 

theoretically possible that he was convicted as an aider 

and abettor because the law in California, as it is 

elsewhere, is that somebody charged as a principal can 

be convicted as an aider and abettor; but the law in 

California, as it is elsewhere, is that somebody charged 

as a principal cannot be convicted as an accessory after 

the fact. There is no language in the charging 

instrument to suggest that respondent was charged as an 

accessory after the fact.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But to accept your answer, 

we've got to look into a question of California pleading 

law which hasn't been passed on below.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right. 

Respondent raises a number of arguments in response 

essentially to the argument I just made. We think 

they're all entirely insubstantial and could be rejected 

quite easily. But it may well be that the Court would 

think that the better course is not to address the

accessory after the fact issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't the better 

course be also not to decide the principal question you 

want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us 

to take, which is that if there are minor differences 

between what you might call the general law of aiding 

and abetting, it doesn't matter. Why wouldn't it be 

wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind 

of consequential liability is part of the general law of 

aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief?

 So that would be the narrower ground.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That would be narrower 

ground. That is certainly our fallback position and we 

would not be at all unhappy if the case were resolved on 

that ground.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though that position 

has been widely criticized, I think. Is it the 

ALI Model Penal Code, which thinks it's a bad rule?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: There has been some 

criticism of the rule, Justice Ginsburg, but it is 

applied in criminal cases in Federal courts; and 

whatever criticism there might be in the academic 

literature, even in some state decisions, we think it is 

just inconceivable that Congress would have intended 

that somebody could be convicted under this theory under

the Federal criminal law and be subject to the same 

criminal penalties as a principal, and yet under the 

federal immigration law could not be subject to the same 

immigration consequences as a principal. So whatever 

grounds there are for criticizing it, it is the law in 

most places. And most importantly, we think, it is the 

law in Federal courts.

 Taking account of minor variations in 

formulation of aiding and abetting standards among 

jurisdictions would not only have the consequence of 

drastically limiting the number of aliens who could be 

found to be aggravated felons, because of the difficulty 

of establishing that someone was convicted as a 

principal rather than an aider and abettor. It would 

also complicate removal cases enormously, as I 

mentioned.

 The premise of respondent's aiding and 

abetting theory would suggest that in any case, it would 

be necessary for the immigration judge, board of 

immigration appeals and the reviewing court, to engage 

not only in an analysis of whether the principal offense 

of conviction matches some Federal definition, which 

itself can be a quite complex enterprise, but having 

done that, it would then have to go on and compare the 

aiding and abetting law of the state of conviction with

some Federal aiding and abetting law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In that former question as 

to whether California theft is general theft, do you 

propose the same rule? That even if California has some 

minor variations -- not just in aiding and abetting but 

in what constitutes theft -- minor variations from what 

the general national rule is, they should be 

disregarded? And if not, why not?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think that -- we 

don't, first of all.

 And I think no court would say that and we 

certainly wouldn't. But there's a very important 

difference insofar as that type of comparison was 

concerned between on the one hand a principal offense 

and on the other hand aiding and abetting. The two 

important differences are if you have a general 

definition of the principal offense, whether it's a 

theft offense or burglary, any reasonable framework 

would contemplate that in a great many cases you would 

be able to tell whether the alien before the court was 

convicted of that offense, of the Federal definition of 

that offense, simply by looking at the State statute of 

conviction; and if it matches it, that's the end of the 

analysis. If it's broader, in most cases you'd be able 

to look at the charging instrument and see whether that

person was charged with something narrower than the 

whole range of conduct that's covered by the statute.

 Under respondent's theory, if you were 

to apply that same approach to aiding and abetting you 

would never be able to look at the statute to see 

whether somebody was convicted under an aiding and 

abetting theory that matches the Federal definition 

because every statute includes aiding and abetting, so 

it's impossible to tell from the statute whether 

somebody was convicted as a principal or an aider and 

abettor.

 Then if you look at the charging 

instrument, that won't suffice either because the law 

everywhere as far as I'm aware is that somebody charged 

as a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor. 

So the only cases in which you'd be able to establish 

that somebody was not convicted as an aider and abettor 

are the unusual cases where there happens to be 

something in the files of the criminal case that will 

explain in some admissible fashion whether the defendant 

was convicted as a principal or an aider and abettor. 

That's the first important distinction. The second --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you would limit your 

rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor 

variations, just minor variations in the aiding and

abetting definition?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. I mean, our 

submission is that Congress's intent in enacting an 

aggravated felony provision that captures aiders and 

abettors was that minor variations in formulation 

wouldn't matter for the reasons I'm giving. So it's 

ultimately a matter of Congressional intent.

 The second reason why this is important is 

because if you were to apply that rule to aiding and 

abetting you would be saying, in effect, that in any 

jurisdiction that applies a broader rule of aiding and 

abetting every single crime in the criminal code would 

not qualify for aggravated felony status, because an 

aiding and betting statute runs with the entirety of the 

criminal code and is a potential theory of liability for 

every substantive criminal offense. So that would mean 

that in those, those broader aiding and abetting 

jurisdictions, nothing could ever be an aggravated 

felony unless the government could somehow search 

through the criminal files and find something to prove 

that in fact the defendant was not convicted under an 

aiding and abetting theory.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Himmelfarb, before 

your time runs out, there's something curious about this 

California statute. This one is in the Motor Vehicle

Code, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called 

car theft. Do you know what the difference between 

those two and what would move a prosecutor to charge 

under the Penal Code as opposed to the Vehicle Code?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the theft offense 

that covers cars under than this one in California that 

I'm aware of, Justice Ginsburg, is just a grand theft 

statute, which is just general theft as applied to 

particular circumstances, one of which is the theft of a 

car.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's mentioned in what, 

487(d)?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. That's 

right. And as I understand it, that is essentially a 

larceny statute, which encompasses a common law larceny 

rule, which is that there has to be an intent to steal 

or, stated differently, that there has to be an intent 

to deprive the owner of the car, of the car permanently, 

whereas the California vehicle theft statute at issue 

here is a broader statute in that it doesn't require any 

intent to steal. It doesn't even require a taking. A 

driving is sufficient. So it would capture the receipt 

of stolen property. And it doesn't require an intent to 

deprive the owner of the car permanently. It would be 

sufficient if there was an intent to deprive the owner

of the car temporarily.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It covers joyriding?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it would cover -- it 

would cover what is colloquially known as joyriding if 

it fell within the terms of the statute. That is, if 

there was an intent to deprive the owner of the 

property. And on the subject of joyriding, let me --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Temporarily.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: At least temporarily.

 Respondent makes much of the fact that on 

our reading of the statute, on our understanding, that a 

theft offense would cover the California vehicle theft 

statute here. That would mean that joyriding would be 

included. But I think it's critical to keep in mind 

that there are two very important limitations in the 

Federal definition of theft offense. The first is that, 

as interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals, it 

does require an intent to deprive the owner of property, 

and a great many unauthorized use of vehicle statutes in 

the State don't have that element. That's one important 

limitation.

 The other is that many of these statutes are 

misdemeanor statutes, so somebody convicted of it would 

not be sentenced to more than a year in prison. By the 

terms of the theft offense provision of the aggravated

felony provision in the INA you have to be sentenced to 

at least a year in prison in order to be treated as an 

aggravated felon. So we think the vast majority of what 

is colloquially known as joyriding cases would not fall 

within this particular aggravated felony.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in California they 

would? Or is there a separate joyriding --

MR. HIMMELFARB: No. Joyriding in 

California would be prosecuted under this statute. But 

unless there was an intent to deprive, there could be no 

conviction, and unless the sentence was at least a year 

it would not be treated as an aggravated felony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the sentence given or 

the sentence prescribed for the crime?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: The sentence given, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Given.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I'd like to reserve the

please the Court:

 I would like to pick up on the point made by 

Justice Ginsburg. This case does not involve a 

conviction under California's car theft statute, which 

is Penal Code 487(d), which requires an intent to steal. 

Rather, it involves a conviction under California's 

Vehicle Code, which covers varied and less serious 

conduct including liability with or without the intent 

to steal and also expressly reaching accessories after 

the fact, which the Government concedes would make it 

broader than the generic definition of theft.

 The question is whether a conviction under 

this statute is a theft offense and therefore an 

aggravated felony triggering the extremely serious 

consequences of automatic deportation from the United 

States, a permanent bar from the United States, and in 

the sentencing context a sentencing enhancement from 2 

to 20 years for illegal reentry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend began 

his argument by saying you don't defend the decision of 

the Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting. Is that 

correct?

 MR. MEADE: We do defend the judgment of the 

Ninth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know the judgment,

but you focused at least primarily on other grounds than 

the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied.

 Is he correct that you concede that merely 

because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that 

is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical 

treatment?

 MR. MEADE: As an abstract general matter 

divorced from the facts of this case and divorced from 

California law, we agree that aiding and abetting 

liability is part of a generic definition of any crime, 

including the theft offense here.

 However, that's not what the Ninth Circuit 

stated in either this case or in Penuliar. In Penuliar 

the Ninth Circuit stressed the extremely broad nature of 

California's aiding and abetting liability. It cited a 

case, People v. Beeman, which refers to the specific 

natural and probable consequences doctrine under 

California law.

 So the Ninth Circuit was talking about the 

broad sweep of aiding and abetting liability under 

California law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask a factual 

question? I'm just curious. If the Government's 

statement of the facts here is correct, your client, a 

Peruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and

convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994, 

and nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in 

1998. How does that happen? Is that a mistake or --

how do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent 

resident?

 MR. MEADE: I don't know the answer to the 

question except to state that those two, those 

convictions did happen in the years that you state and 

he did become a lawful permanent resident in 1998.

 I believe it was through a waiver provision 

under the INA that that's how he became a lawful 

permanent resident.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's not a joyrider anyway.

 MR. MEADE: I would disagree with that. All 

we know in this case from the record is that he was not 

charged with 487(d) car theft, which requires an intent 

to steal. He was rather charged under a conviction 

which covers joyriding.

 In my reading of the Government's brief, the 

Government doesn't contest that joyriding would put a 

statute outside the generic definition of theft offense. 

Even in the Government's presentation today, the 

Government suggested that in most States joyriding would 

be outside the generic definition of --

was wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft 

as the taking or exercising control over property 

without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of 

rights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent 

or total? They're wrong in your opinion?

 MR. MEADE: No, I don't think they're wrong.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, I don't see 

how you make --

MR. MEADE: Sure. I'd be happy to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that 

inconsistent with what you just said?

 MR. MEADE: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?

 MR. MEADE: No, it's not inconsistent. We 

don't take the position that a permanent deprivation is 

required, is required. A less than permanent 

is sufficient, as the Ninth Circuit stated in 

Corona-Sanchez. The Ninth Circuit has subsequently held 

that a joyriding offense is outside that definition 

because it includes a brief taking with an intent to 

return, and the last footnote of the Government's brief, 

note 8, cites that Ninth Circuit case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand how that 

could be right, though. I mean, when you joyride it's 

less than personal. In other words, their definition is

if you take somebody else's property for an hour that 

that isn't theft, but if you take it for a day it is?

 MR. MEADE: The question has to do with how 

long of the taking. And at common law --

JUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to -- is 

there a common law, because they're trying to report --

is under the common law there a rule or any generic rule 

that says if you take somebody else's property for a 

couple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for 

several hours or several days it is theft?

 MR. MEADE: There is a generic rule on this, 

and there is a consensus among the vast majority of 

States. I point to both Professor LeFave as well as the 

Model Penal Code. And what these rules say -- and this 

is true in the vast majority of States, 42 States by our 

count -- is that if you take either permanently or for 

an unreasonable amount of time such that it would 

deprive the owner of the significant portion of the 

economic value, then that constitute a theft offense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You shouldn't steal it for 

an unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable 

amount of time?

time.

 MR. MEADE: Well, I mean, that goes to the 

exact point, Justice Scalia, because we're not -- the 

question is what is stealing. The question --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that the rule 

is something is theft only if you take it long enough to 

deprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?

 MR. MEADE: Or a reasonable time, or to 

place --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Wait. I want 

to know where that comes from, because I would think I 

have a Volvo. It lasts for about 30 years, apparently. 

So I guess if you took my car for a year, that that then 

would not be a theft, or maybe it would be. Where is 

the source of the rule you just cited?

 MR. MEADE: The source is the generic 

definition as applied in all of the States.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I want a book. I 

want a book that will tell me that if they take my car 

for a month it isn't theft, but if they take it for a 

year it is. What book, or where do I look to verify 

that this is common law? I'm not denying what you're 

saying. I just want to know where to look.

 MR. MEADE: Sure. Two sources. One would 

be Professor LeFave in his discussion of what the intent

required for the different theft offenses; and the 

second source would be the Model Penal Code when it sets 

forth the requisite mens rea for theft offenses.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was the third 

reference to the Model Penal Code, so I have to ask. No 

one's enacted the Model Penal Code, have they?

 MR. MEADE: No. But in Taylor and in 

Seidler this Court used the Model Penal Code as a 

shorthand for the generic definition of a certain crime. 

But we don't rely on the Model Penal Code.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe 

the Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or 

aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence 

of general law?

 MR. MEADE: I would say that the Model Penal 

Code is consistent with the majority view. On this 

question of intent to steal, as we set forth in our 

brief, 42 States hold what we say the law is, that an 

intent to steal -- a theft offense requires a mens rea 

more than taking with an intent to give back.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You assert, you assert it's 

consistent with the majority view on this issue, not on 

everything. What does it say about the death penalty?

 MR. MEADE: I'm not sure what it says about 

the death penalty. On this issue.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that what 

joyriding is? That when you're done with your joy ride, 

you return the car where you picked it up? I thought 

they just abandoned it wherever you happen to be.

 MR. MEADE: If you abandon the car wherever 

you happen to be that's not joy riding. That's covered 

by traditional larceny principles. In the, the case of 

State v. Davis from 1875 involves that exact principle. 

That is larceny in that case. But however, if someone 

takes a car, a teenager, a neighbor takes a car, drives 

it around the block, brings it back to the same place, 

that is joyriding. That is covered by 108.51.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the joy in 

that?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The joy apparently is you 

don't get convicted of theft.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MEADE: But what we have here is statute 

that criminalized conduct less serious than car theft. 

This is -- 108.51 is the only statute in California that 

covers joyriding. There's a whole different provision 

that deals with car theft. In cases where that's the 

appropriate charge, prosecutors will charge the person 

with car theft and meet the burden of proof. Here we're

dealing with a less serious crime, a less serious 

statute and the question is whether this statute that 

require a very minimal mens rea, with or without intent 

to steal, is sufficient to lead to the very serious 

consequences of being an aggravated felony.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you understand 

that point to be what the Ninth Circuit relied on?

 MR. MEADE: No. Absolutely not. The Ninth 

Circuit didn't rely on that. It was presented to the 

Ninth Circuit but the Ninth Circuit did not rely on 

that.

the question, the aiding and abetting question, they did 

decide this would available to you to argue on remand?

 MR. MEADE: Uh, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because you 

presented it to the Ninth Circuit below.

 MR. MEADE: Yes, it would.

 I would like to also to address the question 

of accessory liability under California law.

 108.51 expressly covers accessories. The 

Government concedes that if that term means accessory 

after the fact, then this statute is outside the generic 

definition of a theft offense. Under California law, 

accessory has only one meaning, and that one meaning is

accessory after the fact. On that ground alone, this 

statute is broader than a generic definition of theft 

offense and would provide a -- an alternate ground of 

affirmance in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Meade, the Government 

says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but 

it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal 

code would carry over to the vehicle code.

 MR. MEADE: I have two responses, 

Justice Ginsburg. First, there's a similar provision to 

108.51 covering the taking or operating of an airplane. 

It is in the penal code. It is 499(b). It exactly 

mirrors the language of 108.51. So presumably the 

Government would agree that the definition of accessory 

under California law in the penal code would cover 

499(b) for the same reasons it would cover under 108.51. 

Moreover, accessory under California law only has one 

meaning. In 1872 the California legislature passed the 

provision at issue, Section 32 and said accessory is 

defined to be accessory after the fact. At the same 

time, the legislature passed other provisions which also 

used accessory in that consistent way.

 The California Supreme Court as early as 

1898 stated that accessory means accessory after the 

fact and relatedly, accessory before the fact, the only

other plausible meaning of the term, has no meaning 

under California law.

 So with all due respect to the Government, 

accessory in 108.51 means accessory after the fact and 

that alone makes a broad and generic definition of theft 

offense.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So wouldn't it odd for this 

Court to decide that issue of California law?

 MR. MEADE: I wouldn't think it would be 

odd, Justice Alito, because it is so clear. It has to 

do with a statutory term. It has to do with a statutory 

term that's defined under the California statute. 

Moreover, under a Taylor inquiry, Federal courts are 

often required to look at state law to figure out 

whether a particular provision is within or outside a 

generic definition of a crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course if you're right 

about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it 

would still be available to find out whether your client 

was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.

 MR. MEADE: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now is that -- is it 

possible? Or is that out of the question in this case?

 MR. MEADE: I'm sorry. Is what possible?

pleading documents, from the charge, to determine 

whether he was convicted as an accessory or not? And if 

it's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our 

sometime in arguing this point, aren't we?

 MR. MEADE: I disagree. Because as an 

initial matter, this case in our view is about the 

categorical approach. But as to your question about 

what these documents show, no, the documents in this 

case do show that he was an accessory after the fact or 

a principal, but the Government has failed to meet its 

burden one way or the other.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they say you 

cannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are 

charged as such, and that the documents show he was 

charged as a principal.

 MR. MEADE: We disagree with that 

characterization of the Government as we set forth in 

our brief. California law does not require someone to 

be charged with that specific -- level of specificity. 

And that's something we set forth in our brief. 

Moreover --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well how about how -- how 

the defendant was charged in this very case? 

Mr. Himelfarb thought that it was plain from that 

charge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a

principal. And you must take the view that this charge, 

this information was inadequate to identify him as 

principal.

 MR. MEADE: This charge is ambiguous as to 

whether he was charged as a driver and taker, as the 

principal, or as an accessory after the fact.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. It says, "who 

at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and 

unlawfully drive or take a vehicle." I mean, he is --

he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, 

not, not some subsequent accessory.

 MR. MEADE: Well, this is a question of 

California law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not a question of Cal 

-- it is a question of English.

 MR. MEADE: No, I disagree, Your Honor. I 

mean, it's a question of California law what needs to be 

charged in a California charging document.

needs to be charged. We're talking about what was 

charged. And it seems to me there's no question what 

was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully 

drive or take a vehicle. There is no way you can 

consider that an accessory.

 MR. MEADE: Well, I disagree. Because under

California law you need to charge generally under the 

statute, and the statute says drive or take. That's how 

he was charged. Moreover, though, under California law, 

the charging document does not necessarily control the 

conviction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're -- you're 

saying then despite the fact that the, the indictment in 

this case said he willfully et cetera did this, it would 

be open to California to prove that in fact he didn't do 

any of those things, but was merely an accessory after 

the fact? That -- that's your position? That's what 

California pleading law allows?

 MR. MEADE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 JUSTICE STEVENS? Do you have any case on 

that?

 MR. MEADE: Yes. People v West and People v 

Toro.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Both West and Toro.

 MR. MEADE: Yes. W-e-s-t, and People v 

Toro. There's also the case of Sandoval which is also 

cited in our brief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does any of those cases 

squarely hold that he could be convicted of being an 

accessory after the fact on a general indictment like

this?

 MR. MEADE: No, none of them do. They talk 

about the general principle under California law, about 

that a charging document does not necessarily control 

the ultimate conviction and sets forth the test that 

needs to be applied. But on this question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Government 

-- it is not only that. The Government has authority 

going the other way. People versus Prado, "in the 

absence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must 

be indicted and convicted as such." If you look at this 

information, it's clear that he's not being indicted as 

an accessory after the fact.

 MR. MEADE: Well, we think People v Prado 

supports our view which is a statute specifically that 

allows for accessory liability on its face. So, 

therefore, a person need not be charged under the 

different accessory statute.

 However, to the extent this Court finds the 

charging documents or ultimate conviction ambiguous, 

which it sounds like some members of the Court may 

believe it is, this is a question of California law, as 

a first point; but moreover, the question here is 

whether the Government has met its burden under Taylor 

and Shepard. And under Taylor and Shepard the inquiry

is whether it can necessarily be shown that someone was 

convicted of a generic definition; and here, given the 

ambiguity under California law, it can't be said that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what do we do about 

that? No, you have no interest in answering my 

question, but the question, it seems to me under the 

law, here is what I do -- and I'm a good deference 

lawyer, as you are. I simply look at the statute. And 

I imagine some very weird case that the statute could 

cover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or 

it wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing. 

There's no possibility in the world that applied to my 

client. But most charges are simply stated in the 

wording of the statute. And most judgments simply say 

guilty.

 So I say "see, you see, it is theoretically 

possible." And now when you decide what really 

happened, Court, you're supposed to look only to the 

charging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it 

didn't. So the whole congressional scheme is basically 

put to the side.

 Now what's the answer to that problem, 

insofar as you want to answer it?

 MR. MEADE: Of course, I'd be happy to. I 

don't think it puts the whole scheme aside. Remember,

the Government gets two bites at the apple here. They 

get a first bite on the categoric approach where all 

they need to show is that all the elements are within 

the generic definition of the crime. We'd be dealing 

with a different case if the person was charged under 

the penal code which doesn't require -- which requires 

intent to steal and which does not cover accessories 

after the fact. So the Government gets a free pass on 

round one.

 On round two, on the modified categorical 

approach as we're discussing here, the Government gets a 

second chance to -- based on actual documents in the 

record to establish whether there's enough there.

 Here the Government relies on the charging 

document in an abstractive judgment, but the Government 

does not put in a plea colloquy, it does not put in plea 

allocution, it does not put in any other documents that 

would establish under Shepard that someone was 

necessarily convicted of the crime. So what -- the 

Government here is asking to be relieved of its burden 

of proof which it has in this case. I would like to 

note that on the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the charging document 

you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California 

law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to

charge as an accessory? You would acknowledge this?

 MR. MEADE: Yes. I would acknowledge the 

charging document unto itself, but not taking into 

account the fact that the charging document and the 

conviction not match.

 I would note, though, that the Court need 

not go to the modified categorical approach, and I would 

say should not. This is something that the board -- the 

agency has been able to deal with for 60 years or so, 

dealing with the actual documents, trying to figure out 

a whether particular charging document is or is not 

enough. In Shepard itself, which actually dealt with 

the question of which documents could or could not be 

considered, the Court did not go further and look at the 

next step and decide whether those particular documents 

did or did not meet the definition in that case.

 I'd also like to note to the extent that 

this Court finds California charging law ambiguous or 

hard to understand, under the principle of Jett v Dallas 

Independent School District, the circuit courts are in a 

better position to consider a matter of California State 

law in the first instance.

 So our accessory argument is that the Court 

should decide the categorical approach alone on the 

accessory after the fact ground and remand to the agency

for consideration under the modified approach.

 I'd like to also stress that if the Court 

were to affirm on that ground it would be a very narrow 

holding. There's only two other statutes in California 

that expressly include accessories after the fact. 

California's car theft statute does not include 

accessories after the fact.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In order to agree with you 

on the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide 

two disputed issues of California law? Whether 

accessory here in this statute means accessory after the 

fact, and whether if somebody is charged under that 

statute as an accessory, that has to be alleged 

specifically in the indictment, or whether it is just 

sufficient to charge the person with the offense.

 MR. MEADE: The Court would only need to 

decide that first question, not the second question. 

The first question is what is the meaning of accessory 

under California law. That is sufficiently clear in our 

view that the Court need not send it back to the Court 

of Appeals. The second question under the modified 

approach is outside the core of what this case is about, 

and we suggest that that should be remanded to the Ninth 

Circuit or the agency.

prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?

 MR. MEADE: I do not know one way or the 

other, Your Honor. But I also note that we don't know 

whether anyone has been prosecuted under 108.51 on that 

ground, we also do not know whether someone has been 

prosecuted under Section 32, which is the accessory 

after the fact provision, or more generally on that 

ground.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if no one has 

ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for 

joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to 

construe this charging document which charges him as a 

principal as actually meaning to charge him as an 

accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?

 MR. MEADE: Not necessarily, because what we 

have is a statutory provision that clearly covers 

accessories after the fact. We do not have an example 

of someone who was charged under 108.51, but there are 

many reasons why that may not show up, partly because 

the charging documents don't need to so provide, in our 

view. So figuring out who was and who was not an 

accessory after the fact or a principal under 108.51 is 

not so easy to distill.

convicted of this statute, under the statute would he 

actually have been some kind of accessory to another 

person committing another crime, and the natural and 

probable consequence was that that other person would 

violate this statute?

 MR. MEADE: So --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you been able to think 

of one?

the natural and probable consequences?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I am.

 MR. MEADE: Yes, and I thank you for that 

question. Someone who, say, could aid and abet, or have 

the intent to aid and abet purchasing alcohol for a 

minor, a natural and probable consequence of that could 

be joyriding.

 I would also like to -- turning to the 

question of the natural and probable consequences 

doctrine, the government is incorrect when it states 

that the majority view accepts the natural and probable 

consequences.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are there cases that hold 

that the natural and probably consequences of purchasing 

alcohol for a minor could be joyriding?

that. However --

JUSTICE ALITO: Or anything else that 

somebody might do after getting intoxicated?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Partying maybe I would 

understand. I don't know about joyriding.

 MR. MEADE: The natural and probable 

consequences theory cuts across a wide variety of 

crimes, as the government points out. So it would also 

cover the different provisions under the INA such as 

burglary, theft, and other provisions as well. The 

government, though, is incorrect in stating that the 

natural and probable consequences is a majority view. 

Even in its brief, the government only sets forth 22 

states that it says apply that analysis.

 Those 22 states that the government cites, 

many of them do not support the proposition that it is a 

majority view or even applied in those states. For 

example, just to give a couple of examples, the 

government cites Missouri as a state that applies the 

natural and probable consequences doctrine. However in 

Missouri, in the very case cited by the government, 

People v. Evans, the court rejects the use of the 

natural and probable consequences doctrine and says, 

"The use of the natural and probable consequences 

doctrine was error as a matter of law."

The same is true -- and that's on the same 

page the government cites. The same is true with 

respect to Maryland, where the same footnote that the 

government cites rejects the natural and probable 

consequences doctrine in favor of a narrower theory. 

It's also true in Idaho, Louisiana, Georgia and Texas, 

also do not apply the natural and probable consequences 

doctrine.

 So what, the government here is seeking to 

hold someone guilty of a theft offense as an aggravated 

felony without the requisite mens rea, and something 

that's a minority view of the states.

 Just to put this into context, under the 

natural and probable consequences doctrine, it's as if 

California passed a statute saying that in some cases 

someone can be guilty of burglary without the mens rea 

of burglary, or saying that one can be guilty of theft 

without the mens rea of theft.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument isn't 

limited to theft offenses, correct? That would cut 

across all of these areas in which the federal law 

refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?

 MR. MEADE: Yes, it would. So it would not 

necessarily apply to the non-Taylor provisions such as 

the one --

you aided and abetted natural and probable -- somebody 

did X and the natural and probable consequence was 

Y. Because after all, you are properly held guilty when 

you do an act and a known consequence is Y. So what's an 

example of that?

 MR. MEADE: Sure. I'd be happy to give a 

number of examples.

 JUSTICE BREYER: One would be good enough. 

The best one.

 MR. MEADE: If you intend to aid and abet 

robbery, you intend to aid and abet robbery, you can be 

held liable for an unintended rape of another. If you 

aid and abet --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. That's a 

real case?

 MR. MEADE: That's a real case, and I'll 

give you the cite. People v. Banks, 2002 Westlaw 192, 

720. There's another case cited in our brief, aid and 

abet robbery, natural probable consequence, sex 

offenses, that's the People v. Nguyen case. Another 

example, a person who has the intention to aid and abet 

battery, beating someone up, can be held guilty for an 

unintended robbery.

 And to show how stark this is, this is in 

California, it's broader than even the common law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like the doctrine 

of unnatural improbable consequences.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're asking us to say 

that not only do the states have to have the same rule, 

but they have to interpret the rule the same way. This

expression of the rule of law by the state courts, but 

to its application by the state courts in every 

jurisdiction. I mean, that just makes the whole 

enterprise infeasible, it seems to me.

 MR. MEADE: What the Taylor analysis looks 

to is what's in the heartland of a certain crime, and 

here what's in the heartland of aiding and abetting. 

And what we have here is an aberrant doctrine of 

California law that is outside the mainstream.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me tell you, what's 

aberrant is the California interpretation of the 

standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is 

you intend the natural and probable consequences of what 

you do. And if California has, some California courts 

have come up with weird notions of that, I don't know 

that that destroys the uniformity among the states.

 MR. MEADE: Just to briefly respond?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, sir.

 MR. MEADE: The rule that you state is that 

one intends the natural and probable consequences of 

one's own acts. We do not dispute this rule. The 

question is as applied to aiding and abetting liability, 

and California is one of a handful of states that 

applies the natural and probable consequences doctrine 

to aiding and abetting liability, which has the novel

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be completely 

inconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to 

say that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of 

potential liability such as proposed by the respondent, 

which would exonerate him from application of this 

statute, that he has the burden to show that that's what 

happened?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would Taylor allow us to 

do that sort of burden shifting?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well ultimately, 

Justice Kennedy, we don't think that Taylor controls on 

the question of what Congress's intent was under the 

INA. Ultimately Taylor was a question about Congress's 

intent in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, and 

every aspect of that decision was tied in some way to

Congress's intent there.

 We think Congress's intent in enacting the 

aggravated felony provision of the INA has to be that it 

didn't intend that you would have these highly arcane 

comparisons of some general definition of aiding and 

abetting, which either would or wouldn't include the 

infinite variety of formulations of aiding and abetting.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so your general rule 

to accomplish your objective would be?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: It's the one I suggested 

when I was up here earlier, which is a holding by this 

Court that Congress intended to include aiding and 

abetting liability in the aggravated felony provision, 

and intended to cover whatever formulations were extant 

in 1988 when the provision was enacted. The Court can 

leave open the possibility that if in some future case, 

some jurisdiction were to enact an extraordinarily far 

reaching theretofore unheard of formulation, for 

example, anybody who intentionally insists -- assists --

without regard to whether the person even knew about the 

principles of criminal conduct, could be held liable as 

an aider and abettor. In that circumstance, it might 

well be the case that a state, by adopting such a far 

reaching theory of aiding and abetting, would in effect 

forfeit the right to have any of the subsequent

provisions in its criminal code treated as aggravated 

felonies unless the government in the immigration case 

could somehow prove that the alien wasn't convicted as 

an aider and abettor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I think that, the problem I 

guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory 

of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that 

there was a concept of a generic offense. And when 

aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural 

and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that 

regardless of what the actual count is, even on your 

count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it. 

And I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore, 

form an element of a generic offense when it is -- or a 

generic concept of the offense -- when it is a minority 

view.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, even under our 

fallback position, Justice Souter, under which you would 

have to come up with some general definition of aiding 

and abetting and then make a comparison with the law of 

aiding and abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction. 

And even if it's, you know, 20-20 or 18-18 among the 

states on this particular wrinkle in the law of aiding 

and abetting, we think it is frankly dispositive in this 

case, that it is the Federal rule, and my friend

Mr. Meade has not disputed that.

 We think it's just inconceivable that 

Congress would have intended that in a Federal criminal 

case if you're charged with murder, you can be convicted 

under a natural and probable consequences theory such 

that you could conceivably spend life in prison the same 

way a principal would, and yet you would not be subject 

to the same immigration consequences as somebody 

convicted of the principal offense of murder, and 

indeed, that you wouldn't even be able -- the government 

wouldn't be able to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why didn't we simply take 

the closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I -- in Taylor?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that one of the 

problems in Taylor was that there really is no Federal 

definition of burglary. That's part of it. The other 

part of it is to some extent, the Court did rely on the 

Federal definition in Taylor. The original version, the 

original version of the office statute defined burglary, 

and it defined it in a generic way which was broader 

than the common law rule.

case?

MR. HIMMELFARB: No, it wasn't. It was a 

criminal case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you are in effect, you 

would say that the rule should be, or the modified 

Taylor rule for application here should be that it's 

either got to fall within the concept of the Federal 

offense, or in default of there being a comparable 

Federal offense, a generic offense defined by reference 

to state practice?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: May I answer the question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Our primary submission is 

that in the context of aiding and abetting, there 

shouldn't be any generic definition beyond what the 

states apply, whatever the formulation. Our fallback 

position is essentially what you just described, and we 

think we should prevail under it because we think we 

have the Federal rule. We think we have the majority 

rule in the states. And we have the common law rule as 

well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Himmelfarb. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
