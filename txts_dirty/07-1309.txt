 (11:16 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument in Case 07-1309, Boyle v. United States.

 Mr. Fernich.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC FERNICH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FERNICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This is a case about a defendant's right to 

an independent jury determination of each essential 

element of a RICO offense, specifically a pattern of 

racketeering and a separate enterprise that is more than 

just a duplication of the pattern.

 To keep the elements apart, ensure their 

distinct consideration, and give the enterprise 

independent meaning, juries must be instructed, as in 

the Seventh Circuit and elsewhere, that an "enterprise" 

requires a structure separate from the commission of the 

predicate acts forming the pattern.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fernich --

MR. FERNICH: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- are we talking just 

about the instruction to the jury? I know you think 

that the instruction given here was incorrect. But is

it just a question of charge error or are you saying 

that there was insufficient evidence of enterprise for 

this case to go to the jury?

 MR. FERNICH: I am not suggesting, Your 

Honor, that there was insufficient evidence of -- of 

enterprise to go to the jury. My primary point is with 

respect to the charge. We do contend --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying if a proper 

charge had been given, this jury on this evidence still 

could have convicted the defendant?

 MR. FERNICH: We contend, to be sure, that 

the evidence was legally insufficient under Rule 29. 

But we are pressing principally the first -- the jury-

argument claim here in this Court. We do contend that 

the evidence was legally insufficient.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you make that -- did 

you make that objection in the trial court?

 MR. FERNICH: Yes, we did, and we preserved 

it in the court of appeals as well. And there was, as 

Your Honor knows, no published opinion with respect to 

either issue, so both issues are preserved.

 Now, Your Honor, under the Second Circuit 

rule that functionally conflates the two elements, that 

is enterprise and pattern, the jury in this case was not 

so instructed as to the need for an enterprise with an

existence separate and apart from the racketeering acts 

forming the pattern. For that reason we contend that 

the judgment below must be vacated.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The -- the error was the 

failure to give the instruction that appears on page 95 

of the joint appendix? Is that the error that you are 

complaining about?

 MR. FERNICH: Not merely so, Justice Alito. 

That is why the entire relevant excerpts from the jury 

charge are included in the joint appendix. We objected 

to the entirety of the charge, in addition to requesting 

specific language of our own. To be sure, the principal 

error of which we complain in this Court is the failure 

of that instruction anywhere to require, as this Court 

required in the United States v Turkette, and as 18 

U.S.C. 1962(c) itself requires, an entity with a 

structure separate and apart from the pattern of 

racketeering.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you mean by 

that precisely? Suppose you have a group of people, the 

ringleader goes and gets a safecracker, he gets a 

wheelman, and so forth, all the people he needs for the 

crime; and he says we are going to call this the -- the 

Brinks Job Group, okay? We are the Brinks Job Group. 

But that's the only thing that he has put the group

together in order to do. But it's still a group. He 

calls it a group and he gets all these guys together and 

they -- they meet and have lunch together, and do a lot 

of stuff together.

 Would that meet your -- your condition of a 

separate association from the predicate acts?

 MR. FERNICH: To be sure, we would contend 

that it would be a question in the first instance for a 

properly instructed jury, but without more on the 

hypothetical that Your Honor has posited, the answer to 

that question is no. There is no ongoing decisional 

apparatus, no continuing directional mechanism.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except insofar as it is 

directed to the Brinks job.

 MR. FERNICH: Except the degree of 

organization, I should say, inherent in each individual 

predicate act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you imported --

I'm looking at your quotation from Turkette, at page 5 

of your brief. It doesn't seem to me conclusive of your 

point. In order to answer Justice Scalia, you had to 

interpolate, to add various words. You had to say --

you said an ongoing organization with directions or 

something to that effect. That is not what Turkette 

says. Turkette says "as proven by evidence of an

ongoing organization, formal or informal, that is 

continuing." That's all it says.

 MR. FERNICH: To be sure, Your Honor, we 

don't contend that Turkette is directly controlling of 

the issue and we go through a lengthy textual exegesis 

in our brief of why we think that implicit in the 

factors of ongoing organization and continuing unit is a 

structure requirement. But what Turkette did 

unequivocally say is that there must be an entity 

existing separate and apart from the pattern of 

racketeering activity. There was no such instruction 

given in this case -- and the word "entity," which 

appears in section 1961(4) itself and appears twice in 

the Turkette decision, surely connotes an ascertainable 

structure with an existence separate and apart from the 

pattern of racketeering.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does "structure" 

mean? I think you said it doesn't mean that this has to 

be an organization with a president, a treasurer; it 

doesn't mean that.

 MR. FERNICH: It could mean that in an 

appropriate case, Your Honor. It surely would be 

probative --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is -- what is the 

minimum to qualify as having a structure?

MR. FERNICH: The minimum is a separate, 

ongoing, continuing existence apart from the commission 

of the predicate acts themselves, and the members 

necessary to commit those predicate acts, because that 

by definition, I should say, is the pattern of 

racketeering activity; and moreover, it is also inherent 

in any criminal conspiracy that extends over time.

 To be more specific, the bare minimum 

requisites for a structure would be: an ongoing 

directional mechanism; a continuing decisional-making 

unit -- decisionmaking unit, I should say -- and some 

sort of coherent existence between the commission of the 

racketeering acts themselves. Those are the main 

ingredients.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So all you have to 

do, to pick up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical, is just 

not the Brinks job, but you have to have one more crime, 

and that's it; then everything you've talked about is 

satisfied?

 MR. FERNICH: No, that is, respectfully, not 

what we contend, although in an appropriate case it is 

conceivable that a properly instructed jury may find 

structure on those facts. The point that we are 

conveying here is that this is principally a jury 

question, and a jury that is properly instructed will

make findings, presumably, as to what the -- whether the 

structure was extant, and those findings would command 

substantial deference on appeal, as they do in the 

circuits that have applied a structure requirement; and 

it would be a relatively easy task for an appellate 

court to defer to the jury's findings in such a case. 

There is a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The jury -- the words 

that you asked for, what was it? "Ascertainable 

structural hierarchy." And suppose the judge gets 

questions from the jury: "Your Honor, what do you mean 

by ascertainable structural hierarchy?"

 MR. FERNICH: I'm -- I'm sorry, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Those are the words that 

you wanted the judge to include in the charge --

MR. FERNICH: To be sure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and it's your 

requested charge, as to say to have an enterprise you 

need to have -- the group has to have an ascertainable 

structural hierarchy. Those are the three words in your 

requested charge.

 MR. FERNICH: Well, respectfully, Your 

Honor, it goes beyond that, because the end of --

ask for those.

 MR. FERNICH: I did, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And now I'm asking you, 

what does that mean? The judge gives your charge, the 

jury is puzzled: Your Honor, we don't understand what 

you mean by "ascertainable structural hierarchy"; would 

you please tell us specifically?

 MR. FERNICH: Yes, Your Honor. First of 

all, the charge that we are asking for specifically is a 

charge that is given in the Seventh and Eighth Circuits 

which says a structure separate from the commission of 

the predicate acts themselves. If a jury were puzzled, 

in that instance the judge could, as spelled out in 

pages 31 through 35 of our reply brief, give examples, 

any number of examples that have been spelled out by the 

lower courts in -- that have adopted a structure 

requirement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And some of those 

examples it seems are present here. One you gave was 

longevity, well, this has been going on for 10 years; 

another was a unique way of operating, and they are 

specialists in deposit boxes and they have look-out 

people and they have people who actually break into the 

bank, and they have a certain amount of skill.

 So we have longevity, modus operandi, and a

division of labor. They have some people being their 

lookouts and other people doing other things. So I was 

looking at your list in the reply brief, and it seems to 

me that this organization, this association of 

individuals, has some of those characteristics.

 MR. FERNICH: Your Honor, first of all, to 

get right down to the nitty-gritty of the verdict in the 

case, it's important to focus on what the jury actually 

found. The enterprise as charged was a 10-year 

enterprise. There were three predicate acts found by 

the jury ranging in date from late December of 1998 

through early January of 1999. So the longevity aspect 

is certainly something that we dispute here.

 Again, to answer Your Honor, to go back to 

the beginning of our argument, to be sure the thrust of 

our argument in this Court is directed to the jury 

instruction in this case. It may be conceivable, we 

don't for a minute concede that the evidence was legally 

sufficient under rule 29. That said, had a jury been 

properly instructed and made such a finding, i.e., to 

find a separately structured enterprise, that would be a 

finding that would command significant deference, and 

I'd be hard-pressed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do you need a 

hierarchy? Why do you need a boss? Why can't it be a

democratic mob? I mean, there is no boss and they agree 

that all of their decisions will be taken unanimously?

 MR. FERNICH: We don't contend before this 

Court that it must be hierarchical per se. Certainly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what you 

requested. Isn't -- isn't that the instruction you 

requested?

 MR. FERNICH: On the facts of this case, 

consistent with the examples that are spelled out 

comprehensively in both the opening brief and the reply 

brief, that is the one that we focused on. But to be 

sure -- to be sure, I also objected to the charge as 

given in its entirety. In this Court we don't press the 

contention that a hierarchical structure -- hierarchical 

structure is an irreducible minimum. We do --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you couldn't, could 

you, because the -- an organization can consist of an 

individual. And it seems to me that all of the 

requirements that you have been specifying would in an 

individual case be met simply by showing that there was 

-- there was an individual in business who had a brain.

 MR. FERNICH: An individual, Your Honor, is 

-- is a legal entity under the first clause of 1961(4). 

It means a sole proprietorship in this context. And an 

individual, a legal entity, as set forth in the first

clause of 1961(4), by definition --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but, if I set up a 

newsstand, it's a sole proprietorship and that's all I 

have to do. And if I have a functioning brain, I have a 

decisionmaking mechanism. I remember from day-to-day 

what I did, so I have continuity. And -- and it seems 

to me that all of these requirements are -- are 

virtually satisfied as a matter of course by an 

individual who engages in any kind of business that 

might have interstate-commerce implications.

 MR. FERNICH: And that is not an absurd 

result. It is a -- and it is a result that squares with 

the primary purpose of the statute as enacted, which was 

to prevent the subversion and infiltration of legitimate 

business by criminal elements.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, absolutely. But it 

seems to me that it -- it puts you in sort of a -- a 

difficult position to -- to be calling for or -- or 

requiring jury instructions that call for, as necessary 

conditions, findings of structure, continuity, decision-

making, capacity and so on, when in fact on -- on at 

least one variety of enterprise, these conditions are --

are met virtually automatically simply by having 

somebody doing business in any way.

 MR. FERNICH: To be sure, Your Honor, we are

only calling -- and the problem only arises in the 

context of an association-in-fact enterprise. The great 

weight of authority and the plain language of 1961(4) 

does not define an individual as an association-in-fact 

enterprise. And it does not square with the plain 

language of the statute to call an individual an 

association-in-fact enterprise. And, moreover, doing so 

would create a whole set of other problems, 

distinctly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I agree, but an 

individual can be an -- an enterprise.

 MR. FERNICH: A legal enterprise.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and an association, 

in fact, can be an enterprise. And if we accept those 

two propositions, then I think you've got a tough row to 

hoe in saying that any enterprise which is not an 

individual has got to have all the formal 

characteristics that you talk about, given the fact that 

those characteristics are automatically satisfied by an 

individual.

 MR. FERNICH: We don't -- we don't press 

that contention, Your Honor. We specifically press it 

for the phrase "any union or group of individuals 

associated in fact, although not a legal entity." The 

"individual" portion appears in the first clause of the

statute. The distinctness problem simply does not arise 

in the context of a legal-entity enterprise.

 And it's important to note, as this Court 

said in Salinas -- recognized in Salinas ---virtually 

every criminal prosecution that is brought under 1962(c) 

is brought against an illicit association-in-fact 

enterprise. The -- the scenario of an individual being 

an association-in-fact enterprise, I don't think it's a 

valid association-in-fact enterprise as a matter of law. 

There is a line of cases from the Seventh Circuit that 

says it's not.

 And this structural problem, having a 

structure that is distinct from the pattern of 

racketeering activities so that the two elements, I 

should say, are kept separate and apart, only arises in 

the context of an association-in-fact enterprise, which 

is, of course, a very, very wide swath.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it include, let's 

say, a street gang? How about -- this may be before 

your time, but "The Lavender Hill Mob"?

 MR. FERNICH: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Alec Guiness movie, 

"The Lavender Hill Mob."

 MR. FERNICH: Oh, well, certainly we don't 

have any quarrel with the proposition of street gangs,

and many of them are cited in our briefs. The great 

preponderance of typical RICO prosecutions are 

hierarchical, drug-type street gangs which have 

regimented structures. And again, to answer 

Justice Scalia's question, we don't contend that that is 

a strict necessity, but certainly they are not going to 

have a problem establishing a structured enterprise with 

a regimented drug gang.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If hierarchy is not 

required, then I'm not clear what more -- what you think 

needs to be shown beyond the fact that there was an 

association in fact and whatever continuity needs to be 

shown in order to establish the pattern. What -- what 

needs to be shown beyond that?

 MR. FERNICH: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE ALITO: What needs to be charged to 

the jury that they must find beyond that?

 MR. FERNICH: We contend that they must be 

charged that there has to be a structure separate from 

the commission of the predicate acts themselves. The 

Seventh and Eighth Circuits use pattern jury 

instructions that give that precise charge. And there 

has been, to my knowledge, no reported difficulties --

JUSTICE ALITO: But What does that mean?

take the test most prominently from Your Honor's own 

home circuit as spelled out in the Riccobene case: A --

an ongoing decisional-making apparatus to guide the 

affairs of the enterprise, a directional mechanism.

 The Third Circuit in Riccobene said an 

overseeing, clearinghouse and coordination function, and 

-- and a cohesive existence between predicate acts.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I just --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Basically, you described 

this -- this gang. One -- one person is a guard. The 

other person brings the hook to pull the -- the box off. 

Another person scouts it out. Another person's got the 

scanner. It seems to me to fit precisely what you have 

just described.

 MR. FERNICH: The gang has no structure 

aside from that which is a necessary incident to the 

commission of each racketeering act. We don't contend 

there has to be a formal organization, but there is no 

evidence of any continuing, ongoing organization other 

than that when they get together to commit the predicate 

crimes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it pretty clear that 

if the -- the person who is supposed to be the lookout 

doesn't perform his job, he is not going to be included 

in that next heist?

MR. FERNICH: There is no evidence of that 

in the record to my knowledge, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there a record that 

this is a more or less steady group that hangs out 

together, except when one of them gets caught and put in 

jail, and then they replace him with someone? But this 

is -- this was explained as a group that meets regularly 

in the Brooklyn Social Club?

 MR. FERNICH: Your Honor, the testimony 

about the Brooklyn Social Club is -- is a little bit 

overdrawn, I would say. And I would direct the Court to 

pages 58 and 74 through 75 of the joint appendix, and 

this is the testimony of the witness Gerard Bellafiore, 

whose testimony, by the way, is the only testimony we 

know for a fact that the jury credited. Quote: "Just a 

club to hang out in, not for any type of anything."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the members 

owned the club, right?

 MR. FERNICH: Yes. That -- that's true. 

But that -- there is no evidence in the record that they 

would do anything other than, for example -- and this is 

not in the record -- for example, shoot pool at the 

club. And -- and Bellafiore himself was careful to 

qualify it in that way so that he wasn't gilding the 

lily.

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you have a gang that 

gets together every Friday afternoon and by democratic 

means they decide what crime they are going to commit 

that weekend. And they are multi-talented so they --

they look at the whole list of RICO predicates, and they 

choose a different one each -- you know, each weekend to 

commit. And they do that over some period of time, and 

in doing that they perform different roles at different 

times. Is -- is that an enterprise?

 MR. FERNICH: It sounds to me like a jury 

could -- if they are having regular Friday meetings and 

they are using sophisticated means to canvas the RICO 

statute with a degree of complexity and sophistication 

to figure out what they are going to do or maybe even 

try to evade the statute, it probably --

JUSTICE ALITO: We will take that part out 

of it. They don't look at the statute. They just --

whatever crime comes to somebody's mind. They -- they 

want to commit a crime every weekend to -- to make some 

money. But it is a different thing, done by different 

means, different roles.

 MR. FERNICH: If the jury --

JUSTICE ALITO: Does that have an 

ascertainable structure?

 MR. FERNICH: If the jury were properly

instructed that there had to be a structure separate and 

apart from just that which is inherent in the commission 

of each act, a properly instructed jury probably could 

well find the requirements satisfied on -- on the 

hypothetical that Your Honor has posited.

 The cases say -- the cases out of the 

Seventh Circuit say it is not a high hurdle. They say 

it's a low hurdle, and there has to be some structure, 

but not much -- not much to distinguish between --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what structure would 

there be there? What characteristics of that group 

would satisfy the structural requirement?

 MR. FERNICH: The ongoing existence, the 

regular meetings, and the degree of sophistication 

employed. And it implies that they are not just sort of 

getting together on an impromptu basis as opportunities 

arise, but they are sitting around on a regular basis 

for a -- a continuing period of time and planning things 

out. What are we going to do this weekend? What are we 

going to do next weekend?

 Let's twist the hypothetical a little bit. 

Maybe they project our three or four weeks ahead of 

time. That's what RICO is -- is getting after, some 

kind of sophistication, some kind of coordination. This 

is the crux of the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about during the 

period that this man -- what was his name, Mangia --

MR. FERNICH: Mangiavillano, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. When he was running 

the show, it seems that he was a leader, and that the --

and that the group wasn't quite as democratic before he 

got sent to prison.

 MR. FERNICH: Your Honor, the testimony in 

the record is that -- again, what was found by the jury 

here. The testimony is that Mangiavillano and Boyle and 

Bellafiore never committed any crimes together. It is 

-- it is very extensively briefed in -- in the lower 

court. The Second Circuit never addressed it. There is 

a long multiple-conspiracies argument. We are not going 

to get into that in this Court.

 The fact is that Mangiavillano had nothing 

to do, nothing to do with the bank burglaries found in 

this case. There were three burglaries found as RICO --

I shouldn't say "burglaries" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't what I meant.

 MR. FERNICH: Okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I meant, would the 

organization, as it was described to exist at the time 

Mangiavillano was there, would that have satisfied the 

definition of "structure" because it had a leader?

MR. FERNICH: It may have at that point, but 

there was no evidence -- and -- and because it's outside 

of the time frame of what the jury has found, there is a 

lot more diversity in the criminality that was alleged 

during that period.

 A properly instructed jury may have found 

that there was an enterprise existing at that time, 

Although I'm not even sure a jury could so find under 

Turkette because the core of the membership changed very 

dramatically over a period of time. But the leadership 

would be one -- to be sure, leadership is something that 

a jury could take into account and could permissibly 

find if they were properly instructed. On the facts of 

this case, I cannot answer that question definitively.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you try something out 

in your mind, and maybe you can't react to it. I'm 

trying to figure out how the structure requirement, what 

to say, and a thought was occurring to me which I am not 

wedded to, I would like some reactions to it: Is to say 

that there is a structure means that among this 

association of people there must be rules, 

understandings, or behavior that tend to keep the 

association together over time, other than those which 

would be essential to allow them to commit the 

particular crimes at issue.

MR. FERNICH: Certainly the defense would 

take a ruling like that, but what --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know, but I'm 

trying to work out in my mind, is that a sensible thing 

to say? The trouble with the word "structure" is 

everything in the universe has a structure, and so it's 

awfully vague? I'm trying to make it a little bit more 

specific.

 MR. FERNICH: A structure -- the structure I 

don't think entails necessarily rules, regulations, et 

cetera. I don't think the word "structure" --

JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't what I said. I 

said: Rules, understandings, forms of behavior that 

tend to keep the association together over time, other 

than those rules, understandings and associations and 

behaviors that would be necessary -- "necessary" meant 

strongly -- to commit the particular crimes at issue.

 MR. FERNICH: Is Your Honor's question is 

that a sensible definition of "structure"?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. FERNICH: Yes, it is a sensible 

definition of "structure."

 And if there are no further questions, I 

would like to reserve the rest of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 An association-in-fact enterprise need not 

have an ascertainable structure distinct from the 

predicate act of racketeering committed by one of its 

associates, whatever that means. RICO's statutory text, 

its surrounding context, and this Court's construction 

of the statute show that RICO's definition of 

"enterprise" is broad and contains no such limitation.

 Petitioner's primary argument, that the term 

"enterprise" is rendered superfluous and merges with the 

charged pattern of racketeering acts, is wrong for at 

least three reasons: First, it's wrong as a formal 

matter. The enterprise is a group of individuals. The 

pattern is a series of acts. Second, it fails to 

account for the fact that the relevant pattern of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, 

wait. I assume that he was responding to the argument 

that you can establish the enterprise from the mere 

existence of the pattern of the acts, from the separate 

acts. And if indeed it takes nothing more than the acts

to constitute the enterprise, it seems to me he has a 

point.

 MR. YANG: That goes to my second reason.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so we'll forget about 

your first one.

 MR. YANG: Well, let me go to -- which I 

think it addresses the second reason. It's distinct as 

a formal matter, which is that have you to have find a 

group of individuals versus a series of facts. You can 

infer the group from their actions, just as can you 

infer, you know, a relationship between individuals by 

the way they act together. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So --

MR. YANG: My first point is a formal one. 

The second point goes straight to the statute: That the 

relevant pattern of racketeering acts that is at issue 

in RICO -- this is 1962(c) -- is a pattern of acts 

committed by an individual defendant, not a group. In 

fact, in H.J. this Court explained that the premise that 

the pattern has to be performed by a group or an 

association -- this is at page 244 of the Court's 

opinion there -- was wrong and that the pattern can be 

fully the work of an individual acting alone.

 It's also wrong because an enterprise 

remains wholly distinct and pertinent in numerous RICO

contexts under the government's interpretation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: When you say "individual," 

the first part of the definition of "enterprise" speaks 

about any individual partnership, corporation, 

association, or other legal entity.

 MR. YANG: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So then, I've read 

somewhere that people feel that where that individual is 

involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal 

entity such as a sole proprietorship. Is that right?

 MR. YANG: An individual can be an 

enterprise as a sole proprietorship, if that's the 

question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm talking about a legal 

entity. And in the second clause, what we are talking 

about here, specifically, it is "a corporation, a union, 

or a group of individuals associated in fact although 

not a legal entity."

 MR. YANG: That's correct. I think there 

may be some miscommunication on my part. I would direct 

the Court to page 5a of the appendix which reproduces 

section 1962(c). It states: "It shall be unlawful for 

any person" -- it doesn't say "group," "enterprise" or 

an "association" -- "that is employed or associated with 

an enterprise" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What appendix? Not the 

joint appendix?

 MR. YANG: Excuse me. The appendix to our 

brief. I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 MR. YANG: The gray brief. So what's 

relevant for purposes of showing an element of a 1962(c) 

violation is that the defendant alone, perhaps with 

others, but the element is the defendant has to commit a 

pattern of racketeering. There are other elements. For 

instance, the defendant has to do so in a manner that 

participates in the conduct of the affairs of the 

enterprise. But, of course, that embraces a wholly 

distinct concept, that is the enterprise.

 Now, in many cases, as you have here, the 

pattern of racketeering activity of this defendant is 

proved by evidence that that defendant was also working 

in concert with others. And so in that case, the 

pattern element, which, again, is the individual's 

pattern of acts, is proved by the same type of evidence 

that would prove the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then you'd have 

an easy time before the jury. And same thing with 

respect to the individual. All that's saying is that 

when you are dealing with one person, it's pretty easy

to prove that he, you know, directs himself or, you 

know, has an ongoing plan, but that doesn't mean that 

it's not a separate element that the jury should have to 

find.

 MR. YANG: We don't say that it's not a 

separate element, and we also don't say that a pattern 

necessarily would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say that 

it's not distinct from the underlying offenses.

 MR. YANG: No, I don't believe so. I think 

what we have said is that the evidence regarding the 

pattern of activity allows the jury to infer the 

existence of an enterprise because an enterprise --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't have 

to be separately instructed that they have to find that, 

do they?

 MR. YANG: No, they do. And in fact the 

jury can --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 

instruction that the Seventh Circuit and the Eighth 

Circuit give that you don't think is necessary?

 MR. YANG: The instruction is pertaining to 

an ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of 

racketeering. Here you still have to show an 

enterprise, and the jury may not infer an enterprise

from the pattern, but certainly it's open to the jury. 

When that pattern -- again, a pattern is an individual's 

conduct -- but when that pattern is shown through 

evidence that the individual is acting with others over 

a long period of time -- to either establish that it's a 

pattern of racketeering activity, if that same evidence 

not only shows that the individual committed a pattern 

of racketeering activity, but it was done in concert 

with others and that the -- that evidence shows that a 

group of individuals had associated in fact for the 

common purpose of engaging in criminal conduct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree there could 

be a situation in which an individual engages in a 

pattern of racketeering activity together with other 

people and yet is not participating in the affairs of an 

enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity?

 MR. YANG: Well, I think that's the case 

that we gave -- an example that we gave in our brief, 

which is saying an individual commits a very long string 

of bank burglaries and -- actually, make it robberies. 

Robbery is a predicate act; burglary is not. Bank 

burglaries with individuals, but each time he does it, 

it's with a different group of individuals. There you 

-- the individual would be established -- you could 

establish a pattern from, say, the relatedness of the

crimes to an M.O. or a -- and in the long continuous 

string of crimes, more than a few months, perhaps years. 

But it would not establish an enterprise.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And what is -- why would it 

not? What --

MR. YANG: Because there would be -- you 

would --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's lacking there?

 MR. YANG: What would show is that the 

individual is not working in concert with others to 

achieve an end. There's no parallel identity between 

any two of the crimes except for the individual acting 

alone.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought an 

individual -- I thought an individual could be the 

enterprise?

 MR. YANG: One -- he could be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: An independent 

contractor rather than an employee.

 MR. YANG: He could be an enterprise but not 

one -- when an individual acts an alone as an 

enterprise, the individual is not liability for 

racketeering acts under 1962(c) under this Court's 

decision in Cedric Kushner, because there's a 

requirement in 1962(c) that the individual has to be

employed by or associated with the enterprise. And this 

Court has explained that you have to have some 

distinctiveness between the enterprise itself and the 

individual.

 So with respect to the individual, there 

would be no -- there might be an enterprise. It is 

conceivable that he could be deemed an enterprise, but 

not one that has any relevance for RICO purposes under 

1962(c).

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if he has a list of 25 

people who may, on various occasions, want to 

participate with him in bank robberies? So whenever he 

gets the urge to commit a bank robbery, he gets out his 

rolodex and he picks one or more of them and calls them 

up and they commit the bank robbery?

 MR. YANG: I guess it's unlikely that the 

government, if that were the only fact, could show an 

enterprise. If there was some additional evidence that 

the individuals had gotten together and said, yeah, you 

know what, call me, let's work together, when I'm 

available call me, but it just happens he never called 

me twice.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the element, then, 

that is missing?

Court's decision in Turkette, which we think flows 

directly from the language, any group of individuals 

associated in fact, is that the group of persons must be 

associated together for a common purpose of engaging in 

a course of conduct.  And that could be shown, as 

Turkette explained, by evidence of some kind of ongoing 

organization, formal or informal, that -- whose 

associates function as an ongoing unit.

 And in order to prove through one's actions 

with others that there is an entity -- some agreement 

and continuing unit behind it, you are going to have to 

show some identity in the group. If there is no 

identity except for one person, it would be very 

difficult to show an enterprise.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- I guess that's where 

I'm losing the argument. Why is it difficult?

 MR. YANG: It would be difficult to prove an 

association in fact. I'm sorry. It would be difficult 

to prove an association in fact of more than one person 

as the enterprise in that context, because it would be 

difficult to show that that person had joined with 

others for the common purpose of engaging in a course of 

common conduct. It would just be a series of distinct 

crimes.

with the association-in-fact category and simply go with 

the individual?

 MR. YANG: That was my answer to the Chief 

Justice's question, because under 1962(c), there has to 

be distinctiveness in that context.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Two people -- two people 

walk along the street and know each other, suppose 

that's the example, and one of them says I have a great 

idea. Let's go in and take some money out of the post 

office. The other says, what happens if a policeman 

comes? The first one says, we'll bribe him. Okay. 

Then they do it. That's it. Period.

 Now, of course that's illegal. But is RICO 

supposed to catch that?

 MR. YANG: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is it that keeps them 

out of it?

 MR. YANG: Well, RICO requires, among other 

things, a pattern of racketeering.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here we have two --

two -- two related crimes.

 MR. YANG: Well, they can be related, but 

under this Court's decision in H.J. you also have to 

show continuing criminal conduct.

MR. YANG: Well, no. That has a particular 

meaning under H.J., which is that it has to extend over 

an extended period of time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That is the bribery. What 

happens if three months from now the postal inspector 

comes to catch us, we will bribe him.

 MR. YANG: Well, again, I'm not sure that 

that would meet the continuing aspect, either because 

it's a threat of continuing activity or because it would 

satisfy the closing continuity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You are quite right, I 

agree with you that these are different efforts to try 

to catch the same problem. And the problem is that I 

don't think anyone sees that the simple conspiracy in 

carrying out of two criminal offenses by several people 

together without more -- without something more should 

violate RICO. I think your answer to that would be you 

agree with that, but tell me if you don't.

 And then if you do agree with it, the very 

difficult problem is to figure out how to get the people 

to clearly show a pattern or not.

 MR. YANG: I think I agree with that 

proposition. But what needs to be shown is that there 

needs to be an enterprise. Sometimes the enterprise in 

cases are lawful enterprises; sometimes in cases it

involves an unlawful organization or unlawful 

association in fact, like we have here. And that is 

shown -- the statutory requirement, as explained in 

Turkette, is simply that this group of people associate 

together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of 

conduct.

 Now, when you have a long -- a series, like 

we have here of racketeer -- of crimes. These sets of 

crimes went on for almost a decade, involved dozens and 

dozens of bank heists.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In fact, your friend 

said that the period the jury found was just a couple of 

months.

 MR. YANG: Yes, that concerns the predicate 

acts of racketeering. This is -- this raises another 

important issue, which is, the group largely was 

committing bank burglaries. Those are not predicate 

acts. The predicate acts here under RICO involve the 

interstate transportation of stolen funds. There were 

three of those that were charged as the predicate act, 

and the jury found those to constitute a pattern.

 But what this group of individuals were 

doing, is they were associating in fact for a very long 

period of time, committing dozens of bank -- bank 

burglaries, and did so sometimes with the interstate

to the jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it is not at issue in

district court. The objection that was made, which was 

a J.A. 95, was that there was an ascertainable 

structural hierarchy which seems to be abandoned at this 

point, distinct from the charged predicated acts of 

racketeering, that was repeated at 103, 108, and 109. 

And then there was also an objection that the entity has 

to have a particular or formed structure, and that has 

been abandoned and also inconsistent with Turkette, 

which recognized that this could be an informal 

association.

 And, in fact, there was not an objection to 

the entire charge. Counsel at page J.A. 97, after --

when the court explained that it was going to address 

his proposed charge at J.A. 95 said, you know, I have 

some specific objections to the charges written, and 

then went through them, and raising those two objections 

as we've just discussed here.

 So, we've kind of evolved in terms of what 

this case is all about. And even if the Petitioner were 

right, I don't think he could prevail, even under the 

charge he wants in this case.

 But let me turn to a few anomalies with 

respect to Petitioner's interpretation of a structure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that, Mr. 

Yang, could you give us a sense, if you know it, about 

the practical results of the different formulas that --

there are at least three formulas, I take it that the 

different circuits have approved. In the result of the 

RICO prosecution, does it really make a difference which 

one of these is charged or do they could out the same 

way, anyway?

 MR. YANG: It will make a difference in some 

cases. There is a case called Bagaric that this Court 

cited in its National Organization for Women Against 

Scheidler. In there, there was a -- the -- involved a 

group of Croation nationalists, loosely knit, who agreed 

to promote their anti-Yugoslavian through a series of

acts they committed over a series of years, extortion, 

murder, bombings. There was no structure, it would be 

very difficult to fit into the ascertainable structure 

distinct from the predicate act of racketeering that 

Petitioner espouses.

 There are other cases involving loosely knit 

gangs such as neighborhood thugs. The Nascimento case 

involved a neighborhood group of thugs that protected 

each other, and that was their common -- common bonding 

element through killing rivals or intimidating 

witnesses. There's no hierarchy there. There were no 

colors, no initiation rights. But this went on for over 

a long period of time.

 But beyond the classic cases that might fall 

outside RICO, if the Court were to adopt an 

ascertainable structure requirement, I think as 

Petitioner's laundry list of -- of examples -- unless 

my -- his reply brief illustrates, that is going to 

involve a long course of case-by-case adjudication.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What did you think -- what 

did you think of the -- probably not much of it, but 

what did you think of my effort there? And I am trying 

to point out, as you see, I am open to anything that 

will deal with what I think of as a functional problem 

and the functional problem is exhibited by that Posner

example I gave you or by two investment companies that 

decide, what we will do is we will issue a letter that 

is going to be shown to two different people; that is 

their only association; or maybe 100 people, but they 

know who they are, and they are going to be shown this 

letter over a period of five or 10 years, and someone 

later comes back and says there is a false statement in 

the letter. Well, they shouldn't issue a false 

statement, but is that RICO?

 I mean, so -- so the object -- the object is 

to find a way of not overextending RICO where there is 

nothing there but a conspiracy to commit two crimes. 

Pattern is one help. The pattern is pretty vague, so 

all the courts but one have come along, I take it, with 

this other help, which is playing on the word structure.

 Now you have heard what I said as a weak 

effort to try to do something. What is your best effort 

to do something to deal with the problem? Or what's 

wrong with my effort? Whatever you want to say.

 MR. YANG: Let me first address what is your 

underlying concern, that there is a problem. Turkette 

addressed that; Turkette addressed that it doesn't 

matter that the evidence used to establish these 

separate elements may in case of --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's different.

That's -- of course the same evidence can establish two 

separate elements.

 MR. YANG: The --

JUSTICE BREYER: The problem will be 

conflating the elements so that every single case that 

you have the first set, you also have the second set.

 MR. YANG: That problem does not exist as 

well, because the relevant pattern of racketeering 

activity that is the element of the crime is something 

committed by individuals.

 For instance, let's take a group of 

individuals who commit a long string, of, for instance, 

burglaries, they do so over a series of years. Bank 

burglary is not a predicate act of racketeering; it's a 

wholly criminal organization; all they do is commit bank 

burglaries. One individual is given the money at the 

end of the -- of each burglary. What we would have 

there is a RICO violation after the individual, because 

the individual, the element is that the individual has 

transported the money in interstate transportation -- or 

across State lines, and that is a RICO predicate; but 

the other things that the group was doing, those are not 

RICO predicates.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no.

 MR. YANG: So the -- so the element, it

doesn't change, if the individual then does it with some 

other people -- let's say he brings his buddy along, two 

of them do it, that just shows the evidence necessary to 

show that the individual -- the evidence showed that the 

individual committed a pattern of racketeering, also 

happens to show he did it with a group, but it's the 

evidence, not the element. The element of the crime in 

section 1962(c) always turns on the defendant.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Always, in a case where you 

sue the investment company because of their one letter 

used four times, it's the act of the individual. In the 

case that Posner used, it's always the act of the 

individual. There's always a criminal act of an 

individual.

 MR. YANG: But if you have --

JUSTICE BREYER: And he has to be 

associated, however, with an enterprise for it to fall 

within RICO, and there also has to be a pattern.

 MR. YANG: If we take --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's going back --

MR. YANG: -- my hypothetical with the 

individual transporting the money alone across State 

lines, you have a pattern. If you just looked at that, 

individual taking money across State lines, by himself, 

that doesn't establish enterprise. What would -- so the

pattern exists independently.

 What would show the enterprise is the fact 

that the evidence might also show that he is doing it 

with other people. That would show that he -- the 

element that is, that he is committing a pattern of 

racketeering activity and he is doing it in concert with 

others, but that goes to the separate element of 

enterprise. That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's right, and our 

problem is he is doing it with one other person whom he 

met once, and they agreed to do it, and it's a common 

law conspiracy; and now suddenly he has done it twice 

with another person who helped him and they said they 

would do it, and now we have RICO; and my belief is --

which you may not agree with -- that that common 

garden-variety conspiracy to say, rob a bank and then 

transport the money a few months later, that that's all 

that's at issue. That shouldn't be within RICO.

 MR. YANG: Let me --

JUSTICE BREYER: You might come back and 

tell me it should be.

 MR. YANG: Let me try to approach that in 

two separate ways. One, Turkette in footnote 5 was very 

clear. The Court explained even if the pattern of 

racketeering activity and the enterprise are established

the same way, it doesn't matter, if enterprise has 

function -- some function, there is no such thing as, in 

other words, partial superfluidities of an element, or 

partial superfluidity of a word.

 Secondly, the concern about conspiracy 

exists in any conspiracy. Conspiracy is an inchoate 

act. You are liable for conspiracy as soon as you made 

the agreement, and under 371 commit an overt act or 

under RICO conspiracy agree to all the necessary 

elements of a substantive RICO offense.

 Congress has -- and not only that, you can 

be charged for conspiracy and charged for completing the 

conspiracy as separate crimes. That's the normal rule. 

That's the normal rule here. You can be charged for a 

conspiracy to commit RICO offenses, and RICO offenses, 

the pattern element I don't think can be overestimated 

here.

 The pattern element is where RICO has --

plus the list of predicate acts of racketeering -- is 

really where RICO gets most of its limiting structure, 

and I think the Court recognized that in H.J.

 It's the pattern which requires related 

criminal acts that can be related in a number of ways, 

and the -- the Court gave kind of a list of that in 

H.J., which I think I won't go through now, but as well

as continuity, and that could be long-term criminal 

activity, not just a single or two, but long-term 

criminal activity, or the threat of criminal activity. 

Interestingly enough --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I am -- I am really 

confused now. I don't -- I am not sure I know what your 

answer to the question presented is, which is quite 

simply must an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO 

have some ascertainable structure beyond that inherent 

in the commission of predicate crimes by its members and 

associates?

 And you -- your answer is no?

 MR. YANG: No. I mean, I guess it depends 

on what you mean -- ascertainable structure --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. YANG: It's very -- I have to say it's 

difficult for me to understand what is being proposed by 

the other side, particularly once you have lost 

hierarchy. Hierarchy is something which is an 

understandable term.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. YANG: But if you are talking about 

structure, structure could mean relationship between 

individuals that enable them to --

the case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. YANG: -- I don't see why a jury cannot 

infer from the fact that over a long period of time the 

alleged members of this group have operated as a unit 

and have committed acts of racketeering, from that 

coordinating conduct that you were not able to infer 

that they had a means of acting as a group.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you would have to 

tell the jury -- you would have to tell the jury you 

would have to find it. Of course the jury can find it, 

but the issue is must the jury be told that it has to 

find it? I think he's conceding --

MR. YANG: Must the jury --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Be told it's not enough, 

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for you to find that 

these predicate acts occurred; you must find -- and you 

can find it just from the predicate acts, if you think 

the evidence will justify that -- you must find an 

organization separate from the mere commission of the 

predicate acts.

 MR. YANG: What does that mean?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know.

MR. YANG: Because Turkette makes very clear 

that an association-in-fact enterprise can exist for 

wholly criminal acts. So if for instance, take a few 

hypotheticals. Let's say a group forms for the basis of 

committing just only predicate acts of racketeering, 

they do that. Nothing else, just predicate acts, over a 

10-year period.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. YANG: All right? One formulation of 

petitioners is you have to look at the charged pattern 

of racketeering acts, presumably because then the jury 

has to find the charged pattern and then that has to be 

distinct from the enterprise. If that is the case --

let's say there is 100 predicate acts of racketeering. 

All that does is say that the government has to show 99 

and leave the last one uncharged. That makes no sense.

 To the extent that Petitioners say that 

okay, there has got to be some -- something other than 

racketeering activity, take for instance, the group that 

does wholly legal, but does criminal non-racketeering 

acts as well as racketeering acts; that's in fact this 

case. Bank robberies and -- excuse me, bank burglaries, 

which is not a predicate act, and interstate 

transportation of funds. It would be wholly anomalous 

to exclude a group that only did bank robberies, which

are predicate acts, but include a group that was only 

partially racketeering but wholly criminal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not at all; not at 

all. That would make a lot of sense, because RICO is 

not intended just to bring in the crimes. They are look 

for something else. They are looking for an 

organization that is involved in these types of things.

 MR. YANG: But there is nothing -- there's 

-- in order to find an organization, you are not going 

to see any more from criminal acts that are not 

racketeering versus criminal acts that are. Both of 

them show --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but you -- you 

would instruct the jury that if these three thefts that 

are covered by RICO occurred over a period of a year, 

and they involved lookouts and scanners and so forth, 

you may infer from these acts an enterprise as defined 

by the statute?

 MR. YANG: They might.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would allow that 

instruction?

 MR. YANG: You -- yes, but there would have 

to be more. You have to explain what would be necessary 

to show an enterprise. And in fact the -- the

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where in your 

briefs or in the materials do we find the definition of 

what the enterprise is, other than in the statute, other 

than the terms of the statute itself?

 MR. YANG: I believe page 17.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, in other -- what 

do I refer to in order to supplement the instruction 

that I just noted -- that I just suggested?

 MR. YANG: Page 17 of our brief reiterates 

the standard, I believe it's Turkette, it comes from 

Turkette and in the appendix to petition -- or excuse 

me, to the joint appendix, the charge is at pages 111 

through 113. That's the charge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's at the bottom of 

111 where it said you can look to see what it does and 

make the inference rather than have -- I forget -- an 

abstract analysis?

 MR. YANG: But it goes on to say that you 

must -- the government must prove that there is an 

ongoing organization with some similar framework, formal 

and informal, for carrying out its objectives and 

various members and associations of the association 

function as a continuing unit to achieve a common 

objective.

 The government must prove that in every

case. In this case, this is not in the J.A., but it is 

in the court of appeals appendix at page 8770, the 

district court specifically charged the jury that they 

must find five separate elements of a RICO offense, 

including the existence of an enterprise as one; two, 

that the enterprise engaged in or its activity affected 

interstate or foreign commerce; three, that the 

defendant was associated in it.

 Eventually you get down to five, that the 

defendant knowingly participated in the conduct of the 

affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of 

racketeering.

 So the district court explained you have to 

define an enterprise. And to find an enterprise, what's 

a necessary element, it said you may infer an enterprise 

from what the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say enterprise. 

I mean, the objection is that the enterprise is no 

different than the various predicate acts.

 MR. YANG: It is different in the sense that 

you can have a series of predicate acts without an 

enterprise, you can have an enterprise without a series 

of predicate acts. Now what, the objection seems to be 

ultimately that the evidence needs to show the predicate 

acts of racketeering may also prove that the enterprise

exists, because when you show predicate acts of a 

defendant, which is the only element, he doesn't have to 

work in concert with others to commit the predicate acts 

of racketeering, but when you show the predicate acts 

with evidence that individual is acting with others, you 

can also show that they have -- there is an association 

in fact of individuals who joined together to pursue a 

common course of conduct. Thank you, Your Honors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Yang.

 Mr. Fernich, you have four minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARC FERNICH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FERNICH: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Very briefly, nobody disputes the 

proposition that a properly instructed jury would be 

able to find that racketeering acts committed by an 

individual is a distinct element from the 

association-in-fact enterprise. The government is 

absolutely right and we agree on that score. The 

problem is the lower courts have misread Turkette. They 

are not focusing on the pattern of activity committed by 

the individual; they have -- and the instruction as 

Justice Kennedy himself quoted in this case encapsulate 

it -- encapsulates the problem.

Comments -- and this is at the bottom of 

J.A. 1111. Common sense suggests that the existence of 

an association in fact is oftentimes more readily proven 

by what it does -- it does, not rather than what an 

individual member does -- rather than by abstract 

analysis of its structure.

 So it only raises a further vagueness 

problem. We agree that patterns of racketeering 

activity are properly committed by individuals. If you 

are going to define the enterprise solely or principally 

by virtue of the pattern, whose pattern would you define 

it by? It doesn't even make any sense. And in 

Turkette, it -- with respect to what occurred in 

Turkette -- and this is at page 5 of my brief, the 

latter -- and this is a quote from Turkette, and it is 

referring to a pattern: "The latter is proved by 

evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering 

committed by the participants in the enterprise."

 We agree in the abstract that a properly 

instructed jury, that the pattern and the enterprise are 

totally different things. The problem is it's a giant 

circular argued by the government. Juries are not being 

properly instructed in that regard, and that only 

compounds the vagueness of the statute.

 The second point I would like to make: the

government presses its principal definition of an 

enterprise in its brief, and what I hear here from the 

government is its common purpose. Common purpose. And 

I would like to direct the Court to the Salinas opinion 

which discussed RICO conspiracy. It's at 522 U.S. --

well, I will give you the -- let's try 118 S. Court 477.

 It looks like common purpose is the hallmark 

of a conspiracy. This is in the discussion of a 

conspiracy: "We rejected argument X because it would 

erode the common law principle that so long as they 

share a common purpose, conspirators are liable for the 

acts of their co-conspirators, which is the Pinkerton 

doctrine which collapses 1962(c) into a general 

conspiracy statute, if you are going to define an 

enterprise principally by virtue of its common purpose. 

My second point.

 As far as the claim that somehow we didn't 

object sufficiently to a charge, I am not going to 

address that in any depth. I would just direct the 

Court to pages 97 through 109 of the joint appendix. It 

-- it spells out exactly what we objected to, and we 

objected to virtually every sentence of the instruction 

that defines or purports to define an 

association-in-fact enterprise.

 As far as the definition of the enterprise,

we would certainly agree with Justice Breyer's 

formulation that something to differentiate it as a 

long-term, goal-directed, decisionmaking apparatus that 

continues in the intervals between the predicate acts 

would do it, but we contend that structure is largely, 

it's a plain English word, it's not 

antidisestablishmentarianism or something like that; the 

jury should be instructed as in the Seventh and Eighth 

Circuits that there has got to be a structure separate 

from the pattern. If the jury has questions, we have 

lots of faith in district judges, as Justice Ginsburg 

pointed out; that if the jury comes back with a question 

the judge could list examples tailored to the 

appropriate case.

 And I just want to hit the common -- the 

purpose underlying RICO here. It's very significant in 

my view that bank burglaries are not in fact RICO 

predicate acts, and if you were to look -- if this Court 

were to look at my court of appeals brief in this case, 

bank burglary is not a RICO predicate act for a reason. 

Congress made the judgment that bank burglaries are 

adequately handled by the States, that the States can 

prosecute them. And the reason why the three bank 

burglaries had to be addressed up as interstate 

transportation of stolen money is this is not really a

Official - Subject to Final Review 

case in which RICO is properly invoked.

 It's fully briefed in my court of appeals 

submission. These are State crimes that a State is 

perfectly capable -- capable of handling on its own. 

And unless there are any further questions, I would 

waive any further rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

the case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
