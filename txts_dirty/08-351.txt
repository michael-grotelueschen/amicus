CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-351, Alvarez v. 

Smith. 

Mr. Castiglione. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL CASTIGLIONE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Mr. -- excuse me. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Despite the holding in Von Neumann that the 

civil forfeiture hearing itself is all the process that 

is due for the seizure of personal property, the Seventh 

Circuit struck down Illinois's Drug Asset Forfeiture 

Procedure Act specifically because it does not require 

an additional adversarial hearing that takes place 

post-seizure but before the forfeiture hearing. 

As far back as this Court's decision in 

Gelston v. Hoyt and Slocum v. Mayberry, this Court has 

recognized that the civil forfeiture hearing itself is 

the single unitary hearing, where all persons having an 

interest in the property are present and the following 

questions are resolved: One --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any other 

area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a

prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property 

without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for 

that seizure? 

We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do 

we, except in some narrow circumstances? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Except in some narrow 

circumstances, and I note -- and certainly in 

garnishment cases and in replevin cases that you would 

have to have that type of hearing. But the interests 

are different here. The State's interests in the -- in 

the seized property takes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's --

MR. CASTIGLIONE: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't deny that 

there's a State interest. The question is who tests 

that interest? In what time frame? Meaning you can 

assert an interest, but someone has to determine whether 

it really exists or not. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Your Honor, historically, 

that has always been at the civil forfeiture hearing, 

and that's going -- as I say, going back to Gelston, 

because what -- what Gelston recognized is that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Castiglione, you have 

been asked to address the mootness question -- both 

counsel.

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have forfeiture 

proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases? Is there 

any lingering question concerning the status of the 

property? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: No -- Your Honor, the 

forfeiture cases have concluded, it's true. We --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have concluded? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: They have concluded. 

The -- there are three -- three of the Respondents 

sought the return of cars. Three had had cash seized. 

In the three car cases, the cars had actually been 

returned. In two of the cash cases, the Respondents 

defaulted, and in one of the cash cases, the -- the 

State and the Respondent reached an agreement. So those 

cases are over. 

But we would submit, Your Honor, that this 

case is not moot because, subsequent to the Seventh 

Circuit decision in this case, the plaintiffs filed an 

amended motion for class certification, and that's at 

Docket 49 -- Docket Number 49 of the Northern District 

docket, filed on June 19th, 2008, specifically asking 

for damages and restitution, in addition to declaratory 

and injunctive relief.

case in which this Court has considered the merits of a 

dispute where the individual claims of the named 

plaintiffs expired before we heard argument and a -- and 

a class had not yet been certified? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: That’s not the case here, 

Your Honor. At least one of the -- one of the 

Respondents, a certain Tyhesha Brunston -- her 

forfeiture case ended in 2009, so at the time the 

amended motion for class certification was filed asking 

for damages and restitution. 

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but that wasn't my 

question. The class has not yet been certified, has it? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, it has not, Your 

Honor. That’s true. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And the -- the claims of all 

the named plaintiffs are -- have expired? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, the injunctive 

claims may have expired, with the possible exception of 

the two Respondents whose -- whose cash cases were 

defaulted. But, no, the damage claims, I think were --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were no damage 

claims when the final judgment was entered in the 

district court? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's correct, Your 

Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it was a final

did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the 

court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the 

case, there was nothing for the district judge to do. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, but after the -- the 

Seventh Circuit reversed the district judge's decision 

granting the motion to dismiss, upon -- upon remand, the 

plaintiffs -- then, at that point, asked for a 

certification of the damage class and a restitution 

class and expressly stated that they wished to pursue 

a claim -- a claim for damages and restitution based on 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't granted then, and 

it still hasn't been granted. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's true, Your Honor. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have nobody before 

this Court with a live claim, neither the original named 

plaintiffs nor a certified class. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: I would -- well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So who's here? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: For -- for mootness 

purposes, Your Honor, I think the -- the fact that

plaintiffs were allowed to ask for damages and –- and 

filed a pleading asking --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They did not ask for 

damages originally. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, they did not. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So as the case comes to 

us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing 

the case. The case was only for injunctive relief. It 

goes to the Seventh Circuit. It's in that shape. We 

are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I suppose, if 

the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear 

order. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: I would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there’s no 

controlling authority. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: We would -- that's our 

position, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then I suppose 

the district court doesn't know whether to award damages 

or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a 

decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's correct, Your 

Honor. I mean, the -- whether or not a damage claim

could go forward would depend on the -- on the validity 

of the Seventh Circuit decision. 

And our view, Justice Scalia, is that the 

-- when -- the -- upon -- even though they did not 

formally amend the complaint -- that's true; we 

acknowledge that, but in the -- in the motion for 

class -- in the amended motion for class cert, I think 

the assertion of the claim for damages, at least for 

mootness purposes, is enough to give this Court 

jurisdiction over -- over those claims. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it been there 

originally, but the problem is it wasn't there. The 

case comes to us on a complaint that is simply for 

injunctive relief. And that is moot. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: That -- with the possible 

exception of the two Respondents whose claims defaulted, 

Your Honor, in that it's unclear what it -- to the 

extent they were seeking the return of their property, 

their situation has not changed. Their property never 

was returned. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What were they seeking to 

have enjoined? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: They were seeking, Your 

Honor -- they were asking the court to declare that the 

Illinois statute was unconstitutional for not providing

an interim hearing, and an injunction preventing --

preventing Illinois from enforcing the statute. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- I -- since they 

defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can –- can 

they possibly have any claim left with regard to an 

interim hearing? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I just think the 

nature of their claim hasn't changed. To the extent 

they were seeking the return of their property through 

such an injunction, that hasn't changed for those two 

plaintiffs, Yunker and Williams. But we rest our -- our 

response, Your Honor, and we will --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So am I forgetting, but 

didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the 

claim -- wasn't the class action denied? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: It was denied as moot, 

that's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you didn't appeal 

that? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, we didn't -- we 

didn't appeal at all. The plaintiffs appealed the 

district court's order, which -- it was a single order 

that granted -- I'm sorry -- that granted our motions to 

dismiss and denied plaintiffs' motion for class 

certification as moot. That was the order.

MR. CASTIGLIONE: The two -- well, no, Your 

Honor, they did not. They appealed the order -- they 

appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss -- I'm 

sorry -- the granting of the motion to dismiss. Excuse 

me. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe we should --

we should ask the plaintiffs about that. But you're 

saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not 

moot? Isn't a default the end of it? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: I'm saying they may not be 

moot, Your Honor, in that the claim for relief has not 

-- and they defaulted before, in at least one of the 

cases, before the complaint was even filed. So nothing 

has really changed in the status of their case. I 

believe Mr. Williams -- nothing has changed in his case 

from the time the complaint was filed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said in your opening 

that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the 

petition for forfeiture. But in your brief you 

suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs 

could get back their property pending the ultimate 

forfeiture proceeding. You mentioned a Slocum type 

hearing, a petition for return of their property. So I

don't understand your argument that there's one and 

only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the 

other hand you are telling us that there is a means. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, maybe I can explain, 

and I think it also goes to the -- what is -- why 

the 8,850 -- the use of 8,850 and the Barker speedy 

trial factors makes sense. The one hearing where these 

issues are resolved is a civil forfeiture hearing, it's 

true. But I think what Slocum does, just in a similar 

way to how speedy trial factors operate, it gives the 

claimant an opportunity to come in and ask the court to 

tell the government to fish or cut bait. So you either 

file an action or release the property. I think it 

operates much the same way that the speedy trial factors 

would operate in a criminal case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And they -- and they can do 

that before the -- before the time period has expired? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

And they can certainly do that. That's a remedy that's 

available up until -- up until the forfeiture case is 

filed, and from that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But surely your 

position is going to be that the statutory procedure 

pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing, 

isn't it? I mean, somebody comes in and files a

petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you 

know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not 

going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the 

property. You are going to say, wait until the 

forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois 

law. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I -- the –- what 

Slocum does, Your Honor, we think -- we believe that 

Illinois has recognized for at least over 50 years that 

a property owner has a common law right to come in. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that was before the 

statute was enacted. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: That's certainly true, 

Your Honor, but that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The statute is a dead 

letter if you allow a Slocum action. All you -- all you 

need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute 

says you have to wait for -- you know, that the 

government has 40 days, is meaningless. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, Slocum I think is a 

way of getting into court, getting the government --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. It's a way of 

defeating the statute. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, once -- once the 

government does act, Your Honor, then at that point I'd

say if in fact the government's being -- once the 

government files a forfeiture action, if the 

government's dilatory, there's remedies under – under 

Illinois law, our Code of Civil Procedure, or even 

perhaps a motion to dismiss for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the statute says the 

government isn't dilatory until -- until the time 

period, 40 days. It has 40 days. What does that mean 

if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Oh, the -- I think –- I 

think certainly, Your Honor, the government does have 

the time periods. Yes, I agree with that. The 

government certainly has the time periods. But if the 

case were to somehow to fall through the cracks and 

nothing would happen, I think what -- what the common 

law remedies provide is a safety net for property owners 

to be able to get into court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before the 40 days? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, I would say after the 

40. I would say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. Well, that's a 

different story. These people are asking for a hearing 

before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all 

you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40 

days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't

satisfy what they are asking for. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, I would say Slocum 

provides a hearing after 40 days, Your Honor. I would 

say, if the government does nothing, it's a way of 

getting into court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to do 

anything for 40 days, is what the statute says. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: And we don't dispute that. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say if it -- you 

don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you 

-- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a 

Slocum action. I mean, which is it? One or the other? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, Slocum is an 

equitable remedy. If someone can establish -- I don't 

think before the time has run out in our procedures one 

could probably establish that, but it's possible if a 

case were to -- were to fall through the cracks, and it 

gives --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Slocum then is the 

answer to a very different case. It's a case where 

you have a class action of people whose cases fell 

through the cracks and never got the procedures they 

were entitled to. It doesn't seem at all responsive to 

the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it

falls through the cracks. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, our position, Your 

Honor, is that the -- the statute -- is the regime that 

Illinois has adopted with the time periods, does –- does 

comply with due process. It provides a way of dealing 

with some number of the issues Respondents have raised. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't the basic 

argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all 

the process that is due? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, let me ask you this 

question: Suppose your statute said there shall be a 

forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but 

the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the 

seizure. Would that be adequate? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Under this Court's view --

decision in FDIC v. Mallen, I don't think you would look 

to the outer limits, Your Honor. But I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, I'm saying the 

minimum. The hearing will take place 1 year after the 

seizure, nothing earlier or nothing later. Would that 

be constitutional? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Again, applying -- well, 

if it is possible for the States to do it in a shorter 

fashion --

practice, no background practice. This is a new 

statute. So this -- you have to have a forfeiture 

hearing, as you describe it, that shall take place 6 

months --

MR. CASTIGLIONE: One year later.

process in 8,850 --

the Court has held. I'm asking your view of that 

hypothetical statute.

unconstitutional, then you have to agree that time is –-

hearing --

different argument. It's -- it's not an absolute. 

It's -- we have to consider whether the time period is 

reasonable, right?

State said you can't proceed for 10 years and no one has 

any -- property owner or interest owner has no way of 

going into court, that probably would be --

government's interest involved here and the practicality 

of the situation, and I want to put aside the innocent 

owner defense, which I hope to ask your adversary about. 

But putting that aside, let's take what I envision as 

sort of the typical case where the police officer 

arrests someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and --

without a warrant -- and then has to file a complaint in 

court. 

What -- what is the government -- what is 

the burden on the government, and what would be the 

burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a 

requirement that within some reasonably brief period of 

time after that that there must be the equivalent of the 

filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for 

the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the 

only issue would be whether there was probable cause for 

the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some 

innocent owner defense, but just whether there’s 

probable cause? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: I think there are several 

burdens. One, I think that hearing would be duplicative 

of the ultimate forfeiture hearing. I think if it's an 

adversarial hearing, it might be a way of doing, like, a 

-- like, almost back door discovery in the -- in the 

attendant criminal case if we had to do an adversarial

hearing in a civil forfeiture case. I think it 

disregards the State's interest, Your Honor, in -- in 

promoting informal negotiation and settlement. And 

that's something I had hoped to talk about. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, he was just talking 

about probable cause. How could that be duplicative? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, just something along 

the line --

JUSTICE BREYER: Look, I thought this case, 

though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a 

final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that 

it's more probable than not that the car was used for 

drugs. But under the Illinois law, just as Justice 

Alito said, you can seize a car without a warrant. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And there are lists of 

circumstances. But in the Florida statute that Justice 

Thomas wrote about, it said that a person whose car it 

is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time 

to see if there was probable cause, just as a person 

arrested. You have to bring them before a magistrate 

within a short time to see if there's probable cause. 

Now, how do you do that in Chicago? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, first of all, 

Justice Breyer, we say the complete deprivation of one's

liberty is not the same as the deprivation of property. 

The way we do it under our statute -- the way we deal 

with this issue is there’s -- the statutory regime 

really has two concepts, one for property, seized 

property, that -- whose value exceeds 20,000, and one 

where --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying the answer 

to the question is there is no way? A person who doubts 

this probable cause has no way. He has to wait 6 months 

until there's a forfeiture hearing. He's out of luck 

because then it merges with the merits. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: It does merge with the 

merits. That's historically --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That’s your answer. 

There is no way. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Well, there’s still a –-

JUSTICE BREYER: Then I don't see why you

not? You have pointed to three statutes. Do they give

hearing. And once the hearing is filed, Your Honor, it 

is certainly possible to -- you know, to move to 

expedite the trial. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you get an 

expedited hearing? I thought -- I thought for property 

under 20,000, the State -- the time before the 

forfeiture proceeding could be 187 days. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Forty-five of those days, 

Your Honor, is what would be the property owner deciding 

whether to file a claim. And if -- I mean, one of the 

possibilities -- it’s at section 6 of our statute, which 

is actually nonjudicial in rem forfeitures. If one were 

to simply file -- a property owner simply file a claim 

but not a cash bond, then there wouldn't be a judicial 

proceeding. It would just be informal negotiations with 

the State's attorney. One could always go to court by 

filing a cash bond. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the bond is for 

costs, not to get your car back. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: The bond is for costs, 

right. But the --

MR. CASTIGLIONE: There isn't, Your Honor. 

I would briefly address that. I know I have 1 minute 

remaining. I would like to -- to reserve the time for 

rebuttal. I would like to answer this question. 

No, Your Honor. For bond, about 80 to 85 

percent of our cases are cash, seizures of cash, and as 

the Seventh Circuit recognized, posting a cash bond for 

cash is an absurdity. 

With respect to cars, Your Honor, the 

problem is the State's duty is to be able to preserve 

and prevent the destruction or dissipation of the 

property prior to the forfeiture hearing. If we bond it 

out, we can't guarantee that at the ultimate forfeiture 

hearing, that property would be -- would be preserved. 

Your Honor, I would like -- if I may, I 

would like to reserve the remainder of my time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will afford you 

additional time because the Court's questions have 

intruded upon your rebuttal time.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I would like to begin, if I may, with the 

colloquy that Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia had 

with my co-counsel about the hypothetical where the 

State mandates a minimum time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would think 

you’d begin with the mootness question. 

MR. JAY: I would be happy to begin with the 

mootness question, Your Honor. And I -- although I 

think that it's, to some degree, a question for the 

Respondents what precisely they are seeking. Because 

there are two Respondents, Yunker and Williams, who have 

lost their property. The property is in the possession 

of the State. And if their position is that unless a 

hearing is held within 10 days, which is what they 

originally asked for in their complaint, a probable 

cause hearing within 10 days, if after that no 

forfeiture is possible because timely post-deprivation 

process has not been afforded, if that’s their claim, 

then it appears their claim is still alive because the 

State still has their property.

If, however, their claim expires when the 

forfeiture proceeding is actually held, then that 

proceeding is over and we agree that their injunctive 

claims are moot. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what were they 

seeking to enjoin? 

MR. JAY: It's not entirely clear from their 

complaint, Your Honor. They were -- they were asking 

for the imposition of this 10-day hearing requirement, 

but it -- and they are -- they were contending -- now, 

each of these was filed after the 10 days had run. The 

most recent seizure had occurred 2 months before the 

class action complaint was filed in district court. 

So it appears they were contending that they 

wanted the forfeiture proceeding stopped because a 

hearing had not been held within 10 days. So the 

complaint doesn't make perfectly clear what kind of 

injunction they were seeking except that they wanted the 

imposition of this 10-day procedure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What did the Illinois 

court do? Didn't it remand for an appropriate hearing 

to be given? 

MR. JAY: Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit 

remanded for the district court to fashion -- to fashion 

some kind of procedure, that's right. And after that

remand order the plaintiffs, interpreting what the 

Seventh Circuit had said, filed the amended motion for 

class certification that Mr. Castiglione referred to, 

and in that they said they wanted a class certified to 

pursue damages for the time that their property was 

detained, and they wanted the court to certify a class 

of anyone who had had their property held for more than 

7 days this time without -- without a proper hearing. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right that what is –-

what is the rationale your supporting it for the 

following: My car was parked on the street. There 

happened to be some big drug crime nearby, and the 

policeman took my car. In my opinion, there was no 

probable cause. I would like my car back. 

Now, I take it that in Illinois there is no 

proceeding, as there was in Florida, so that I can claim 

there was no probable cause, and I -- none at all. I 

never get that determination made; and, moreover, I have 

to wait, for 6 months possibly, before I get a different 

determination made, which is whether they had –- more 

likely than not, whether that's entitled to forfeiture 

on the merit. 

Is that the law? If anything like it is the 

law, what’s the constitutional justification for it?

pointing out that it's not the law, because the State's 

ultimate burden at the hearing is not preponderance of 

the evidence; it's probable cause. It's -- it's 

precisely the same burden that --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean they can keep my 

car even if it's more likely than not that it was never 

involved? 

MR. JAY: When the -- when the State shows 

probable cause, the burden shifts to the claimant to 

prove by a preponderance -- so the ultimate burden is by 

a preponderance.

fine. 

MR. JAY: But it’s --

JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. That is – all 

right. That's a burden of proof thing at the final 

thing. That's not the thrust of my question. 

The thrust of my question is: Do I have to 

wait for up to 6 months before I have any magistrate, 

any neutral official, pass on my claim there was no 

probable cause to take my car? 

MR. JAY: And, Justice Breyer, you –-

JUSTICE BREYER: And the Florida statute, by 

the way, doesn't do that. It says of course you get a 

hearing on probable cause.

MR. JAY: The Florida statute -- you are

statutes legislated by the 50 States that use asset 

forfeiture or the Federal Government, does provide an 

adversarial probable cause hearing within the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So nobody gives you 

-- they go around taking cars even without probable 

cause. There’s no way to do -- it happens in every 

State. 

What’s the constitutional justification for 

making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a 

neutral judicial official to say whether there was even 

cause to take his car? 

MR. JAY: The constitutional justification, 

Justice Breyer, requires that a reviewing court look at 

each step in the process, and it's not just a matter of 

6 months from beginning to end. That process in 

Illinois and in many other systems has different steps. 

The first step is investigation and notice. 

The -- and then the second step is deciding whether to 

pursue this. The third step is completely in the hands 

of the claimant, where the claimant decides whether to 

pursue a judicial hearing. And the fourth --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You take the 

car and then you investigate? 

MR. JAY: Your Honor, there’s more to 

investigate than just the probable cause to seize. In 

many cases, the probable cause to believe the car is 

forfeitable is ironclad, but there is more to 

investigate because, for example, an innocent owner in 

Illinois by statute is entitled not to have her car or 

her gun or her personal -- other personal property -- it 

could be currency -- forfeited. And that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but you are –-

but you’re sort of begging the question. You are saying 

to me that initial period is for the government to 

figure out if it made a mistake or not, and we're 

entitled to that time. You're not entitled, meaning 

you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who 

will make that decision without a personal interest in 

the outcome, because the person who seized does have an 

interest of some sort. Many local police departments do 

in seizing property, because they keep the proceeds. 

So what you're saying is that 

constitutionally it's okay for the party holding on to 

property without a warrant to decide whether or not it 

wants to give something back, whether or not there’s 

-- there’s a viable defense. I'm a little confused.

MR. JAY: Let me respond to that in a couple 

of steps. And the first is to respond to your point 

about the incentives that local police departments may 

face. There is no incentive to -- to hold property 

longer than necessary because, while the property is 

being held, there is no ability to access that property. 

If it's currency, for example -- as Mr. Castiglione 

pointed out, 85 percent of their seizures are -- the 

currency is held in a suspense account and is not 

accessible by the -- by the seizing government at all. 

So the government has no interest in delaying longer 

than necessary, especially for cars. The government has 

to take care of the car, maintain it in a lot, you know, 

preserve it from -- from harm. 

Second, on the basic question of what is the 

government doing during this time? The government has a 

due process obligation, especially in an in rem 

proceeding like this one, which deals with a piece of 

property to which there may be competing claims. The 

government has a -- itself has a due process obligation 

to notify everyone who has a claim to this property that 

it’s in the government's custody and that there will be 

a proceeding to adjudicate the competing claims to it. 

I mean, this Court in Robinson v. Hanrahan, 

a decision in 1972, held that Illinois under its

forfeiture statute had violated due process by not 

providing notice to the owner -- to the registered owner 

of a car, because it sent notice to that owner at his 

address when in fact he was in the custody of the State 

of Illinois in a criminal proceeding. 

The State has an obligation to notify -- to 

investigate, especially after a seizure, even if it is a 

car which only a minority of seizures are -- even if it 

is a car. Identifying the driver is not enough to 

identify who has a claim to that car. There may be a 

registered owner. There may be -- there may be a 

security interest. In currency cases, it's even more 

difficult, because on the face of currency there is no 

indication who owns the currency --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just get you to 

answer what I thought you were going to do at the 

beginning of the argument. How do you answer my 

hypothetical? You have a forfeiture hearing, but you 

have a provision that it shall not take place for 6 

months. 

MR. JAY: And that, of course, as I think 

the hypothetical recognizes, Justice Stevens, is 

different from a statute like we have here where there’s 

a maximum time, but it may well take place within --

different. I’m just curious to know what your answer 

is. 

MR. JAY: My answer, Justice Stevens, is 

that it might well be unconstitutional as applied. And 

the Court, in 8,850, says --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it be 

unconstitutional on its face? 

MR. JAY: It wouldn't be unconstitutional on 

its face, Justice Stevens, because sometimes the State 

has a valid interest in holding property for more than a 

year, as Mr. Castiglione said. In 8,850 itself, the 

property was held for 18 months. The Court has said in 

any due process case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that justify a 

statute that says in all cases it shall be held for at 

least 18 months without telling the owner? 

MR. JAY: I think, Your Honor, that if the 

State responded to an 8,850 defense and said -- and said 

nothing other than the statute says 18 months or 

10 years, and -- you know, and we have done nothing 

during that time, I think that it would be 

unconstitutional as applied. 

But as a practical matter, States and the 

Federal Government are not sitting around doing nothing 

after seizing property. They are actively investigating

who has a claim, they are notifying all claimants, they 

are allowing -- allowing those claimants to file claims 

if they wish. A majority of all seizures are 

uncontested. 

And then whenever a claimant wants one, that 

claimant is entitled to an in rem judicial hearing, 

where all -- all claimants come into court and have --

have the government's right to seize the property 

adjudicated and also the affirmative defenses, such as 

the innocent owner defense. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose a situation in 

which the property taken is really essential to the --

to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it --

a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every 

day. And -- and there is really no reason why the --

why the government has to wait that long. 

Is there no procedure by which he can say, 

you know -- do it quickly. You don't have to wait so 

long. I'm the owner. I'm the only owner. I can -- I 

can prove that. Let's have a quick hearing. 

MR. JAY: I think that as the Federal 

framework reflects, that is the kind of situation that 

is -- that can be addressed by legislation. And the 

Federal hardship provision, 18 U.S.C. 983(f), is a good 

way of illustrating that; that the government has

where the government can't be secured against the

made a hardship provision for other forms of personal 

property.

no hardship under the Illinois statute? There is no

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS PETERS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. PETERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This case is not moot. It's not moot 

because at the time that the plaintiffs filed the case 

they clearly had standing. They immediately moved for 

class certification. And although their motion for

class certification was denied, it was denied because 

the merits of the case were simultaneously denied. And, 

in fact, this Court has addressed a situation remarkably 

similar to this in United States Parole Commission v. 

Geraghty. 

In the Geraghty case, the class was not 

certified. It was denied, as it was here. The case 

became moot because the plaintiff in that case was a 

Federal prisoner, had been released on parole, and 

nonetheless the Court allowed the case to proceed. And 

the reason the Court allowed the case to proceed, as I 

understand it, is that the "capable of repetition, yet 

evading review" doctrine was invoked. Once that 

document is invoked, the claim -- the standing relates 

back to the time of the filing of the complaint. At the 

time of the filing of the complaint, there was standing, 

and the putative class --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say it was likely 

to -- these same named plaintiffs were likely –- likely

MR. PETERS: No, that's not what I'm saying, 

Your Honor. What I'm suggesting –-

on -- on, you know, "capable of repetition, yet evading 

review," that's -- that's the test, whether -- whether

indeed these people stand a chance of having the same 

thing happen. 

MR. PETERS: I respectfully beg to differ, 

Your Honor. With respect to class actions and cases 

where the plaintiff has timely requested to certify a 

class, the "capable of repetition" relates to the class. 

There is right now today a class of people in the city 

of Chicago who have their cars impounded. That -- their 

claims are repeating daily. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are begging the 

question. That is, you are assuming that the class is a 

valid class. It hasn't been certified. How -- how can 

you make that -- that argument when there is no class? 

MR. PETERS: Well, I -- I can make that 

argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just an asserted class on 

your part. There’s no class. 

MR. PETERS: Yes, and that was also true in 

Geraghty, Your Honor. There were -- the motion for 

class --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it wasn't. The 

appeal in Geraghty included an appeal of the denial of 

class certification. 

MR. PETERS: Yes, it did, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So both issues – both

the merits and the denial of the class certification –-

were still active before the Court. Here you didn't 

appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the 

mootness of it. 

MR. PETERS: Well, we couldn't, Your Honor, 

because it was inextricably linked to the merits. In 

Geraghty --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but in many 

appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you 

-- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the 

class certification because we still want to proceed as 

a class. You didn't do that. You waited for the merits 

to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action. 

It's a very different procedural step. 

MR. PETERS: I don't think that it is 

significantly different when one considers the concerns 

that animated the Court's decision in Geraghty. The 

concerns that were at issue in that case were the fact 

that the plaintiff was representing a class that was 

going to continue to exist and that as to that class 

there was constantly going to be a claim repeating; and 

that that person, even though the class was denied -- in 

that case it truly -- it was denied on the merits, 

because he had an opportunity to litigate the merits. 

We did not have a -- opportunity to litigate the merits

of the Rule 23 issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Peters, I think the 

Court in Geraghty said it split the interests. And they 

said his interests in challenging the denial of class 

action status continued even though he was no longer 

incarcerated. 

So they were concentrating on his right to 

appeal the denial of class action certification. And 

that's what you don't have here. And that’s what 

distinguishes this case from Geraghty. 

MR. PETERS: I -- I certainly agree that it 

is not an identical situation, Your Honor. But I 

think -- as I said before, I think again that the 

concerns that caused the Court to reach that position in 

Geraghty are in fact the same because in this case 

the -- there is a continuing activity with respect to 

the class. There is some -- there are a group of people 

who are aggressively pursuing the rights of that class. 

There is a live controversy between the government and 

that class. 

So in all of those respects, which are 

similar to what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we must take it as it 

came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from 

the denial of class certification. So we have

individual plaintiffs who are seeking to overturn the 

denial of injunctive relief. And that's all that's 

before the Seventh Circuit. 

MR. PETERS: That was -- that was all that 

was before the Seventh Circuit because I don't -- it 

seems to me that it is just sort of a gratuitous gesture 

to say, I am appealing the denial of the class 

certification ruling, when the class certification 

ruling is itself based entirely on the denial of the 

merits. 

If there had not -- if there had been any 

inkling, any ruling that suggested that the Rule 23 

aspect, the class aspect, was being denied on 

class-related grounds, then of course there would be an 

appeal. But what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: As it turns out it -- it 

wouldn't have been gratuitous. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. PETERS: Well -- I understand Your 

Honor's position, although I --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if I have a different 

position, which is I’d like to see if it's practical 

to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in 

my mind which I’d like you to address. The first 

is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really

address this issue now because there are three Illinois 

statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, 

a right to a hearing at least on probable cause. And 

that's a matter of Illinois law. And although the 

statutes don't seem to say it, they might. 

And the second is that this seems mixed up 

in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my 

mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate 

questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of 

whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you 

are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there 

was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car. 

Now, that latter question I think might be 

impractical in many cases to work out until there's been 

a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which 

may be much later. 

But the former question is where I think you 

have a point, that there are five instances here in this 

statute where a policeman could seize a car without a 

warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of 

them nonetheless. So your clients might say: He did 

not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to 

contest it. 

Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a 

different question than the final hearing about who's

entitled to the car. And I also see the three statutes 

and now I see a case where here in front of me 

everything is mixed up. So I think -- perhaps I'm just 

seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up 

confused and not separated out. So why don't we 

wait? What's your answer now? 

MR. PETERS: I think that -- that waiting 

would be the prudent thing to do. And it's 

unquestionably true that what we're suggesting with 

respect to the preliminary hearing is not identical to 

the final hearing. The final hearing is -- is on the 

merits. It decides where the property is going to, 

finally and ultimately. The hearing we are talking 

about is a conditional release hearing, similar to what 

happens in Krimstock, similar to what happens under the 

Civil Asset Forfeiture Review Act. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then if 

it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally 

released, there’s no security for the government. If 

it turns out later on it shouldn't have been released, 

it's probably gone. 

MR. PETERS: Well, there -- there could be 

grounds for -- there could be ways of getting security 

for it. I mean, perhaps a person would post some other 

collateral because they desperately needed the cash at

that moment. I certainly agree with Your Honor that the 

bond procedure is much more in tune with and much more 

likely to work with cars than with other property. 

JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you --

MR. PETERS: Sure. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- exactly what you think 

needs to take place at this hearing? And the hearing 

you think has to take place within 10 days? Is that 

your figure? 

MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor. In the 

complaint we did reference 10 days, and the reason we 

did that is because we thought that that was an 

appropriate time frame. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, whatever the period 

is: 10 days, 14 days, whatever. Some short period. 

MR. PETERS: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I have two questions: Must 

it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State 

disprove the innocent owner defense? 

MR. PETERS: No and no. I think that 

the -- with respect to whether it's an adversarial 

hearing, I -- what we envision is a hearing similar to 

what happens in Krimstock where basically the 

government's burden is met by having police reports 

which on their face establish probable cause to at least

seize the car. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but my understanding 

of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures –- and 

others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI, 

and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner 

defense there. And that's where I see a great 

impracticality in this. I -- I don't see how you can 

expect the State to come into court within such a short 

period and have any burden of contesting an innocent 

owner defense without compromising a criminal 

investigation. 

MR. PETERS: Well, if there was -- my answer 

to that, I think, Your Honor, is in two parts: One is 

the Federal Government is already doing something like 

that with the CAFRA. There are hardship provisions, and 

part of the hearing could include showing by the car 

owner or the property owner that they are in fact likely 

to prevail as an innocent owner. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- I 

thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash. 

So that -- which we are told is 85 percent of the 

seizures involved. 

MR. PETERS: The CAFRA doesn't apply to 

cash. That’s true. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this 

example which is pretty much based on something that you 

–- you wrote in your own brief. Joe is arrested on a 

drug offense driving a car, and there are drugs in the 

car. But Joe isn't the owner of the car; John is the 

owner of the car. Then John comes in 10 days later or 

14 days later and says, well, you know, I never had any 

inkling that Joe was using the car to deal in drugs and 

had no reason to know that. And you think that within 

that short period of time the State has to disprove 

that, you know, that John didn't have --

MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- reason to believe that 

Joe was involved in drug dealing? 

MR. PETERS: No, Your Honor. I think the 

burden will be on the property owner to establish first 

that that the person is the owner of the property, and 

second to establish to some yet-undefined degree that 

they have a likely innocent owner defense. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said -- I 

thought you said the innocent owner defense didn't have 

to be inquired into in the probable cause here. I 

thought that was your position.

what we're suggesting, the order of the Seventh Circuit 

does not invalidate any provision of this Act and in 

fact it's entirely consistent with section 2 of the 

Act, which incorporates by reference Federal remedies 

which include interim remedies. So it is not how the

all you're concerned about is as-applied, you mean you 

are being treated unconstitutionally by a State and you 

have no remedy? 

MR. PETERS: There is a Federal remedy, Your 

Honor, but that is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that enough? 

MR. PETERS: That’s -- that’s certainly not 

enough, Your Honor, for the following reason: It is 

largely impractical for most people -- many of the 

people who are involved in drug forfeiture seizures are 

people with modest to low incomes, probably little to no 

access to attorneys. The likelihood of them 

understanding, first of all, that they may have this 

right, then contacting an attorney and getting an 

attorney to litigate --

are asking for a facial challenge. You want these 

hearings in all cases --

individual circumstances are; isn't that so? 

MR. PETERS: No, that is not so. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not so?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what are the 

individual circumstances of all the other people in 

the class? We don't know what they are. We don't know 

whether it's a car that has been taken, money that has 

been taken, whether they are millionaires, whether they 

need the car. We know nothing about them. 

MR. PETERS: That's correct, Your Honor. 

But that's a function of the fact that this case came to 

the Court without the benefit of discovery, without 

having an opportunity to identify. 

But what I was -- what I would suggest to

necessarily entitled to this hearing. If, for example, 

the police seize my favorite baseball card, I would not 

be entitled to a hearing under the Mathews criteria 

because my favorite baseball card does not justify 

putting the government through the expense. On the 

other hand, there are categories of people -- say they 

seized $5,000. There is some limit below which the 

hearings may not apply. But if all --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what 

if at your innocent owner or the hearing that you are 

seeking, you establish, well, I was going to sell my 

baseball card to give me the money to -- to survive, to 

get food? 

That was my -- I mean, what happens then? 

MR. PETERS: There would have to be -- first 

of all, we don't know how that would administratively be 

handled because of the posture of the case, but my 

suggestion, Mr. Chief Justice, would be this: That the 

likely result in a case -- in this case, is that there 

should be hearings for all car owners and that there 

should be a baseline dollar value below which a person 

is not entitled to a hearing. Now, how that --

the drug -- the suspect is driving the car, there are 

drugs in the car. 

MR. PETERS: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At your hearing, the 

-- it's not registered to him. The registered owner 

comes in and says, that's my car, I had no idea it was 

being used for drugs. 

Who wins, the State or the registered owner? 

MR. PETERS: Well, in -- in those 

circumstances and that's the only car, I would say, 

most likely, the property should be returned to the car 

owner. 

However, I would add that, if the government 

has some concerns about -- for example, that they need 

additional time to investigate this innocent owner 

claim, then by having the hearing in front of a neutral 

and detached person --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, aren't they 

always going to say that? They are going to say, well, 

we don't know if the registered owner is involved in the 

drug conspiracy. We don't know how closely he is tied 

with the owner, so it's reasonable to assume he knew 

what was going on, and besides, we’ve got a lot of other 

bigger fish to fry during this period.

MR. PETERS: Well, I don't think that that 

is likely to happen, and I think what’s going on in New 

York is proof that that is not how it works out, and I 

think --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the situation is much 

worse than that, that they don't have the -- that they 

need time to investigate. They may have the registered 

owner under investigation. 

They may think he is involved in the drug 

conspiracy as well. They may have him on wiretaps. 

They may be preparing to arrest him. Now, you want to

investigation and prepare to -- that makes a great --

to have the filing of the equivalent of a -- of a 

complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone 

is arrested without a warrant, where it's not 

adversarial and you establish probable cause for the 

seizure. 

But when you start to go beyond that in drug 

forfeiture cases, at least, not -- not DWI cases, I just 

don't see how that's workable. 

MR. PETERS: Well, except --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can you 

unpackage for me this hearing? Because there is a 

confusion in it that appears, both in your papers and in 

this argument. 

There’s a probable cause component, which 

is the police coming before a neutral magistrate and 

saying, this is the reason I seized; I have probable 

cause to believe that this car was involved in an 

illegal activity, and this is why. 

And then there is what sounds like, to me, a 

sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are 

looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have 

probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing 

authorities to keep the car because you can post a bond 

instead, or something else should be done to mitigate 

the damage to you during this process of forfeiture.

MR. PETERS: Yes, Your Honor, but let me go 

back in response to your question and, I think, in 

part to Justice Alito's. 

The Seventh Circuit hasn't ordered any 

specific hearing, so I am, at this point, advising the 

Court of what I think this hearing should look like. 

It could well be, upon remand and discovery, 

that what I am suggesting the -- the hearing should look 

like, it may -- it may not look like that at all. It 

could be that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that one of the 

problems with the Seventh Circuit decision? That it 

covers the waterfront. It covers cash, as well as any 

property. It’s not concentrated on cars. 

And what your complaint asks for -- you said 

it was as applied, but you are asking for a declaration 

that defendants must hold a post-seizure probable cause

hearing within 10 business days, and you are asking the 

Court to enjoin the defendant’s current practice of 

seizing property and retaining custody without a 

judicial determination of probable cause. 

That sounds, to me, like a facial challenge 

to this statute, and you are asking for a declaration 

that the statute is invalid, not as applied to any 

particular person. 

MR. PETERS: I think it's invalid as applied 

to categories of people, but I would continue to

unconstitutional as applied to everybody who is not 

given this -- this preliminary hearing. That's --

Your -- the class you want certified is the

saying that this statute is unconstitutional as 

applied.

hearing is entitled to relief because the statute is bad 

as to all of them. 

MR. PETERS: The Seventh Circuit, however, 

did not endorse completely what we alleged in the 

complaint. We, of course, in the complaint, like most 

complaints, ask for as much as you think you might be 

able to get. 

But the Seventh Circuit did not order 

hearings across the board for every single person whose 

property is taken. And I'm not suggesting that every 

single person whose property is taken will necessarily 

be entitled to a hearing. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, can we --

MR. PETERS: There are --

JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. Finish. 

MR. PETERS: There are going to be 

circumstances when the value of the property is de 

minimis as compared to the cost of the hearing. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not the class you 

asked to be certified. You asked to certify everybody 

who had been denied a preliminary hearing. 

MR. PETERS: Yes, I -- I did, Your Honor, 

and in that regard, I was mistaken, but the Seventh 

Circuit corrected my mistake and only ordered a remand 

for a determination as to who it would be, who would be

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where does the 

Seventh Circuit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't change this --

this action from a class action -- from a facial 

challenge into a nonfacial challenge. They can't change 

your complaint. 

You were either asking this to be struck 

down on its face, or you weren't. And what -- what the 

Seventh Circuit did doesn't change that. 

MR. PETERS: Well, Your Honor, I think what 

the Seventh Circuit did does change it because now the 

ruling is what was determined by the Seventh Circuit, 

and the Seventh Circuit did not say that every single 

person is entitled to a hearing. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can I get to the 

merits for a second? 

MR. PETERS: Yes, sir. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Go back to what Justice 

Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking. This 

statute gives a policeman the right to seize some 

property without a warrant if it's a circumstance where 

you could seize a person without a warrant. 

That’s basically what it says, doesn't it? 

MR. PETERS: Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. In that kind of 

situation, I would think maybe you are entitled to a 

quick hearing where the only subject would be: Was that 

language carried out? Was that policeman right? Was 

there probable cause, or wasn't there? 

Now, if that's the issue, I don't see why 

you give up at all on the baseball card. I mean, if 

somebody comes into my house and takes a baseball card, 

and he's supposed to have probable cause and he doesn't, 

I don't see why I can't go get a judge or a magistrate, 

determine whether he had at my baseball card, and pretty 

quickly, too. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them are worth --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if you go to the other 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a lot of money. Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If you go to the other, 

which is whether there’s an innocent owner or whether 

in fact you should give bail to the property -- I mean, 

that's -- I know we give bail to people, but I don't 

know that we give bail to property. Maybe real 

property, but that seems a much more complex argument. 

So I want to know: What's your authority 

that we should give bail to the property and have a 

hearing on that?

MR. PETERS: I don’t --

JUSTICE BREYER: And why do you give up in 

respect to baseball cards or anything in effect to the 

first? 

MR. PETERS: Well, I wouldn’t like to give 

up my favorite baseball card, but the reason that I said 

that, Your Honor, is this: The Mathews criteria, which 

we are espousing here, require a cost-benefit analysis, 

and if the value of the property under that -- using 

that criteria does not warrant a hearing, then as to 

that property, there shouldn't be a hearing. So there 

doesn't have to be a hearing in every case. There may 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it’s as -- so 

it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a 

little bit to the mootness question that we began with. 

Because it focuses on the circumstances of the 

individual claimants, and if the individual claimants 

have already had their property returned, I think it 

accentuates the mootness issue. 

MR. PETERS: I -- I continue to maintain, 

Your Honor, that the -- as long as there was standing 

when the case was filed, and as long as there is a live 

class that could be represented by these class -- or 

putative class --

JUSTICE SCALIA: “My potential class,” you 

should call it. 

MR. PETERS: Potential class. Yes, Your 

Honor. 

Then there is standing on -- and I believe 

that the standing can be established through the 

Geraghty decision. I agree that it is not literally 

identical to Geraghty, but I think the underlying 

circumstances that animated the Court's decision in that 

case are the same and that, therefore, these people 

maintain standing. 

If, however, in response to a question 

that you asked Mr. Castiglione earlier, if the case 

became moot as a result of the return of the property, 

then it wouldn't be a Munsingwear situation. It would 

be a Bancorp v. Bonner situation, because if it became 

moot as a result of the settlement of the case after the 

Seventh Circuit's decision, then the Seventh Circuit's 

decision should stay in place. 

So if -- I do not agree that the case is 

moot, but if hypothetically the case were moot, then we 

are not in a Munsingwear situation; we are in a Bancorp 

situation, because the mootness --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's an 

interesting -- that's an interesting question. I mean,

is it becoming moot through their voluntary cessation or 

activity when the State law requires them to take 

particular action? 

MR. PETERS: No, what -- what I'm saying, 

Your Honor, is if we're -- if we're defining mootness as 

the ultimate return of the property, then the property 

was returned pursuant to settlements in four of the 

cases. The plaintiffs agreed, we’ll pay $400 instead of 

$20,000, if you return our car. The car was returned. 

So if the case was settled and became moot 

because of the settlement, it is not a situation in 

which the Court can adopt the Munsingwear position. It 

really is a Bancorp situation, and the Seventh Circuit's 

decision remains --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, all of these 

problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of 

the court of appeals’ decision basically was to overrule 

the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand. 

So if we said it is moot, you'll just get another 

plaintiff and bring another lawsuit, which is what you 

do if the Court -- we are trying to get into the case 

much earlier than we should, it seems to me. Just let 

the proceedings go ahead on remand and find out what all 

the -- all these factual answers that -- or these 

questions that should be answered.

JUSTICE STEVENS: The mootness -- the 

mootness decision won't really decide anything. You'll 

just say you’ve got to file another lawsuit and start 

over again. 

MR. PETERS: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you just say, we –-

probably, in my judgment, we ought to dismiss this writ 

as improvidently granted and let the record be developed 

and the case go by, and we could decide the issues. 

MR. PETERS: That, it seems to me, is a very 

wise choice of action. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But where you said –- you 

said that --

MR. PETERS: For obvious reasons. But 

beyond that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Seventh 

Circuit -- your complaint, you say, is -- you asked for 

the universe, every kind of property of due process 

hearing within 10 days or a short period. But you said 

the Seventh Circuit narrowed the relief. And I'm 

looking at the Seventh Circuit decision, and I really 

don't see what was narrowed. I think they left 

everything open for the district Court.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is there 

any narrowing? 

MR. PETERS: Well, the narrowing, as I 

perceive it, Your Honor, is this: I believe the Court 

said at different times whether an appropriate remedy 

can be fashioned. The Court did not say for whom. It 

didn't say it must be for everybody. It didn't say what 

would be necessary to trigger the right to the hearing. 

It didn't say how much time would elapse. 

It left -- it did leave, in that sense, 

everything open, but by leaving everything open, it also 

allows the court to narrow the categories of people who 

would be entitled to this hearing that -- in such a way 

that it would be an effective practical remedy.

thought some didn't have it returned, but there was a 

settlement. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: One did, Your Honor, but 

it wasn't in response to the Federal litigation. So our 

position would be if this is moot, this is really --

Munsingwear would apply. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The mootness was not a 

result of any settlement between the city and --

the opposite. I mean --

the cases went to hearing and the three -- with the

back. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't understand. 

They got their cars back, right? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The people who had money at 

stake, what happened to the money? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Two of them -- two 

defaulted and one reached a settlement with the State. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: A settlement? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes, sir. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have at least one 

case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement. 

You have at least one plaintiff, and you can't get the 

kind of remand for mootness that you are asking for. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: No, I understand, Your 

Honor. I'm just making the point that if this case --

if the Court finds it's moot, that we would want --

would ask for an entry of an order vacating the 

orders below pursuant to -- pursuant to Munsingwear. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't do Munsingwear 

orders where -- where the mootness is a result of a 

settlement.

is that the settlement wasn't in response. We didn't 

settle the Federal -- we didn't settle the Federal 

litigation. The -- the underlying forfeiture case was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

answer is that they didn't all settle. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: They all didn't settle. 

That's right. In fact, that's a better answer, I think, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what good would a 

Munsingwear order do, anyway? They'll just file another 

lawsuit, won't they? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: They could. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: They certainly could, if 

you -- they have the right to do that, Your Honor.

judge said -- having read this opinion, which was 

vacated, says, well, I guess it states a cause of 

action, I will deny the motion to dismiss -- we would 

be exactly where we are now.

Judge Breyer said: My car was just sitting there. 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: There is not, Your Honor. 

I mean, the forfeiture is not going to help. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And, second, 

is there any procedure under your State law to do the 

second half of what your adversary said he was looking 

for, a remission-type proceeding that would balance the 

government's need to hold the property and the 

individual's need for it, and whether there is a bond 

that could be posted or not? 

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Not that we –- Illinois 

doesn’t provide for a bond, Your Honor. As we 

indicated, there are problems with bonds, certainly for 

cash and for -- and for other personal property as well, 

but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that may be part 

of the Mathews issue, that once you prove probable 

cause, giving away -- giving back money just never would 

probably be rational to hold a hearing about, but that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you apply a Mathews 

analysis --

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the multifaceted item 

would say for the seizure of cash, maybe only the 

hearing has to address probable cause, but for real 

property it has to go further. Not real property, in 

the sense of real personal property. It has to go 

further, because there has to be some sort of 

protection of the interest of the individual, pending --

MR. CASTIGLIONE: Let me attempt to address 

that. The -- the statute does contemplate, Your Honor, 

section -- especially section 6 of DAFPA, nonjudicial 

remedies, and then essentially if the amount of property 

is under 20,000 or if we are dealing with a car, which 

falls under section 6, those cases are routinely dealt 

with by negotiation, Your Honor. 

And I think that's the best way to deal with 

hardship -- the hardship examples given -- is that both 

through negotiation and a speedy hearing --
