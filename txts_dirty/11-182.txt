3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning in Case 11-182, Arizona v. The United 

States. 

6  Mr. Clement. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The State of Arizona bears a 

12 disproportionate share of the costs of illegal 

13 immigration. In addressing those costs, Arizona 

14 borrowed the Federal standards as its own and attempted 

to enlist state resources in the enforcement of the 

16 uniform Federal immigration laws. 

17  Notwithstanding that, the United States took 

18 the extraordinary step of seeking a preliminary 

19 injunction to enjoin the statute as impliedly preempted 

on its face before it took effect. The Ninth Circuit 

21 agreed with respect to four provisions, but only by 

22 inverting fundamental principles of federalism. 

23  The Ninth Circuit, essentially, demanded 

24 that Arizona point to specific authorization in Federal 

statute for its approach. But that gets matters 

3

1 backwards. 

2  A state does not need to point to Federal 

3 authorization for its enforcement efforts. Rather, the 

4 burden is on the parties seeking to preempt a duly 

enacted state law to point to some provision in 

6 statutory law that does the preempting. Now, the United 

7 States can't really do that here, and the reason is 

8 obvious. 

9  There are multiple provisions of the Federal 

immigration law that go out of their way to try to 

11 facilitate state and local efforts to communicate with 

12 Federal immigration officials, in order to ascertain the 

13 immigration status of individuals. 

14  So, for example, 1373(c) specifically 

requires that Federal immigration officials shall 

16 respond to inquiries from state and local officials 

17 about somebody's immigration status. 1373(a) goes even 

18 further. That provision says that no Federal agency or 

19 officer may prohibit or in any way restrict the ability 

of state and local officers to communicate with Federal 

21 immigration officers to ascertain somebody's immigration 

22 status. 

23  Indeed, if the DHS had --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement --

MR. CLEMENT: Yes.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- could I interrupt? 

2 And turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the state's 

3 view is -- the Government proposes that it should be 

4 read on its face one way, and I think the state is 

arguing that there's a narrower way to read it. But am 

6 I to understand that, under the state's position in this 

7 action, the only time that the inquiry about the status 

8 of an individual rises is after they've had probable 

9 cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?

 MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice 

11 Sotomayor. So this only operates when somebody's been, 

12 essentially, stopped for some other infraction. And 

13 then, at that point, if there's reasonable suspicion to 

14 try to identify immigration status, then that can 

happen. Of course, one of the things that --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I --

17  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- just stop -- stop you 

19 there just one moment?

 That's what I thought. So, presumably, I 

21 think your argument is that, under any circumstance, a 

22 police officer would have the discretion to make that 

23 call. Seems to me that the issue is not about whether 

24 you make the call or not, although the government is 

arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the

1 individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when 

2 individuals are arrested and held for other crimes, 

3 often, there's an immigration check that most states do 

4 without this law.

 And to the extent that the government wants 

6 to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of 

7 detainer. This process is different. How is it 

8 different? 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's different in one 

important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I 

11 don't think that the issue that divides the parties is 

12 only the issue of how long you can detain somebody 

13 because I think the Federal government takes the rather 

14 unusual position that, even though these stops and these 

inquiries, if done on an ad hoc basis, become preempted 

16 if they're done on a systematic basis --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I understand that's 

18 their argument. I can question them about that. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Okay. But -- so that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I want to get to 

21 how -- assuming your position, that doing it on 

22 a systematic -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as 

23 it's been done in the past. Whenever anyone is 

24 detained, a call could be made. What I see as critical 

is the issue of how long and under -- and when is the 

6

1 officer going to exercise discretion to release the 

2 person? 

3  MR. CLEMENT: And -- and, with respect, I 

4 don't think Section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is 

to say I don't think Section 2(B) says that the
 

6 systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the
 

7 ad hoc inquiry.
 

8  And, indeed, Section 2 -- in one of its
 

9 provisions -- specifically says that it has to be
 

implemented in a way that's consistent with Federal, 

11 both immigration law and civil rights law. 

12  So, there --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens if -- this 

14 is the following call -- the call to the -- to the 

Federal government. Yes, he's an illegal alien. No, we 

16 don't want to detain him. 

17  What does the law say -- the Arizona law 

18 say, with respect to releasing that individual? 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know that it 

speaks to it in specific terms, but here's what I 

21 believe would happen, which is to say, at that point, 

22 then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's 

23 any reason to continue to detain the person for state 

24 law purposes.

 I mean, it could be that the original

1 offense that the person was pulled over needs to be 

2 dealt with or something like that. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm putting all of this 

4 outside of -- of -- the --

MR. CLEMENT: But -- but, if what we're 

6 talking about is simply what happens then, for purposes 

7 of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is 

8 nothing. The individual, at that point, is released. 

9  And that, I think, can be very well 

illustrated by Section 6 -- I don't want to change the 

11 subject unnecessarily, but there is arrest authority for 

12 somebody who has committed a public offense, which means 

13 that it's a crime in another state and in Arizona, but 

14 the person can't be arrested for that offense, 

presumably, because they have already served their 

16 sentence for the offense; and then there is new arrest 

17 authority given to the officer to hold that person if 

18 they are deportable for that offense. 

19  Now, I think, in that circumstance, it's 

very clear what would happen, is an inquiry would be 

21 made to the Federal officials that would say, do you 

22 want us to transfer this person to your custody or hold 

23 this person until you can take custody? And if the 

24 answer is no, then that's the end of it. That 

individual is released because there is no independent

1 basis in that situation for the state officer to 

2 continue to detain the individual at all. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how would the state 

4 officer know if the person is removable? I mean, that's 

sometimes a complex inquiry. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

7 think there's two answers to that. One is -- you're 

8 right, sometimes, it's a complex inquiry. Sometimes, 

9 it's a straightforward inquiry. It could be murder. It 

could be a drug crime. But I think the practical answer 

11 to the question is, by hypothesis, there is going to be 

12 inquiry made to the Federal immigration authorities, 

13 either the Law Enforcement Support Center or a 287 --

14 287(g) officer.

 And, presumably, as a part of that inquiry, 

16 they can figure out whether or not this is a removable 

17 offense or at least a substantially likely removable 

18 offense. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it takes two weeks 

to make that determination, can the alien be held by the 

21 state for that whole period of time --

22  MR. CLEMENT: Oh, I don't --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just under Section 6? 

24  MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

and I think that -- you know, what -- in all of these

1 provisions, you have the Fourth Amendment backing up the 

2 limits, and I think so --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would be the 

4 standard? You're -- you're the attorney for the -- the 

alien, he -- they are going to hold him for two weeks 

6 until they figure out whether this is a removable 

7 offense. And you say, under the Fourth Amendment, you 

8 cannot hold for -- what? More than a reasonable time 

9 or --

MR. CLEMENT: Yes, ultimately, it's a 

11 reasonable inquiry. And I think that, under these 

12 circumstances, what we know from the record here is 

13 that, generally, the immigration status inquiry is 

14 something that takes 10 or 11 minutes, I mean, so it's 

not -- we're not talking about something -- or no more 

16 than 10, if it's a 287(g) officer, and, roughly, 11 

17 minutes on average if it's the Law Enforcement Support 

18 Center. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: How do they have -- well, 

the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of 

21 examples. Example one is the person is arrested. Now, 

22 it says any person who is arrested shall have the 

23 person's immigration status determined before the person 

24 is released. So I wonder, if they have arrested a 

citizen, he's Hispanic-looking. He was jogging. He has 

10

1 a backpack.  He has water in it and Pedialyte. 

2  So they think, oh, maybe this is an illegal 

3 person. It happens he's a citizen of New Mexico. And 

4 so the driver's license doesn't work.

 And, now, they put him in jail. And are 

6 you -- can you represent to us -- I don't know if you 

7 can or not -- can you represent to us he will not stay 

8 in jail, in detention, for a significantly longer period 

9 of time than he would have stayed in the absence of 

Section 2(B)? 

11  Do you want to represent that or not? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: I don't want to represent 

13 that --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if you 

cannot represent that -- and I'm not surprised you don't 

16 want to -- I mean, I don't know --

17  MR. CLEMENT: Sure, sure. But what I can 

18 represent --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. CLEMENT: -- is that he's not going to 

21 be detained any longer than the Fourth Amendment allows. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, fine. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: And --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: But the Fourth Amendment --

since -- for -- I mean, that's -- that's another

1 question. I don't know how long the Fourth Amendment 

2 allows. I don't know on that. There probably is a 

3 range of things. But we do know that a person, 

4 ordinarily, for this crime, X, would have been released 

after a day.
 

6 Oh, you know, the Fourth Amendment would have allowed
 

7 more. So, now, what I want to know is what, in
 

8 practice, will happen?
 

9  You -- from your representation, I think
 

that there will be a significant number of people --

11 some of whom won't be arrested. It takes 11 minutes for 

12 some. For citizens, it might take two hours. It might 

13 take two days. Okay. There will be a significant 

14 number of people who will be detained, at the stop or in 

prison, for a significantly longer period of time than 

16 in the absence of 2(B). 

17  Is that a fair conclusion? 

18  MR. CLEMENT: I don't think it is, Justice 

19 Breyer, and here's why it's not: Because, even though 

there certainly are situations where state authorities 

21 will arrest somebody and then release them relatively 

22 rapidly, they generally don't release somebody until 

23 they can nail down their identity and whether or not 

24 they are likely to come to a court hearing at a 

subsequent --

3  MR. CLEMENT: It --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or is it a Fourth Amendment 

problem? 

6  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, it is 

7 neither --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the Government's attack 

9 on this that it violates the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. CLEMENT: No, of course, the Federal 

11 government, that also has a lot of immigration arrests 

12 that are subject to the Fourth Amendment, is not making 

13 a Fourth Amendment claim here. And it's neither an 

14 immigration law concern or something that should be the 

basis for striking down a statute on its face. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: That's a 

17 different argument --

18  MR. CLEMENT: But I do want to -- but I do 

19 want to be responsive and make the point that I think 

the factual premise that this is going to -- 2(B) is 

21 going to lead to the elongation of a lot of arrests is 

22 not true. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Can I make the 

24 following statement in the opinion -- and you will say 

that's okay. Imagine -- this is imaginary. "We 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

1 interpret" -- imagine -- "we interpret Section 2(B) as 

2 not authorizing or requiring the detention of any 

3 individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison, 

4 for a significantly longer period of time than that 

person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B)." 

6  Can I make that statement in an opinion, and 

7 you'll say, that's right? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: I think what you could say is 

9 that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But can I say that? 

11  MR. CLEMENT: I don't think you can say just 

12 that. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: No. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: I think you can say something 

similar, though. I think you probably could say that, 

16 look, this is a facial challenge. The statute's never 

17 gone into effect. We don't anticipate that Section 2(B) 

18 would elongate, in a significant number of cases, the 

19 detention or the arrest. I think you could say that.

 And the reason is, as I indicated, it's 

21 something that happens even without this law that, when 

22 you arrest somebody -- and there are some offenses that 

23 are -- you can arrest and release under state law, but 

24 before you release the individual, you generally want to 

ascertain that that individual is going to show up at

1 the hearing, and that's what really distinguishes those 

2 cases, where there's arrest and release, from those 

3 cases where there's arrest and you book somebody. 

4  Now, here's the other reason why I don't 

think, factually, this is going to elongate things 

6 because, already, in a significant number of booking 

7 facilities in Arizona, you already have the process that 

8 people are systematically run through immigration checks 

9 when they are booked as part of the booking process. 

That's reflected in the record here in the Maricopa 

11 County system, that that's done by a 287(g) officer as a 

12 matter of routine. 

13  The Federal government doesn't like this 

14 statute, but they are very proud of their Secure 

Communities program. And their Secure Communities 

16 program also makes clear that everybody's that's booked 

17 at participating facilities is -- eventually has their 

18 immigration status checked. 

19  And so I don't think that this immigration 

status check is likely to lead to a substantial 

21 elongation of the stops or the detentions. Now, 

22 obviously --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I want to make sure that 

24 I have a clear representation from you. If, at a call 

to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to

1 detain this alien, that alien will be released for --

2 unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me.
 

3 Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's
 

4 immigration crimes.


 MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. Obviously, if this 

6 is somebody who was going -- you know, 60 miles an hour 

7 in a 20-mile-an-hour school zone or something, they may 

8 decide, wholly apart from the immigration issues, that 

9 this is somebody they want to bring back to the station.

 But, for the purposes of once they make the 

11 contact with Federal immigration officials, if the 

12 Federal immigration officials say, look, we have no 

13 interest in removing this person, we have no interest in 

14 prosecuting this person under the Federal criminal 

provisions, then that's the end of the Federal case of 

16 the --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Then tell 

18 me --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you'll concede that the 

-- that the state has to accept within its borders all 

21 people who have no right to be there, that the Federal 

22 government has no interest in removing? 

23  MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't accept that, 

24 Justice Scalia, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's all the

1 statute -- and you call up the Federal government, and 

2 the Federal government -- yes, he's an illegal 

3 immigrant, but that's okay with us. 

4  MR. CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the state has no 

6 power to -- to close its -- its borders to -- to people 

7 who have no right to be there? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: Well, here, Justice Scalia, 

9 here's my response, which is all of this discussion, at 

least as I've understood it, has been about 2(B) and, to 

11 a lesser extent, 6. 

12  Now, Section 3 of the statute does provide 

13 an authority, under state law, to penalize somebody who 

14 has violated, essentially, the Federal registration 

requirement. So if that's -- as to that provision, 

16 there would be a state authority, even under these 

17 hypotheticals, to take action with respect to the 

18 individual --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I think --

MR. CLEMENT: -- but not with respect to 

21 the Federal --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think Justice Scalia's 

23 question was the -- was the broader one, just as a 

24 theoretical matter. Can we say -- or can -- do you take 

the position that a state must accept, within its

1 borders, a person who is illegally present under Federal 

2 law? 

3  MR. CLEMENT: Well, and I think --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is by reason of 

his alien --

6  MR. CLEMENT: And I think my answer to that 

7 is no. I think the reason my answer is no has more to 

8 do with our defense of Section 3 and other provisions 

9 than it does with respect to the inquiry and arrest 

authority provisions, 2(B) and 6. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you move on to 

12 the registration requirement, could I take you back to 

13 an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer 

14 was referring to?

 Let's someone -- let's say someone who is a 

16 citizen and a resident of New Mexico, has a New Mexico 

17 driver's license, drives across the border, is stopped 

18 for speeding, not 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone, 

19 but 10 miles over the speed limit on an interstate. And 

the officer, for some reason, thinks that this person 

21 may be an illegal alien. How would that work out? 

22  If you do the records check, you're not 

23 going to get anything back, right, because the person is 

24 a citizen? So what -- where would the officer take it 

from there?

1  MR. CLEMENT: Well, if I can just kind of 

2 work back for a second? I mean, obviously, it's a 

3 pretty unusual circumstance, where somebody produces an 

4 out-of-state driver's license, and that doesn't dispel 

reasonable suspicion for the officer. But I'll take the 

6 hypo --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it dispel 

8 reasonable suspicion if it's -- if the officer knows 

9 it's a state that issues driver's licenses to aliens who 

are not lawfully in that instance --

11  MR. CLEMENT: And that might be a situation 

12 where that's the case, and then -- then it wouldn't 

13 dispel the reasonable suspicion. But, say, in the 

14 average case, I think it would.

 They would then go further. And then they 

16 would then make the inquiry to the Federal officials. 

17 And then if -- because of the fact that the individual 

18 actually is a citizen or something like that, then what 

19 would happen is, at some point, you'd get to the end of 

a permissible Terry stop, and the officer would release 

21 the individual. 

22  Now, it might not be the end of the matter 

23 because, of course -- you know, they -- they still have 

24 the name, they still have the ability to collect that 

information and try to continue the check as they move

2 driver's license. 

3  But I think the important thing is that --

4 you know, this statute doesn't authorize them to detain 

the individual, certainly beyond the -- the Fourth 

6 Amendment limits. And it really doesn't authorize them 

7 to do anything that the official couldn't do on an 

8 ad hoc basis without the statute. 

9  Now, it does do --

JUSTICE ALITO: That -- that may be the 

11 case, and I would like to ask General Verrilli about 

12 that. But, under the Fourth Amendment, presumably, if 

13 the officer can arrest -- the state officer can arrest a 

14 person on -- simply on the ground that the person is 

removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel 

16 opined some years ago, then, presumably, the officer 

17 could continue to detain that individual that 

18 I mentioned, until they reached a point where the Terry 

19 stop becomes an arrest. At which time, they would have 

to have probable cause. 

21  But, if they had probable cause to believe 

22 the person was removable, then they could hold the 

23 person, presumably, until the -- the person's status was 

24 completely verified, isn't that correct?

 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's correct,

1 Your Honor. 

2  Now, as we read Section 6, because there's a 

3 pre-existing definition of public offense in Arizona 

4 law, we don't think this is kind of the -- the full 

Office of Legal Counsel situation, where you have broad 

6 arrest authority for removable individuals. This is a 

7 relatively narrow slice of additional arrest authority 

8 that happens to give arrest authority for people that 

9 seem to fit the Federal government's priority because it 

really is going to apply to criminal aliens. 

11  But I don't -- I don't take any issue with 

12 what you're saying. I do think, though, it's important 

13 to understand that 2(B) really doesn't give the officer 

14 an authority he didn't otherwise have.

 It does do one thing that's very important, 

16 though, which it does have the effect of overriding 

17 local policies that actually forbad some officers from 

18 making those communications and -- because that's one of 

19 the primary effects of 2(B). It just shows how 

difficult the government's preemption argument is here 

21 because those kind of local policies are expressly 

22 forbidden by Federal statute. 1373(a) and 8 U.S.C. 1644 

23 basically say that localities can't have those kind of 

24 sanctuary laws.

 And so one effect that 2(B) has is, on a

3 You must have those inquiries. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could -- does 

Section 6 permit an officer to arrest an individual who 

6 has overstayed a visitor's visa by a day? They are 

7 removable, correct? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: They are removable. I don't 

9 think they would have committed a public offense --

absent a very unusual situation, I don't think they 

11 would have committed a public offense under Arizona law. 

12 So I don't think there actually would be arrest 

13 authority in that circumstance, as Justice Alito's 

14 question has -- has --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the definition 

16 of public offense? 

17  MR. CLEMENT: A public offense definition --

18 it's actually -- it's a petition appendix -- well, I'm 

19 sorry.

 The definition is, basically, that it's 

21 something that is a crime in another jurisdiction and 

22 also a crime in Arizona. And so what makes this kind of 

23 anomalous is, normally, if something is a crime in 

24 Arizona, there's arrest authority for that directly.

 So what this really captures is people who

1 have committed a crime are no longer arrestable for the 

2 crime because they have served their sentence or some 

3 other peculiarity, but they are, nonetheless, removable 

4 because of the crime. And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, maybe it's 

6 a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in 

7 particular Section 5(C). 

8  Now, that does seem to expand beyond the 

9 Federal government's determination about the types of 

sanctions that should govern the employment 

11 relationship. 

12  You talk about supply and demand. The 

13 Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment, 

14 but it also imposes sanctions with respect to 

application for work. And the state of Arizona, in this 

16 case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions. 

17  MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's certainly imposing 

18 different sanctions. I mean -- you know, it's -- it's a 

19 little bit -- kind of hard to weigh the difference 

between removability, which is obviously a pretty 

21 significant sanction for an alien, and the relatively 

22 modest penalties imposed by Section 5(C). 

23  But I take the premise that 5(C) does 

24 something that there is no direct analog in Federal law. 

But I -- but that -- that's not enough to get you to

1 preemption, obviously. 

2  And one of the things that makes 5(C), it 

3 seems to us, a weak case for preemption is that it only 

4 targets employment that is expressly forbidden by 

Federal law. And so, then we look at -- you know, 

6 essentially, the government is reduced to arguing that 

7 because, in 1986, when Congress passed IRCA, it only 

8 focused on the employer's side of the equation and 

9 didn't, generally speaking, impose restrictions on 

employees, that, somehow, they are going to draw a 

11 preemptive inference from that. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree 

14 that -- would you accept, as a working hypothesis, that 

we can begin with the general principle that the Hines 

16 v. Davidowitz language controls here, and we're going to 

17 ask our principal -- our primary function is to 

18 determine whether, under the circumstances of this 

19 particular case, Arizona's law stands as an obstacle to 

the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes 

21 and objectives of Congress? 

22  Is -- is that an acceptable test from your 

23 standpoint? 

24  MR. CLEMENT: I think it's an acceptable 

test. I mean, Justice Kennedy -- you know, there

1 obviously have been subsequent cases, including DeCanas 

2 that -- and Whiting, that give additional shape and 

3 color to that test, and -- but I don't have any -- I 

4 don't have any real quarrel with that test.

 And here's why I don't think that --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but then the
 

7 government on this section is going to come and say,
 

8 well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the
 

9 enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it,
 

will be in considerable tension with our -- with our 

11 basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from 

12 the government? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: It may be what you're going to 

14 hear, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think you just take 

the Federal government for its word on these things. 

16  You know, it's interesting, in DeCanas 

17 itself, the SG said that that California statute was 

18 preempted. And, in DeCanas, this Court didn't say, 

19 well, you know, we've got this language from Hines, and 

we have the SG telling us it's preempted, that's good 

21 enough for us. They went beyond that, and they looked 

22 hard. 

23  And what they did is they established that 

24 this is an area where the presumption against preemption 

applies. So that seems one strike in our favor.

Official 

1  We have here a situation where there is an 

2 express preemption provision, and it -- it only 

3 addresses the employer's side of the ledger. So the 

4 express preemption provision clearly doesn't apply here. 

So the only thing they have is this inference --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, for those of us 

7 for whom legislative history has some importance, there 

8 seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that 

9 the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised, 

discussed, and explicitly rejected. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. And --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The preemption language 

13 would be geared to what was decided to be punished. 

14 It seems odd to think that the Federal government is 

deciding on employment sanctions and has unconsciously 

16 decided not to punish employees. 

17  MR. CLEMENT: But -- but, Justice Sotomayor, 

18 there's a big difference between Congress deciding not 

19 as a matter of Federal law to address employees with an 

additional criminal prohibition and saying that that 

21 decision itself has preemptive effect. That's a rather 

22 remarkable additional step. 

23  And here's why I think, if you consider the 

24 legislative history, for those who do, it really 

supports us because here's what Congress confronted. I

1 mean, they started thinking about this problem in 1971. 

2 They passed IRCA in 1986. 

3  At that point, here's the state of the 

4 world: It's already unlawful, as a matter of Federal 

law, for the employee to get -- to have this unlawful 

6 work; and, if they seek this unlawful work, they are 

7 subject to removal for doing it. 

8  In addition, Congress was told that most of 

9 the aliens who get this unlawful work are already 

here -- they illegally entered, so they are already 

11 subject to an independent criminal offense. 

12  So, at that point, Congress is facing a 

13 world where the employee is already subject to multiple 

14 prohibitions. The employer is completely scot-free as a 

matter of Federal law. And so, at that point, in 1986, 

16 they address the employer's side of the equation. They 

17 have an express preemption provision that says nothing 

18 about any intent of preempting the employee's side of 

19 the ledger. And, in that, I don't think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They did -- they did 

21 provide -- I mean, your position was the Federal 

22 legislation regulates the supply side. That leaves the 

23 demand side open. But there is regulation, and the 

24 question is whether anything beyond that is inconsistent 

with the -- the Federal -- it's not just that the person

1 is removable, but, if they use false documents in 

2 seeking work, that's a Federal crime. 

3  So we have the -- what you call the supply 

4 side is -- is regulated, but you want to regulate it 

more. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: Two quick responses, and then 

7 I'd like to save time for rebuttal, Justice Ginsburg. 

8  The first is that, if you look at what they 

9 regulate on the employee's side, it's really things that 

actually assist in regulating the employer's side 

11 because what they are worried about is a fraudulent 

12 document that then is used, essentially, to trick the 

13 employer to employing somebody who shouldn't be 

14 employed.

 The second thing is the more that you view 

16 IRCA as actually regulating part of the employee's side, 

17 then I think the more persuasive it is that the express 

18 preemption provision doesn't reach the employee's side 

19 of the equation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you 

21 plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you 

22 have to say about Section 3 before you sit down. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

24 I appreciate the opportunity to do that. I do think, as 

to Section 3, the question is really -- it's -- it's a 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 provision that is parallel to the Federal requirements 

2 and imposes the same punishments as the Federal 

3 requirement. 

4  So it's, generally, not a fertile ground for 

preemption. But, of course, there are cases that find 

6 preemption even in those analogous circumstances. They 

7 are the cases that the government is forced to rely on, 

8 cases like Buckman, cases like --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- double 

prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted 

11 under Federal law for violating, basically, the terms of 

12 3. Could the states then prosecute him as well? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: I think they could under 

14 general double jeopardy principles and the dual 

sovereignty doctrine. Obviously, if that was a 

16 particular concern to you, that might be the basis for 

17 an as-applied challenge, if somebody was already 

18 prosecuted under Federal law. 

19  But, of course, this Court has confronted 

exactly that argument, in California against Zook, where 

21 you had the statute of California that prohibited 

22 somebody operating as an interstate carrier without the 

23 ICC license. It was raised -- you know, you have to let 

24 just the Feds enforce that law. Otherwise, there is a 

possibility of duplicative punishment, duplicative 

29

1 prosecution. And this Court rejected that argument 

2 there. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, it 

4 seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for 

you is Hines, which said the registration scheme --

6 Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which 

7 the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary 

8 regulations. 

9  So I don't see the alien registration as a 

question of obstacle preemption, but appeal preemption 

11 that alien -- we don't want a competing registration 

12 scheme. We want the registration scheme to be wholly 

13 Federal. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think that's part of the reason why I accepted Justice 

16 Kennedy's characterization of the relevant language in 

17 Hines because, although there is some general discussion 

18 there of field preemption, when the Court actually 

19 states what its holding is, it does state it in terms of 

obstacle preemption. 

21  And here's where I think there is a critical 

22 difference between what the Court had before it in Hines 

23 and what you have before you here. 

24  In Hines, Pennsylvania passed its statute 

before Congress passed the alien registration statute.

1 So, not surprisingly -- you know, they weren't -- they 

2 weren't soothsayers in Pennsylvania. They couldn't 

3 predict the future. So, when it got up here, there was 

4 a conflict between the provisions of the Pennsylvania 

registration law and the Federal registration law. And 

6 this Court struck it down on that preemption basis. 

7  Here it's quite different. Arizona had 

8 before it the Federal statute. It looked at this 

9 precise provision in the Federal statute. It adopted 

those standards as its own, and then it imposed parallel 

11 penalties for the violation of the state equivalent. 

12  And so I -- I think the right analysis is 

13 really the analysis that this Court laid out in its 

14 Whiting decision, which says that, in these kinds of 

cases, what you look for is whether or not the state 

16 scheme directly interferes with the operation of the 

17 Federal scheme. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you something? 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: In that regard, we are told 

22 that there are some important categories of aliens who 

23 can't obtain registration -- cannot obtain Federal 

24 registration; and, yet, there are people that nobody 

would think should be removed. I think someone with a

1 pending asylum application would fall into that 

2 category. 

3  How would Section 3 apply there? 

4  MR. CLEMENT: I think it probably wouldn't 

apply. There's two provisions that might make it 

6 inapplicable. The first question you'd ask is whether 

7 that individual in that category would be subject to 

8 prosecution under 1304 and 1306. And, if I 

9 understand -- you know, the Government's position, there 

are certain people where -- you know, they can't really 

11 get the registration document because of the narrow 

12 class that they are in. 

13  And, as I understand it, it is not a 

14 violation of either 1304 or 1306 to not get a 

registration document when you're somebody who can't get 

16 one. So you're not liable for the willful -- willful 

17 failure to get a registration document. And, when you 

18 don't have a registration document to carry, you don't 

19 run afoul of 1306 in the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, of course, if you've 

21 entered the country illegally, you can't get a 

22 registration. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: Well, sure. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: And it would -- but --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that. I 

3 understand the distinction you're drawing, that you 

4 can't be prosecuted for lack of a registration, if you 

couldn't have gotten a registration. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: Well, if you're in -- no, if 

7 you're in the country lawfully, I mean, you can try to 

8 register. And so somebody who enters illegally -- I 

9 mean, they are already guilty of one Federal misdemeanor 

by the illegal entry. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 

12  MR. CLEMENT: But, at the point that they 

13 stay 30 days and don't try to register, then that's an 

14 independent violation. And so maybe I need to fix what 

I said and say, look, if you're somebody who -- if you 

16 did go to register, would be told, you're fine, but we 

17 can't give you a registration document. Then that 

18 individual is not subject to prosecution under the 

19 Federal statute, therefore, wouldn't be subject to 

prosecution under the state statute.

outset what it's not about. No part of your argument 

6 has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it? I 

7 saw none of that in your brief. 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: Where -- that's correct,

portray SB 1070 as an aid to Federal immigration

unlawfully present aliens out of the state.

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: That is our position,
 

Your Honor. It is our position because the Constitution 

6 vests exclusive authority over immigration matters with 

7 the national government. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, all that means -- it 

9 gives authority over naturalization, which we've 

expanded to immigration. But all that means is that the 

11 government can set forth the rules concerning who 

12 belongs in this country. But if, in fact, somebody who 

13 does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona 

14 has -- has no power? What -- what does sovereignty mean 

if it does not include the ability to defend your 

16 borders? 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, the -- the 

18 Framers vested in the national government the authority 

19 over immigration because they understood that the way 

this nation treats citizens of other countries is a 

21 vital aspect of our foreign relations. The national 

22 government, and not an individual state --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's still up to the 

24 national government. Arizona is not trying to kick out

3 state shall without the consent of Congress lay any 

4 imposts or duties on imports or exports except," it 

says, "what may be absolutely necessary for executing 

6 its inspection laws." 

7  The Constitution recognizes that there is 

8 such a thing as state borders, and the states can police 

9 their borders, even to -- to the point of inspecting 

incoming shipments to exclude diseased material. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: But they cannot do what 

12 Arizona is seeking to do here, Your Honor, which is to 

13 elevate one consideration above all others. Arizona is 

14 pursuing a policy that -- that maximizes the 

apprehension of unlawfully present aliens, so they can 

16 be jailed as criminals in Arizona, unless the Federal 

17 government agrees to direct its enforcement resources to 

18 remove the people that Arizona has identified. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the state does --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a question of 

21 enforcement priorities. 

22  Well, let's say that the government had a 

23 different set of enforcement priorities, and their 

24 objective was to protect, to the maximum extent 

possible, the borders. And so anyone who is here

2 something about, in other words, different than the 

3 current policy. 

4  Does that mean, in that situation, the 

Arizona law would not be preempted? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the mandatory 

7 character of the Arizona law and the mandatory character 

8 of the obligations it imposes, in -- especially as 

9 backed by this extraordinary provision in Section 2(H), 

which imposes civil penalties of up to $5000 a day on 

11 any official in the state of Arizona who is not 

12 following Section 2 or, as we read it, the rest of SB 

13 1070, to the maximum extent possible, does create a 

14 conflict.

 But I do think the most fundamental point 

16 about Section 2 is to understand its relationship to the 

17 other provisions in the statute. Section 2 is in the 

18 statute to identify the class of people who Arizona is 

19 then committed to prosecute under Section 3 and, if they 

are employed, also under Section 5. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I have the same 

22 question as the Chief Justice. Suppose that the Federal

6 the national level because it's the national government 

7 and not -- it's the whole country and not an individual 

8 state that pays the price --

where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of 

11 preempting state action?

13 think about Section 3 of the law, Your Honor. I think 

14 it will help illustrate the point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about another 

16 -- another case of ours where we've said that, 

17 essentially, the preemption of state law can occur, not 

18 by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the 

19 executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so 

rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing 

21 it vigorously. 

22  Do we have any case that says that? 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the preemption

judgments about how this law is going to be enforced --

7 all -- with all Federal criminal statutes. And you

9 enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: They -- they can make --

16 a far different matter. 

17  And it really goes to the heart, I think, of 

18 what's wrong with Section 3 of this Act, in that --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you say 

that the Federal government has to have control over who 

21 to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says 

22 anything about that at all. All it does is notify the 

23 Federal government, here's someone who is here 

24 illegally, here's someone who is removable. The 

discretion to prosecute for Federal immigration offenses

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct, but, with 

3 respect to -- and I will -- let me address something 

4 fundamental about Section 2. That is true, but I -- I 

think it doesn't get at the heart of the problem here. 

6  The -- Section 1 of this statute says that 

7 Sections 2 and 3 and 5 are supposed to work together to 

8 achieve this policy of attrition through enforcement. 

9 And so what Section 2 does is identify a population that 

the state of Arizona is going to prosecute under Section 

11 3 and Section 5 --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So, apart 

13 from Section 3 and Section 5, take those off the table, 

14 you have no objection to Section 2?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: We do, Your Honor. But, 

16 before I take 3 and 5 off the table, if I could make one 

17 more point about 3 and 5, please? The -- I think --

18 because I think it's important to understand the dilemma 

19 that this puts the Federal government in.

 Arizona has got this population, and 

21 they've -- and they're, by law, committed to maximum 

22 enforcement. And so the Federal government's got to 

23 decide, are we going to take our resources, which we 

24 deploy for removal, and are we going to use them to deal 

with this population, even if it is to the detriment of

1 our priorities --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. You -- the 

3 Federal government has to decide where it's going to use 

4 its resources.

 And what the state is saying, here are 

6 people who are here in violation of Federal law, you 

7 make the decision. And if your decision is you don't 

8 want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up 

9 to you. That's why I don't see the problem with Section 

2(B). 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Here's the other 

12 half -- here's the other half of the equation, Mr. Chief 

13 Justice, which is that they say, if you're not going to 

14 remove them, we are going to prosecute them. And that 

means that the -- and I think this does get at the heart 

16 of why this needs to be an exclusive national power --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only under Section 3 

18 and Section 5. 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, but those are -- but 

what you're talking about is taking somebody whose --

21 whose only offense is being unlawfully present in the 

22 country and putting them in jail for up to 6 months, or 

23 somebody who --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's 

say you're worried about --

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- or like 30 days, 

2 forgive me. 6 months for employment. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

4 Right.

 For the notification, what could possibly be 

6 wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk 

7 driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in 

8 jail overnight, no matter what, okay? What's wrong, 

9 during that period, by having the Arizona arresting 

officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and 

11 find out if this person is here illegally because the 

12 Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my 

13 question. 

14  It seems an odd argument to say the Federal 

agency has to answer the state's question, but the state 

16 can't ask it. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we're not saying 

18 the state can't ask it in any individual case. We -- we 

19 recognize that section --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there are 

21 individual cases in which the state can call the Federal 

22 government and say, is this person here illegally? 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, certainly, but that

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I don't think so, 

3 Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I think the problem 

4 here is in that -- is in every circumstance, as a result 

of Section 2(B) of the law, backed by the penalties of 

6 section 2(H), the state official must pursue the 

7 priorities that the state has set, irrespective of 

8 whether they are helpful to or in conflict with the 

9 Federal priorities. And so --

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that 

11 every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in 

12 Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona 

13 legislature. And so, without any direction from the 

14 legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make 

these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or 

16 arrested somebody. 

17  Would that be a violation of Federal law? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, it wouldn't be, 

19 Your Honor, because, in that situation, they would be 

free to be responsive to Federal priorities, if the 

21 Federal officials came back to them and said, look, we 

22 need to focus on gangs, we need to focus on this drug 

23 problem at the border --

24  JUSTICE ALITO: But what if they said, well, 

we don't care what your priorities are; we -- we have

6  JUSTICE ALITO: -- that would be okay? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if there's a -- if 

8 there's a state policy locked into law by statute, 

9 locked into law by regulation, then we have a problem. 

If it's not --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I am having --

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- the line is mandatory 

13 versus discretionary --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: That's what I can't 

understand because your argument -- you seem to be 

16 saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that 

17 the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its 

18 employees are doing, and they have to be free to 

19 disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for 

whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal 

21 government, for whom they don't work. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: But they -- but, with 

23 respect to immigration enforcement, and to the extent 

24 all they're doing is bringing people to the Federal 

Government's attention, they are cooperating in the

Justice Kennedy, the problem is that it's not 

6 cooperation if, in every instance, the officers in the 

7 state must respond to the priorities set by the state 

8 government and are not free to respond to the priorities 

9 of the Federal officials who are trying to enforce the 

law in the most effective manner possible. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little 

12 confused -- general, I'm terribly confused by your 

13 answer. Okay? And -- and I don't know that you're 

14 focusing in on what I believe my colleagues are trying 

to get to. 

16  Making the -- 2(B) has two components, as I 

17 see it. Every person that's suspected of being an alien 

18 who's arrested for another crime -- that's what 

19 Mr. Clement says the statute means -- the officer has to 

pick up the phone and call -- and call the agency to 

21 find out if it's an illegal alien or not. 

22  He tells me that, unless there's another 

23 reason to arrest the person -- and that's 3 and 6, or 

24 any of the other provisions -- but putting those aside, 

we're going to stay just in 2(B), if the government

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Taking out the other 

6 provisions, taking out any independent state-created 

7 basis of liability for being an -- an illegal alien? 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think there are three. 

9 The first is the -- the Hines problem of harassment.

 Now, we are not making an allegation of 

11 racial profiling; nevertheless, there are already tens 

12 of thousands of stops that result in inquiries in 

13 Arizona, even in the absence of SB 1070. It stands to 

14 reason that -- that the legislature thought that that 

wasn't sufficient and there needed to be more. 

16  And it -- given that you have a population 

17 in Arizona of 2 million Latinos, of whom only 400,000, 

18 at most, are there unlawfully, there --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Sounds like racial 

profiling to me. 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: And they're -- and given 

22 that what we're talking about is the status of being 

23 unlawfully present, which --

3  GENERAL VERRILLI: There is some evidence in 

4 the record, Your Honor. It's the -- the Palmatier 

declaration, which is in the Joint Appendix, was the --

6 he was the fellow who used the run the Law Enforcement 

7 Support Center, which answers the inquiries. That --

8 that declaration indicates that, in fiscal year 2009, 

9 there were 80,000 inquiries and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What does this have to do 

11 with Federal immigration law? I mean, it may have to do 

12 with -- with racial harassment, but I thought you 

13 weren't relying on that. 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you objecting to 

16 harassing the -- the people who have no business being 

17 here? Is that -- surely, you're -- you're not concerned 

18 about harassing them. They have been stopped anyway, 

19 and all you're doing is calling up to see if they are 

illegal immigrants or not. 

21  So you must be talking about other people 

22 who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration 

23 laws. Okay? Citizens and -- and other people, right?

6 what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.
 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Hines identified this
 

8 problem as harassment as -- as a central feature of
 

9 preemption under the immigration laws because of the
 

concern that the way this nation treats citizens of 

11 other countries is fundamental to our foreign relations. 

12 And this is a --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's -- let me just 

14 go back because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the 

question, I think, others are asking. And one way to 

16 focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement. 

17  Think of 2(B), the first sentence. All 

18 right? 

19  Now, I can think -- I'm not saying they are 

right -- but, if that means you're going to hold an 

21 individual longer than you would have otherwise, I can 

22 think of some arguments that it is preempted and some 

23 replies. So keep that out of it. 

24  Suppose that we were to say, that sentence, 

as we understand it, does not raise a constitutional

1 problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the 

2 policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE, 

3 cannot detain the person for longer than he would have 

4 done in the absence of this provision.

 Now, in your view, is there any preemption 

6 exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument 

7 against that sentence as I have just interpreted it? I 

8 don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm 

9 asking.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I -- we would 

11 think it would ameliorate --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: And if so, what? 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- it would ameliorate 

14 the practical problem. But there is still a structural 

problem here in that this is an effort to enforce 

16 Federal law. And the -- under the Constitution, it's 

17 the President and the Executive Branch that are 

18 responsible for the enforcement of Federal law --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is not an effort 

22 to enforce Federal law. It is an effort to let you know 

23 about violations of Federal law. Whether or not to 

24 enforce them is still entirely up to you. If you don't 

want to do this, you just tell the person at LESC -- if

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: It is, Mr. Chief Justice. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- LESC, look, when 

4 somebody from Arizona calls, answer their question, and 

don't even bother to write it down. Okay? I stopped 

6 somebody else, is he legal or illegal, let me check --

7 it's -- oh, he's illegal. Okay. Thanks. Good-bye. 

8  I mean, why -- it is still your decision. 

9 And, if you don't want to know who is in this country 

illegally, you don't have to. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. But the 

12 process of -- the process of cooperating to enforce the 

13 Federal immigration law starts earlier. And it starts 

14 with the process of making the decisions about who to --

who to stop, who to apprehend, who to check on. And the 

16 problem -- the structural problem we have is that those 

17 decisions -- in the making of those decisions, Arizona 

18 officials are not free --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under 2(B), the 

person is already stopped for some other reason. He's 

21 stopped for going 60 in a 20. He's stopped for drunk 

22 driving. So that decision to stop the individual has 

23 nothing to do with immigration law at all. All that has 

24 to do with immigration law is the -- whether or not they 

can ask the Federal government to find out if this

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I -- I don't think 

that's right. I think we want to be able to cooperate 

6 and focus on our priorities. 

7  And one thing that's instructive in that 

8 regard, Mr. Chief Justice, are the declarations put into 

9 the record by the police chiefs from Phoenix and Tucson, 

both of whom I think explain effectively why SB -- the 

11 Section 2(B) obligation gets in the way of the mutual 

12 effort to -- to focus on the priorities of identifying 

13 serious criminals, so that they can be removed from the 

14 country.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, what -- what's 

16 wrong about the states enforcing Federal law? There is 

17 a Federal law against robbing Federal banks. Can it be 

18 made a state crime to rob those banks? I think it is. 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it could, but I 

think that's quite --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: But does the Attorney 

22 General come in and say, you know, we might really only 

23 want to go after the professional bank robbers? If it's 

24 just an amateur bank robber, you know, we're -- we're 

going to let it go. And the state's interfering with

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course not. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: But this argument is 

quite different, Justice Scalia, because here what we 

11 are talking about is that Federal registration 

12 requirement in an area of dominant Federal concern --

13 exclusive Federal concern, with respect to immigration, 

14 who can be in the country, under what circumstances, and 

what obligations they have --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, are you talking about 

17 3 now or --

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.

relate to 2 as well?

22 Section 3. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I ask you this

3 within the Federal removal priorities without making an 

4 inquiry to the Federal government?

 For example, I understand one of the 

6 priorities is people who have previously been removed, 

7 then that might be somebody who you would want to arrest 

8 and -- and remove. But how can you determine that 

9 without making the -- the inquiry in the first place?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, in any individual 

11 case, that's correct. You -- you would need to make the 

12 inquiry in the first place. It won't always be correct, 

13 if you're arresting somebody based on probable cause 

14 that they have committed a serious crime, and they --

and they -- the inquiry into whether -- into their 

16 status will be enough to identify that person for 

17 priority --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if they just --

19 they stop somebody for a traffic violation, but they 

want to know whether this is a person who previously was 

21 removed and has come back or somebody who has just --

22 just within the last few hours, possibly, come -- well, 

23 let's just -- somebody who's previously been removed.

1 it's correct that you can't, but there is a -- there is 

2 difference, Justice Alito, I think, between the question 

3 of any individual circumstance and a mandatory policy 

4 backed by this civil fine, that you've got to make the 

inquiry in every case. 

6  I think it's as though, if I can use an 

7 analogy, if you ask one of your law clerks to bring you 

8 the most important preemption cases from the last 10 

9 years, and they rolled in the last -- the last hundred 

volumes of the U.S. Reports and said, well, they are in 

11 there. That -- that doesn't make it --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if 

13 they just rolled in Whiting? 

14  (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a pretty good 

16 one. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Look, in the Federal 

18 statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or 

19 restrict any government entity from making this inquiry 

of the Federal government. And then it says that the 

21 Federal government has -- any agency -- and then it says 

22 the Federal government has an obligation to respond. 

23  Now, assuming the statute were limited, as I 

24 say, so nothing happened to this individual, nothing 

happened to the person who's stopped that wouldn't have

had to be the situation, then what in the Federal
 

6 statute would that conflict with, where we have two
 

7 provisions that say any policeman can call?
 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: So --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: What's the -- that's --

that's where I'm trying to push you. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Because, in my mind, I'm 

13 not clear what your answer is to that. 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I understand 

the question. And I think the answer is this: 1373 was 

16 enacted in 1996, along with 1357. And 1357 is the 

17 provision that sets forth the powers and authorities of 

18 Federal immigration officials. 

19  It contains 1357(g), which effectively says 

that Federal -- that the Federal government, the 

21 Attorney General, can deputize state officials, so long 

22 as they're -- they obtain adequate training, and they 

23 are subject to the direction and control of the Attorney 

24 General in carrying out immigration functions.

 Then the last provision, (g)(10), says that

1 nothing that we've said so far should be read to -- to 

2 preclude informal cooperation, communication or other 

3 informal cooperation in the apprehension, detention, and 

4 removal of unlawfully present persons, but it's the 

focus on cooperation. 

6  And I think you have to -- so I don't think 

7 you can read into 1373 the -- the conclusion that what 

8 Congress was intending to do was to shift from the 

9 Federal government to the states the authority to set 

enforcement priorities because I think the cooperation 

11 in this context is cooperation in the service of the 

12 Federal enforcement. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I get to a different 

14 question? I think even I or someone else cut you off 

when you said there were three reasons why -- 2(B). 

16  Putting aside your argument that this --

17 that a systematic cooperation is wrong -- you can see 

18 it's not selling very well. Why don't you try to come 

19 up with something else?

 Because I, frankly -- as the Chief has said 

21 to you, it's not that it's forcing you to change your 

22 enforcement priorities. You don't have to take the 

23 person into custody. So what's left of your argument? 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: So let me -- let me just 

summarize what I think the three are, and then maybe I

4 more significant harassment problem than was present in 

Hines --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- please move more --

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: With respect to -- in 

8 addition, we do think that there is a structural 

9 accountability problem, in that they are enforcing 

Federal law, but not answerable to the Federal 

11 officials. 

12  And, third, we do think there are practical 

13 impediments, in that the -- the result of this is to 

14 deliver to the Federal system a volume of inquiries that 

makes it harder and not easier to identify who the 

16 priority persons are for removal. 

17  So those are the three reasons. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, you have 

19 been trying valiantly to get us to focus on Section 3, 

so maybe we should let you do that now. 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

22 Justice. 

23  The -- I do think the key thing about 

24 Section 3 is that we -- is that Section 3 is purporting 

to enforce a Federal registration requirement. That's a

3 It's governed by the terms of 1301 through 1306.
 

4  And the way in which those terms are
 

enforced does have very significant Federal interest at 

6 its heart. And there is no state police power interest 

7 in that Federal registration relationship.

categories of people. I think it's -- it is quite

2 is not correct in saying that those are people who 

3 aren't in violation of 1306(a) and, therefore, aren't in 

4 violation of -- of Section 3. They are in violation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe 1306(a) ought 

6 to be amended, then. I mean, we have statutes out there 

7 that there a lot of people in violation of it and --

8 well, the Attorney General will take care of it. Is 

9 that how we write our criminal laws?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: But -- but it's a 

11 situation in which no reasonable person would think that 

12 the individual ought to be prosecuted. And, yet, very 

13 often, the states aren't even going to know, in fact, 

14 about asylum status. They can't know because there are 

regulations that require that to be kept private, to 

16 avoid retaliation against the person making the 

17 application. 

18  And so, this -- so this is -- this is, I 

19 think, a very strong illustration of why the enforcement 

discretion over Section 3 needs to be vested exclusively 

21 in the Federal government. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, I ask you, do you 

23 have any other case in which the basis for preemption 

24 has been you are interfering with -- with the Attorney 

General's enforcement discretion?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think what is 

6 extraordinary about this, actually, Justice Scalia, is 

7 the state's decision to enact a statute purporting to 

8 criminalize the violation of a Federal registration 

9 obligation. And I think that's the problem here. And 

they are doing it for a reason --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not criminalizing 

12 anything that isn't criminal under Federal law. 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: But -- but what --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's the bank. 

It's the Federal bank example --

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a state law, which 

18 criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does. 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's quite 

different. 

21  What they are doing here is using 1306(a) to 

22 get at the status of unlawful presence. The only people 

23 who can be prosecuted under Section 3 are people who are 

24 unlawfully present in the country. That's what the 

statute says. And they are using it to get at that

1 category of people, to, essentially, use their state 

2 criminal law to perform an immigration function. 

3  And the immigration function is to try to --

4 to prosecute these people. And, by the way, you can 

prosecute somebody, they can be put in jail for 30 days 

6 here. But, under Federal law, a violation of 1306(a) is 

7 a continuing offense. 

8  So the day they get out of jail for that 30 

9 days, they can be arrested again. And this can happen 

over and over again. And the point of this provision is 

11 to drive unlawfully present people out of the state of 

12 Arizona.

14 well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two 

hypothetical instances.

17 simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce 

18 our immigration laws the way we wish. We wish we could 

19 do so, but we don't have the money or the resources. 

That's the first -- just hypothetical. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: You said that in your 

22 brief, didn't you? 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Also -- also hypothetical 

24 is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive 

emergency with social disruption, economic disruption,

other state wouldn't have? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course, they have 

7 legitimate concerns in that situation. Justice 

8 Kennedy --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And can they go to their 

legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask 

11 the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem? 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: They -- they certainly 

13 can enact laws of general application. They can enforce 

14 the laws of general application that are on the books. 

They already -- as a result of 8 U.S.C. 1621, it's clear 

16 that they are under no obligation to provide any state 

17 benefits to the -- the population.

can engage in cooperative efforts with the Federal

said that the Justice Department doesn't get nearly 

6 enough money to enforce our immigration laws? Didn't 

7 you say that? 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course, we have to set 

9 priorities. There are only --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. Okay. So the 

11 state says, well, that may be your priorities, but most 

12 of these people that you're not going after -- or an 

13 inordinate percentage of them, are here in our state, 

14 and we don't like it. They are causing all sorts of 

problems. So we're going to help you enforce Federal 

16 law. We're not going to do anything else. We're just 

17 enforcing Federal law. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well -- well, what I 

19 think they are going to do in Arizona is something quite 

extraordinary, that has significant real and practical 

21 foreign relations effects. And that's the problem, and 

22 it's the reason why this power needs to be vested 

23 exclusively in the Federal government.

effectively, in mass incarceration because the

in Section 3 and in Section 5. 

6  And so -- so you're going to have a 

7 situation of mass incarceration of people who are 

8 unlawfully present. That is going to raise -- poses a 

9 very serious risk of raising significant foreign 

relations problems.

happens when the Arizona police call the Federal agency.

14 does the computer have? What information does your 

system have? 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. So the way this 

17 works is there is a system for -- for incoming

19 terminal. And that person searches a number of 

different databases. There are eight or ten different

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I had a little --

23 wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy. 

24  Is the reason that the government is not

1 the other categories you were talking about, because of 

2 prioritization or because of lack of resources? 

3  You suggested that if the -- every illegal 

4 alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted, 

that that would cause tensions with other governments. 

6 So I -- I don't understand if it's because you don't 

7 have enough resources or because you don't want to 

8 prosecute the people who are simply here illegally, as 

9 opposed to something else.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it's a little more 

11 complicated than that. I think the -- the point is 

12 this: That with respect to persons who are unlawfully 

13 present, there are some who are going to fall in our 

14 priority categories. There are those who have committed 

serious offenses. There are those who have been removed 

16 and have come back. And there are other priority 

17 categories. 

18  Because we have resource constraints and 

19 there are only so many beds in the detention centers and 

only so many immigration judges, we want to focus on 

21 those priority categories, find them, remove them. 

22  There is a second category, and that is, 

23 individuals who are here in violation, technically, of 

24 1306(a), but who have a valid asylum application or 

application for temporary protected status or other --

1 and, with respect to those persons that we think 

2 would -- it's affirmatively harmful to think that they 

3 ought to be prosecuted. 

4  And then there is an additional category of 

people who are not in the second category and not 

6 priorities, and the form and we think there, the idea 

7 that an individual state will engage in a process of 

8 mass incarceration of that population, which we do think 

9 is what Section 2(H) commits Arizona to do under Section 

3, raises a significant foreign relations problem. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you avoid that 

12 particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting 

13 these people? Free them from the jails --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And send them back to the

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: This is a -- this is a --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the problem with 

19 that?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, a couple of things. 

21 First is I don't think it's realistic to assume that the 

22 aggressive enforcement of Sections 3 and 5 in Arizona is 

23 going to lead to a mass migration back to countries of 

24 origin. It seems a far more likely outcome is going to 

be migration to other states. And that's a significant 

69

25

Official 

1 problem. That's part of the reason why this problem
 

2 needs to be managed on a national basis.
 

3  Beyond that, I do think, you know, the --

4 it's worth bearing in mind here that the country of
 

Mexico is in a central role in this situation. 

6  Between 60 and 70 percent of the people that 

7 we remove every year, we remove to Mexico. And, in 

8 addition, we have to have the cooperation of the 

9 Mexicans. And I think, as the Court knows from other 

cases, the cooperation of the country to whom we are --

11 to which we are removing people who are unlawfully 

12 present is vital to be able to make removal work. 

13  In addition, we have very significant issues 

14 on the border with Mexico. And, in fact, they are the 

very issues that Arizona is complaining about, in 

16 that --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: So we -- we have to -- we 

18 have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please 

19 Mexico? Is that what you're saying?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Your Honor, but what 

21 it does -- no, Your Honor, I'm not saying that --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounded like what you 

23 were saying. 

24  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, but what I am saying 

is that this points up why the Framers made this power 

70

1 an exclusive national power. It's because the entire 

2 country feels the effects of a decision -- conduct by an 

3 individual state. And that's why the -- the power needs 

4 to be exercised at the national level and not the state 

level. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your concern is 

7 the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if 

8 you remove all of these people -- or a significant 

9 percentage or a greater percentage than you are now. 

Nothing in the law requires you to do that. 

11  All it does is lets you know where -- that 

12 an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide, 

13 we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against 

14 that individual. It doesn't require you to remove one 

more person than you would like to remove under your 

16 priorities. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Right, but the problem 

18 I'm focused on -- we're focused on, Mr. Chief Justice, 

19 is not our removal decisions, but Arizona's decision to 

incarcerate, and the foreign relations problem that that 

21 raises. That's why this power has got to be exercised 

22 at the national level. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that -- and that 

24 arises under 3 and 5?

 I haven't -- I've been up here a long time. 

6 I haven't said anything about Section 5 yet.  And I 

7 don't want to tax the Court's patience, but if I could 

8 spend a minute on Section 5? 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Section 5.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: The -- I do think the 

11 fundamental point about Section 5 here is that, in 1986, 

12 Congress fundamentally changed the landscape. Congress 

13 made a decision in 1986 to make the employment of aliens 

14 a central concern of national immigration policy. And 

this Court has described the 1986 law as a comprehensive 

16 regime. 

17  Now, what my friend, Mr. Clement, says, is 

18 that it may be a comprehensive regime for employers; 

19 it's not a comprehensive regime for employees. And, 

therefore, it's -- there ought not be any inference here 

21 that the states are precluded from criminalizing efforts 

22 to seek or obtain employment in Arizona. 

23  But I really think that's not right. 

24 The -- employment is one problem. And Congress tackled 

the problem of employment and made a decision -- a 

72
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 comprehensive decision, about this -- the sanctions it 

2 thought were appropriate to govern. And Congress did, 

3 as Justice Ginsburg suggested, make judgments with 

4 respect to the circumstances under which employees could 

be held criminally liable, as well as the circumstances 

6 under which employers could be held liable. 

7  And I think it is useful, in thinking about 

8 the judgments Congress actually made --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- think field preemption; 

is that your argument with respect to this section? 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: It's -- it's both. I 

12 think we're making both a field and a conflict 

13 preemption argument here, Justice Scalia. And the --

14 and the -- I think it's worth examining the specific 

judgments Congress made in 1986. 

16  On the employer's side -- and, after all, 

17 this is a situation in which the concern here is that 

18 the employer is in a position of being the exploiter and 

19 the -- the alien of being the exploited -- on the 

employer's side, Congress said that states may not 

21 impose criminal sanctions, and even -- and the Federal 

22 government will not impose criminal sanctions for the 

23 hiring of employees, unless there's a pattern or 

24 practice.

 It seems quite incongruous to think that 

73
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Congress, having made that judgment and imposed those
 

2 restrictions on the employer's side, would have left
 

3 states free to impose criminal liability on employees
 

4 merely for seeking work, for doing what you, I think,
 

would expect most otherwise law-abiding people to do, 

6 which is to find a job, so they can feed their families. 

7 So I think that's -- that's a significant problem. 

8  The -- in addition, Congress made clear in 

9 the law that the I-9 form could not be used for any 

other purpose than prosecutions for violation of the 

11 Federal antifraud requirements. And, if Congress wanted 

12 to leave states free to impose criminal sanctions on 

13 employees for seeking work, they wouldn't have done 

14 that, it seems to me.

 So there, I think there are strong 

16 indicators in the text that Congress did make a 

17 judgment, and the judgment was this far and no farther. 

18 And it's reasonable that Congress would have done so, 

19 for the same kinds of foreign relations concerns that I 

was discussing with -- with respect to Section 3. It 

21 would be an extraordinary thing to put someone in jail 

22 merely for seeking work. And, yet, that's what Arizona 

23 proposes to do under Section 5 of its law. 

24  Now, of course, there is an express 

preemption provision, but the express preemption 

74

20

25

Official 

1 provision, as this Court has said many times, does not 

2 operate to the exclusion of implied preemption, field or 

3 conflict. So we do think those principles apply here. 

4  We think there's a reason why the express 

preemption provision was limited to the employer's side, 

6 which is that, after DeCanas, laws had been enacted on 

7 the employer's side, and with -- Congress was making 

8 clear that those were preemptive, there were no laws on 

9 the employee's side at the time and, therefore, no 

reason for preemption.

 I'd like to start, briefly, with the 

21 enforcement issues and then talk about the other 

22 provisions. The last thing I'll say about the 

23 enforcement provision, since I do think that the 

24 Government's rather unusual theory that something that's 

okay when done ad hoc becomes preempted when it's

1 systematic. I think that theory largely refutes itself. 

2  But I will say one thing, which is to just 

3 echo that there is no interference with enforcement 

4 priorities by simply giving the Federal government 

information on which to bring their enforcement 

6 priorities to bear. And this is really illustrated by a 

7 point this Court made in its Florence decision earlier 

8 this month, which is that, sometimes, you pull somebody 

9 over for the most innocuous of infractions, and they 

turn out to be the most serious of offenders. 

11  And so if you preclude officers, as happened 

12 in Phoenix, from communicating with the Federal 

13 government, the Federal government will not be able to 

14 identify the worst of the worst. And if you want an 

example of this, look at the declaration of Officer 

16 Brett Glidewell at Joint Appendix 183 to 186. He pulled 

17 somebody over in a routine traffic stop and was shot by 

18 the individual. 

19  Now, the individual, it turns out, was 

wanted for attempted murder in El Salvador and was also 

21 guilty of illegal reentry into the United States. He 

22 was stopped on three previous occasions and his status 

23 was not verified. Now, if it had been, he certainly 

24 would have been apprehended. In at least two of the 

stops, his immigration status wasn't checked because of

1 the city policy, city of Phoenix. 

2  Now, if the state, I submit, can do 

3 anything, it can, at the state level, override those 

4 kind of local policies and say, that's not what we want. 

Community policing is all well and good, but we want to 

6 maximize communication with the Federal authorities. So 

7 I think the enforcement policy and priorities argument 

8 simply doesn't work. 

9  As to Section 3, two points about that, one 

is, I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General 

11 as to whether the various things that he led off -- read 

12 off, the litany of situations where somebody is --

13 technically doesn't have registration would be a 

14 violation of 1306(a).

 And the reason I take that position is that 

16 provision says a willful failure to register. Now, 

17 maybe the prosecutors take the view that there is 

18 willfulness in those circumstances, but I don't think 

19 many judges would. I think they would say that, if 

you've been told by the Federal government that you're 

21 perfectly fine here and you don't need to register, that 

22 that would be good enough to defeat a finding of 

23 willfulness. So I don't think 1306(a) covers this case. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're inviting --

you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's

1 talking about because what's going to happen, now, is 

2 that, if there is no statement by the Federal agency of 

3 legality, the person is arrested, and, now, we're going 

4 to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out 

whether they have an asylum application, whether they 

6 have this, whether they have that, whether they are 

7 exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry 

8 was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the 

9 Federal government in your prosecution.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, you may say we're 

12 not because all we're going to show is -- what? That we 

13 got a Federal call -- we got a Federal answer that the 

14 person wasn't registered?

 MR. CLEMENT: No, we're going to say that we 

16 communicated with the Federal immigration officials, and 

17 they told us this is somebody who's perfectly fine and 

18 doesn't have to register. The --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No -- no 

Confrontation -- no Confrontation Clause problem with 

21 that? With relying on a call to a Federal agency and 

22 the police officer says, you're arrested, you're 

23 charged, it's not an illegal alien -- or it is an 

24 illegal alien.

 MR. CLEMENT: My supposition, Justice

1 Sotomayor, is that they would use that call to not bring 

2 the prosecution, so the issue wouldn't even arise. But 

3 I do want to be clear about --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. How 

about -- what -- how about they get a response, yes, 

6 it's an illegal alien? 

7  MR. CLEMENT: And they bring a prosecution 

8 under Section 3 and then --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how -- where do they 

get the records that show that this person is an illegal 

11 alien that's not authorized to be here? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: I --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who do they get it from? 

14  MR. CLEMENT: I think they would get it from 

the Federal authorities. I think it would be admitted. 

16 There might be a challenge in that case. I mean -- you 

17 know, this is a facial challenge. I'm not going to try 

18 to address that potential Sixth Amendment issue. 

19  What I would like to say is two things. 

One, if there is some sloppiness in the way the Federal 

21 government keeps its records, so that there's lots of 

22 people that really should be registered, but aren't, I 

23 can't imagine that sloppiness has a preemptive effect. 

24  The second thing I would say is that I do 

think, in thinking about Section 3 in particular, the

1 analogy is not the fraud on the FDA claim in Buckman.
 

2 It's really the state tort law that says that it's a
 

3 violation of state tort law to not even seek the
 

4 approval that's needed under the FDA for a device.


 Now, states impose tort law for people that 

6 market a device without getting the necessary approval. 

7 And nobody thinks that's preempted because it serves the 

8 Federal interest. It doesn't have a deluge of 

9 information. It forces people to get FDA approval.

 And in the same way, this state law will 

11 force people to register, which is what the Federal 

12 government is supposed to want in the first place, so 

13 there is no preemption there. There is no conflict. 

14  As to the employment provision, I do think 

it's important to recognize that --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 

17 sentence. 

18  MR. CLEMENT: -- before 1986, the -- the 

19 government was not agnostic about unlawful employment by 

aliens. The employees were already covered, and they 

21 were subject to deportation. So the government said, 

22 we're going to cover the employers for the first time. 

23 I can't imagine why that would have preemptive effect. 

24  Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
