 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear 

argument on number 04-278, the Town of Castle Rock 

versus Jessica Gonzales. Mr. Eastman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. EASTMAN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. EASTMAN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 What happened here is undeniably tragic. 

A father shot and killed his own daughters. He was 

under a restraining order, so the issue for this 

Court is whether the order restraining Mr. Gonzales 

also gave to Mrs. Gonzales and her children a 

property interest put against the police giving 

Mrs. Gonzales an entitlement to the arrest of her 

estranged husband.

 More precisely, the issue is whether the 

State of Colorado intended to create such a property 

interest.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Tell us how we know 

exactly how much discretion the State of Colorado 

wanted to give to the police.

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, Justice O'Connor --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Without a statute that 

uses the word shall enforce. Do we know how Colorado

has interpreted that?

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, they have in other 

cases, as we note in our brief, that the word shall 

is not always mandatory, particularly here, I think, 

Justice O'Connor, when we have such a backdrop of law 

enforcement discretion.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are there 

Colorado cases that tell us how we should read those 

statutes?

 MR. EASTMAN: Not in particular on this 

statute. They only -- the Colorado case law on the 

word shall says that you have to read it in context 

of the entire statute. And here the word shall is 

used several different places pointing several 

different directions in the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So do you concede that if 

shall means shall, that it creates a property 

interest?

 MR. EASTMAN: No, Justice Scalia, I do 

not. There is a long way between giving direction, 

even mandatory direction, to law enforcement and 

creating a property interest. I think that was the 

essence of this Court's holding in Sandin. And it's 

that distinction that even if you read shall in these 

statutes as requiring a particular outcome, and we

don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Eastman, would you 

comment on the extent of deference that we should 

give to the court of appeals' interpretation of 

Colorado while in view of what we said in Bishop 

against Wood?

 MR. EASTMAN: Yes, I don't think here, 

because it's not just an application of Colorado law 

here. We have identical statutes in 19 or 20 

different states around the country. And what you 

do --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the Colorado statute 

is the one that's controlling in this case and 

normally, at least according to Bishop against Wood, 

we defer to the interpretation of the court of 

appeals as the issue of state law.

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, what you're asking is 

that the court of appeals that created -- that read 

this statute shall, without any Colorado court 

interpretation, and did so without any greater 

indication from the Colorado legislature, that it 

intended more than just to give direction to police. 

It intended to create a property interest.

 I understand the question from Bishop 

versus Wood, but I don't think we can defer to the

Tenth Circuit here in creating something that 

Colorado did not intend to create.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that's the 

issue, whether Colorado intended to create it.

 MR. EASTMAN: But I think there is a big 

difference. I mean --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The reading in Bishop 

against Wood was really counterintuitive also, as the 

dissenters pointed out, as you would agree, I think.

 MR. EASTMAN: Yes, and I think when you're 

looking at a statute such as this, that is invoking 

the federal court's -- I mean, what we're using is a 

state law to invoke federal protections. And I think 

it's that deference to the State that I think is more 

critical. And I don't think you can allow the 

federal courts to make that decision when Colorado 

itself has not been -- has been as ambiguous as it 

is. I think we need a clearer statement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you suggest to the 

federal court that it certify the question of the 

meaning of Colorado law to this Colorado Supreme 

Court?

 MR. EASTMAN: No, we did not, because I 

don't think the statute gets us over the hurdle to 

make that even necessary. There is nothing in this

statute that is intended -- that uses the language of 

property interest or entitlement. I think if this 

Court would look to its decision in Gonzaga, for 

example, in alaogous context --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait. I thought we 

were just talking here about state law as to whether 

shall means shall. Do you think that it's a matter 

of state law whether, if it does mean shall, it 

creates a property interest for purposes of the 

Federal Constitution?

 MR. EASTMAN: No, Justice Scalia, I don't.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't concede that 

that's a state question at all?

 MR. EASTMAN: No. And what we're talking 

about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, isn't that what we 

squarely held in Bishop?

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, what we have to look 

at is whether, first, the State, under Roth, intended 

to create a property interest rather than just giving 

mandatory direction to its officers. And I think the 

critical question there is what the default rule 

ought to be on a statute that is not clear on that 

question.

 And I think Roth tells us that for

purposes of federal constitutional law, the default 

cannot be that we assume the State created a property 

interest, at least in this kind of nontraditional 

property interest. And I think it's important to 

focus on what kind of property interest we're talking 

about.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose shall does mean 

shall. Fine. But you might have a statute that says 

the fire department shall respond to fires, the 

police department shall respond to crimes, the Army 

shall respond to attacks.

 Even the word shall doesn't necessarily 

mean that this is the kind of interest that, like 

property, the Duke of Rutland relied upon Blackacre, 

that welfare recipients rely upon continuing to 

receive money.

 What is it about this that makes it like 

property, even if shall does mean shall?

 MR. EASTMAN: Justice Breyer, I agree, and 

the difference between even mandatory language 

directing law enforcement to behave in a certain way 

is a far cry from actually creating a property 

interest in Mrs. Gonzales herself.

 This Court in Sandin held that in the 

prison context, and I think the analogy in this

Court's implied right of action cases such as Gonzaga 

is a good one.

 In order to take a statute and try and 

find a property interest, we would want to have it 

phrased in terms of the beneficiary rather than the 

person restrained. We would want to see an 

actionable entitlement created. None of that is 

here. And I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you compare it 

to -- this is a court order and it's enforceable. 

There is no question about that, is there? This is a 

court order that enforcement officials carry out. 

How does it differ from, say, a money judgment and 

executing -- levying execution on property? Judgment 

creditor says, here is my judgment, marshal, sheriff, 

go out and find some of the defendant's property.

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, you 

know, the analogy we cite in our reply brief and the 

U.S. Marshal Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1990 that says that

there is a right in the beneficiary to have a warrant 

issued. And if the marshal refuses to do that, that 

he can be challenged and held to a thousand dollar 

fine for the benefit of the person whose arrest 

warrant he was supposed to serve.

 Now, even that doesn't quite go far enough

because there is not a private right of action by the 

beneficiary about a warrant to bring the suit 

directly. But at least that kind of statute is 

getting closer to acknowledging a property interest.

 This is enforceable against Mr. Gonzales, 

and Ms. Gonzales could go back in and get a contempt 

proceeding. I know here, after the fact, that's not 

going to do any good. But the restraining order is 

issued against Mr. Gonzales. It's not issued to the 

police. And all we have then is how its violation by 

Mr. Gonzales will be enforced.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that true of 

all injunctive orders, they're not issued to the 

police. And yet the police -- don't the police have 

an obligation to enforce that?

 MR. EASTMAN: To my knowledge, we've never 

held that the police have an actionable obligation to 

enforce them. But the State --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But wouldn't you concede 

that in the case of the injunction in which there is 

a specific order in relation to a specific 

respondent, that the police have much less discretion 

than they would have when there is in effect a 

general statute saying, respond in these kinds of 

situations?

 MR. EASTMAN: Justice Souter, they still 

have a great deal of discretion here. The statute 

says reasonable means of enforcement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In the case of the 

statute that we're talking with, but they don't have 

that kind of discretion, do they, in Justice 

Ginsburg's example? What I'm getting at is, if 

you're going to take the example that Justice 

Ginsburg has given you as equivalent to the example 

that we have before us, I think you're fighting 

uphill and I don't think you have to do that.

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, let me take your 

invitation, then, and respond back. I mean, if the 

terms of the restraining order cut out all discretion 

whatsoever and that they specifically are written in 

terms that the property interest creates an entitlement 

in the beneficiary of the restraining order, as 

against not just the person restrained or the person 

whose property is going to be attached, but an 

entitlement to enforcement by the police itself, then 

I think we would be on the step toward creating a 

property interest.

 The Colorado statute here does none of 

those things. It continues to give the police a 

great deal of discretion. Reasonable means --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is discretion --

does discretion on the means to use include 

discretion to do nothing?

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, it includes a finding 

of probable cause. It includes a -- seek an arrest 

or make an arrest or seek a warrant arrest when the 

arrest is impractical. If the arrest is impractical, 

such as when --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But were any of those 

determinations made here?

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, we don't know. We 

don't know because this case comes up here on a 

motion to dismiss. All we have are the allegations. 

The allegations are that they didn't enforce the 

restraining order, all right? But we don't know 

whether it's because they made a determination of no 

probable cause, whether there was probable cause but 

because he wasn't in the jurisdiction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So are you requesting 

that there are insufficient fact findings here, so it 

should be returned --

MR. EASTMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg, 

because what we're saying is that there is not a 

property interest at all and it doesn't matter, even 

if these allegations are true, there is no underlying

property interest that would invoke the procedural 

protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Eastman, can I ask 

you this question? Supposing this case came to us 

through the Colorado State system instead of through 

the federal system, and the Colorado Supreme Court 

had written precisely the same opinion that the Tenth 

Circuit ruled. Would we have jurisdiction to 

overturn their holding that there was a property 

interest here?

 MR. EASTMAN: Justice Stevens, you're 

asking whether, for purposes of federal 

constitutional law, the state court decision that 

Colorado had created a property interest is 

dispositive. And I'm not sure it is, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then your answer is no, 

we would not have jurisdiction in that event.

 MR. EASTMAN: Well, no, I was saying that 

yes, you would, because what we're talking about is 

looking to the state legislature on whether they've 

created a property interest for purposes of federal 

law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We could say that they 

had misconstrued Colorado law? I don't think you 

really mean that.

 MR. EASTMAN: Okay.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I think you might --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps what you mean is 

that what is a property interest for purposes of 

Colorado law, if Colorado chooses to nominate some 

utterly zany thing of property interest, it doesn't 

necessarily mean that it's a property interest for 

purposes of the Federal Constitution.

 MR. EASTMAN: Justice Scalia, I'm happy to 

do that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You can do that, but you 

won't find any cases making that point.

 MR. EASTMAN: No, you won't, but it makes 

perfect sense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you need a 

case for that, do you?

 MR. EASTMAN: No, but it makes perfect 

sense.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you have cases 

saying the contrary. That's the problem.

 MR. EASTMAN: What we want to find out is 

whether the Colorado --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any cases 

involving a zany property interest having been found 

by a State? I don't think we have any.

 MR. EASTMAN: We don't even have any cases 

involving a property interest to enforcement against 

somebody else. All we have are cases to the 

contrary. Linda R.S., for example, this Court held 

that there is no right to arrest or enforcement 

against somebody else.

 And so I think at least in the context of 

these very non-zany property interest claims, that we 

need to have a pretty clear statement, not even from 

the Colorado courts, but from the legislature itself 

that the legislature intended, as a matter of state 

policy, to have a property interest created and all 

of the consequences that would flow from that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I stop you? You 

cited that Linda R.S., whatever, I thought that was a 

standing case saying it's not going to do you any 

good to have him locked up in jail if what you want 

to do is get money from him.

 MR. EASTMAN: It was, but the case has 

been relied on by several subsequent decisions 

including in the Second Circuit in the Attica case, 

inmates of Attica, for the proposition that there is 

just simply no right to an enforcement against 

somebody else, that there is no entitlement.

 Now, I'm not saying that the Colorado

legislature never could create such an entitlement, 

but given the backdrop of Linda R.S., and also given 

the backdrop of traditional law enforcement 

discretion, I think we need a much clearer statement 

from the Colorado legislature itself, both that it's 

written in terms of the beneficiary -- getting her an 

entitlement against the police, rather than in terms 

of what the person restrained is.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Eastman, assuming 

for the moment there is no due -- procedural due 

process right here, on the facts of this case, does 

Colorado law provide any alternative remedy for 

Mrs. Gonzales?

 MR. EASTMAN: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it 

does.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what would that be?

 MR. EASTMAN: There are several remedies. 

In the first instance, any violation of a restraining 

order, she can petition the court for a contempt 

order, even against the police. If their conduct was 

willful and wanton, they can be held --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So she could presumably 

ask for some relief under that notion, against the 

police and possibly the town?

 MR. EASTMAN: Against the police and --

not the town. The town has absolute immunity but 

against the police under the tort statute, the police 

are not immune if their conduct is willful and 

wanton.

 And I think this Court in DeShaney 

addressed that very question when it looked like if 

the State wanted to create an interest here, that it 

could do so by modifying the --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You say the 

tort statute means something like the Federal Tort 

Claims Act. Does Colorado have something like that?

 MR. EASTMAN: It does. And there is a 

Colorado Governmental Immunity Act that gives 

immunity to police except when their conduct is 

willful and wanton. And so that tort remedy does 

exist and if the Colorado legislature wanted to lower 

the threshold on that and make it negligent omissions 

or what have you, whatever the allegations are, they 

could do so.

 The fact that they haven't done so I think 

is a pretty strong indication that they did not 

intend to create a property interest here.

 If there is a property interest -- let me 

just say one minute about the procedures that were 

given, and then I'll reserve the remainder of my

time. At most we would have here, if there is a 

property interest, is the opportunity for 

Mrs. Gonzales to tell the police that she believed 

the restraining order was violated and that they 

responded to her however they did.

 She received whatever process might be due 

assuming we have a property interest here. If there 

are no more questions, I'll reserve the remainder of 

my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 For two reasons the holders of restraining 

orders lack a property right to police enforcement of 

those orders. First, Respondent's claim has to be 

evaluated in light of the fundamental background 

principles that private citizens lack a judicially 

cognizable interest in arrest and in prosecution of 

third parties. And that executive decisions not to 

enforce criminal statutes are presumptively beyond 

the scope of judicial review.

 Nothing in the Colorado statute reflects 

an intent to depart from those background 

presumptions and to create an individual right to 

enforcement. Unlike statutes where this Court has 

recognized a protected property interest, the 

provisions at issue here do not regulate the 

Plaintiff or Respondent, but rather regulate a third 

party. And the provisions do not mention the 

restraining order holder, much less state that she 

has an entitlement to review.

 In addition, the provisions do not afford 

the holder of restraining orders procedural 

protections or judicial review of the sort that this 

Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What good is -- what 

does the restraining order do, then, other than give 

her a right to sue the person who is restrained for 

contempt?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think it does two main 

things. First of all, it gives her rights against 

her husband which are enforceable through contempt 

and are enforceable by asking the police to enforce 

them.

 And second, which has the benefit -- it 

has the effect basically of creating a new arrest

statute that lowers the threshold of what conduct is 

criminal from something that would be a freestanding 

crime to basically just violating one of the terms of 

the order. And that is the interest that the 

restraining order gives her.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But only to ask the 

police and the police are not obliged to respond.

 MR. ELWOOD: That is correct. She has the 

ability to ask the police to enforce the order, but 

the police have discretion, under our reading of the 

statute, not to enforce the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do the police have any 

duty at all, in your view?

 MR. ELWOOD: The police -- I don't believe 

that the police have any sort of actionable duty. I 

think that what the statute creates is basically it's 

a direction from the legislature that this is what 

they want them to do.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could the police just 

issue an order saying ignore all orders of this kind?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think that if they were to 

do that, I do not think that there would be sort of 

any individual right to challenge that. I think that 

they would be adopting a policy decision that would be 

probably different than the one the Colorado

legislature has --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: That's the sort 

of aggressive sort of thing that the Colorado courts 

could conclusively decide.

 MR. ELWOOD: That's something the Colorado 

courts decide, and it's something that would be --

that could be addressed through the political process 

as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any extreme 

cases we could imagine where the police have a duty 

to protect the citizen? The policeman sees four 

people beating up on the victim, no race involved, 

and he just enjoys watching the fight. Does he have 

a duty under the Constitution to intervene?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think any duty that there 

would be would be a substantive duty. And this Court 

indicated in DeShaney that it would require basically 

state creation of the harm or state increasing the 

vulnerability of the person. So for example --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did DeShaney stand for 

the proposition there could never be an affirmative 

duty to intervene, under what you're talking about 

the Constitution here?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think it would be, in a 

case, for example, where a prisoner was handcuffed in

his cell with a cell mate who the authorities knew to 

be basically interested in harming him. Because they 

had affirmatively restrained him, I think that that 

would be a case where the State had created the 

danger or increased the vulnerability.

 So I think there is something left to the 

requirement of police protection substantively under 

DeShaney.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there has to be some 

State -- the State has to have created the risk 

somehow?

 MR. ELWOOD: Under DeShaney, the State has 

to have created the risk or increased the 

vulnerability of the person.

 Now, in addition to the fact that the 

Colorado statute does not speak to the Plaintiff, it 

essentially speaks to the restrained party. And 

under -- as Mr. Eastman mentioned, under Gonzaga and 

this Court's 1983 cases, that when a statute speaks 

in terms of the regulated party instead of the 

protected party, there is no implication of an intent 

to create a federal right.

 And I think that that principle would 

apply even more clearly in the context of the state 

rights, because there there is a question of imposing

federal liability which shouldn't really be done in 

the absence of an indication that the State really 

meant to do that.

 Another reason is -- not to assume that 

there is a property right here, is that the State 

statute does not create any sort of procedural 

remedies or judicial remedies which this Court has in 

the past taken as an indication that the State really 

did mean to create a protected right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your response to 

the fact that the Tenth Circuit found otherwise and 

that we usually defer?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think our response would be 

that it's not simply -- well, first of all, I don't 

want to make too much of the fact that it's obviously 

a very close question of state law because the Tenth 

Circuit was divided by a single vote.

 But even aside from that, you basically 

have to adopt not simply a question of what the state 

law says, but what the federal courts are going to do 

with it. And we are of the opinion that given what a 

tremendous departure it would be, what a procedural 

innovation it would be to give complaining witnesses 

essentially a right in the process, that in the 

absence of a very clear statement, the federal court

should not imply a right or imply -- should not 

infer, rather, that the state legislature intended to 

create a right.

 So essentially, what we're asking for is a 

clear statement rule. And in the absence of a clear 

statement, we should presume that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree that if 

this case stands with the state system, we would have 

to accept their holding on the property right issue?

 MR. ELWOOD: Obviously, I think there 

would be a much closer question at a minimum. There 

may be something to the fact that we should -- this 

is the sort of thing we would want a statement from 

the Colorado legislature.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, let's -- I'm 

assuming the Supreme Court has said, this is what the 

statute means and so forth and so on, wouldn't that 

be binding on this?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think it would be binding. 

I mean, it would still be the federal question of 

whether that applied federal law correctly. But 

given that it's basically a question of what is a 

state property right, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Or whether the question 

of property right -- the property right issue is not

a question of federal law, it is a question of state 

law.

 MR. ELWOOD: That is correct. That is 

correct. There is something of a federal overlay to 

sort of correct it at the margin --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What did they hold 

in the Tenth Circuit? I mean, shall could be 

mandatory. You can have a mandatory duty, but that 

doesn't mean that the victim has a legal right to 

enforce that duty.

 MR. ELWOOD: That's absolutely correct, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what did they hold in 

the Tenth Circuit in respect to that?

 MR. ELWOOD: Basically they said that 

because it is -- because the statute was mandatory, 

they basically leapt from that to an inference that 

because it was mandatory, it was a duty that she 

could enforce. But there is no tradition in that --

JUSTICE BREYER: They should reask the 

certified question?

 MR. ELWOOD: I don't think that they need 

to because that is something that, again, it would be 

a useful thing given that there are 50 legislatures 

out there and there are probably at least 20 and

perhaps 31 similar statutes that rather than certify 

the question and then have to certify on a 

State-by-State basis, just to adopt a background rule 

that this Court applies.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But a background rule is 

awfully tough. I mean, you could have lots of shalls 

in all kinds of statutes. If they said shall, the 

sanitation department shall inspect your home for 

tuberculosis, maybe that does give a right. If they 

say to the fire department, you shall put out fires, 

I wouldn't think they meant that every possible 

homeowner had a right to a lawyer and a full judicial 

hearing before they go and respond to an alarm.

 You know, I mean, it depends on the area. 

I don't know how to create a background rule.

 MR. ELWOOD: Well, I think the rule that 

the Court could create is that in a criminal context, 

which is all that is at stake here, there is a 

background presumption that individuals lack a 

judicially cognizable right to arrest or prosecution.

 For example, an arrest warrant, although 

there is some question about whether or not that 

really is mandatory. It's certainly couched in 

mandatory terms. It's directed to the marshal. To 

the marshal, you are hereby commanded to arrest Jane

Doe or whoever.

 But there is a very established body of 

law that even the people who basically agitate for 

the arrest warrant don't have a grounds to complain 

if the arrest warrant isn't executed.

 At the federal level, there is Leek versus 

Timmerman, where the court held there is no 

protective interest or there is no cognizable 

interest in the arrest of another party. And at the 

state level, there is a lot of case law indicating 

that officers are not liable to private citizens for 

failure to execute arrest warrants.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not true that 

the Colorado legislature could create such a right if 

it did it with sufficient specificity?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that is correct. 

This Court has not placed really many limits on what 

kind of rights could be created under Roth. There is 

some indication in cases like Sandin that there might 

be limits at the margins or rather at least limits 

presumptively --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Constitution does say 

property right. I mean, it has to be a property 

right, doesn't it? Is that meaningless? Is 

everything in the world either life, liberty or

property? Does that describe everything in the 

world?

 MR. ELWOOD: Justice Scalia, all I'm 

saying is that the Roth cases haven't really 

indicated that there might be limits on that. I 

think that there are reasons --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, because there has 

been no case that really did not involve something 

that could reasonably be called property.

 MR. ELWOOD: Correct. And I think that 

this is a case where courts might want to exercise 

some caution because there is a reason why they don't 

involve private citizens in the prosecution. And 

that is because our system is built around the idea 

that to -- basically, we want to interpose brakes 

between the complaining witness and the courts and 

power of the State, as the Court indicated in Young 

versus United States ex rel. Vuitton. The prosecutor 

there, because it was a prosecutor, basically serves 

as a circuit breaker to prevent people from 

going straight to the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the State's 

problem. I mean, if the State doesn't want that, 

sure, the State can take that away. But if the State 

does, do I still have to call it property just

Thank you, Mr. Elwood.

 Mr. Reichel, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN J. REICHEL

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. REICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 A public high school student threatened 

with suspension receives more process under this 

Court's holding in Goss versus Lopez than Castle Rock 

is willing to provide to a holder of a court-issued 

protective order.

 Instead of providing Ms. Gonzales with any 

opportunity to be heard in any meaningful manner, 

Castle Rock repeatedly ignored Ms. Gonzales's pleas 

to have her children returned to her and the 

restraining order enforced.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What process do 

you think your client was entitled to?

 MR. REICHEL: We believe that what my

client seeks is much less than what police officers 

do every day. We would ask this Court to hold that 

Ms. Gonzales was entitled to an objective, reasoned 

and good faith consideration of her complaint of a 

restraining order violation, and a good faith 

assessment of probable cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Could that 

simply be made by the person on the desk?

 MR. REICHEL: It can, Your Honor, but it 

needs to be a probable cause determination that is 

actually communicated to the holder of the 

restraining order, whether it be a favorable or 

adverse determination, there needs to be some notice 

provided to the holder of a restraining order of what 

the police officers intend to do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, does --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- no, please.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The basic problem that I 

have is you just put your finger on. I mean, on your 

view of the facts here, which I will accept, it's 

outrageous what happened and a terrible tragedy, but 

it wasn't that they didn't hear her. They heard her. 

That's the problem. They heard her and they didn't 

do anything.

 So if you proceed under state law, you

will, if you're right, get a holding that the police 

behaved very badly, that would help your client, and 

it would help future people in the same position.

 If you proceed under federal law, the most 

you get is somebody at the desk saying, well, we 

think other things are more important. And at that 

point, your client may or may not be helped and other 

people won't be helped. So don't you have a misfit 

between the remedy that you're trying to get and the 

harm that was done?

 MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor, I don't 

believe so. We're asking for a specific process 

here. And Ms. Gonzales wants the right to prove a 

pattern and practice on the part of Castle Rock of 

not responding properly to complaints and pleas of 

this type.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not the kind 

that you've brought, as I understand it. As I 

understand it, you've brought a claim simply that she 

was hurt and was not given process. That's all you 

have to prove. If you can prove a pattern, sure, 

it's easy to prove an individual case. But your only 

claim is damage as a result of a denial of some 

procedural right in this case, isn't that correct?

 MR. REICHEL: As the case stands now, it

is a Monell claim, Your Honor. It is a pattern and 

practice claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not a class 

action, is it? It's not a claim under some 

statute -- civil rights statute. It's a claim for 

the benefit of this client and if this client wins, 

this client presumably will get a money judgment, 

isn't that the case?

 MR. REICHEL: Yes, you are correct, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Okay.

 MR. REICHEL: You are correct. But the 

ignoring here, the allegations are in the complaint, 

Your Honors, is that Castle Rock has this custom and 

policy, this pattern and practice of just ignoring 

these types of complaints. And the ignoring, as the 

law enforcement amicus brief filed on our behalf 

points out, the ignoring is a classic example of how 

police have traditionally responded to these types of 

complaints.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'll grant you that, but 

as I understand it, what stands between or what would 

stand between your ignoring complaint and success 

would simply be the police's statement of a reason 

because, as I take it, I take it that you don't deny

she was heard, they answered the phone, they talked 

to her. She got a result.

 After she had talked with them on the 

phone, she knew that they weren't going to do 

anything or that they weren't going to do anything 

satisfactory. So as I understand it, on your theory, 

the only thing she didn't get that she would be 

entitled to would be a statement by them as to why 

they were not going to do something for her. Is that 

what it boils down to?

 MR. REICHEL: No. What it boils down to, 

Your Honor, is we're looking for a probable cause 

determination to be made in good faith.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if they had said, we 

don't think there is probable cause, that would be 

the end of your case.

 MR. REICHEL: As long as there was a good 

faith determination. If there was a mistaken belief 

that there was a lack of probable cause, then there 

is no violation of due process. The process has been 

provided.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they just say, 

look, in our experience, children come home in two or 

three hours and, moreover, we have other things to do 

that are more important. Is that a sufficient

answer? Both things, by the way, most people who 

look into this would say are completely wrong. But I 

mean, the police would say just what I said. Is that 

sufficient?

 MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor, that is not 

a thoughtful, objective --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what you really want 

is what they should do, is they should respond?

 MR. REICHEL: They should respond by 

making an objective probable cause determination --

JUSTICE BREYER: In this case, you would 

say they should respond?

 MR. REICHEL: They should have made the 

probable cause determination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then your complaint 

is the result, not the procedure. 

MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it's true that the 

procedural cases are designed so that the right result 

can be reached most of the time. I understand that. 

But all we ask is whether or not the procedure was 

adequate.

 MR. REICHEL: There was no procedure here, 

Your Honor, and that's the point of our lawsuit is 

that the fact that Castle Rock has an official custom

and policy of ignoring, of not applying any procedure 

to these types of claims is the crux of our complaint 

in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why was your procedure, 

assuming your entitled to a procedure, why did it 

have to come from Castle Rock? Why wasn't your 

proper recourse to the court that issued the 

restraining order? Did you try to do that, to go to 

the judge that issued the restraining order and say, 

the police are not enforcing the restraining order 

that you issued, I would like directive from the 

court that they enforce it?

 MR. REICHEL: At the point at which she 

realized the police weren't really going to do 

anything, she found out her children were dead. That 

would have been at that point in time a meaningless 

process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just as she could 

have complained to the police earlier, she could have 

gone to the court earlier when she saw that the 

police weren't doing anything.

 MR. REICHEL: The police told her to 

continue to wait. They strung her along, Your Honor. 

That's -- the crux of the problem here is that she 

relied upon the police to enforce her restraining

order. They told her to hold on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be a tort, but 

it's not necessarily a denial of process if the 

proper place to seek that process was from the court 

that issued the restraining order.

 MR. REICHEL: But the restraining order 

has no meaning, Your Honor, unless the police are 

willing to enforce it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, and the 

court can make sure that they enforce it upon 

complaint.

 MR. REICHEL: In this case, it's our 

position that the legislature has done so as well.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you a question 

that is suggested by Justice Scalia's question. And 

it goes basically simply to the practical problems 

that your position seems to entail.

 You answered him by saying that the point 

at which she realized they were denying her whatever 

she was entitled to was the point at which the 

children were dead. How would a reviewing court know 

when this particular right had been denied?

 I take it from your answer to Justice 

Scalia that there had not been a denial of the right 

and hence a violation of procedural due process after

the first telephone conversation. I take it from 

your answer that there wasn't one after the second 

conversation. And I take it the only -- that there 

was no ripening, as it were, of the facts into a 

denial of what she was entitled to until the 3:00 

a.m. call, is that correct?

 MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor, and I 

apologize if I misstated -- and it gave you that 

impression.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, my general question, 

then, is how does a reviewing court determine when or 

the point at which there has been a denial?

 MR. REICHEL: The initial contact with the 

police department we're saying has to involve 

appropriate processes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So following the first 

phone call, they would have to have made an express 

probable cause determination?

 MR. REICHEL: They would have had to have 

made a probable cause determination in good faith and 

conveyed and communicated --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And communicate that to 

her.

 MR. REICHEL: Communicated that to her, 

which they never did. Instead they just kept telling

her, you can call back later, call back later. They 

never made the probable cause determination and 

conveyed it to her.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did they simply 

have to take her word as to the facts on the probable 

cause issue?

 MR. REICHEL: No, not at all, Your Honor, 

and I believe that the whole intent of Goss versus 

Lopez was to allow a high school student to 

understand the interpretation of the principal's view 

of the facts, and allow the student the opportunity 

to clarify or to fill in any missing points in terms 

of the understanding being --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but Goss 

versus Lopez, to my knowledge -- you may know more 

about it. But to my knowledge, there are not a lot 

of federal cases which second guess the principal or 

the teacher, once the teacher or the principal gives 

a plausible reason for suspending the student.

 And of course my fear is that that is 

precisely what would occur here. There would be 

procedure, there would be a reason. The reason is 

we're too busy. All right? And courts won't second 

guess that.

 But if you take the other route, you get

what you need, which is an instruction to the police 

department that when a child is missing, you don't 

wait. But I don't see how you can get that 

instruction on this procedural route.

 MR. REICHEL: Your Honor, we're not asking 

for the Court to instruct the police department they 

have to drop everything --

JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. And that seems 

to me to be the problem, because you have a case 

where the problem was the delay and that's apparently 

a common problem. And I don't see how this route 

that you take gets at that problem.

 MR. REICHEL: Your Honor, if I could 

respond, the delay issue is not the crux of the 

problem. The crux of the problem is that the police 

officers here never told Ms. Gonzales that they 

believed that there was or was not probable cause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What good could that have 

done anyone?

 MR. REICHEL: It would have allowed her 

the opportunity --

JUSTICE SOUTER: She knew, as it was, that 

they weren't going to do anything. What good would 

it have done her to know that, oh, it's nice to know 

that they've gone through a probable cause

determination in coming to the conclusion that 

they're not going to do anything. I mean, what is 

the social value of that?

 MR. REICHEL: Your Honor, I don't believe 

the record is such that we've alleged that 

Ms. Gonzales knew that they weren't going to do 

anything. In fact, it's just the opposite, that she 

relied upon --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They said call back in 

two hours and whatnot.

 MR. REICHEL: And she continued to do 

that, to follow their instructions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And each time at the end 

of the call, she knew that they weren't going to do 

-- they weren't going to go out and look and they 

weren't going to enforce the order at that point, 

didn't she?

 MR. REICHEL: I'm not sure that's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I can understand 

you're making an argument -- you have made it, but I 

can understand you're making an argument that the 

point of procedure is to force people, in this case 

the police, to face facts. If they really know that 

she has made out probable cause that something is 

wrong here, if they are forced to face that as a

result of procedure, they will then do something 

about it. It's not as easy to be irresponsible in 

that case.

 But the trouble with that argument, it 

seems to me, although it's sound as far as it goes, 

is that it's an argument that would apply with 

respect to every statute in which there is mandatory 

language to the police to enforce it.

 And that seems to me to suggest a 

completely nonadministerable system and one which is 

totally at odds with the normal accord of police 

discretion.

 MR. REICHEL: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, how do you get 

around that dilemma?

 MR. REICHEL: We believe that the process 

test that we're articulating here is unique to 

domestic violence mandatory arrest statutes across 

the country. The reason being is that these statutes 

were enacted precisely because of this problem, the 

problem of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why weren't they 

enacted with an express provision saying, and by the 

way, the police have got to go, either through the 

following procedure or, by the way, this statute

creates a right on the part of the protected party.

 In other words, if the response to what I 

understand the problem to have been, if the response 

was the response that you think the legislature made, 

why didn't the legislature say something that would 

take these statutes out of the run of the mill 

criminal law statutes in which the police, subject to 

mandatory language, have an apparent obligation to do 

something to enforce?

 MR. REICHEL: I would respectfully submit, 

Your Honor, that they have, especially in Colorado. 

This statute is much more detailed than a run of the 

mill criminal or civil statute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't say that 

people like your client have a personal right to 

enforcement with a damage remedy.

 MR. REICHEL: It doesn't, Your Honor, but 

the fact that there is a court order here in place 

individualizes the entitlement. It makes it 

personal.

 Ms. Gonzales went into court and aired her 

dirty laundry under the assumption, mistakenly here, 

that she was going to be provided protection from the 

State. That if she went in and explained the 

situation to the courts, the courts would issue her

an order that meant something. And it could only 

mean something if police officers are willing to 

enforce it. The legislature in turn has said, if a 

person has this kind of order, you shall use every 

reasonable means to enforce it.

 Now, in order to enforce it, the police 

officers are going to have to, as they respond to 

every criminal complaint, make an initial probable 

cause determination. That's part of every day law 

enforcement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Reichel, how would 

you describe, briefly, the property that your client 

has been deprived of? What is the property?

 MR. REICHEL: The property is an 

entitlement to enforcement of her order. That's the 

property, Your Honor. That's how it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The entitlement to 

enforcement of an order is property? Do you know any 

case that is -- what's the closest case that you 

would say has held something to be property that is 

an entitlement to have an order enforced as opposed 

to an entitlement to a job, an entitlement to money, 

an entitlement to what I would consider property?

 MR. REICHEL: There is no opinion of this 

Court that talks about orders per se. There is,

however, what I would classify as a more quirky 

property interest, and that was the Logan versus 

Simmerman Brush case. That case dealt with the 

situation where there was a statute that provided a 

cutoff for when somebody could sue for unemployment 

benefits or discriminatory allegations in the State 

of Illinois.

 And the court there held that while there 

is really a right in this process, to go through this 

process and by cutting it off without any opportunity 

for notice or a hearing, the State of Illinois --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's, at the end 

of the day, they were unemployment benefits, right? 

I mean --

MR. REICHEL: That's true.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't the better 

analogy be to assume she made a contract with a 

private detective agency to protect her from these 

events. And if something arises, to go get the 

police and act on it? That would be a property right 

if she had a private contract with a private 

detective agency to do exactly what the police were 

supposed to do here.

 MR. REICHEL: Well, Your Honor, that's 

true, although when she went into court, I think she

believed that she had a contract with the State of 

Colorado, at least a promise by the State of Colorado 

that she would obtain some protection.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me a 

contract for protection would be a familiar kind of 

property, is what I'm suggesting.

 MR. REICHEL: Exactly. Exactly. And here 

the order --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But there is no contract 

here, is there?

 MR. REICHEL: There is no contract but 

there is an order. There is a court issued order 

based upon her allegations and based upon her 

submissions to the court.

 Your Honors, again, Ms. Gonzales took the 

risk here of seeking an order of protection and 

airing her dirty laundry in public, and she did so 

with the reasonable expectation that the order meant 

something, that law enforcement would enforce it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you be precise 

about what is the due process? You're saying it's 

not a hearing that you're seeking. Not just that she 

could be listened to and no action taken. But what 

precisely is the process to which she is due?

 MR. REICHEL: We believe that there has to

be an objective, thoughtful, reasoned evaluation of 

her complaint of a violation. And that involves 

necessarily an evaluation in good faith of probable 

cause, a determination of whether probable cause 

exists, and an articulation of that determination --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you said a 

moment ago, this could be done by the sergeant on 

duty at the desk who probably had three other calls 

waiting. Do you still think that could be done?

 MR. REICHEL: Certainly, Your Honor. I 

believe if you take a look at some of the model 

policies already in place by police departments 

around the country that are attached to the amicus 

brief of the law enforcement agencies that filed on 

our behalf, you'll see some policies whereby the 

person at the desk taking the information is required 

to have certain types of questions and provide 

certain types of responses to those questions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But on any timetable?

 MR. REICHEL: Yeah, we're not asking for 

the police department to drop everything. We're just 

asking that they --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If I understand your 

position correctly, I know what the allegations are 

here, but if the evidence should show later on that

in response to one of these telephone calls, the desk 

sergeant said, send a squad car out and see if you 

can locate the kids, you would lose?

 MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor, that's not 

what I'm saying.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because that would have 

been a good faith response by somebody to try and 

find out whether there was probable cause.

 MR. REICHEL: There has to be an 

articulation of the determination of probable cause 

to the holder of the restraining order to allow her 

to, for example, clarify facts, to perhaps talk to a 

superior or perhaps, in this case, go somewhere else 

for help, go to the court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But where do you get 

that? I know that the Tenth Circuit tried to stick 

to the language of the statute. But where do you get 

the requirement, A, that police inform her and, B, 

that it give reasons for nonenforcement? Those were 

not within what the Tenth Circuit said.

 MR. REICHEL: I believe it was wrapped 

within the concept of a probable cause determination. 

And they did specifically state that if there was an 

adverse determination, that notice of that 

determination has to be conveyed to her. That was, I

believe, the fourth prong of our analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the notice -- yeah, 

did it say with a statement of reasons?

 MR. REICHEL: With a statement of reasons, 

it did, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does that come 

from?

 MR. REICHEL: Well, the statement of 

reasons, Your Honor, allows again for there to be 

communication on both sides. So that if the 

statement of reasons turned out to be based upon 

false information --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know that it would be 

a fair process that you're describing.

 MR. REICHEL: A meaningful process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it an essential 

one, that is, that nothing spells out -- in most of 

the cases that involve property and a procedural due 

process right, it's a hearing that the person is 

seeking. Are they entitled to benefit or are they 

not? But here, this is not what you want. You want 

the police to enforce. And if they don't enforce, to 

give you a reason.

 MR. REICHEL: Well, I believe that the 

enforcement of the order flows from the probable

cause determination. The obligation to enforce is 

triggered by a finding of probable cause of a 

violation.

 So the process we're looking for involves 

the probable cause determination. It's our position 

that by simply ignoring that process, you're 

depriving somebody potentially of their property 

right in enforcement of the order.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the police --

let's say, focusing on this case, suppose they had 

looked at this order and said, wow, it gives him 

weekends with the girls, it gives him summertime with 

the girls and, subject to his ex-wife's agreement, 

dinner time with the girls, this can't be all that 

urgent because if he would harm the girls then why is 

the judge allowing him so much sole time with them?

 So wouldn't -- looking at this particular 

order, wouldn't there be reasons why the police would 

say, the judge is allowing the father to spend time 

with the girls, this can't be that urgent?

 MR. REICHEL: There could have been, Your 

Honor, but again, those reasons were never 

articulated to my client and any reasons the police 

officers may have had are not in the record.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But this is such a new

sort of a requirement you're seeking us to develop 

here. I just don't know of any past case that would 

suggest such a requirement when it comes to law 

enforcement requests by citizens of police. It would 

be a major step, wouldn't it?

 MR. REICHEL: It would be a different kind 

of case, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. Are there any 

indications that any of the police in this instance 

will face disciplinary action for their response 

here?

 MR. REICHEL: I really have no idea, Your 

Honor. I really have no idea.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you still bring a 

state tort suit?

 MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor. I believe 

that as was conceded in Petitioner's reply brief, 

they're really under our governmental immunity laws. 

They're probably the strictest in the country. There 

really is no viable tort --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because it is 

willful and wanton, and you've made out a claim they 

didn't even give an answer, they didn't do anything, 

they have a practice of doing nothing.

 MR. REICHEL: I believe that centers more

around the causation and foreseeability issues that 

are triggered by that type of a claim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if the State cares 

so little about enforcing what its officers do under 

its own laws, isn't that some indication that it did 

not intend to create the property interest that 

you're arguing for?

 MR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor, I don't 

believe that at all. And in fact, again, going back 

to some of the Court's prior cases and the Roth 

series of case law, if you look, for example, at 

Logan versus Simmerman Brush, there was a good deal 

of discussion about whether there was a tort law 

remedy and, in fact, there was in that case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Do you have any 

other cases besides Logan?

 MR. REICHEL: On that issue?

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.

 MR. REICHEL: Not with that elaborate of a 

discussion on the issue, although I would submit that 

the existence of a post-depravation remedy, so to 

speak here, is irrelevant under, again, Logan, simply 

because we're left now with the Monell claim. We're 

left with the allegations of state action, a custom 

and policy of a state entity here.

 And the existence of a post-depravation 

state law tort remedy is irrelevant to the analysis 

of whether there is a due process violation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there had been a 

question certified to the Colorado Supreme Court, and 

the Colorado Supreme Court said we weren't intending 

to create any entitlement here, evidence that we 

don't even have a tort action that's willful or 

wanton conduct, no liability at all in the 

municipality. So suppose the State Supreme Court has 

said, we didn't mean to create any entitlement, then 

where would you be?

 MR. REICHEL: We probably wouldn't be 

here, Your Honor. That question simply never got 

certified to the Tenth Circuit. And I believe you do 

have to give deference to the Tenth Circuit's 

analysis of Colorado law on that issue.

 Your Honors, at issue here is a specific 

order of protection, a legislative mandate requiring 

enforcement of a protective order and a pattern and 

practice of the Castle Rock police department of

case. This case involves allegations of a pattern 

and practice, an official policy and custom on the 

part of Castle Rock of not taking complaints of 

restraining order violations seriously.

 This pattern and practice that's -- in and 

of itself proves there was no process. Ms. Gonzales 

merely seeks the opportunity to prove at a trial on 

the merits that no matter what she said to the Castle 

Rock police officers, they were not going to do 

anything about her --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you whether 

you would favor or disfavor our certifying the 

question whether there is a property right here to 

the Colorado Supreme Court?

 MR. REICHEL: At this point in time, I 

suppose I would disfavor it, because I believe that 

Bishop versus Wood is controlling. Your Honors, we 

respectfully request that this Honorable Court affirm 

the Tenth Circuit's ruling in this matter. Thank you 

very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, 

Mr. Reichel. Mr. Eastman, you have four minutes 

remaining.

 MR. EASTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. I want to go back to Justice Scalia's point 

about the property interest. This is such a unique 

claim of a property interest. I think it would be 

appropriate to find that even if you were to accept 

Justice Stevens' contention of a contract, an ADT 

type of guarantee of protective services, that looks 

a lot more like the type of entitlements under Roth 

that this Court has recognized.

 I think it may well be the case that you 

never reach a property interest in the enforcement 

against somebody else, that that's a different thing 

in kind from this traditional contract protective 

services.

 So if there was a statute that said, when 

somebody has a protective order that implicates --

particularly when there is a finding of dangerousness 

that's been made by a court that has nothing to do 

with the restraining order that was issued here, and 

that the police are obligated to provide 24-hour, 

seven days a week police -- squad car out in front of 

her house until she goes to testify at a hearing, for 

example, that would be I think a property interest.

 But it would meet the criteria that this 

Court set out in Gonzaga, that it's defined in terms

of rights to her, not just benefits that might flow 

from a criminal law more generally.

 It's phrased in terms of the person 

benefited and it has an unmistakable focus. That's 

the phrase from Gonzaga. And that there is an intent 

to create a private remedy as well, not just the 

private right. I think those kind of things would 

give rise to a Roth type property interest that would 

lead to the invocation of procedural due process 

requirements.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the willful 

and wanton -- suppose the facts were just as they 

say, long-standing practice, not responding, doing 

nothing, doing nothing here despite evidence of 

serious danger, and being told you shouldn't do 

anything, don't pay any attention he'll come home, 

would that show willful and wanton?

 MR. EASTMAN: I believe under Colorado 

law, that would show willful and wanton and their 

tort claim would be available against the police. 

But it's precisely because of that tort claim is 

available and only on those limited circumstances 

that I think you cannot read the Colorado legislature 

as having created a property interest here, because 

the remedies that would be available would not be so

limited.

 We would not be limited to willful and 

wanton conduct. We would have all sorts of remedies 

beyond what the State of Colorado specifically said. 

And you would go a long way toward making 

constitutional provisions the font of Colorado tort 

law, and completely supplant --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same 

question I asked your opponent? Would you favor or 

disfavor our certifying the property law issue to the 

Colorado Supreme Court?

 MR. EASTMAN: Disfavor. I think there is 

just nothing in this statute that would even make it 

reasonable for the Colorado Supreme Court to hold 

that there is a property interest here.

 And to go back to your earlier point about 

Bishop, it's not a determinative rule. You give 

deference to the Tenth Circuit. But when the Tenth 

Circuit's decision is not based on any even 

developments in Colorado law, and based on a Colorado 

statute and takes the step that this statute simply 

doesn't comply with, I don't think you need to give 

the kind of absolute deference here that you might 

have given other cases. If there are no more 

questions, I'll -- thank you.
