CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 11-204, Christopher v. SmithKline 

Beecham. 

Mr. Goldstein. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 

In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress 

directed the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote "define 

and delimit" the statute's outside salesman exemption. 

By regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside 

salesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting 

sales by others. In further guidance, the Secretary 

elaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either, 

one, a conversation where there can be no commitment or, 

two, one where there will be no exchange with the 

employer. 

Now, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical 

detailer engages in promotion. They tout drugs to 

doctors. Everyone agrees that there can't be a 

commitment to issue a prescription. Everyone agrees 

that a prescription is not an exchange with a

pharmaceutical company. But nonetheless, the Respondent 

argues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly 

to doctors as a matter of law. They say that follows 

from the fact that the Secretary's regulation 

incorporates the definition of "sale" in the FLSA, which 

is in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1. 

That definition, which is section 203(k), 

provides -- it's the second provision on the page --

"'sale' or 'sell' includes any sale, exchange, contract 

to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or 

other disposition." And what you will not find in that 

language is anything that contradicts the two points the 

Secretary has made, which is that there has to be a 

commitment or that, at the very least, there has to be 

an exchange with the employer. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is that consistent 

with the Government's argument? They argue, quote, "an 

employee does not make a 'sale' for purposes of the 

'outside salesman' exemption unless he actually 

transfers title to the property at issue." The statute 

refers to a consignment for sale. When that occurs, 

does -- does the consignor actually transfer title to 

the property at issue? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is an arrangement for 

transfer of title, and that's why it's critical that it

says a consignment for sale, the sale being the transfer 

of title. But in all events, this case is not a fight 

about transferring title or some lesser form of 

exchange, because there's no exchange between the doctor 

and the --

JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that, but I 

would appreciate an answer --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- to my question. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Is the Government's position 

consistent with the reference to consignment for sale? 

When a consignment for sale occurs, is there a transfer 

of title? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: There is an agreement for a 

transfer of title, and I believe there --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there a -- a transfer of 

title? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. There is not a 

transfer of title, but there is an agreement for a 

transfer of title. They -- just to be clear, the 

Government says the definition of "sale" includes a 

transfer of title. And so, all I'm pointing out, if I 

could just go back to the definition -- I apologize for 

not answering --

transfer title.

know, whatever you want. 

The Government can explain it --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, not really, but 

anyway, go ahead. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. All right. It is --

the statute refers to a consignment for sale. I believe 

they're defining a sale in that phrase. But in all 

events, the debate over whether it includes or is 

limited to a transfer of title is not at issue in this 

case, because what the -- because all the statute 

requires is that there, at the very least, be some 

exchange of some part. There's going to be an -- a 

binding agreement, a commitment, and that commitment 

will involve an exchange with the employer. What 

happens in pharmaceutical detailing is that there can't 

be any commitment to issue a prescription at all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because -- because the 

limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law, 

they can't sell. And you -- you are debating about 

exchange, sale. What strikes one about this case is 

that these are workers -- they work autonomously. They 

don't clock in and out. They work outside the 

workplace. After they're trained, they have minimal 

supervision. 

Is there any other category of exempt

workers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come 

under the wage and hours law? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. So, your premise 

is that they are exempt to begin with? There -- I can 

tell you that there are a large number of employees who 

do work outside the workplace and are substantially more 

autonomous than are pharmaceutical detailers, who have 

to operate from very strict scripts. There are -- it's 

literally --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: For example, what are 

the -- that's what I wanted to know. What are the 

categories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the 

type that clocks in and out? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Well, you can have 

emergency service workers that are working outside. 

There are lots of people -- so, for example, you may 

well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

understand what that is. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's an emergency service 

worker?

fireman, an ambulance driver. They are constantly 

outside the office. You can also have lots of different

kinds of promotion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. They're not on 

duty all the time. Aren't -- don't they have hours of 

duty? My goodness. Some of them make enormous overtime 

wages because they've put in hours beyond their regular 

hours of duty --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that -- my --

JUSTICE SCALIA: These people have no hours 

of duty. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not quite right, 

Justice Scalia. They are expected -- the joint appendix 

explains -- to be in the doctors' offices between 8:30 

and 5:00 p.m. They work additional time. The fact 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that 

just -- I mean, that's when the doctors are there. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's -- but that is when 

they are supposed to be in the doctors' offices. That's 

dictated by the company. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about 

the extras? I mean, we're told that part of this job is 

to have a good relationship with the doctors. It 

includes dinners. It may be conventions. 

Entertainment, maybe golf. If -- if you're right, would 

the time on the golf course get time and a half?

MR. GOLDSTEIN: There actually are very 

strict restrictions. That kind of activity is under the 

PhRMA Code, which is trying to interpret Federal law, is 

actually very heavily restricted. But whatever it is 

that the employee is doing to further the employment 

relationship is going to be hours on duty. It is really 

important I think that while it is true that a 

pharmaceutical detailer has many of the characteristics 

of an outside salesman, the one they don't have is 

selling.

any --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And these are all -- these 

are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, Justice Kennedy, 

they absolutely are. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any occupations 

or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor 

Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are 

out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth. In other 

words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent, 

would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas 

that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they 

wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other 

classifications to fit them in? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I would, but they would all 

be one of two things. They would either fall within the 

administrative exemption, which is, Justice Ginsburg, 

what is -- Congress was talking about when it talked about 

people who have a lot of autonomy, and which is not true 

of detailers -- or some other exemption. So, to give an 

example, certain outside buyers are exempt under the 

Fair Labor Standards Act. A good -- that's a good 

example, because if you're an outside buyer of poultry,

then you are exempt, but if you are an outside buyer of 

meat, you aren't. 

It is one of a lot of different places --

there are 50-some exemptions from the Fair Labor 

Standards Act. And Congress drew incredibly fine lines. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Congress can draw -- draw 

even silly lines. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If Congress draws it, it's 

a line. But the line you're suggesting here -- both 

your brief and the Government's, as I recall, say, my 

goodness, if we find for the Respondent here, there'll 

be so much uncertainty in the future. I'm not sure 

there isn't a lot of uncertainty if we -- if we find in 

your direction. 

Now, let me give you an example. One of my 

law clerks -- my law clerks supplement my sparse life 

experience. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: One of my law clerks is 

familiar with the -- the framing business. Okay? Now, 

salesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time 

that they visit the -- the framing company or the 

framing store. They get a commitment that in the 

future, that person will order from the framing company.

Now, is that a sale? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is a sale, but the 

difference here is that there's neither a commitment --

remember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but there is a 

commitment. There is a commitment to -- what they're 

trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if 

it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the 

future. That's a commitment. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if that is 

the commitment, then all of promotion I think is going 

to be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you 

on the street saying will you try my product, will you 

go into the store, is trying to get you to say I'll go 

in. And that is much more of a direct commitment than 

you saying I'll consider it in an appropriate 

circumstance. 

The commitment by a doctor is precatory at 

most. They do not make any commitment in any instance 

that can be binding in any way that they will prescribe 

a drug for anyone. 

And remember, there is the second -- the 

second distinction. So, that's one. But the second is 

that -- remember, there is a purchase in your 

hypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing

store. But the second part of the Secretary's guidance 

is that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription, 

they're not exchanging anything with the drug company. 

There -- nothing is acquired from the drug company. 

That is a very significant difference. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a peculiar line of 

commerce. And -- and you're saying that what 

constitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of 

the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where 

you're selling to people who cannot make a commitment. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, there are two things. 

The first is the commitment, and they are not selling 

anything to the doctor. Remember, just to frame this 

industry, the pharmaceutical company sells its products; 

it sells them to pharmaceutical wholesalers, which sell 

them to pharmacies -- pardon me -- which sell them to 

customers, which have a relationship with a doctor, who 

may or may not have met with a detailer. 

There is a sale here in this industry, but 

it is to a pharmaceutical detailer, and that is a very 

significant difference. The critical point as well for 

purposes of --

up on other -- other categories of employee? You gave 

me cleaning workers, emergency service workers. Are any 

of those categories people who get paid commissions? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Those are not, but the 

example that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which 

is that there are outside buyers who do receive 

commissions. And remember, of course, that there are 

outside salesmen who do not receive commissions but are 

nonetheless exempt. Congress didn't write an exemption 

about commissions; it wrote them about whether it's an 

outside person who engages in sales. 

And the other point I was trying to make is 

that -- and Justice Scalia echoed it to some extent --

and that is that the FLSA draws very fine lines. If you 

work for a movie theater you are exempt, but not a 

playhouse. If you work for a small newspaper but not a 

small magazine, you're exempt. If you care for the 

elderly but not the young, you're exempt. 

And what Congress said is that there has to 

be -- you are an outside salesman and that -- it is true 

that this is a peculiar industry, but the peculiarity of 

it is that you don't make sales. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

It's common ground in this case that in 

order to be an outside salesman, an employee must make 

sales. And in theory there are two different ways in 

which Respondent could have attempted to establish that 

the PSRs in this case fit that criteria. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer 

Justice Alito's question? Your brief to the Second 

Circuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is 

a -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at 

least a promise to purchase. But your brief here calls 

it a much more rigid test, that there has to be a 

transfer of title. And he pointed to the language of 

3(x) -- 3(k), that says "consignment for sale," which 

doesn't have a transfer of the title. So, what is the 

Government's position? 

MR. STEWART: Well, the DOL regulations have 

since 19 -- I believe it's since 1949, have said that 

"make a sale" within the meaning of 203(k), the term 

"making a sale" within the meaning of 3(k) includes a 

transfer of title. And in theory, the verb "includes"

could leave open the possibility that other things could 

be included as well. We've never encountered a 

situation in which DOL has found a sale of goods without 

a transfer of title.  But in direct answer to your 

question, Justice Alito, about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me. 

Consignment salesmen are -- are not exempt? 

MR. STEWART: It would be -- with specific 

respect to consignments for sale, it would have been 

more precise to say that there has to be a transfer of 

possession in contemplation of a transfer of title. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And what about salesmen 

who -- whose objective is to obtain a rental? The lower 

courts have said that they qualify. Does the Government 

disagree with that? 

MR. STEWART: DOL believes that they 

qualify, but not as sales of goods. And if the -- the 

Court could look at the appendix to the blue brief on 

page 4. This is the pertinent regulation that refers to 

making sales or obtaining orders. 

And it says: "Section 541.500 requires that 

the employee be engaged in making sales within the 

meaning of section 3(k) of the Act or obtaining orders 

or contracts for services or for the use of facilities." 

And DOL's view is that a rental agreement would be a

And the way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How can they 

put in number (2)? I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k). 

Can -- can they supplement 3(k)? 

MR. STEWART: They have supplemented 3(k), 

and they did that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the authority to do 

that? 

MR. STEWART: The -- this is discussed in 

the Stein Report, which was issued in 1940, and what had 

happened was that the question had arisen -- and the 

Stein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail. 

The question had arisen whether individuals who 

negotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell 

time -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell --

negotiate contracts for carriage of freight by rail or 

truck -- the question arose whether they were outside 

salesmen within the meaning of the statute. 

And the Stein Report explained that the Wage 

and Hour Division had taken the position that they were 

not because it interpreted "sales" -- it appears to have 

interpreted "sales" to refer only to sales of goods, and 

people who were engaged in those sorts of businesses 

were not selling goods. But the Stein Report said:

However, these people are commonly regarded as salesmen; 

the contracts they negotiate are treated as sales. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's wonderful. 

Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the 

question before us is whether it's arbitrary or 

capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their 

power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these 

people look like salesmen to me. 

And so, if they can do number (2) there, I 

don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and 

by the way, detailers are also included. 

MR. STEWART: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue would be 

whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that. 

MR. STEWART: The agency has taken the 

position that, even though it has construed 3(k) to 

refer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or 

contracts for the use of facilities can be covered. 

However, there's a big difference between the 

interaction between a detailer and a physician and the 

interaction between the -- the person who sells time on 

the radio. The person --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure there is; sure there 

is. But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't 

have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of

the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really 

have a different -- a different argument before us here. 

MR. STEWART: Well, the -- the theory on 

which the Stein Report proceeded was that, even though 

sales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they 

were still customarily regarded as sales, and they had 

the essential attributes of sales; namely, an exchange 

of something valuable that the seller possessed in 

return for consideration from the buyer. And you don't 

have any of that when the detailer deals with the --

with the --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, there's this 

other regulation which is I guess in the coverage 

section, 779.241, which says that if an employee 

performs any work that in a practical sense is an 

essential part of consummating the sale of the goods, 

he'll be considered to be selling the goods. 

So, I guess this question is a two-part 

question. Do you agree that that regulation does cover 

the -- these detailers? And the second part is, if you 

do, you know, how does it work that we should understand 

"sale" one way for purposes of coverage and another way 

for purposes of exemption? 

MR. STEWART: Well, the first thing I would 

say is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover

detailers. That is, if the relevant sales are, as we 

believe, GSK's sales to -- the transfer of drugs to 

wholesalers and pharmacies in return for consideration, 

the detailers don't play an essential role in the 

consummation of those sales. They don't participate in 

those sales. It's true that their mission is to engage 

in activities which set in motion a chain of events that 

will make those sales more likely to occur, but we 

wouldn't regard them as --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But that seems a little bit 

blind to the way the industry actually works. The way 

this industry actually works is the real work is done by 

the detailer getting the doctor to say, yes, I'm going 

to start prescribing this where it's medically 

appropriate. The actual sales from the company to the 

pharmacy just follows from however successful the 

detailer is. 

MR. STEWART: But I think much the same 

thing could have been said about all the promotional 

workers that DOL has done with -- has dealt with in the 

past. That is, the premise, the justification for a 

company to hire a promotional worker, is that the 

promotional activities will increase the overall sales 

of the company, will either directly or indirectly set 

in motion a chain of events that leads people to buy the

product. But DOL has historically regarded those 

activities as distinct from selling the product. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do those employees 

work on commissions? 

MR. STEWART: Some employees may work on 

commission. Some --

JUSTICE ALITO: Promotional workers do work 

on commissions? 

MR. STEWART: It's -- I don't think there is 

necessarily a uniform rule one way or the other. The 

Stein Report did say in 1940 that, although it was 

characteristic for outside salesmen to receive 

commissions, that was not the test, that that was a 

quirk of compensation. The other thing I would say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did we have detailers in 

1940? Gee, that's a long time ago. Did we have 

detailers in 1940? That's almost a century ago. 

MR. STEWART: There were detailers in that 

era, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's my point, actually. 

That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what 

Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've 

seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly 

balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who 

work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years

of nobody said anything. 

So you would think -- and it isn't the only 

problem that has just been recognized in other 

industries, too. If the agency is going to reverse, not 

reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for 

75 years, the right way to do it is to have notice and 

comment, hearings, allow people to present their point 

of view, and then make some rules or determine what 

should happen. Perhaps they'd say for the future let's 

do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the 

past. Perhaps they'd say some and not others. Okay? 

That's my instinctive reaction, not 

necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law. 

But why shouldn't I try to get there? 

MR. STEWART: I guess I'd say two things, 

one general and one specific to detailers. The general 

thing is that DOL has consistently drawn a distinction 

between promotional work --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I've read those. 

MR. STEWART: Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I've read those, and I find 

them beautifully ambiguous. 

(Laughter.)

that's the end of it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's gone on for 

70 years, and you're -- and instead of doing a 

regulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer 

indicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in 

different -- different courts. It seems to me that's 

not nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as --

as an agency ought to be. 

MR. STEWART: Well, with respect to where 

the industry expectation arose, we have only one data 

point or at least only one data point that has been 

identified in the briefs. That is the National 

Federation of Independent Small Business Legal Center 

has filed an amicus brief on Respondent's side, and then 

they -- they identify one DOL opinion letter, of which 

we were previously unaware, that dates from 1945. And 

in the opinion letter, the employer of the detailer 

asked for an opinion to the effect that its detailers 

were covered by the administrative exemption. That 

employer didn't request a ruling that these were outside 

salesmen. And DOL --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're right about that, 

and so, they're at fault, too. But on the other hand, 

their employees might have been satisfied, and this is 

done to protect the employees.

So, I'm asking, not saying, but what is the 

process here? How do you know -- at what level was this 

agency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this? 

Who made it? What was the input? How do you know 

they're on your side? You do know; you're right. But I 

mean, what's the process internally? 

MR. STEWART: Internally, the -- the 

Solicitor's Office at the Department of Labor would 

consult with the Wage and Hour Division. The 

Solicitor's name went on the briefs both that were filed 

in the Ninth Circuit and the brief -- I mean, the Ninth 

Circuit and also the Novartis brief in the Second 

Circuit. And the Solicitor's name is on the 

Government's brief in this Court. The Solicitor is the 

third-highest-ranking individual within the Department 

of Labor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- I'm sorry 

to interrupt your answer, but does your office review 

the amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the 

agencies? 

MR. STEWART: There was SG authorization for 

the amicus brief to be filed.

procedure?

the law is. And in terms of --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, the alternative is not 

enforcement actions, necessarily. The alternative is 

for the agency to focus on the question and decide what 

it actually wants to do. 

MR. STEWART: And the agency has regarded 

the application of its promotion sales regulations to 

the facts of this case as clear. That is, if you asked 

GSK's highest level management why does it make sense to 

employ detailers, they wouldn't say because they get 

these commitments from physicians which are of value to 

the company. The commitments or the quasi-commitments 

from physicians in and of themselves are of no value. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There are 90,000 of these 

people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought 

any action for these -- lo, these many years. Ninety 

thousand of them. And all of a sudden, you say -- you 

come in and say, oh, you have been in violation of the 

law in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot 

of money for all these people that you didn't give 

overtime to in the past. 

I just think that's extraordinary. 

MR. STEWART: Well, to the extent that there 

was an industry expectation that was based on anything 

DOL had said, it was based on, as far as we know, based 

on the 1945 opinion letter, which said not --

your attention. 

MR. STEWART: Again, our argument is not 

that they should have known from the -- about the 

opinion letter. Our argument is that the proper 

application of the promotion sales regulation to the 

facts of this case is pretty clear, and that if GSK's 

top-level management was asked to defend the use of 

detailers, they would say these people are important 

because if they persuade physicians to write more 

prescriptions and those are filled with GSK products, 

then pharmacies will reorder the drug and our 

wholesalers will reorder it from us. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you have been guilty of 

malfeasance for 70 years, right? These 90,000 people

judgment in the performance of their duties. That's 

what the -- what DOL said in concluding --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I thought that 

this whole system was set up on giving industries the 

opportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter, 

correct? 

MR. STEWART: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I saw in the briefing 

hundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different 

industries. Outside of this 1945 letter, did anybody 

else, any other pharmaceutical company, ever set out for 

the government or seek an opinion letter that you're 

aware of? 

MR. STEWART: I'm aware of only one 

instance. I think this is not a matter of public 

record, but there was one request in, I believe, 

December of 2007 for an opinion to the effect that the 

detailers were covered by the outside salesman 

exemption. DOL never responded one way or the other. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't suggest -- you're 

not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does 

not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty? Is that --

MR. STEWART: It does -- it has phased out 

the opinion letter program and gives other forms of 

administrative guidance. That is, DOL's rationale was 

that the opinion letter program had not been cost 

effective because often the bottom line -- may I --

often the bottom-line answer to the question would turn 

on factual nuances of a particular employer and wouldn't 

provide much guidance to others. And so, it's tried to 

provide forms of guidance that are -- speak to the

activities involved in the work of their worker, and 

they're exempt. Give me your definition? As long as

if I could, there's two important qualifications that 

avoid the slippery slope concerns you're talking about. 

One is it's, I think, common ground among everybody that 

you -- to qualify for any exemption or certainly all of 

these relevant exemptions here, it has to be your 

primary duty. So, you can't just slip in a little sales 

activity for something and get that person qualified. 

The other thing, and I think this is very --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it seems like the 

sale here is not the primary duty. The sale here is to 

schmooze the doctor and give him information. That's 

what you said in one of your briefs -- your company said 

in one of its briefs in -- in a products liability 

litigation. 

MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Your Honor, the 

commitment is very important in this industry. It is 

the objective of the sales call. It's to get a 

commitment to prescribe when medically necessary. 

Now, it is true that there is prologue to 

that, and there is efforts to promote before you get 

that particular sale. But the regulations address that 

particularly, and they say, as long as you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Primary duty is one of 

the limiting, and what was the second limiting 

principle?

MR. CLEMENT: The second limiting principle 

is actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you 

look at 503, which are the regulations that draw the 

distinction between promotion and between being outside 

sales, they do not say that promotion is nonexempt 

activity. What they say is it depends who does the 

promotion. And as long as the outside salesperson does 

the promotion in conjunction with his or her own sales 

or solicitations, then that is exempt activity. And 

what they're trying to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also says -- it 

also says promotional work incidental to sales made by 

someone else. 

MR. CLEMENT: Is not covered. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is nonexempt. 

MR. CLEMENT: You're right, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And these sales -- I 

mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a 

pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer. 

MR. CLEMENT: But, Justice Ginsburg, I think 

it's important to recognize that the reason that 503 

draws a distinction between promotional activity in 

conjunction with the salesperson's own sales or 

promotional activity with respect to somebody else's 

sales is they're concerned about the consideration where

somebody else is going to follow up with the same 

customer to close the deal. 

And if you look at the regulatory 

commentary, that's what they're concerned -- they don't 

want to sort of have double counting, where somebody 

promotes with a sales target and then somebody else 

follows up to close the sale. And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that might be one 

thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be 

the only thing. I mean, if you look at these 

regulations, it seems as though what they're trying to 

do is draw a distinction between people who actually 

consummate transactions, transactional people, and 

people who are pitchmen. And -- and what the Department 

of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make 

pitches; they're not people who consummate the 

transactions. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I really 

think if you look at the regulations as a whole and the 

commentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report, 

they're not worried about sorting out the pitchmen 

because they understand that that classic outside 

salesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a 

commitment to buy or some other commitment from the 

sales target.

So, what they're trying to do is really 

distinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people, 

but between what they refer to as missionary men or 

people who pave the way for somebody else to make the 

sale. And I really think that's the focus of the 503 

regulation. 

And so, the Government's argument really 

boils down to the notion that there's nobody in this 

industry that makes enough of a commitment with the 

doctor for anybody to be involved in anything but 

promotion with the doctor. And that seems --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But why isn't that possible? 

I mean, your brief seemed to suggest that in every 

industry there needs to be some group of people who 

would be classified as outside salesmen. And that's not 

necessarily the case. There may be some industries, and 

here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because 

of other business practices, where there just isn't 

anybody who's an outside salesman. 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, it's 

theoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially 

in an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to 

get a commitment to prescribe from the doctor. And I 

think if you look across --

would turn on whether it was in writing or not because 

what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be lawful to put 

it in writing? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I think the answer is 

yes. It's important for the commitment not to be 

binding because of the nature of the doctor's role. 

Nobody wants to go into a doctor's office, let alone 

these sales people, and say, look, whoever is the next 

person who walks in the door, prescribe them the 

product. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That sounds to me it's not 

a commitment, unless the doctor says: Well, I'll look 

at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your 

material, I'll think about it.

the medicine is medically appropriate, that they will

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's got to be non-

binding. 

MR. CLEMENT: It has to be non-binding. I 

agree. But I don't think that the Government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's why -- and 

that's why it's not in writing. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, but you can have a 

non-binding commitment in writing. You can have a 

binding commitment that's oral, as long as it's -- you 

know, I don't want to get into the statute of frauds 

here. But it seems to me that the binding nature is not 

dispositive either. You can have a situation -- look, 

if I agree as -- that I'm going to buy something, I can 

often return it. Sometimes there is a cooling-off 

period, things like that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you this, 

and I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the 

specifics, but my understanding is that the Federal 

Government has expressed new concerns, has new 

regulations, new rules about these outside sales. 

Does that mean that the nature of the work 

has changed in the last 5 or 10 years, so that the

70 years we are talking about is not relevant? Would 

you comment on that? 

MR. CLEMENT: I'd love to, Justice Kennedy. 

I think, to the contrary, I think that -- I mean, the 

Government actually ironically says that the 2004 

rulemaking, which was the last time there was any 

rulemaking, didn't change anything substantively. We 

think that's wrong. We actually think there was an 

important substantive change to the 503(c) regulations 

and others which addressed the following problem, which 

is not that the basic role of the outside salesperson 

has changed, but the technology has changed in such a 

way that it would be silly to draw a distinction between 

whether the salesperson actually takes the order and 

writes it down or gets a form in triplicate, or rather 

gets a commitment to buy from the sales target who then 

actually enters the order on a computer on their own. 

And that I think is the specific situation 

that the agency was confronted with. And in 2004 they 

said: We don't want things to turn on who enters the 

order, whether it's the customer on their own computer 

or the outside salesperson. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement, I thought 

that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one 

was the proposal that was changed, and the other was the

proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to 

allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside 

salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that 

suggestion. 

MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but 

there has always been an effort to try to get all 

promotional people treated as being exempt. But that's 

different from what's being asked for here, which is the 

last person who makes a visit to the person who places 

the relevant order in the industry and gets the 

commitment from that person. That, in contrast to 

general promotion, often directed at the world at large, 

has always been the hallmark of a sale in the 

Department's own flexible approach. And I think that's 

really important because if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that seems to be 

inconsistent with this -- this opinion letter. The 

request is put in by the pharmaceutical company, and 

they want an exemption under administrative employee. 

In the Department of Labor's response allowing that 

exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use 

the word "detailers," medical detailers, are engaged in 

a form of promotional or missionary work. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I 

want to say two things about that. One is to say,

obviously, that may depend a little bit on how the 

particular role was described. If you're reading from 

the 1945 opinion letter, I mean, that may be somewhat 

different. But I do think that what's important here is 

that promotional activity itself is not problematic. 

Promotional activity is exempt as long as it's in 

conjunction with the person's own sales or 

solicitations, is the word of the regulation. So, I 

don't think that's dispositive. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This goes -- the letter 

goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a 

form of promotion not having for its object the making 

of specific transactions. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, and again, Justice 

Ginsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no, 

there is an interest in getting a specific commitment. 

It is commitment to prescribe. It may be somewhat -- it 

is non-binding, and it may be somewhat forward-looking, 

but I don't think that distinguishes this industry from 

many industries. It's not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as your 

70 years, it's suspect for two reasons. One is we're 

told that in the early years, at least, before there 

were regulations restricting the sale of prescription 

drugs, that these detailers did two things. They did

have their informational function, but they also did 

direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals. 

So, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these 

people were engaged in what the department would call 

sales. So, that's suspect. 

And then when we have the commitment, the 

opinion letter that says we have a category for these 

people; they are engaged in instruction, in information; 

they are not engaged in sales; but because they're so 

independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the 

particular case we rank them as administrative people. 

So -- so, it's not so that there was a 

sudden about-face as you suggest. We have a 

categorization as -- as administrative employees, but 

not sales employees, and we have a history of these 

detailers at one time actually selling. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me 

say -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment 

has changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted 

in this industry have changed, but I think the focus is 

very much on the doctors appropriately because they're 

the ones that place the order. But I also want to be 

responsive to the administrative exemption. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't -- you 

wouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?

exemption as an ace up their sleeve or in their back 

pocket. And it's really the same exact issue, because, 

once again, the agency has changed their view. And once 

again, their view is not based on anything that has to 

do with label --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you claim -- did you 

claim exemption as administrative employee? 

MR. CLEMENT: We did, Your Honor, in the 

district court. It's not before this Court because we 

got summary judgment in our favor on the outside sales 

exemption. 

But I really would think it would be a -- a 

mistake for this Court to say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that would -- then 

that would be still open if you lose on the outside 

sales?

But you're just deferring the same inquiry, because the 

Government's position once again is after 70 years of 

having the industry proceed on the assumption that these 

individuals were exempt, they now have changed their 

mind. And, again, their view has everything to do with 

FDA regulation --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Clement --

MR. CLEMENT: -- and nothing to do --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. 

MR. CLEMENT: -- and nothing to do with 

labor policy, because what they say is that now because 

of the government's own off-label prosecutions, these 

outside salespeople have to stick to a script and -- in 

order to avoid off-label liability. And because they 

have to stick to the script, they are told they don't 

exercise sufficient discretion to come within the 

administrative exemption. 

And the problem here is the Labor 

Department, instead of looking at this and making a 

rational judgment about labor policy and whether these 

individuals who make $93,000 on -- for the median should 

rationally be the kind of workers that are protected by 

the Fair Labor Standards Act, instead they're looking at 

things that have everything to do with FDA regulation 

and nothing to do with labor policy.

extra pay?

compensation.

the question -- are these people, people who in some 

sense or other receive commissions on their sales? 

MR. CLEMENT: And the answer is -- for the 

Petitioners on this record, the answer is yes. They're 

not the commissions that are a one-to-one 

correspondence, but what they do is they receive 

substantial incentive compensation, about 25 percent of 

the total, and it's based on the sales of the product in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How's that different 

from a bonus that an employee gets? How is it any 

different than what most companies do in -- in giving a 

bonus at the end of the year? 

MR. CLEMENT: Certainly, based on the facts 

in this record, it -- at the time of this case, it's 

much more tied to the performance of the product in the 

sales territory. And I don't think that's -- you know, 

it's not based on the company's overall performance --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, you give me 

one definition of "outside salesmen," the one that you 

prefer for us to apply here. The Department of Labor 

gives another, and the one they're giving according to 

them is a bright-line rule. It's easy to apply. You 

have to do some sort of transfer of title. That's as --

their rule. 

Tell me what the -- your argument is that --

why your rule has to win. Meaning, aren't we supposed 

to give deference to the expertise of the agency, 

especially when Congress lets them define --

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor --

construction, because it's flatly inconsistent with the 

statute. This idea that you have to have a transfer of 

title cannot be squared with 3(k); it cannot be squared, 

at least as I understand it, with some of the -- the own 

advice they've given, which is all you need is a 

commitment to buy. That's what they've told people 

since 1949. 

There's an example in that Weiss Report from 

1949 involving a jobber where you have a situation where 

somebody's treated as an outside salesperson even though 

they never have title over the product. So, they get 

the commitment to buy from the sales target, and then a 

jobber who works for a different employer is the one 

that transfers title. That's at page 11 of the NFIB 

brief, if you want to look at it. So --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not 

sure I understand what you just said. 

If -- forget the transfer of title business, 

but if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here. 

And we're drawing a line between people who do 

transactions and people who just advertise or make 

pitches or whatever you want to do it. That's perfectly 

consistent with the statute, isn't it? I mean, you can 

argue about is it the only possible reading; you can 

even argue about whether it's the best possible reading.

MR. CLEMENT: It is a possible reading, 

Justice Kagan. But it's not the one that the Labor 

Department has advanced in their amicus brief. So, you 

can't defer to that. I mean, you can decide that it's 

the best reading of the statute if you want, but --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose that that's 

a question for them. I read their amicus briefs to sort 

of suggest two things. Sometimes they just talk about 

transactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of 

title. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, and with respect, 

Justice Kagan, that's one of the many problems with 

deferring to amicus briefs. Because when an agency 

gives guidance in an interpretative rule or something, 

there's one place, and they provide "the" answer. Now, 

I don't know if the Government wants you to defer to the 

-- defer to the argument on page 12 or the argument on 

page 20 or the argument on page 24. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think that they 

would say that it doesn't make any difference, because 

they've never really seen a person who makes 

transactions without transferring title. So, I think

MR. CLEMENT: No, with respect, they have

JUSTICE SCALIA: Consignment, for one, which 

is legitimate business. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, consignment is in the 

statute, but this jobber example is right out of the 

Weiss Report in 1949, and the outside salesperson in 

that case never had title. The title comes from the 

jobber who works for somebody else. So, the salesperson 

in that instance never had title, not even in the chain 

of distribution. Yet, they say that is a clear case 

where the person is an outside salesperson and exempt. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did the 

pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, 

request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these 

PSRs?

MR. CLEMENT: No, there wasn't, Justice 

Ginsburg, but I think that actually cuts in our favor, 

because in 2004, a lot of companies were coming in with 

things where they thought it was unclear, where they 

thought there was some doubt, and asking for 

clarification. This was so well understood that the

exemption, covered the outside sales force of this 

industry --

regulations as setting a new regime, and the Department 

has never made an objection. And, therefore, it follows 

that the Department's interpretation is implausible or 

improper, and then I cite some case from our Court.

to just use the following reasoning, though, which I

could cite as perhaps Cf. cites. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'd like one. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: Sure. Well, here's -- let's 

start -- let's start with Fox and just the basic notion 

that in administrative law, if you're going to change 

your position, you have to acknowledge that you're 

making a change. I think at a minimum here, if they're 

going to impose this kind of massive retroactive 

liability on this industry --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement, this isn't 

a change. You've referred to it as a change in a lot of 

ways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an 

agency that, for some number of years, thought that this 

was not the most urgent problem on their plate. Indeed, 

one would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of 

Labor if they thought that this was the most urgent 

problem on their plate. So, they didn't enforce it. 

But now the question has come up. And so, 

they say we'll look to our regulations. This falls on 

one side of the regulation. Now, you've been given a 

gift for all these years is one way of looking at it, 

because -- because you were not their most urgent

problem; and so, they didn't enforce their own 

regulations against you. 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, here's the 

thing. We can quibble about whether or not there is a 

change in their position or whether they just didn't 

have a position before, but I think the important thing 

is they've imposed, by taking this position in an amicus 

brief and asking for deference to it, massive liability 

on this industry. The PhRMA brief estimates it's 

billions of dollars. 

Now, I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why must you -- why must 

you look to an amicus brief? Why not just look to the 

regulation that defines -- the regulations that define 

"sale" and that define "promotion"? The 541.503 says 

promotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody 

else is not exempt. 

Why do we get into the amicus brief when we 

have in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on 

the one hand, promotion on the other, and then this 

statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by 

somebody else is not exempt? 

Why doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to 

this case?

that's not the answer, and then let me circle back and 

say why, if you're going to err on one side or the 

other, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive 

retroactive liability. The reason that that's not a 

simple matter of deferring to that is because that same 

regulation earlier says that promotional work is exempt 

if it's in conjunction with the individual's own sales 

or solicitations. 

Now, I happen to think it's pretty clear 

that these -- by getting this commitment, which is the 

functional equivalent of a commitment to buy, which is 

what the regulations and the regulatory interpretations 

have always said is a sale in some sense, I think these 

are sales. Certainly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- does the 

pharmaceutical company have a sales force? I mean, who 

sells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the 

hospitals? 

MR. CLEMENT: It's not this kind of outside 

sales force. It's a much less sales-oriented 

transaction. The PhRMA amicus brief, for example, gives 

the example of a company that has 2,000 outside sales 

reps and 10 people that handle the movement of transfer 

of product to the wholesalers and the distributors.

court addresses this issue and I think gets it exactly 

right, which is the reason there isn't a sales effort

physicians are prescribing.

hospitals, are they exempt?

they're not really engaged in a sales effort. It does

competitor's product and it doesn't make any difference 

at all because as a result of that -- I mean, they need 

to have product that actual doctors are writing 

prescriptions for. That's what drives sales in this 

industry. 

There's nothing anomalous about that. If 

you think about any industry, sales activity is always 

directed at the people who place orders. In this 

industry, because of the learned intermediary doctrine, 

the person who places the order is the doctor, not the 

ultimate end user. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there -- let's 

say the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says, 

okay, yours is the first thing I'll think of, you know, 

when I have a patient with this and this. I mean, is 

that a sale? 

MR. CLEMENT: We think it is, Your Honor, 

but if you have any doubt about that, certainly at the 

point that the doctor then, when he sees the next 

patient, writes the prescription, at that point I think 

there's a sale, because, again, what the regulations and 

regulatory history looks for is a -- is a commitment to 

buy. That's the relevant commitment to buy. That's the 

order in this industry --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if the 

doctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to 

this guy, and they say, okay, I'll think of -- you know, 

when it comes up, I'll think of your product; and the 

next guy comes in from the other company, and he says, 

okay, when it comes up I'll think of your product -- are 

those two sales or no sale? 

MR. CLEMENT: I think they're probably two 

sales, Your Honor. But, you know, it's the same 

thing -- imagine somebody who's, you know, just sitting 

in their house, and they get an encyclopedia 

salesperson. And they say, you know, I'll -- maybe I'll 

buy that. That looks good, I'll buy it. And they say, 

but you know, maybe the State law has a law that says 

you've got to wait 24 hours before you put the order in, 

in the computer. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a firmer 

commitment when they say I'll buy it. The physician is 

just saying I'll think of your product when it -- when 

the need comes up. 

MR. CLEMENT: But -- well, if -- I mean, 

what I was suggesting is maybe you're talking about a 

State that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like 

that. So, it's a commitment that, sure, I'm going to 

enter the order in 24 hours. Well, maybe another

encyclopedia salesmen comes in, in 12 hours, and he 

gives another commitment. One of the two people he's 

going to put the order in, and one of the two people 

will certainly have finally had a sale. I think, 

again --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But don't you think that the 

way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it 

works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer 

provides information, the doctor says that's very 

interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to 

think about it. Then the doctor reads some medical 

journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and 

talks to other doctors about the product. 

I mean, that's what you would hope that a 

doctor would do before a doctor decided I'm going to 

start prescribing this medicine. And the detail work is 

a part of that, but so are many other things before the 

doctor actually decides to do something. 

MR. CLEMENT: Sure, Justice Kagan. But you 

don't want to look at this like it's an isolated, 

one-time, you know, sort of interaction. I mean, one of 

the things that -- that happens in this industry, like 

other sales industry, is there are multiple trips. The 

detailer goes there maybe the first time and lays the 

ground work. Then maybe the doctor reads some other

information. Then maybe on the final visit, after all 

that information is there, finally the detailer gets the 

commitment to prescribe to appropriate patients. 

I think one way to think about the absurdity 

of making the difference turn on the prescription is to 

compare this salesperson to another salesperson of 

medical devices who goes in, but these are medical 

supplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office. 

Now, they're both hired for their sales experience. 

They both get sales training. They both have a sales 

territory. They're sitting in the same doctor's waiting 

room, waiting for the same doctor; they have samples in 

their bags, and they both get a commitment from the 

doctor. 

Now, what sense does it make as a matter of 

the FLSA and its labor policies to say one of those 

people is exempt and the other one is not exempt, 

because for perfectly sensible reasons, we say that one 

of those products is a prescription where the doctor 

writes the order and then with that order, the end user, 

the ultimate end user, can make the purchase at the 

pharmacy, whereas the other one --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, I wanted to 

ask you about section 501 of the regulations, which --

and was mentioned in the -- in the Government's 

presentation. It says -- requires that the employee be 

engaged in (i) making sales within the meaning of 3(k); 

or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or 

for the use of facilities. 

What authorization is there for the agency 

to invent number (ii)? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, you 

heard the Government's explanation; and, as you suggest, 

if the Government's explanation is right, then this 

shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to 

3 -- to the 3(k) definition. I think, even though -- at 

the 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that 

definition, it has every hallmark of being broad and 

functional and flexible. 

I would want to make one very important 

point, though, about the ultimate question here, because 

ultimately the decision whether to go one way or another 

on this issue has remarkable significance for 

retroactive imposition of liability. 

We all know that retroactive rulemaking is 

disfavored. Well, think about the consequences here. 

You have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of 

effective time and a half, because of the way that the 

statute works. It has time and a half plus liquidated

damages. You are talking about people who are very well 

paid, close to six figures. So, unlike the classic 

worker who you might think is covered by the FLSA, who 

is a relatively low hourly worker, the amounts of 

damages here are quite significant. 

Of course, the effort to try to reconstruct 

these people's hours, given that they were told they 

were exempt and they were outside the office, trying to 

reconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked 

is going to be a crapshoot at best. So, if you think 

about all of that, and then you think about, as 

Justice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is 

to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let's pursue this for a 

second. 

MR. CLEMENT: Sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because I'd like to go back 

to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me 

speaking. I don't know how anybody else feels. If this 

had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance. I 

would have said look at the statute; it says the 

Secretary defines it. You'd say, well, can you define 

it in a brief? Yes, you have to be careful of briefs, 

but, yes. And that's the end of the case. It's not a 

question for judges; it's a question for administrators.

All right. But now it's difficult for me 

because of the passage of 75 years. And we can blame it 

in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary. 

There is blame to go around. So, the question is, what 

do I do as a judge? 

And partly my instinct is get somebody to 

decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of 

Labor, because this is a hard question. And that's 

where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he 

says all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what 

case do we cite? 

And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer. 

I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them 

with care. And then I have the statute here, which 

talks about the Secretary doing the definition of 

"outside salesman," and I have lots of rules and 

regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in 

my opinion. So, you tell me what to say. 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- may I answer? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly. 

MR. CLEMENT: I would start by citing -- I 

know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court 

opinions, but I'd start by citing Judge Posner's opinion 

in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit -- they're a very 

distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one

other judge. The three of them considered this 

question -- Judge Sykes. I'm sorry; it slipped my mind. 

A very distinguished judge. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: The -- it's -- the point being 

that he said along these lines that the 70 years of 

history makes a significant difference. And here's the 

thing. Just like you expect an agency to confront a 

change in position, you'd at least expect an agency to 

confront the retroactive consequences and in that sense 

address them and make sense of it. 

And I would just simply say this, which is 

if you had a rulemaking, you could bring in all of the 

affected parties, including the current sales 

representatives, who are not the ones bringing these 

lawsuits, whose jobs are going to be changed, and you 

could make a comprehensive view, as opposed to just 

getting one side of an ongoing litigation and then 

making a decision about an amicus brief. 

Thank you.

it.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

Three quick points. First, if you read the 

transcript, you will see that my friend says that the 

nature of this job has changed. And that is an 

essential part of understanding this case. And there is 

an entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on 

behalf of pharmaceutical representatives, which explains 

how very much the requirements of pharmaceutical 

detailers and the restrictions on them have changed 

dramatically over the last couple of decades in 

particular. And that's why the continued references to 

70 years are wrong. 

The other important point about the FLSA in 

particular is that there is a statute on this issue, and 

it says that an employer can request guidance from the 

agency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has 

no defense. Its job is to ask for guidance. And there 

are 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover 

hundreds of different categories of employees. And if 

the rule you are going to announce -- because Mr. 

Clement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any 

precedent. If the rule you are going to now announce is

that there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of 

those, it's going to be an administrative nightmare. 

Two quick further points. The Department of 

Labor's position is that there has to be an actual 

commitment, not a precatory commitment. And Mr. Clement 

says, well, that's contrary to the definition of "sale" 

in 3(k). Please read the definition again, and if you 

find something in there, something that is not a 

commitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a 

commitment that is even a consignment; it can be a 

traditional sale. Every one of those things is 

commitment. It is impossible to find in the definition 

of "commitment" a rule that says -- excuse me, in the 

definition of "sale" --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where do they say that 

that's -- that that's their test? Where does the 

Department of Labor say that's their test, that it has 

to be a commitment? I thought what they said in their 

brief was there has to be a transfer of title. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are two different 

parts to it. One is that they -- as explained by Mr. 

Stewart, their view of transfer of title, but the Weiss 

Report says repeatedly that there has to be a commitment 

to buy. That is --

you say, yes, yes, it's both. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: You have to agree --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Pick one. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: You have to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the transfer of title 

or a commitment? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is the agreement to 

transfer title. There are two parts to it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. Okay. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But there has to be the 

agreement, a firm agreement. It's repeated in the 2004 

preamble to the regulations as well. 

Now, the last critical point I want to make 

is that Mr. Clement says there are commissions on sales 

in the sales territory. And what he is not talking 

about is any commitment by a physician. When you go 

look at the transcript and he talks about sales in the 

sales territory, he is talking about the sales by the 

pharmacy. That's where the sale occurs in this 

industry. It's to the wholesaler and to the pharmacy 

and to the customer. 

He is not talking about a sale in the sense 

of getting a commitment to have --

for the Petitioners: "Sales volume is directly and 

exclusively driven by the number of prescriptions 

written by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to 

encourage such prescriptions." 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That -- Mr. Justice Kennedy, 

I don't believe that you can fairly describe that as a 

finding of fact. That is the judge -- his view of the 

summary judgment record. It is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a finding of logic, 

for Pete's sake. These are prescriptions. You can only 

get a prescription from a doctor. Obviously, the number 

of prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of 

prescriptions given by doctors. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two -- two things about 

that. First is that a detailer doesn't get a commitment 

to a prescription. And then in addition, it's clear 

that there are numerous influences on what a doctor 

does. There's all the advertising --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different point. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is an important point. 

It is a different point, but it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not the point you were 

making. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the point 

that I will make at bottom is that you have to have a

contradicts that.
