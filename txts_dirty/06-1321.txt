 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case No. 06-1321, Gomez-Perez v. Potter.

 Mr. Guerra.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The government claims in this case that 

Congress decided to treat retaliation against Federal 

workers who complain of age discrimination differently 

than every other species of retaliatory conduct, that 

for age-based retaliation alone Congress created a 

four-part patchwork scheme in which a small cadre of 

Federal employees have a full judicial remedy, but tens 

of thousands of others who suffer retaliatory conduct 

have absolutely no remedies at all.

 This scheme is inconsistent with over three 

decades of administrative interpretations by the 

agencies charged with administering and enforcing the 

statute and it is flatly inconsistent, most importantly, 

with the plain language and historical origins of the 

statute itself. By its plain terms, Section 633a(a) 

bars retaliation against covered workers who have

complained that have they suffered age discrimination. 

Such retaliation is directed at persons over --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. By its plain 

terms?

 MR. GUERRA: Yes, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Read it to me, would you?

 MR. GUERRA: The provision is: "All 

personnel actions shall be made" -- "affecting covered 

employees shall be made free from any discrimination 

based on age."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is retaliation 

discrimination based on age? I can see your argument 

that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain 

language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary. The 

plain language doesn't cover it.

 MR. GUERRA: With respect, Justice Scalia, I 

submit it does cover it for at least three reasons. 

First of all discrimination -- retaliatory conduct aimed 

at a 40-year-old or someone over age 40 because he or 

she is asserting rights she possesses by virtue of being 

age 40 or older is discrimination based on age.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's not. I 

mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody 

who complains about anything and the fact that a worker 

is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he

is being fired because of age.

 MR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in 

this case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and 

ultimately prove that she was -- she suffered adverse 

personnel actions because she complained of age 

discrimination. It may be that in some, that in a 

certain case the employer could demonstrate that in fact 

the retaliatory conduct was not triggered by the nature 

of the complaint, and in fact there have been Title VII 

cases where the courts have found that it was the manner 

in which a complaint was lodged, that there was, that 

there was false statements or it was too inflammatory, 

and so the employer prevailed.

 But if -- the issue here is whether, if 

Ms. Gomez can prove ultimately that the retaliatory 

conduct was a function of the fact that as a 40-year-old 

she was asserting her rights to be free from age 

discrimination, we submit that is covered by the plain 

language of the statute. And that is confirmed by this 

court's interpretation of Title IX in the Jackson case 

because there the Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course the 

statute that covers age discrimination in the private 

sector does have an express provision addressing 

retaliation. The one that governs Federal employees

does not, and that's the government's main argument, 

that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not 

there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply 

one. What's your answer to that?

 MR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, three 

responses to that. First of you, as this Court 

explained in Jackson itself, it's improper to narrow the 

scope of a stand-alone general discrimination ban that 

does not identify any discriminatory practices based on 

a comparison with an enumeration ban that sets forth a 

detailed series of prohibitions. And that's precisely 

the comparison that the Court rejected in Jackson and 

the government is asking the court to draw here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But in Jackson it was in a 

different statute and here it's in the same statute. 

Surely that makes a big difference.

 MR. GUERRA: It doesn't in this case, 

Justice Scalia, for two reasons. First of all, 

subsection (f) of section 633a effectively deems the 

private sector and the Federal sector provisions of the 

Age Act to be the functional equivalents of two separate 

statutes. So I think that distinction is refuted by 

that provision. But more fundamentally, the 

government's argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not familiar with that

provision. What does that provision say?

 MR. GUERRA: That is the provision that the 

government cites in its brief and it provides that: 

"Any personnel action of any department, agency, or 

other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this 

section shall not be subject to or affected by any 

provision of this chapter other than the provisions of 

Section 631b of this title." And the government's 

position is that that provision makes these statutory 

schemes utterly distinct from one another.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. I mean, they're 

all in the same, in the same statute, and what that 

provision says is that just because we give certain 

relief in, in the portion applicable to private 

discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief 

in the section applicable to government discrimination, 

where it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be 

explicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although 

it's explicitly included for private discrimination. I 

think that's the only sensible way to read that 

provision. It surely doesn't make two statutes out of, 

out of one. It is simply one statute.

 MR. GUERRA: Justice Scalia, if I may, two 

points. One is it's clear that the scope of the 

language of 633a(a) is broader in its own right than

623a, which is the -- or 623a and 623b operate in 

conjunction with each other. So we know that the 

stand-alone prohibition in the Federal sector side is 

intended to be broader than the -- the discrimination 

ban of 623(a). So it's not anomalous at all to conclude 

that because it sweeps more broadly and because it's not 

limited by any other provision that operates in 

conjunction with it, that there's no basis for drawing a 

negative inference.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would Congress 

have taken this drafting approach? The private sector 

provisions were already in existence when it made the 

statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a 

specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the 

private sector. If Congress wanted to carry that over 

to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either 

copied that or incorporated it? And they did neither, 

and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the 

private sector provisions are not incorporated unless 

they're specifically noted. And this isn't one of the 

ones that's noted.

 MR. GUERRA: Justice Alito, if I could --

the second point I was going to address to Justice 

Scalia I think answers this, this point. Congress did 

the exact same thing in Title VII two years earlier. It

could have added Federal employers to the definition of 

employer and subjected them to the private sector regime 

there, but instead it created a stand-alone prohibition. 

If you take the government's logic in this case and 

apply it to Title VII, it would lead to the conclusion 

that the Federal sector ban in Title VII, which is 

717(a), does not bar retaliation either, and yet we know 

that's not true. Because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? This Court hasn't 

so held. We haven't had that issue before us.

 MR. GUERRA: You -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. It's not true because of this Court's holdings, 

but it's true because of the structure of the statute, 

the consistent interpretations of the lower courts and 

the administrative agency. The structure of the statute 

is, in 717(a), the language, the prohibition there is 

virtually identical to the prohibition here except it 

proscribes race discrimination, et cetera, instead of 

age discrimination.

 Then, in the remedy section Congress 

explicitly made a remedy for retaliation available for 

violations of 717(a)'s substantive norm. The only 

reason to do that was because Congress understood that 

substantive norm to prohibit retaliation. Congress then 

copied that very same language into 633a(a), thereby

giving it the same breadth.

 And so the negative inference theory the 

government puts forward with respect to Title VII fails 

on that statute because of the incorporation of the 

remedies, we know that that prohibition bars 

retaliation. And because the norm at issue here was 

copied from that Federal sector prohibition in Title 

VII, the same reasoning dictates that the argument fail 

here as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Federal 

employee, though, has all of the remedies under the 

Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment 

practice. Those remedies are elaborately reticulated 

and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add 

complication. In other words, despite all the remedies 

under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in 

other cases you go here, and you get different types of 

review depending on the facts, all of that would be 

wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the 

age discrimination statute.

 MR. GUERRA: Three points, Mr. Chief 

Justice: First of all, everything you just said would 

be equally true of discrimination under Title VII, and 

yet the government acknowledges that retaliatory conduct 

for race discrimination claims, sex discrimination

claims, can all be brought directly in court, 

notwithstanding the existence of the CSRA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the government --

well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind 

of qualified that in their brief. The brief says that 

the case -- this case presents no occasion to consider 

whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against 

Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private 

sector retaliation ban. So they haven't made a 

concession.

 MR. GUERRA: Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, I 

read them to be conceding for purposes of this case and 

the analysis of this case, and if they're willing to 

acknowledge, at least for purposes of this case, that 

all these other retaliatory claims can be brought 

outside of the CSRA regime, it makes no sense, I submit, 

to single out retaliation based on age discrimination 

claims. And, in fact, Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're saying even 

if, even if that were the case, they would still urge 

the Court to come out the way they do. I don't think 

they're conceding that that's the case.

 MR. GUERRA: But, Justice Scalia, even if --

if -- even if taken on the "even if" premise, you still 

are in the situation where you have an irrational

distinction by saying the CSRA is the exclusive remedy 

for retaliation for age complaints and yet not for 

retaliation under Title VII.

 Also, Mr. Chief Justice, the CSRA itself 

explicitly carves out claims under the ADEA and Title 

VII. So, Congress did not view it as the exclusive --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not retaliation 

claims. In other words, although the direct claims, as 

you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation 

claim fits under the employment practices provisions of 

the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation. In 

other words, you took personnel action against me for an 

impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the 

various civil service remedies.

 MR. GUERRA: That's -- that's correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice. And of course, the CSRA covers 

retaliation that has nothing to do with complaints of 

employment discrimination as well. So it would not be 

rendered a dead letter by recognizing our position.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Does it cover your client?

 MR. GUERRA: I don't believe it would, 

Justice Souter, because she did not suffer an adverse 

action. No, and in fact putting that aside --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: She could complain; it's 

just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.

MR. GUERRA: Well, more fundamentally, 

Justice Ginsburg, she's not covered at all by the CSRA. 

And that was the third point I wanted to make. The CSRA 

excludes thousands of employees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it does that for 

a reason.  We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit 

and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these 

problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types 

of claims of employees, they do it for a reason. In 

other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them 

or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the 

remedies that they've provided don't apply in a 

particular case. And to say that those people who are 

excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for 

employment practices seems to me to undermine that --

that judgment.

 MR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, with 

respect, the problem with the government's reliance on 

the statute is that it doesn't -- on their view, White 

House employees and congressional employees have a full 

judicial remedy for retaliation suffered for raising age 

discrimination complaints. And our argument is it makes 

no sense to permit that one band of employees, many 

high-level policy employee -- policymakers, to bring 

retaliation claims in Federal court, while excluding

Postal Service workers who have only collective 

bargaining rights and tens of thousands of other 

employees for --

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is that it 

doesn't exclude them, that they have all these 

collective bargaining rights; they have the civil 

service rights; they can go and bring their same claim 

with other remedies. You could make the opposite claim: 

Why should they have two rights? Everybody else has 

one. I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is 

underlying this.

 Then when you go to Title VII -- and this I 

don't understand fully. Look at Title VII and Title VII 

in 16(e) has a basic ban. Is that right?

 MR. GUERRA: That's correct, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And then, in 16(d) it says 

certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits 

against the Federal Government. Then it incorporates 

some provisions. And it says that you get that certain 

relief against the Federal Government where there is 

discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, 

or national origin. Then it says "or in violation of 

3(a)." And then 3(a) refers to retaliation.

 So it looks like Title VII does give you a 

remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation. And it's rather

specific, and that suggests that those other words don't 

pick up retaliation. It's rather that specific thing. 

Now, what have I missed?

 MR. GUERRA: Justice Breyer, the -- you are 

right to focus on these remedies, but the remedies 

themselves are not incorporated as substantive bans. 

They are simply remedies, and our point is by making a 

retaliation remedy available for a violation of the ban 

that you identified in subsection 717(a), Congress 

necessarily understood that substantive ban, 717(a), to 

prohibit retaliation. Otherwise there would be no 

reason to provide a remedy for retaliation as one of the 

remedies for a violation of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you could say that, 

but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII 

Congress has some words, and these words give you a 

specific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's 

retaliating against you because you went and complained 

about race or something, just read those words; you can 

bring a lawsuit, right? Am I right about that?

 MR. GUERRA: I don't think so --

JUSTICE BREYER: No?

 MR. GUERRA: -- Justice Breyer. You can 

bring a lawsuit under section --

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GUERRA: I'd like to think I -- I can 

illuminate the -- the language that authorizes Federal 

employees to bring suits for violations of Title VII 

says that if they are aggrieved by final disposition of 

the complaint, they may bring a civil action under Title 

VII, and aggrieved -- they can bring complaints for 

violations of subsection (a), which like subsection (a)

in our statute says "all personnel actions affecting 

employees or applicants for employment shall be made 

free from any discrimination based on race, color, 

religion," et cetera.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Or in violation of --

MR. GUERRA: No, it does not say that, 

Justice Breyer. The prohibition of subsection (a) of 

717a in substantive terms is identical, except it 

specifies a different protected status. So this is a 

ban on discrimination based on race, color, religion, 

and you are authorized to bring a suit if you are 

aggrieved by a violation of that provision, and one of 

the remedies that's made available is a remedy that's 

available for violations of the private sector provision 

on retaliation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that so clear, 

because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it 

is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall 

govern civil actions brought hereunder. And if there is 

no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't 

be applicable.

 MR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, the language 

"as applicable" I submit has to be referring to whether 

the case itself would implicate the need for that 

remedy. In other words, it would not be applicable to

have a reinstatement remedy in a case where there was no 

discharge.

 But the reading that you have suggested 

assumes that Congress didn't know what it was -- the 

scope of the prohibition it enacted in Section 717(a) 

and was effectively saying: Here are some remedies; we 

don't know whether they apply or not, but if they do, go 

ahead and use them.

 And I submit that is an improper assumption 

about congressional understanding of its own 

legislation. The proper assumption is that Congress 

understood 717(a) to bar retaliation. That's why it 

provided a retaliation remedy, and that assumption is 

buttressed by the fact that, as this Court explained in 

the Brown v. GSA case, Congress adopted Title VII 

precisely because it found that fear of reprisal had 

made the old scheme ineffective.

 So it makes perfect sense that it would want 

to prohibit retaliation under Title VII in the Federal 

sector because reprisals had rendered the old 

protections useless.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, could you proceed 

with that? That is, a very simple way of thinking of

whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put 

some in. When State officials discriminate, say, on the 

basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's. Maybe 

they protect them in some States; maybe they don't 

protect them in others. We better put some in. When 

Federal Government officials discriminate against on the 

basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected.

 But we have a whole system here to protect 

them. And so let's just use that system and treat all 

whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter. 

We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's 

here.

 Now, the answer to that is what?

 MR. GUERRA: That is the very system that 

Congress had deemed ineffective to prevent retaliation 

for the very claims you're talking about in -- and 

that's why it chose to adopt the amendments to Title VII 

in 1972. That's what the Brown case canvasses; and, in 

fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's sort of 

begging the question. I mean, you're saying it's not 

true because our interpretation of Title VII is true. 

But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title 

VII. That is, it makes more sense to say when it's 

retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed

remedies within the agency.

 I mean, it doesn't answer the point that 

Justice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret 

Title VII the way we want to interpret it. His point 

is: One reason to interpret it the way you do want to 

interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of 

the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through 

the agency mechanism, rather than in court.

 MR. GUERRA: Justice Scalia, I apologize if 

I wasn't clear in my response, but what I'm saying is 

that in the Brown case this Court looked at the 

legislative history of Title VII -- excuse me -- yes, in 

1972 and 1977 -- and said that the reason Congress 

adopted these, this new prohibition, was because the 

very scheme that Justice Breyer is suggesting would have 

been a fix for whistle blowing was ineffective. That --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then it's ineffective here.

 MR. GUERRA: And it is ineffective here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if it's ineffective 

here and Congress has made it clear that the only way to 

cure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provision 

and you don't have a separate provision, you're out.

 MR. GUERRA: That's correct. And the 

ineffectiveness here is because of the extraordinarily 

limited nature of the types of conduct that would

trigger any rights that the employee could control under 

the CSRA. Retaliation rarely takes the form of a 

removal from position or a suspension of more than 14 

days. The most typical things are poor performance 

evaluations, what we have in this case, allegations of 

groundless charges of misconduct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you qualified 

your answer by saying that the employee can control, was 

that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?

 MR. GUERRA: Well, I was talking about 

actually the -- the -- you can complain about 

non-adverse actions under the CSRA, but all you can do 

is ask the Office of Special Counsel to investigate. 

And then you have no right to compel any further action 

at any step of the process. So if the counsel decides 

not to investigate, that's the end of the matter. If 

they do and the agency refuses to take their advice, 

that's the end of the matter. There's no judicial 

remedy for the vast majority of retaliatory actions that 

a Federal employee could suffer under the CSRA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about review 

under -- by the Merit Systems Protection Board?

 MR. GUERRA: That is the remedy under the 

CSRA, Mr. Chief Justice.

talking about the Office of Special Counsel --

MR. GUERRA: If the Office of Special 

Counsel doesn't pursue the case -- and the statistics in 

the NTEU brief suggest that it rarely -- out of 

thousands and thousands of complaints, it pursued only 

in a small handful. You have no right as the employee 

to do anything, to go to the MSPB or to any Federal 

court, if they decide not to pursue that claim. And so 

that is -- and, again, both because Title VII, I submit, 

clearly based on the remedial structure, would allow 

employees to bring all types of retaliation claims 

unrelated to age discrimination complaints in Federal 

court, it doesn't make sense for Congress to have 

relegated older workers who suffer age discrimination to 

this one scheme, especially because it excludes --

Petitioner herself has no rights under the CSRA.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Guerra, can you help 

me on a provision of the statute that I'm a little 

puzzled about? Am I correct in believing that Section 

2000e-16, which is the provision under Title -- 42 

U.S.C. -- I'm using the code number -- that that is the 

provision that makes the Federal Government liable for 

retaliation based on sex and race?

 MR. GUERRA: That is.

that is necessary for there to be a remedy against the 

Federal Government?

 MR. GUERRA: For retaliation based on race 

and sex?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Under Title VII.

 MR. GUERRA: No. That's the remedy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then -- your argument, if 

I understand it, is that precisely the same language 

that's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a.

 MR. GUERRA: 633a.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: 633a.

 MR. GUERRA: Yes, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And, therefore, the two 

should be treated alike?

 MR. GUERRA: Precisely. That is the -- that 

is our -- one of our central arguments. Of course, we 

also realize --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, that the 

language "shall be made free from any discrimination 

based on race, color, or religion," and so forth, covers 

retaliation. And when you use the same language based 

on age it also would cover retaliation.

 MR. GUERRA: Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

those two provisions being exactly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It isn't that simple 

because the government hasn't conceded that, with 

respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for 

retaliation. If the Government -- we'll ask them --

will make that concession, then the argument is very 

strong. The words are identical.

 MR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, even if, as I 

anticipate, they will not make that concession, the fact 

of the matter is that the remedial structure of Title 

VII, the Federal sector provision, confirms that the 

substantive ban that Justice Stevens read necessarily 

covers retaliation. Otherwise, Congress wouldn't have 

made a retaliation remedy available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, another reason 

it's not that simple is that under the Age 

Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that 

specifically provides for retaliation. And that is 

noticeably absent from the Federal remedy. And I 

thought that was the strongest argument on the 

government's side.

 MR. GUERRA: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

is precisely the same -- the same is precisely true of 

Title VII. Section 704a of Title VII is the analog to 

623(b) in our case.

a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private 

anti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this 

case.

 MR. GUERRA: That is true, but our position 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that makes it not 

precisely the same situation.

 MR. GUERRA: Not precisely the same, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court's -- in that case, for 

example, this court said when you copy language verbatim 

into another statute, there must be some compelling 

evidence that you've intended to have given it a 

different meaning.

 If you look at the remedy section of Section 

633a(c), all you see there is not some dramatic 

difference, but what Congress did was it replicated the 

civil action provisions of the private sector in the 

Federal sector provision. So it's not as though there's 

some stark evidence that Congress intended to have a 

drastically different regime. It simply didn't --

rather than incorporate subsection (c) of the private 

section, 626c, it simply replicated it.

 I would like to reserve the balance of my 

time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Age Discrimination and Employment Act 

does not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federal 

sector context and it should not be read to impliedly 

prohibits such conduct either.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not, given the 

Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general 

ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to 

include retaliation for complaining about 

discrimination?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, the Court did 

so very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's cases 

interpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX 

broadly. And it specifically distinguished statutes 

like Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act which 

delineate different types of discrimination.

 In fact, on page 175 of the Court's decision 

in Jackson, the Court said because Congress did not list 

any specific discriminatory practices when it wrote 

Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does 

not tell us anything. And then it pointed to the fact

that Title VII had delineated certain types of 

practices.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be -- would it be 

unkind to say that the government's position seems to be 

that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on 

retaliation except when the government is being sued? 

In Jackson the government argued that discrimination on 

the basis of sex included retaliation. Tomorrow the 

government is going to argue that the prohibition of 

discrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation. 

And yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me 

exactly the opposite position.

 MR. GARRE: I think that would be unfair, 

Justice Alito. The government's position is that 

statutory context matters. It made that clear in 

footnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court. It's 

made it clear in this case.

 In this case, there are several indicia of 

statutory intent that are lacking where you have a 

general prohibition in the context of the inferred right 

that has -- that this Court has treated differently, as 

it did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the 

CBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow.

 In the Age Discrimination Act you have 

separate provisions of the Act which explicitly

delineate different types of discrimination, including 

retaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector 

prohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at 

a time where it decided to treat State employers like 

Federal employers, specifically put the State employers 

in the definition of employer for the Federal -- for the 

private sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act, 

and it created a stand-alone provision for Federal 

employers.

 And then it went even further. It 

specifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the 

Federal sector provision, that the Federal sector 

provision should be unaffected by the private sector 

provision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts 

should not be reading into the Federal sector provision 

the additional protections or other provisions in the 

private sector provisions. And this Court recognized 

the significance of that construction, that statutory 

scheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case.

 In that case, the Court considered whether 

Federal employees were entitled to a right to a jury 

trial in an action for discrimination under the Federal 

sector prohibition. Private sector employees were 

entitled to that. And so the plaintiffs in that case 

made an argument very much similar to the argument made

by Petitioners in this case: Well, the private sector 

provisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no 

sense not to have a jury trial --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- Mr. Garre, 

that's traditionally when you're suing the government, 

you don't get a jury. And so that's on one side.

 Here, as I think you would recognize, 

retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination 

claims. A person who is discriminated against will 

quite commonly say: I was not promoted because that was 

discrimination and then because I complained about it 

all these bad things happened to me. It's very common 

that those two go together.

 And yet, without any indication that 

Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one 

forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue 

retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress 

had in mind, it would be rather strange.

 MR. GARRE: Well, let me try to answer that 

question, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one 

final point on Lehman and the statutory construction in 

that case. The Court specifically said on page 162 of 

its decision that because Congress demonstrated that it 

knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial 

when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very

legislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly 

failed to do so, and it said that that was the 

conclusive point of statutory construction in that case. 

So we do think the Lehman case is very on point here.

 With respect to the general notion that it's 

uncommon to provide -- not to provide an 

anti-retaliation right when you do have an underlying 

anti-discrimination prohibition, certainly we would 

agree with you that it is uncommon, but we don't think 

that it is absurd. It's certainly not absurd where 

Congress was aware that there was a separate set of 

protections available for Federal workers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I recognize 

it's not absurd. But if there is ambiguity and one 

interpretation is, well, that in every other context 

retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would 

Congress leave out this one category of persons, 

especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme 

Court says discrimination includes retaliation?

 MR. GARRE: Well, we know that Congress in 

the Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice 

noted, we know that it didn't think that additional 

anti-retaliation protections were necessary for some 

Federal employees. So the fact that Congress wouldn't 

have a separate anti-retaliation -- anti-retaliation

right in some situation in itself is not unprecedented.

 We do think that the statute has several 

indicia that make clear that Congress did not intend to 

provide an anti-retaliation right here. Not only the 

contrast between the private sector and Federal sector 

provisions, but look at what Congress expressed in 

section 633a. In at least three respects this is 

materially unlike the typical anti-retaliation right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can you say what the 

government's position is on Title VII, whether there is 

a retaliation remedy against the Federal Government?

 MR. GARRE: As we make clear in our brief, 

we have not conceded that, Justice Alito. We don't 

think it's necessary for the courts to decide that in 

this case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the government's 

position? What does, for example, EEOC or whoever 

passes on these complaints, what is the government's 

position in practice with respect to a Federal employee 

who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of 

my race and then they retaliated against me for 

complaining?

 MR. GARRE: I think in practice, Your Honor, 

we have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal 

courts that have found that Title VII does incorporate

an anti-retaliation right. But there are at least --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has any Federal court 

found otherwise?

 MR. GARRE: I'm not aware of a circuit court 

that has gone the other way on Title VII. Certainly the 

Age Discrimination Act is different. The First Circuit 

in this case explicitly recognized that the textual 

differences between Title VII and the Age Act call for a 

different result. And there are at least two 

differences that we do think call for a different result 

under the Age Act.

 The first is the fact that, whereas Title 

VII expressly incorporates the private sector provisions 

of the Act and by reference the anti-retaliation 

provision of the Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you agree -- then you 

agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words 

"as applicable"?

 MR. GARRE: Well, this Court actually has 

interpreted that phrase, "as applicable," in a case 

called Chandler v. Radabush. It wasn't cited in the 

brief, but it is directly responsive to that question. 

And the cite there is 425 U.S. 840. And in that case 

the Court said that the "as applicable" language just 

means that there are certain provisions of the private

sector remedies that are inherently incompatible in the 

Federal sector context. And it pointed to the 

provisions in the private sector part of Title VII that 

allowed EEOC or the attorney general to intervene in the 

private action and take over the suit.

 So the "as applicable" doesn't undermine the 

express incorporation of private sector remedies and 

anti-retaliation. And that's a critical difference 

between Title VII and the Age Act. The Age Act not only 

does not include that express incorporation, it goes in 

just the opposite direction, and Congress went out of 

its way to say don't import the private sector 

provisions -- it did that in section 633a(f) -- don't 

incorporate those provisions, and that's what this Court 

recognized.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know what Congress 

had in mind when it said don't incorporate private 

sector?

 MR. GARRE: Well, this Court in the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There must be an 

explanation for that section.

 MR. GARRE: I don't think there is any 

legislative history on point. The Petitioners argue 

that it meant don't incorporate the more restrictive 

features. But that argument is directly contradicted by

this Court's decision in Lehman, where it pointed to 

section, subsection (f) of that provision as a reason to 

not import in the jury trial right that was not 

recognized for private sector employees.

 The other way --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 

your friend that this employee has no remedy under the 

Civil Service Reform Act?

 MR. GARRE: Yes. She is a 

nonpreference-eligible employee of the Postal Service. 

That means that she has to pursue her remedies under the 

collective bargaining arrangement, which gives her a 

remedy to complain about reprisal. And it means that 

the union representative would present that grievance on 

her behalf. But it also means that if for some reason 

she felt that her right of -- her obligation of fair 

representation was not carried through, she could go to 

court and complain about that.

 This Court in a case called Bowen v. United 

States Postal Service recognized that employees who 

don't get fair representation can go into court and 

complain about that. So she is protected --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What could she get --

what could she get by way of remedy? And you recognize 

that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service

Act, but does have collective bargaining rights. 

Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.

 MR. GARRE: I believe the remedies are 

largely co-extensive in that the principal remedy that 

you would get under the Age Act, under the Civil Service 

Reform Act and I believe under the collective bargaining 

agreements, although I frankly am not certain about 

that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --

MR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective 

action, Justice Ginsburg. There is no right -- unlike 

Title VII, there is no right to compensatory damages 

under the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or 

emotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act 

is quite different. What you typically get -- you get 

this under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the 

Age Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front 

pay and corrective action to -- to address the 

discrimination.

 The other way in which the Age Act, section 

663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is 

actually another thing that makes it inherently 

incompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that 

the prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector 

provision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I 

mean, if you have the private -- the private sector 

remedy is not so limited, right?

 MR. GARRE: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we imply or 

incorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedy 

an anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be in 

the same scope as the private anti -- the private 

anti-retaliation provision.

 MR. GARRE: Well, then this Court would be 

directly disregarding the express intent in section 

663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants of 

employees -- for employment who are at least 40 years of 

age. And further, in section 633 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Garre isn't the 

most that argument gets you that the only individuals 

who could complain against retaliation are those over 

40? It doesn't get you out -- it doesn't get you where 

you want to go. It's not retaliation right at all.

 MR. GARRE: I think that's right, but if 

we're going to talk about anomalies then we have to 

recognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation 

protection right that only protects people within the

protected class with respect to discrimination.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it any more 

anomalous than the fact that the only protection of the 

age protection is simply for people over 40? In other 

words, Congress didn't care whether there are employers 

in the world who don't like youthful people.

 MR. GARRE: If --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They're just worried about 

the age. So if it's an anomaly it's an anomaly across 

the board in the statute.

 MR. GARRE: I think it's a great deal more 

anomalous, with respect, Justice Souter. With both 

anti-retaliation provisions, whistleblower provisions, 

all the provisions that the government is aware of, 

including all the ones cited in Petitioners in its 

brief, protect all employees, all --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the same anomaly 

applies to the private sector, because section 631a 

applies to the private sector and 631b to the public 

sector.

 MR. GARRE: Well, that's not the way the 

courts have interpreted it, Justice --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The language is the same. 

They both are limited to prohibitions to people who are 

over 40.

MR. GARRE: What the courts have focused on 

is the "any employee" language of section 623d of the 

private sector provisions. And that's the way --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's no reason why 

that trumps -- any more reason why that trumps 631a than 

631b.

 MR. GARRE: And that's the longstanding 

interpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's 

been any doubt in the courts to date that under the 

private sector provision you can bring claims for 

retaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's 

the way it is under Title VII.

 We do think that it would be anomalous to 

say that employees who complain about age discrimination 

or who testify about age discrimination in a case are 

not entitled to protection if there is an 

anti-retaliation right, and if they are under the age of 

40; and there is at least two other respects in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it says that 

-- the protection doesn't apply. The word is 

prohibition -- but that --

MR. GARRE: Well, I think that that's right. 

But it's odd to say that this prohibition in 663a, which 

is clearly limited to people -- and I think by --

the problem doesn't arise in the private sector. The 

same explanation would apply to the public sector, if 

you choose the word prohibition as talking about these 

people who are protected by the --

MR. GARRE: That's not -- that's not the way 

the courts have interpreted for more than 20 years under 

the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I though we are talking 

here a prohibition against taking retaliatory action. 

Isn't that a prohibition?

 MR. GARRE: It is a prohibition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. GARRE: Right, and then that would be --

their argument is that 663a contains that prohibition, 

and so therefore it is limited by 631b.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't this an 

unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly 

retaliated against also has substantive 

anti-discrimination claims? And I gather -- I think it 

would take a particularly incompetent lawyer that 

couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying 

discrimination.

 MR. GARRE: I wouldn't disagree with that, 

Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not sure it's unusual to have 

retaliation claims piggyback on discrimination claims,

but I think you're right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it quite the contrary, 

Mr. Garre, that most -- if you did a statistical 

analysis of all the cases in which there was a 

retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a 

very high percentage of those are cases in which the 

person claiming retaliation is also the person who 

claimed the underlying discrimination?

 MR. GARRE: I wouldn't doubt that. I think 

in most cases you do have discrimination claims. I 

would say, though, that our research indicated that in 

the Age Discrimination Act context, at least the private 

sector context, only 14 percent of the claims involve --

cases involve retaliation claims, which is lower than 

other statutes.

 I wanted to point out two respects --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those, are those 

mostly witness cases?

 MR. GARRE: I don't know.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it's 

a witness saying I think so and so was fired because of 

his age.

 MR. GARRE: I don't know the answer to that 

question.

retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case, 

whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination 

Act? That is, I think I have a solid claim of 

discrimination, but maybe not. Nevertheless, once I 

filed that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who 

complain about sex discrimination, age discrimination. 

Therefore, I was retaliated against.

 In this case, isn't it the fact that the age 

discrimination claim, the claim of direct 

discrimination, was rejected and the question is but 

nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?

 MR. GARRE: She abandoned that claim at the 

summary judgment stage. That's my understanding, 

Justice Ginsburg, and of course we are here today 

because she is still pursuing her anti-retaliation 

claim; and certainly if there is an anti-retaliation 

right, we've agreed that you could pursue that 

independent of whether you complained about the 

underlying discrimination, but we do think that in at 

least three respects the prohibition in 663a is 

incompatible with an anti-retaliation right.

 One, we think it is limited only to the 

people within the protected class, people 40 years old. 

Two, it's limited to personnel actions, which means if 

you think about it in the context of this Court's

decision in the Burlington Northern case and the Oregon 

case, it's limited to workplace-related things that 

happened to you, and in Burlington Northern the Court 

specifically said, in holding that Title VII's 

anti-retaliatory provision was broader than that, was 

that it would defeat or at least limit the purpose of 

achieving the purpose of an anti-retaliation provision, 

to limit it workplace-related harm.

 And then third, of course, the 

discrimination that's expressed in section 633 is 

discrimination based on age, not discrimination based on 

conduct -- the conduct of complaining about or 

exercising your rights under Federal law. And that, 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That does bring up 

Justice Alito's point. I mean, tomorrow you're going to 

argue the exact opposite, right?

 MR. GARRE: With respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or else that 

distinction between conduct and status would require you 

to lose.

 MR. GARRE: I think if we have the conduct 

and status alone, then I think you're in the Jackson 

box. But where you've got the three indicia that you 

have here, which indicate that this provision is

incompatible with the typical anti-retaliatory 

provision, and you couple that with other indicia of 

statutory intent -- you have the competing schemes in 

the statute between private sector where Congress 

specifically delineated an anti-retaliation right, with 

the fact that it didn't delineate that right in the 

Federal sector scheme; the evolution of the statute --

where you have Congress specifically deciding not to put 

in Federal employers with private employers, as it did 

for States having the separate provision; and the 

distinctions between 663a and 623 of the Act -- 623 of 

the Act is the main private sector prohibition; 663a, 

the Federal sector provision, doesn't have all the other 

types of practices that are prohibited by 623.

 For example, pensions -- pensions are 

specifically addressed by 623. Congress didn't address 

that in 663a of this Act. It presumably understood that 

it either would address it through other means if there 

were other protections out there.

 Similarly we think with respect to 

retaliation. Congress knew how to express an 

anti-retaliation right. It did so forcibly in the 

private sector provisions of the Act; and that language 

which you find in 623d of the Act is simply completely 

absent in 663a of the Act.

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's plausible 

that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation 

in the Federal sector differently under the various 

Federal anti-discrimination statutes?

 MR. GARRE: I do think that, Justice Alito. 

There certainly are several differences between Title 

VII and the Age Act, and I'm not sure that Congress has 

explained each difference, but nevertheless they exist 

and this Court has recognized them, most recently in the 

Smith v. City of Jackson case, where the Court noted 

that because of textual differences between acts, there 

is less protection with disparate impacts of 

discrimination under the Age Act and Title VII.

 It's also the case that Congress has 

provided for compensatory damages in Title VII and not 

in the Age Act. It's also the case that there is a 

right, a Federal right to a jury trial in Federal sector 

actions in Title VII but not in the age act. And this 

Court has recognized, in Smith v. City of Jackson, that 

Congress has treated age discrimination as if it's 

qualitatively different and presumably accorded 

different protections taking that into account.

 So, the notion that this -- that the Age Act 

is different than Title VII or different than other 

Federal statutes in itself with respect to retaliation

unusual when you take into account that there is this 

back-stop protection that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, can I go back 

to the authority you're pointing out for a moment? Is 

it your reading of 631a, the private sector section, 

that says "the prohibitions in this chapter shall be 

limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of 

age," that it's correctly read as the prohibitions in 

this chapter, except those contained in 623a, shall be 

limited? That's the way you read it?

 MR. GARRE: Well, we -- no, Justice Stevens. 

I think that the textual argument that the courts have 

embraced with respect to 623d, the anti-retaliation 

provision, is because in 623d the Congress specifically 

said "with respect to any employees or applicants." It 

couldn't have meant with respect to only 40, only 

employees who are over 40. And, again, that's the way 

it's been interpreted consistently for decades under the 

statute. And we think, though, that giving effect to 

the language in 633a, you have express prohibition 

limited to people over 40 years old, and that it is 

anomaly, and we're not aware of any other situation that

the effect to the word "any" in this section is in 

effect to read in this exception.

 MR. GARRE: I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you --

MR.GARRE: I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the practical 

effect?

 MR. GARRE: I think that is the practical 

effect. This Court has recognized, in Bush -- in the 

Bush v. Lucas case, which dealt with the question of 

whether to infer a retaliation remedy for constitutional 

claims by a Federal employee -- that Federal employment 

practices present different questions. It's an area in 

which this Court uniquely defers to the policy judgments 

of Congress, recognizing that Congress has greater 

resources to police Federal employment, that there are a 

number of balances that have to be struck between 

government efficiency and the rights of Federal 

employees.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right now in thinking, 

just as a matter of practice, where there is 

retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race 

discrimination, Federal Government, that the person 

making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court? 

That's right?

MR. GARRE: That's true --

JUSTICE BREYER: The same thing in respect 

to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go 

through the civil service system or the collective 

bargaining agreement; is that right?

 MR. GARRE: Well, what would happen, if you 

had an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of 

age and retaliation, that would be a so-called mixed 

complaint. They could bring that to the --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, not what they do if 

their claim is a retaliation claim.

 MR. GARRE: If it's purely --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

have to bring it under the protections afforded by the 

Civil Service Reform Act.

the other that one of these two systems -- the civil 

service plus collective bargaining, on the other hand; 

or EEOC plus the court, on the other -- works better, 

works the same, works worse?

 MR. GARRE: Well, I guess, if I could just

that certainly Congress had any concerns about whether 

the system under the Civil Service Reform Act is working 

properly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's drawing 

something from where you don't know. Okay. So that's 

fair enough.

 But is there any -- what is the best reason, 

in your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make 

this distinction? What are the best two or three 

reasons? If you were just starting with a blank slate, 

why would Congress have wanted to send the one to the 

one route and the other to the other route.

 MR. GARRE: My assumption is that Congress 

felt that the back-stop protections that were available 

for Federal workers at the time it passed the Age 

Discrimination Act and that were subsequently codified 

by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were 

appropriate for people who complained about age. As I 

mentioned earlier --

complained about race.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm asking you, and if 

you were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought --

the conclusion that I would reach from what you're 

saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat 

them differently.

 MR. GARRE: Well, I think the reason would 

be that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially 

different than other types of discrimination, and it --

either it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as 

great or that the protections -- that it didn't need to 

add protections. And as I mentioned --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But why would it have 

thought that? In other words, if -- I can understand 

why you say -- if you're going to put a rational gloss 

on it, that must be what they were thinking, but why 

would they think such a thing?

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, again, Congress 

didn't say -- I'm not -- I think you can make the same 

argument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a 

jury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age 

Act, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages 

under Title VII but not under the Age Act.

make sure I understood something you said before, rather 

pleadingly. One is if one could imagine a claim just 

for reprisal, but you called something a "mixed claim" 

if you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both. 

So if you're suing for both, on your theory you still 

must split them up? You cannot bring the reprisal claim 

together with the discrimination claim?

 MR. GARRE: Well, you can bring them 

together. What you would do is you would bring a 

discrimination claim under the Age Act and you'd bring a 

reprisal claim under the Civil Service Reform Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a different 

administrative mechanism.

 MR. GARRE: You can bring them both together 

before the Merit Systems Protection Board, if you're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, oh, but how about 

court?

 MR. GARRE: Well, in -- what would happen 

there is you would have your proceeding in the Merit 

Systems Protection Board, which would decide the 

discrimination claim and the retaliation claim. At that 

point, the employee could decide to go to the EEOC to 

try to fight on discrimination, or the employee could go 

to Federal court, and in Federal court he would get a de 

novo trial on his -- on his discrimination claim and a

record review --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you -- you would 

be putting everything under the civil service umbrella 

and nothing under the --

MR. GARRE: No, I don't think so. And it's 

a clear difference.  There are several types of mixed 

claims that can be brought in this fashion. Once you 

get to Federal court on your Age Act discrimination 

claim, you get a trial de novo on that claim. You just 

only get record review of the Civil Service Reform Act 

claim because that's what Congress deemed appropriate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it didn't amount 

to an adverse action under the Civil Service Act --

MR. GARRE: If it doesn't amount to an 

adverse action, then you have to go the route that 

Congress thought appropriate for --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you wouldn't get to 

court.

 MR. GARRE: Well, you would have -- you

Special Counsel.

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me, 

Mr. Garre, that, following up on Justice Breyer's 

question of what's the reason for it, the most striking 

thing to me is that Congress used precisely the same 

language in the two sections: "All personnel actions 

shall be made free from any discrimination based on 

race, color" and so forth. That clearly includes 

retaliation. But "all personnel actions shall be made 

free from discrimination on account of age" does not 

include retaliation seems to me rather anomalous.

 MR. GARRE: But there are at least two 

material textual differences between Title VII and the 

ADA -- and the Age Act. The first is that the Title --

the Title VII --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In the key section 

describing the prohibition, the language is exactly the 

same.

 MR. GARRE: Well, to understand the meaning 

of that section you have to understand the meaning of 

the whole section itself including this express 

incorporation. And, secondly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Garre, are we going to 

have to decide the Title VII question in this case? We

a Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?

 MR. GARRE: The Court does not have to 

decide the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I would 

have thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question 

would be: This is an unusual situation where you have 

the employer writing the law about what the employees 

can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the 

situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be 

covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or 

disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that 

it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that 

they as the employer didn't want to face that 

disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil 

Service Reform Act already.

 MR. GARRE: I think that that's right, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think this Court recognized 

similar considerations in the Bush versus Lucas case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there -- there was 

something that was said about this -- that doesn't apply 

to congressional employees or White House employees, 

that they would have a claim of retaliation.

protections that existed for executive agency employees, 

but -- but look at the statutes -- and we cite them at 

page 36 in the appendix and our brief -- in those two 

statutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition 

that is in section 633(a): "All personnel actions 

affecting these employees shall be made free from 

discrimination based on age." But they explicitly 

included a separate anti-retaliation provision, which, 

again -- that's a subsequent statute, but that's --

again, that's another indication that Congress doesn't 

think that this kind of general prohibition in section 

633(a) covers discrimination. When it wants to cover 

retaliation, it passes an express anti-retaliation 

provision Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Garre.

 Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GUERRA: I'd like to make three points. 

First, I want to emphasize the practical reality that 

there are thousands of employees who have no remedies 

under any of the schemes we are talking about: 

Employees of TVA, employees of the General Accounting 

Office, these employees of the Transportation Security 

Administration.

 They have no collective bargaining remedies, 

no CSR remedy, and, according to the Government, no 

remedy under the ADEA.

 Justice Ginsburg, on Title VII, not only has 

the Government failed to challenge the lower --

consistent lower court interpretations. The EEOC's 

interpretation of this provision is that it bars 

retaliation in the Title VII sector -- Title VII bans. 

And so when you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Would you 

clarify your earlier statement: These people have no 

remedies just for retaliation? They do have remedies 

for the age discrimination, but not for retaliation?

 MR. GUERRA: They have no remedies for 

retaliation under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But they have remedies for 

age discrimination?

MR. GUERRA: They do, Justice Scalia, but my 

point is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. GUERRA: Our argument is that it makes 

no sense to give some people remedies under one scheme 

and leave some -- congressional employees getting full 

remedial relief, people under the CSRA getting a limited 

remedial relief, others getting remedies under the 

collective bargaining rights and thousands of others 

have no remedies only with respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that because they 

may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they 

have chosen not to?

 MR. GUERRA: I believe they are not allowed 

to. The entities I mentioned, I believe, are not 

allowed to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To have a remedy.

 MR. GUERRA: Because they simply have none 

of the remedies the Government has put before --

JUSTICE BREYER: Who -- who is such a 

person?

 MR. GUERRA: An employee of the 

Transportation Security Administration.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't they -- why can't 

they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?

MR. GUERRA: They are excluded from the 

Civil Service Reform Act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So they are outside the 

Civil Service, and they don't have unions?

 MR. GUERRA: They don't have bargaining 

rights.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They don't have a union?

 MR. GUERRA: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So they could be fired for 

anything.

 MR. GUERRA: Well, they have claims for 

discrimination if they suffer age discrimination 

directly, but if they complain about age discrimination 

and then get fired in retaliation, they have nothing. 

And -- and just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that's 

consistent with whatever prohibition it is that 

precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.

 MR. GUERRA: But it's not consistent with 

their rights under Title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, because 

as the EEOC has -- an -- is entitled to deference, it 

has said, for three decades.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we do 

have to decide the Title VII question if you are to 

prevail.

MR. GUERRA: I do. Well, I don't know that 

you necessarily do, but I certainly think it compels the 

conclusion I am advocating if you reach -- if you reach 

the issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You should have given us 

the statute to look at if that's the case.

 MR. GUERRA: I recognize that, Justice 

Scalia, and I apologize.

 I would also like to note that there was a 

suggestion that perhaps Congress didn't care as much 

about age discrimination. That's refuted by the House 

report that accompanied this very statute.

 It's quoted at page 23 of the AARP brief 

where the Congress said age is as great an evil in our 

society as discrimination based on race and religion. 

Whether or not this Court agrees with that assessment as 

an objective matter, that's the view of the Congress 

that adopted this statute.

 And, as Justice Stevens noted, they have --

they adopted the statute by incorporating the language 

from Title VII, the exact same language where Title 

VII's remedial scheme makes clear, and the EEOC's 

consistent interpretation confirms, that that then 

prohibits retaliation for complaints of race or gender 

discrimination.

By incorporating that same language in the 

ADEA's federal sector provision, Congress necessarily 

gave it the same scope; and, by doing so, eliminated the 

various anomalies, to put it mildly, that the 

Government's position leads to.

 If the Court has no further questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
