3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-277, Wal-Mart Stores v. 

Dukes. 

6  Mr. Boutrous. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR., 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. BOUTROUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The mandatory nationwide class in this case 

12 was improperly certified for two fundamental reasons. 

13 First, plaintiffs failed to satisfy Rule 23(a)'s 

14 cohesion requirements as reflected in the commonality, 

typicality, and adequacy requirements of the rule. 

16 Second, plaintiffs' highly individualized claims for 

17 monetary relief failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)'s 

18 requirements for certification of a mandatory 

19 non-opt-out class.

 Regarding Rule 23(a), because the 

21 plaintiffs' claims in this case hinge on the delegation 

22 of discretion to individual managers throughout the 

23 country, they cannot meet the cohesion requirements that 

24 are reflected in -- in Rule 23(a). The delegation of 

discretion in some ways is the opposite of cohesive

1 claims that are common to everyone in the class. The 

2 common policies that the plaintiffs point to are either 

3 neutral and not argued to be discriminatory or they are 

4 affirmatively nondiscriminatory. The company has a very 

strong policy against discrimination and in favor of 

6 diversity. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose if 

8 corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective 

9 decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to 

the field was resulting in several discriminatory 

11 practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other 

12 words, the decentralized process was leading to 

13 discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that 

14 that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at 

headquarters? 

16  MR. BOUTROUS: No, Your Honor. I think that 

17 in this situation, if there was a pattern, for example, 

18 at a particular store where the decisionmaking unit -­

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking 

about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you 

21 know, every week they get a report from another store 

22 saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender 

23 discrimination. At some point, can't they conclude that 

24 it is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that 

is causing or permitting that discrimination to take 

4

1 place? 

2  MR. BOUTROUS: That -- I think that would be 

3 an inquiry, Your Honor. I don't think it would rise to 

4 a pattern or practice or a common policy that affects 

everyone in the same way. Certainly, companies do look 

6 at the -- the situation throughout the company and seek 

7 to root out discrimination, but it would take more than 

8 some reports, especially in -- in a company that has so 

9 many stores and so many units.

 And here, the plaintiffs' claims simply 

11 aren't typical. If the three named plaintiffs stand 

12 before the court, they are supposed to represent 500,000 

13 or a million or more people and stand in judgment -­

14 that's the words the Court used in Hansberry v. Lee -­

to represent all those other people. And the claim is 

16 that the individual decisionmakers in those other cases 

17 exercised their discretion in a way that was biased, and 

18 there's no proof of that. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice's 

21 question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 

22 1983: A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional 

23 violation unless it has a policy. Would you think that 

24 we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or 

not there is a common question here?

1  MR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor. I think the 

2 analogue is that if a company had a policy, a general 

3 policy, of discrimination as opposed to here, where it's 

4 a general policy against discrimination, and it was -­

in the words of the Court in Feeney, saw patterns 

6 throughout the company and because of sex, because of 

7 gender, continued to allow the patterns to exist, that 

8 would raise a different question. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, following the 

Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing 

11 of deliberate indifference to the violation. Would that 

12 be a policy? 

13  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, I think 

14 deliberate indifference raises a different question. 

Under a disparate treatment claim, again, in Feeney, the 

16 test would be, was the company allowing the 

17 discrimination to occur because of gender, because it 

18 wanted there to be discrimination? There's no evidence 

19 of that here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any 

21 responsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been 

22 left out so far. The company gets reports month after 

23 month showing that women are disproportionately passed 

24 over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men 

and women doing the same job. It happens not once, but 

6

1 twice. Isn't there some responsibility on the company 

2 to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is, 

3 isn't there an obligation to stop it? 

4  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, yes, there is an 

obligation to ensure -- for a company to do its best to 

6 ensure there are not wage gaps and discrimination. But 

7 here, for example, if one looks at the aggregated 

8 statistics that the plaintiffs have pointed to, it 

9 points to a completely different issue. It does not 

show that there were gender gaps at the stores among 

11 comparable people. That's really the fundamental flaw 

12 in their case. 

13  Their argument is that individual 

14 decisionmakers throughout the country were making 

stereotyped decisions and that that had a common effect, 

16 but they just added everything together. They haven't 

17 shown a pattern across the map. They've added all the 

18 data together and pointed to disparities, some of which 

19 mirror some of the -- the statistics that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I thought their 

21 expert didn't aggregate them together. He did it 

22 regionally, not store by store, as your expert did, 

23 number one; and, number two, that he performed, as 

24 accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the 

circuit court, any number of controlled variable 

7

1 comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and 

2 other things, and found that the disparity could not be 

3 explained on any of the normal variables that one would 

4 expect and that the disparity was significantly much 

higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they 

6 were paying their labor force. 

7  So, what is speculative about that, number 

8 one? And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis 

9 inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?

 MR. BOUTROUS: Justice Sotomayor, first, 

11 plaintiffs' expert did a national regression and then 

12 simply estimated the regional results. He did not do a 

13 regional regression. But even if he had, these 

14 statistics go more to the merits. We think we have 

strong arguments on the merits responding to those 

16 statistical arguments -­

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs the 

18 legal question, which is -- you're right. Ultimately, 

19 you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis 

is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded 

21 was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted 

22 because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on 

23 premises that the court found not acceptable, that there 

24 was enough here after a rigorous analysis.

 What's the standard that the court should 

8

5

15

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 use in upsetting that factual conclusion? 

2  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, the district 

3 judge did not discount Wal-Mart's expert. The district 

4 court found that it wasn't the stage at which to make a 

determination between the two. The standard that we 

6 think would govern would be the standard that the Second 

7 Circuit adopted in the IPO case, which says there needs 

8 to be a choice. 

9  When you're talking about discretionary 

decision around the country by different decisionmakers, 

11 there has to be some demonstration that there's a common 

12 effect throughout the system. Our expert's report and 

13 testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there 

14 was no pay disparity. And that's the kind of -- and 

even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come 

16 forward with something that showed that there was this 

17 miraculous recurrence at every decision across every 

18 store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't 

19 show that.

 The -- the other problem on the -- on the 

21 cohesion analysis is that -- again, the typicality 

22 inquiry. Each of the plaintiffs have very different 

23 stories. One of them was promoted into a managerial 

24 position. One was terminated for disciplinary 

violations. One was promoted and then had a 

9

1 disciplinary problem and then was demoted. In each of 

2 these cases, if this were an individual case, they would 

3 have to show that they were treated differently than 

4 people who were situated just like them, with the same 

supervisor, the same department, the same situation. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: What do you think is the 

7 difference between the standard that the district court 

8 was required to apply at the certification stage on the 

9 question whether there was a company-wide policy and the 

-- the standard that would be applied on the merits? 

11  MR. BOUTROUS: At the certification stage, 

12 Justice Alito, the plaintiffs did not have to prove that 

13 there was an actual policy of discrimination and that 

14 that was the company's policy, but they at least needed 

to point to a policy that was common and that linked all 

16 of these disparate individuals and disparate locations 

17 and different people together. And -- and one -- their 

18 argument is that the common policy is giving tens of 

19 thousands of individuals discretion to do whatever they 

want. That is not commonality. It's the opposite. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't think that's quite 

22 fair, Mr. Boutrous. I think their argument was that the 

23 common policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one 

24 of using factors that allowed gender discrimination to 

come into all employment decisions. And in Watson, we 

10

1 suggested that that was a policy, a policy of using 

2 subjective factors only, when making employment 

3 decisions. That's exactly the policy that was alleged 

4 here.

 MR. BOUTROUS: Justice Kagan, they do not 

6 argue that it was an entirely subjective process. As 

7 the Court suggested in Falcon, entirely subjective 

8 would -- would be a different issue. They argue that it 

9 was excessive subjectivity and that there were general 

overarching company standards that exerted control. 

11  On page -- I think it's on page 13 of their 

12 brief, they say the discretion was unguided. Three 

13 pages later they say it was guided by these 

14 nondiscriminatory policies. So, it's really an 

incoherent theory that does not have -- pose the kind of 

16 situation you're suggesting. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I guess I'm just a 

18 little -- a little bit confused as to why excessive 

19 subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a 

Title VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII 

21 disparate impact suit. 

22  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, in Watson, the 

23 Court did suggest -- did state and -- and hold that 

24 subjective decisionmaking could be challenged in a 

disparate impact case, but Justice O'Connor's opinion 

11

1 went on to say there needs to be the identification of a 

2 specific practice within that policy. 

3  As the Court said in Falcon, Title VII does 

4 not govern policies; it governs practices. And 

subjectivity is not a practice if it were a policy. And 

6 there was a -- like most companies, Wal-Mart has a 

7 combination of objective and subjective standards. 

8 Within that, the plaintiffs -- if they had pointed to 

9 some particular criteria, people with a great 

personality, they're going to -- they're -- they're the 

11 ones we're going -- we're going to push up, and they -­

12 they were trying to tie that to a disparate impact or 

13 disparate treatment, that would be -­

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boutrous, there was a 

case, it was in the '70s, and it was a class action 

16 against AT&T for, I think, promotion into middle 

17 management. What was at issue there was a part -- a 

18 test, part objective, but then in the end, the final 

19 step was a so-called total person test, and women 

disproportionately flunked at that total person. 

21  And the idea wasn't at all complicated. It 

22 was that most people prefer themselves; and so, a 

23 decisionmaker, all other things being equal, would 

24 prefer someone that looked like him. And that was 

found, that total -- the application of that total 

12

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 person concept was found to be a violation of Title VII. 

2  This sounds quite similar. I mean, it's not 

3 just -- it's not subjective. You have an expert -- I 

4 know you have some questions about that expert -- but 

the expert saying that gender bias can creep into a 

6 system like that simply because of the natural 

7 phenomenon that people tend to feel comfortable with 

8 people like themselves. 

9  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, this -- this is 

not like the total person test, but I think that is a 

11 very good example of something that could be a -- a 

12 practice inside the -- the overarching policies, and if 

13 you had a case where a particular decisionmaking unit 

14 applied the total practice test, and you had disparate 

results in that particular unit, that group of people 

16 could -- could -- would have a much stronger case for a 

17 class action. 

18  But as Your Honor points out, the -- the 

19 sociologist here, who is the glue that's supposed to 

hold this class together, said he couldn't tell if 

21 stereotyping was occurring one-half of 1 percent or 95 

22 percent or at all. 

23  And this is a class action. The question 

24 here is whether that we can assume that every 

decisionmaker acted in the same manner in a way that had

2 plaintiffs had the same interest and the same injury, 

3 that's the way the Court put it in Amchem, by their own 

4 expert accepting all of their proof, the answer is no. 

That assumption is not supported by the record. That's 

6 why there's not the kind of cohesion that's necessary to 

7 protect the rights of the absent class members and the 

8 defendant. 

9  The -- the -- the other -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Boutrous, I think that 

11 that suggests that the plaintiffs would have to 

12 demonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and 

13 that's never been the law. All that the plaintiffs have 

14 to demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the 

proceedings, is that there is a practice, a policy of 

16 subjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination 

17 against women, not that each one of these women in the 

18 class were themselves discriminated against. 

19  MR. BOUTROUS: That's correct, Your Honor. 

At the phase one, we're not arguing that a plaintiff 

21 would have to come forward and show that every class 

22 member was discriminated at that point. Under the 

23 Teamsters' analysis, there must be proof of a standard 

24 operating procedure of discrimination.

 Here, it's undisputed that Wal-Mart's 

14

5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 policy -- and it wasn't just a written policy; it was 

2 implemented and enforced rigorously -- that was 

3 antidiscrimination. But, Your Honor, you're correct, 

4 that each person doesn't have to come forward in phase 

one. 

6  The big -- the other big problem here is 

7 that the district judge said in phase two, under 

8 Teamsters, Wal-Mart would not be entitled to put on its 

9 individual defenses. Women who thought they had a claim 

would not be able to come forward if a -- in this 

11 process, the paper records suggested they didn't have a 

12 claim, and come into court and have their day in court 

13 and argue that they should be compensated. 

14  The plaintiffs are trying to cut off half of 

the Teamsters' framework, which is fundamental both to 

16 due process and to Title VII because Title VII's section 

17 706(g) states very clearly that only victims of 

18 discrimination may recover. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what happens 

to the damages claim of an individual woman who is part 

21 of this class if that class prevails? 

22  MR. BOUTROUS: If the class prevails, then 

23 the -- the claim would be resolved in this manner 

24 under -- it's very unclear what the District Court had 

in mind.

claims for themselves but waived those for the class

12 is a fundamental, crucial violation.

14 would -- would the -- would the women with a claim for 

compensatory damages be able to sue that after the class

2 Rule 23(b)(3). Rule 23(b)(3) was -- was created for 

3 precisely this sort of circumstance, the growing edge of 

4 the law where individualized monetary claims are at 

stake. The -- the language of Rule 23(b)(2) speaks of 

6 injunctive and declaratory relief. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would -­

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought your position was 

9 that this could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), 

either; is that correct? 

11  MR. BOUTROUS: Our view is the plaintiffs 

12 will -- will not be able to satisfy those -- those 

13 provisions, but that's why they brought it under Rule 

14 23(b)(2), to circumvent the procedural protections of 

superiority, predominance, and the like. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that bar the 

17 (b)(2) class? Meaning if their claim is, as they state 

18 it, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory 

19 relief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a 

pattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and 

21 wouldn't that value be, standing alone without the 

22 damages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in 

23 later have a presumption that discrimination affected 

24 them and the burden shifts to Wal-Mart to prove that 

there was a nondiscriminatory reason?

1  MR. BOUTROUS: There certainly could be a

3 all the standards. The problem here is that the -- the 

4 individualized damage claims, the back pay claims, 

engulfed and overwhelm the injunctive relief -­

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if they did, why 

7 couldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the 

8 (b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough 

9 common facts and law to warrant a certification under 

(b)(3)? 

11  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, some courts have 

12 done that, looked at the injunctive relief claims under 

13 -- under the (b)(2) standard and the monetary reliefs 

14 under a (b)(3) standard. That can raise other 

complications, especially here the plaintiffs are 

16 seeking punitive damages as well, but that's at least a 

17 possibility. It would certainly be better than this, 

18 shoe-horning these monetary relief claims that are so 

19 individualized.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, would you address 

21 the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a 

22 (b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief? 

23 And if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your 

24 attack merely that the monetary component of this, the

1 whether that's equitable relief or compensatory relief 

2 or not -- why that just can't be separated out and put 

3 into the (b)(3) claim? 

4  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, our view is that 

the injunctive relief claim still has significant 

6 problems concerning cohesion, adequacy, typicality, 

7 commonality. On the adequacy point, this case includes 

8 at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be 

9 discriminators and victims. If that's not a conflict 

under Amchem and the adequacy test in Hansberry v. Lee, 

11 I don't know what is. The -- the women who are 

12 compelled to be in the class -- they can't opt out, 

13 they're current employees, they're former employees, 

14 they cut across every position in the country, and 

there's no demonstration that they're being affected in 

16 a common way. So, I think there would still be those 

17 commonality, typicality, cohesion problems because of 

18 the nature of the plaintiffs' case here, the notion of 

19 the common policy being giving -- giving discretion and 

-- and independent judgment. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- correct 

22 me if I'm wrong, but I thought that this district judge 

23 said that -- that the absent class members would get 

24 notice and have an opportunity to -- to opt out. So, a

2  MR. BOUTROUS: The district court, Justice 

3 Ginsburg, limited that ruling to the punitive damage 

4 claim, and the Ninth Circuit made clear it was viewing 

it that way. It said under its ruling, which sent 

6 punitive damages back, that would simplify things 

7 because then there wouldn't have to be notice and an 

8 opportunity to opt out under back pay. And back pay is 

9 monetary relief for individuals. To bind people based 

on a balancing test under (b)(2) to a judgment to which 

11 they were not a party -- in Taylor v. Sturgell, this 

12 Court talked about the fundamental rule that an 

13 individual is not bound by a judgment to which they're 

14 not a party and said we need crisp rules with sharp 

corners in this area where such a fundamental right is 

16 at stake. And that's why we think it needs to be Rule 

17 23(b)(3) when individual monetary relief is at stake. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That begs my question. 

19 Are you talking about any monetary relief? You're -­

you're claiming, I'm assuming, that monetary relief 

21 includes equitable relief. 

22  MR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Fifth Circuit has 

24 described a test where it doesn't use the predominant 

question; it uses the incidental test. What's wrong

1 with that test? 

2  MR. BOUTROUS: That test is much better than 

3 the test that was applied below. The plaintiffs have 

4 walked away from the two tests that were applied in the 

lower court. They have never contended they could meet 

6 the incidental damages test. And under the Fifth 

7 Circuit's case, the Allison case, only automatic back 

8 pay that goes to the group as a whole would qualify for 

9 that. Here, this is individualized relief.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- that's where I'm 

11 going to. Would you accept that incidental test as 

12 appropriate to the question of when monetary damages 

13 predominate or don't? 

14  MR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, the text of Rule 

23(b)(2) is very clear. It talks about injunctive and 

16 declaratory relief. The only ambiguity that's created 

17 is from the advisory committee note, and as this Court 

18 said three weeks ago in the Milner case, we don't look 

19 to legislative history to try to create ambiguities. 

The -- the other parts of the advisory committee notes 

21 make very clear that the drafters were concerned about 

22 the historical antecedents where it was an 

23 injunctive-only case to -- of -- to desegregate and the 

24 like. I think the drafters of Rule 23(b)(2) would have 

been shocked if they had learned that this case that

1 involves millions of claims for individualized monetary 

2 relief were -- were being sought to be included in a 

3 (b)(2) class. 

4  That said, Your Honor, the incidental damage 

test is -- is I think far superior because it's at least 

6 clearer and would be closer to a sharp, bright-line 

7 rule, which is required in this context. 

8  I'd like to go back briefly to the point I 

9 made earlier about individual relief and taking away the 

rights of both Wal-Mart and the absent class members. 

11 The procedures that would be used here -- the Ninth 

12 Circuit proposed a statistical sampling method. The 

13 plaintiffs do not defend that. They do not mention 

14 the Hilao case, which was the cornerstone of the -- the 

Ninth Circuit's ruling, which would allow sort of a 

16 prediction about who might have been hurt, how many 

17 people might have been hurt, and then a divvying up of 

18 -- of moneys based on that. 

19  The district court precluded the fundamental 

Teamsters hearings, which would allow, once a 

21 presumption, if one was to arise, of discrimination 

22 occurred in a pattern of practice -- would allow the 

23 defendant to then show that it didn't discriminate on -­

24 on an individual basis, and it would allow the 

individuals to come in and have their day in court.

1 That violates Title VII. It violates the Rules Enabling 

2 Act, and -- and we think it really shows some of the 

3 core flaws in this case. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the class 

does -- does not prevail; it loses? Does that bar an 

6 individual woman at a particular Wal-Mart from bringing 

7 these same claims? 

8  MR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor. There's a 

9 presumption in -- in the world of class actions -­

there's two that I think the plaintiffs are -- are 

11 relying on. One is that class actions are always good, 

12 and the bigger the class action, the better, and that 

13 the class will win. None of those presumptions can be 

14 counted on. If the plaintiffs lose, and they -- and 

here their compensatory damages claims, I think, would 

16 be gone because the named plaintiffs are asserting them. 

17 If they tried to bring a case as pattern or practice or 

18 pay or promotion, there would be significant questions 

19 of res judicata and collateral estoppel. And it's not 

fair to anyone to put this all into one big class. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not suggesting 

22 that they would be precluded on individual 

23 discrimination claims, are you?

11  MR. SELLERS: That's correct. We don't 

12 submit that. There is no minimum number that this Court 

13 has ever set. Teamsters, as an example in Teamsters, 

14 the Court had before it about 40 examples, but 

significantly they weren't required. In order to 

16 establish a pattern and practice of liability -- and we 

17 have more than that, of course -- but in order to 

18 establish a pattern and practice of liability or at 

19 least a prima facie case, Teamsters holds that what you 

need to do is show that there were disparities 

21 sufficiently substantial to create an inference of 

22 discrimination with respect to a discrete practice.

1  MR. SELLERS: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

2 position -- I don't know that that's a fair comparison. 

3 The position that Wal-Mart has advanced makes no -- the 

4 comparison it makes is with the general population, not 

with people in retail. 

6  Wal-Mart's obligation under Title VII is to 

7 ensure that its managers do not make pay decisions 

8 because of sex, and the comparison that's relevant is 

9 between men and women at Wal-Mart, not the general 

population that includes people in retail, but includes 

11 railroad workers and all kinds of other people. That's 

12 not the appropriate comparison. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me: 

14 What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, 

under your theory of the case? 

16  MR. SELLERS: Justice Kennedy, our theory is 

17 that Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked 

18 discretion in the way that this Court's Watson decision 

19 addressed that was used to pay women less than men who 

were doing the same work in the same -- the same 

21 facilities at the same time, even though -- though those 

22 women had more seniority and higher performance, and 

23 provided fewer opportunities for promotion than women 

24 because of sex.

well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. 

6 It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm 

7 just not sure what the unlawful policy is. 

8  MR. SELLERS: Well, Justice Kennedy, there 

9 is no inconsistency any more than it's inconsistent 

within Wal-Mart's own personnel procedures. The company 

11 provides to its managers this discretion, which, by the 

12 way, is very discrete. It is not the broad kind of -­

13 we're not attacking every facet of the pay and promotion 

14 decisions. The District Court found specific features 

of the pay and promotion process that are totally 

16 discretionary. There's no guidance whatsoever about how 

17 to make those decisions. 

18  But with respect to the discretion, every 

19 store, the District Court found, is provided -- managers 

are provided with the same level of discretion. But the 

21 company also has a very strong corporate culture that 

22 ensures that managers, not just with respect to the 

23 practices we're challenging, but in all respects, what 

24 they call the Wal-Mart way, and the purpose of that is 

to ensure that in these various stores that, contrary to

to do.

6 the company about how to exercise that discretion. So,

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: If somebody tells you how 

9 to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion.

 MR. SELLERS: Well, all right. That's

about the unchallenged fact that the central company had

18 the managerial level? It was, you make these hiring 

19 decisions, but you do not make them on the basis of sex. 

Wasn't that the central policy of the company? 

21  MR. SELLERS: That was a written policy.

question -- a response to a standard question: Why are 

6 women so underrepresented, or so few women in 

7 management? And the response given was, because men 

8 seek advancement, are more aggressive in seeking 

9 advancement.

4  MR. SELLERS: Well, the -- the approach that 

the District Court endorsed, an approach we recommended, 

6 and which has been endorsed by seven circuits over a 

7 period of 40 years, is in circumstances here -- like 

8 here, which are, admittedly, the exception to the rule, 

9 where the company had no standards by which to make 

promotion and pay decisions, they had kept no records of 

11 who -- the reasons for people being promoted and the 

12 reasons why they pay people certain amounts, that as a 

13 consequence of that, the Albemarle decision and the 

14 Teamsters decision make clear that the obligation of the 

District Court upon finding of liability is to attempt 

16 to reconstruct the decisions that would have been made 

17 in the absence of discrimination. 

18  And the District Court found here -- and we 

19 submit it's not clearly erroneous -- that the more 

reliable method for doing so is to use a formula relying 

21 on Wal-Mart's robust database in which it captures 

22 performance, seniority, and a host of other job-related

6 You know, the answer to your -- the answer to your

8 managers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and 

9 in promotion, yet you still have the same subjective 

delegation system.

6 government that wasn't a class action case.

3  MR. SELLERS: Outside the company. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- society wide, but the 

company does have a policy against discrimination. 

6  MR. SELLERS: Right. I -- I would say that 

7 the company's responsibility under Title VII is to 

8 ensure its managers do not make pay and promotion 

9 decisions because of sex. If the comparison between the 

pay women receive, for instance, who are similarly 

11 situated to men within the company is such that they are 

12 underpaid compared to similarly situated men in the 

13 company, then -- then the company would have legal 

14 responsibility under Title VII, regardless of what 

happens in the rest of the industry, what happens in the 

16 rest of the world.

actions, imagine every company in the country would

8  JUSTICE ALITO: I understand your answer to

look to in Hazelwood, which makes very clear that you 

21 don't look to populations outside the company in making

2 same profile. Then you would say every single company 

3 is in violation of Title VII? 

4  MR. SELLERS: It -- that could very well be 

the case. If -- if the -- I think that Title VII holds 

6 companies responsible for the actions they take with 

7 respect to their employees. There certainly are 

8 industries, and there were 30 years -- many more 30 or 

9 40 years ago when Teamsters was decided, where the 

entire industry might have had evidence of 

11 discrimination. That would not -- there is not a 

12 negligence standard under this statute that immunizes 

13 companies because they follow the same standards as 

14 others.

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: One thing you haven't 

7 touched on is to -- to have, first of all the question 

8 of whether (b)(2) is limited to injunction and 

9 declaratory relief.

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if -- if you follow 

12 the advisory committee's note, then if dollars -- if

14 can't use (b)(2). You have to make your case under

17 injunctive relief, but everybody's interested in money.

8 makes clear that there is a -- that the -- whether or 

9 not an action or inaction is taken with respect to the 

class which is the predicate to (b)(2) certification, it 

11 depends on -- it doesn't depend on the number of people 

12 who are adversely affected by that action.

1  Let me begin with this question of back pay 

2 because Mr. Sellers has made clear under their vision 

3 Wal-Mart would never have an opportunity to prove that 

4 it didn't discriminate against a woman who was seeking 

back pay; and the district court did not suggest that it 

6 might be difficult, as Mr. Sellers suggested. The 

7 district court, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, said that 

8 he found it would be impossible; not just because of the 

9 number of people, but because of the nature of the 

claims, that discretionary decisions were being 

11 implemented in a way that affected different people 

12 differently. 

13  The -- the problem here Mr. Sellers says is 

14 that the records are not available. Then he says we're 

going to have a -- a proceeding where the district judge 

16 relies only on the records, that he says are inadequate, 

17 to allow a reconstruction of the decision. That is not

9 impossible to try these cases other than because of 

their large numbers? That's a different issue.

12 just outlined, we agree that a woman should be able to 

13 come in and say that, and she may say well, the records 

14 don't show what really happened. I -- I had more 

experience; I was a much better employee than the guy 

16 working next to me. Under the plaintiff's theory in 

17 order to get a class here, they have thrown that out the 

18 window; that woman would not be able to come and 

19 testify. Wal-Mart wouldn't be able to say this person 

was a terrible employee, this person was a great 

21 employee. On the record, it's not impossible to 

22 recreate these decisions. The record is filled with

17 was affected the same way by the common policy. Many 

18 women thrived. Maybe some men stereotyped or some women 

19 stereotyped the other direction. Five hundred and 

forty-four of the plaintiffs are female store managers. 

21 So, it's impossible to make these sweeping
