 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 07-21 and 07-25, Crawford v. Marion 

County Election Board and Indiana Democratic Party v. 

Secretary Rokita.

 Mr. Smith.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case involves a law that directly 

burdens our most fundamental right, the right to vote. 

Those Indiana voters who lack the identification now 

required by the new photo ID law must overcome 

substantial practical and financial burdens before they 

can continue to exercise their constitutional right. 

Now, the State says that those burdens are justified by 

the need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation 

fraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many 

times that such a justification should not just be 

accepted at face value, but instead it should be 

scrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is 

both real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden 

being imposed on constitutional rights.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before -- before we get to 

that, can we talk about standing a little? Who are 

the -- who are the complainants here?

 MR. SMITH: There are many plaintiffs, Your 

Honor, including the ones that the courts below found 

have standing, the Democratic Party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Courts below are sometimes 

wrong.

 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and 

especially when I'm a petitioner I agree with you on 

that. But in this case, Your Honor, the Democratic 

Party was found to have standing correctly, I believe, 

on at least two grounds, associational standing as well 

as what you might call haven standing, the 

organizational interest being impaired by virtue of this 

law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they still have to 

identify individuals who are members. Now, what does it 

take to be a member of the Democratic Party here?

 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, in Indiana you 

become a member of the Democratic Party by participating 

in party affairs. They did identify members who are 

activists, who are poll workers, and that's why the 

district court said that as, as to the equal protection 

claim those people were sufficient to satisfy

associational standing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought they 

took the position that anybody who voted or intended to 

vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.

 MR. SMITH: Well, there are different 

degrees of membership, different ways to become a 

member, as this Court has recognized --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any way in which 

you can say -- and I thought this was the theory of 

associational standing -- that this individual has 

voluntarily given this organization the right to 

represent that person for particular purposes?

 MR. SMITH: There is no formal method of 

induction as you would have in the Elk's Club or 

something, Your Honor. But there clearly are methods by 

which you become a participant in the affairs of the 

party. For example, to vote in the primary you have to 

aver that you have either supported Democratic 

candidates in the last election or intend to in a future 

election.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't mean that 

I'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me 

for all sorts of purposes. And these people can bring 

their own individual challenges. I mean, I'm not 

questioning their ability to do it. But, but why is the

Democratic Party their representative?

 MR. SMITH: Because they have -- the 

Democratic Party is an association of people joined 

together to elect candidates of a particular kind and 

those people include many people who are burdened by 

this law. This seems to be the absolutely 

quintessential case for associational standing, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, though, 

Mr. Smith, the trial court didn't rely on, simply on the 

associational standing of the Democratic Party, did it?

 MR. SMITH: No, that's correct, Your Honor. 

Well, the court of appeals relied as well on Havens 

Realty and said that the organizational interests of the 

party are being impaired by virtue of the fact that this 

is putting a burden on them achieving their goal, the 

Democratic Party's goal, of electing its candidates.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And is doing so by forcing 

them to get people properly identified.

 MR. SMITH: Extend resources getting people, 

get their identification. It's very much like the 

Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority case which we 

cited in our brief, which involved a nonprofit 

organization aimed at trying to keep the noise level 

down at National Airport that was impaired by an

unconstitutional statute in that case as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That organization had 

members. I mean, you did join that organization.

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And they identified members 

who would be, who would be annoyed by the noise.

 MR. SMITH: I'd note, Your Honor, that in 

the Hunt case itself there were no members. The Court 

said it doesn't really matter because the State agency 

that had associational standing in Hunt functioned for 

all purposes as the representatives of those, of those 

apple farmers, but there was no formal membership 

organization, no members per se at all. But the Court 

said that shouldn't make a difference because there's 

really no actual functional difference between the two 

situations. I would certainly submit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just think it's hard to 

confine your rationale if you say that any association 

could sue. If it says, you know, there are people that 

if they knew what we were doing, if they knew this 

problem they would really want us to sue on their 

behalf, I don't know if I'm going to confine your 

rationale.

 MR. SMITH: Well Your Honor, the thing that 

confines the rationale is it has to be something that

relates as well to the purpose of the organization, of 

the association, the reason why these people are bound 

together as a group, and that is of course to get people 

to vote and vote to support -- support the goals of the 

organization, support the candidates, the nominees of 

the organization.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We can limit your 

standing argument to -- I guess it's based on the 

affidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is 

a clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a 

judge for the Democratic Party. We don't have to agree 

with you that anybody who votes, might vote Democratic, 

is enough to give you standing.

 MR. SMITH: But we also have other people in 

the record, Your Honor -- for example, Theresa Clemente, 

others who are active poll workers, activists in the 

party, who -- had been polled and found that they didn't 

have IDs and that they would be burdened by the 

difficulty of getting IDs. So that that -- there is 

specific standing evidence in there of specific people 

who, much more than just your average voter, are active 

in party affairs. They may not have a -- be 

card-carrying members of the Democratic Party, but they 

are as much a part of the Democratic Party as anybody 

possibly could be, who were identified in response to

interrogatories, about 9 or 10 of them, and were found 

to be satisfactory for purposes of standing by the 

district court on the equal protection claim.

 Now, in addition I would note as I suggested 

to Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the 

associational standing because the Democratic Party 

clearly is injured in its own right as an organization.

 Now, if I could turn to the merits then, the 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Even in its own 

right, it has to identify somebody that's a member or 

not.

 MR. SMITH: No. When it's in its own right 

the association, the organization, is injured, Your 

Honor. Now, the question -- if what you're suggesting, 

is there enough evidence here that people are actually 

being prevented from voting?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, Democrats in 

particular, I suppose.

 MR. SMITH: A great deal of evidence in the 

record of the burdens that are imposed on people who try 

to comply with this law and continue exercising their 

constitutional right to vote.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understood 

Judge Barker to say that you had not come up with a

single instance of somebody who was denied the right to 

vote because they didn't have a photo ID.

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the record in 

this case was made when an election had not yet 

happened. So that comment, while it was certainly made, 

I don't quite understand its significance.  This case 

was brought to try to prevent an irreparable loss of 

constitutional rights in advance of the implementation 

of this law. I think it had been used in two little 

towns in '05, Montezuma, Indiana, but other than that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So elections were 

conducted under this law?

 MR. SMITH: I'm not even -- there were a 

couple of hundred people that had voted under the law, 

but nobody else had yet, at that point. Now, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, did you have anybody 

who said, I don't have a voter ID?

 MR. SMITH: Yes, we did, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I plan to come in this next 

election, I plan to vote, and I don't have a voter ID 

card?

 MR. SMITH: Yes, we did, Your Honor. That's 

the 9 or 10 people who came from the poll worker survey. 

There was also a considerable amount of testimony about 

other people who said they wanted to vote, who spoke to

many of the other plaintiffs, Mr. Crawford, the NAACP 

chapter. There's a lot of other plaintiffs who also 

submitted evidence of people saying: I don't have an 

ID, I'm not going to be able to get one, I'm not going 

to be able to vote.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- and 

they're not going to be able to get one even though the 

State will provide them with one if they don't have one, 

subject to some identification?

 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. But what the 

State did in 2002 was it ratcheted up the difficulty of 

getting one by requiring for the first time that you 

have an original certified birth certificate that you 

paid for and that -- and then you have to go through the 

hoops of what kind of identification you need for that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is it your position 

that a State can't require any form of identification 

and can only require a signature, or would some lesser 

form of identification than Indiana has required be 

constitutional?

 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, it may well be 

possible that there's certain situations that it could 

require it. Each case is a balancing test. As the 

Court said in Timmons, you have to make hard judgments 

on the specific facts of each case and identify both the

State interest being served, the incremental State 

interest being served, and the degree of the burdens.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What was the answer to my 

question? Is any form of voter identification beyond a 

signature permissible or not?

 MR. SMITH: If it's readily available and 

not especially burdensome and there is some reason to 

think that it is preventing a fraud of some sort, 

serving some --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But clearly you answer all 

of those questions that you've just posed, that you've 

just responded with, "no". So then your answer to 

Justice Alito should be no.

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, it is true --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Although that leads to the 

next question, is whether or not there are ways in which 

the -- the central purpose of this law can be preserved 

but it could be less stringent. But I'd like you to 

respond to both of those things.

 MR. SMITH: Well, it is certainly true that, 

in fact, there is no evidence in this record of any 

significant amount of fraud that is still occurring with 

the existing system of voter identification.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That wasn't -- that wasn't 

the problem I had with your answer to that question.

You posed a number of questions to Justice Alito, or a 

number of responses, but to each one of those your own 

answer in the brief was no, and therefore your question 

-- the answer to Justice Alito's question should be no, 

there is no system that you know of that can impose a 

photo ID.

 MR. SMITH: I think -- I think that the 

current system works just fine. So if there's any 

degree of burden being imposed on the voter by some 

additional identification requirement, then I would say 

it's unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Smith --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer is no.

 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- suppose at the time of 

registration there was a photograph taken right in the 

registration place and on the spot they gave you an ID 

with that photo, and everybody who registers would get 

one and there isn't any question of paying money to get 

a birth certificate. Would that be satisfactory? Ir 

that -- if you could make a photographic ID universally 

available, you would still have the problem of the 

religious objectors, but wouldn't everybody else be 

covered?

were true, Your Honor, I think that would be potentially 

constitutional. That's a very different world than the 

one we live in, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be 

potentially constitutional?

 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So we should 

ignore your religious objection argument in this case?

 MR. SMITH: Well, I was assuming that we 

would make some additional exemptions for particular 

people with those kinds of problems, if people can't 

have one. If the question is, if everybody has a photo 

ID in their pocket is it constitutional to require them 

to show them at the voting booth, the answer to that I 

think is yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, do we know that that 

religious exemption won't be made?

have their photograph taken. Do we know that if that's 

the reason that they assert, I can't get the photograph, 

the State will say you can't vote?

 MR. SMITH: I must be misunderstanding. We 

have every reason to think that they will let them vote. 

The only problem with that exemption, like the indigency 

exception, is that it's kind of gratuitively burdensome 

in that you have to go down to the county seat to vote 

every time; you can't vote in your polling place because 

you have to fill out this affidavit every time you vote.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you could, you could 

do it twice. You could make the two trips, one to your 

local place and one to the distant place.

 MR. SMITH: Either way, your real voting 

place is going to be the county clerk's office in the 

county seat, forever. That's -- it's not that they 

won't do it; it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how far away 

is the furthest county seat for somebody in the county,

 MR. SMITH: I don't know the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: County seats aren't 

very far for people in Indiana.

 MR. SMITH: No. If you're an indigent 

person, Your Honor, in Lake County, in Gary, Indiana, 

you'd have to take the bus 17 miles down to Crown Point

to vote every time you want to vote. And if you're 

indigent that's a significant burden, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a burden if you're 

not indigent?

 MR. SMITH: Well, it's -- it's less of a 

burden, Your Honor, considerably less of a burden. You

because the person presumably has no access to an 

automobile because they don't have a driver's license 

and they're indigent and they're living in Gary, 

Indiana.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- the 

record shows that fewer than 1 percent of people in 

Indiana don't have a photo ID.

 MR. SMITH: That is not what the record 

shows, Your Honor, and it's not what the district court 

said. I think it's -- it would be really a travesty if 

this Court decided the case on that assumption. What 

the district court said is if you compare the voting age 

population in the census to the total number of driver's 

licenses and IDs that have been issued, you get that 

disparity of 43,000 or 1 percent, but what the district

court went on to say is this is probably not accurate 

because the total of licenses and IDs includes all the 

people who have died and left the State and their 

licenses are still unexpired.

voting rolls. I thought the district court found 41 --

MR. SMITH: No, no. The population --

 MR. SMITH: So sorry.

the people on the voting rolls in Indiana were either 

dead or they were duplicate entries.

voting rolls. She was comparing population in the 

census as of 2005 with the driver's license records.

with the 41.4 percent figure for bad entries on the 

voting registration rolls?

may have gotten better now. They apparently have 

instituted a lot of efforts in the last 3 years to make 

it better, but --

think if you have the voter rolls with a significant 

number of bad registrants, either dead or duplicates, 

that that presents a significant potential for fraud?

 MR. SMITH: I suppose. I don't know if I 

can say significant. The situation has existed for now 

a number of years, and the salient fact here is that 

there's not a single recorded example of voter 

impersonation fraud.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

it's less of an issue. If somebody wins an election by 

500,000 votes, you may not be terribly worried if some 

percentage were cast by fraud, but you might look to the 

future and realize there could be a closer election and 

there -- it's a type of fraud that, because it's fraud, 

it's hard to detect.

 MR. SMITH: No, it's actually not, Your 

Honor. It's the type of fraud that the Elections 

Commission said -- found is unlikely, the most unlikely, 

because it's not that hard to detect. When you're going 

into the polls and saying, I'm Joe Smith, you're dealing 

with a neighborhood person who knows a lot of people who 

are there, you have to match that person's signature.

And if that person shows up later on to vote --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem with 

the duplicate entries is there may be two entries for 

John Smith because John Smith has moved and the voter 

registration hasn't been updated. So all you need is 

somebody else to go in and say: I'm John Smith, this is 

my address. And later in the day somebody else comes in 

and says: I'm John Smith and this is my address. And 

because they're duplicates it's really difficult to 

check.

 MR. SMITH: Well, the duplicates, 

presumably, are in two different places, right. So they 

would vote in two different places.

 But if -- what the -- the fraudfeasor 

doesn't know is where the real John Smith is going to 

vote. So if he goes in and votes in one place and says, 

well, I'm going to -- I expect he's going to go in the 

other place, sooner or later, if you had any significant 

amount of this kind of fraud occurring, people would be 

coming in and saying I can't vote. Somebody says I 

already voted.

 It's not happening and, indeed, every single 

indication in this record is that the evidence of this 

kind of fraud occurring, to call it scant is to 

overstate it.

JUSTICE SCALIA: The people who are dead or 

have moved away would certainly not be objecting.

 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. I was talking 

about the disparity between the number of people in the 

voting-age population and the number of licenses and 

saying you can't assume it's only a one percent 

differential. It's actually more like an eight or nine 

percent differential.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wasn't talking about 

that. I was talking about whether there is a genuine 

threat of fraud which the State is moving to eliminate 

MR. SMITH: The question is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and your assertion that, 

you know, it's not much of a problem because the person 

whom you're impersonating would find out about it. I 

mean -- but that's certainly not the case for people who 

have moved away or people, you know, the people in the 

graveyards that are still on the rolls.

 MR. SMITH: It's certainly possible that 

someone could commit this kind of a crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd say likely.

 MR. SMITH: Well, one of the things that 

makes it less likely is if you try to actually affect an 

election you need to sway a lot of votes. And in order

to do that this way you'd have to have 100 or 200 or 500 

co-conspirators, each of them assigned an identity, 

learning the signature of that person, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: You don't really -- I mean, 

that's what I wonder if there is no such evidence. How 

could you get evidence? It used to be common maybe 

urban legends, but of political bosses voting whole 

graveyards of dead people. All right. Now, that would 

be almost impossible to catch, I think. Someone walks 

in, saying: I'm Joe Smith. He doesn't say: I'm Joe 

Smith dead. He says, I'm Joe Smith, and he signs 

something. And the poll worker looks at it and the 

signature looks very weird.

 Well, what's the poll worker supposed to do? 

He's not going to go disrupt the election. And is there 

going to be a policeman there to follow this person 

home? Of course not.

 So that's their claim. Their claim is that 

we have a lot of anecdotes and there is a certain kind 

of fraud that you really just can't catch at the poll.

 MR. SMITH: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's your response 

to that? Because that's their argument on the other 

side.

the anecdotes, I would encourage you to look at the 

Brennan Center brief.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know there are arguments 

on both sides. But at the heart of this is what was 

Judge Posner's claim and others that this isn't the kind 

of fraud that you can just dismiss and say it never 

happens because the person would walk into the poll 

later and try to vote. What they are talking about is 

what Justice Scalia was talking about, and I'm simply 

trying to focus your answer on that part of the 

question.

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, many kinds of 

fraud do get caught, and they are no more easily 

detected than this kind of fraud to be detected. But 

this kind of fraud is not being caught. No one has been 

punished for this kind of fraud in living memory in this 

country. This is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they say that's 

because you can't catch it.

 MR. SMITH: Well, but Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: How would you catch it, 

which is my question.

 MR. SMITH: First of all -- first of all, 

you talk about deterring it. You deter it by the 

signature match, by having to have the same age, by

having to get past people who know a lot of the people 

in the precinct, and by having very severe criminal 

penalties. And then you have --

JUSTICE ALITO: If this is not a problem at 

all, how do you account for the fact that the Commission 

on Federal Election Reform that was co-chaired by former 

President Carter and former Secretary of State Baker 

recommended a voter ID requirement, and many other 

countries around the world have voter ID requirements?

 MR. SMITH: What they recommended, Your 

Honor, is exactly what Justice Ginsburg anticipated, 

which is get everybody the cards, and then we'll be like 

Europe, and everything will work really fine, and it'll 

actually help the poor to have these IDs for a lot of 

other purposes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand, they 

were going to have some years in between when their 

proposal was enacted, and they were going to have a 

mobile unit going around to all the neighborhoods, lots 

of advertising, because a premise of that Carter-Baker 

report was that everybody would easily and costlessly 

get this photo ID.

 MR. SMITH: I would encourage the Court to 

refer to the Democratic Party Exhibit 18, which is an 

article by Carter, President Carter, and Secretary

Baker, following on their report, saying, look, there's 

a problem here; that 12 percent of the voting age 

population of this country doesn't have a license; we 

did not recommend this being a mandatory thing until we 

get those licenses in those people's hands.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would they even 

require that if it's not any problem at all? Doesn't it 

at least show that it is a problem of some dimension, 

maybe not as severe as Indiana claims, but there would 

be no need for any sort of photo ID problem, 

requirement, if there were no problem whatsoever. Isn't 

that true?

 MR. SMITH: Some States don't have signature 

matches. There may have been a minimal amount of 

additional benefit in some States from having that 

added. That was a decision they ultimately made, with 

some dissents.

 The reality, though, is if you do it not 

their way, but the Indiana way, which is to say you need 

an ID, we're not going to help you get it, in fact we're 

going to ratchet up the requirements for making you get 

it, and we're going to charge you money for it, then 

what you have is a very different system. Then you have

it. They say if you don't have an ID we'll give you 

one. If you don't have a photo ID, come in and we'll 

give you one.

 MR. SMITH: But what the record shows is 

that 60 percent of the time, when people go in and ask 

for one, they get sent home, because they don't have the 

right documentation because the rules --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What documentation 

did President Carter and Secretary Baker propose to 

require for their photo IDs?

 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I think they were 

very strong on having this birth certificate 

requirement, as well. So they -- they were talking 

about the real ID law and that sort of thing. So I'm 

not specific about what the report says on that, but 

they certainly thought there should be -- obviously, in 

the wake of 9/11 there is some concern about giving out 

these things too readily. So I'm reasonably sure they 

supported a birth certificate requirement as well.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you concede that 

some kind of voter ID requirement is appropriate, the 

problem that I have is where you draw the line on a 

record like this where there's nothing to quantify in 

any way the extent of the problem or the extent of the 

burden, how many people will actually be prevented from

voting or significantly burdened from voting as a result 

of the requirement? How do we tell whether this is on 

one side of the line or the other side of the line?

 MR. SMITH: Well, it is a difficult area of 

the law for you for that reason, Justice Alito. But if 

you like at Timmons what it says is there's no litmus 

test, there's no escaping the hard judgments. This is 

the area where the courts have to be not too deferential 

even though there are hard judgment calls about matters 

of degree, because this is an area where the concern is 

that the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch are 

going to abuse their power to regulate the electoral 

process to find subtle ways to skew the outcome on 

election day.

 As John Hard Ely says, this is an area where 

judicial review is the most important, the most 

legitimate. And so you can't shy away from that even 

though there are difficult matters of balancing involved 

and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're telling us 

that, you know, we've got to be careful and it's 

difficult. But Justice Alito's question is: What are 

we supposed to look at, how are we supposed to do it?

 MR. SMITH: You are supposed to look at how 

difficult it is to get the ID, what assistance is

provided or not being provided, how much it costs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's get down -- let's get 

down to the question of quantification, which is one of 

the issues that he raised. What's your response to the 

issue that there is no quantification of the actual 

burden measured by the number of voters who are going to 

be adversely affected? What's the answer to that?

 MR. SMITH: The answer is that there's 

plenty of evidence in the record about the number of 

people in this country who don't have IDs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's talk about 

Indiana. What have you got -- what is -- what is your 

best argument for Indiana?

 MR. SMITH: The best argument for Indiana is 

if you take the district court's 43,000 figure and you 

adjust it for the two factors, death and departure, that 

I mentioned before, the number becomes more like 400,000 

people in the State of Indiana who lack IDs and are of 

voting age, eligible -- voting age population people.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And how many of them are 

going to suffer from an unreasonable denial of an 

opportunity to get the ID which the State will provide 

through the Bureau of Motor Vehicles? How do we 

quantify that?

 MR. SMITH: It is obviously for each person

a different matter of degree.  The burdens here are 

along a whole spectrum because some people don't have a 

birth certificate, some people have -- don't have a 

birth certificate, but they have money. Some people 

don't have a birth certificate and they don't have 

money.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I know that. That's 

why it's a tough issue. But how do -- how are we going 

to -- how is a court going to arrive at some kind of a 

bottom line judgment on this issue?

 MR. SMITH: Well, because you -- you 

basically have to take into account all of those 

factors: How many people are potentially affected; how 

difficult it is; how similar it is to, say, a poll tax, 

for example, and say -- and then look at what purpose is 

being served here. Is there any real incremental 

benefit to anything by --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, that's on -- that's 

on the other side of the issue.

 MR. SMITH: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But walk -- walk us through 

-- if you were writing the opinion and what you wanted 

to put in the opinion was a reasonable estimate of the 

number of people who are going to be substantially 

burdened in having -- who do not now have the

identification, substantially burdened in getting it. 

What approximate number would you arrive at and how 

would you -- how would you get to it?

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I would say of 

that 400,000 voting age people, probably about half of 

them are registered voters. It stands to reason that 

most of them are lower income people, and that 

therefore, the burden even of having to pay for the 

birth certificate is a significant one. That -- so that 

a very substantial portion of that 200,000 people in 

order --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Smith, is there 

anything in the record about the extent to which the 

political parties help people get their IDs, as they 

sometimes drive them to the polls for voting and so 

forth, the part they play in this process?

 MR. SMITH: I'm not aware of anything, Your 

Honor. This is a fairly new law at the time this record 

was being put together in 2005. But certainly, the 

parties --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it fair to presume 

that the parties would play a role in helping people get 

registered and getting to the polls?

and say: We want your help to get IDs. A year later, 

less than 75 had succeeded because they found themselves 

caught in this Catch-22, where they went to get a birth 

certificate, they didn't have a driver's license, they 

didn't have the other kinds of very narrowly specified 

IDs they needed, and so they were basically in this

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

form of identification. The only evidence in the

figure of, what, about 50,000, to be further discounted 

by those who might vote absentee and so on?

 MR. FISHER: We've never had a problem. In 

fact, that data was submitted by the plaintiffs. It 

came from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and was matched 

against census data.

 I don't think there's ever been any dispute 

about the accuracy of the record. Now, the judge did 

acknowledge that there might be some outliers one 

direction or another, but those cannot possibly account 

for 10 times the number.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I just want to -- I 

just want to know what your figure. Mr. Smith was 

starting with 400 and then getting it down 2 and so on. 

And my recollection in the red brief is that you said, 

all right, let's take the 43,000 figure. I forget what 

you discounted it for, but it got it down to 25,000. 

Some of those would be able to vote absentee, but 

this -- I take it you're conceding that, at least 

subject to some discount, there are probably about 

25,000 people who may be affected by this adversely. Is 

that clear?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think we would say that 

that's the number -- that's the number that could 

conceivably be inconvenienced by this law. Now, to put

that in perspective, I think you have to compare it, for 

example, to the number of people who are not registered 

to vote, because there again that's an incidental 

burden. That is something that inconveniences some 

people.

 And we're talking about 35 times more -- in 

terms of a percentage, we're talking about 66.8 percent 

or so of the population that reports being registered to 

vote, far short of the percentage based on the 

calculations of the district court or anything in the 

ballpark of that that don't have photo identification. 

So we're talking about an infinitesimal portion of the 

electorate that could even be, conceivably be burdened 

by this.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't that a little 

bit of a stretch, too, when you say "infinitesimal"? I 

mean, if you take your two-thirds figure and so on, 

isn't it fair to say that you're probably going to get 

down to something like 10,000 people or 10,000 plus who 

are going to be affected in the sense that they're going 

to have to scurry around if, if they're going to get the 

appropriate ID?

 MR. FISHER: And at that level, you're 

talking about less than a half a percent of the total 

electorate. This is -- this is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But 10 -- isn't the 

concern over 10,000 voters a sufficiently substantial 

concern to -- to be considered as something more than 

merely de minimis and is something that should count in 

a facial challenge?

 MR. FISHER: Well, if that's going to be the 

case, then you're going to have a big problem with voter 

registration, which is a far bigger problem for more 

voters. That is a procedure that the Court has long 

accepted, has endorsed multiple times, and yet continues 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we haven't 

endorsed -- I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but we 

haven't endorsed a registration procedure that would 

require as much documentation and as much travel as --

as the -- as this voter ID procedure would have.

 MR. FISHER: The point I'm making is that if 

we're going to look at the percent conceivably burdened 

by the law, then voter registration is called into 

question. And I don't think that the Democratic Party 

argues against that. I think in their reply brief they 

accepted that that's a possible response.

 Now, it's also terribly significant that we 

don't have anybody in front of this Court in this case 

who's injured by this law.

JUSTICE SCALIA: And why, why can't the 

people injured by this law appear themselves and say the 

law can't be applied to us? You seem to accept that a 

facial challenge is appropriate here. Why is -- some 

different kind of a facial challenge. I thought in the 

usual facial challenge you have to show that there is no 

situation in which the law cannot be constitutionally 

applied.

 MR. FISHER: I agree with that. I don't 

think that that -- that we take any issue with that 

notion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then why are we arguing 

about whether there is one half of one percent of the 

electorate who may be adversely affected and as to whom 

it might be unconstitutional? That one half of one 

percent, if and when it is sought to be applied to them, 

have a cause of action to say you can't apply it to me. 

But why -- what precedent is there for knocking down 

this entire law on a facial challenge when I think 

everybody agrees that in the vast majority of cases it 

doesn't impose a significant hardship?

 MR. FISHER: None. I think that that's 

exactly the point. That's why we argue there's no 

standing.

going to take the -- if this Court takes the Salerno 

standard, there can never be a facial challenge to a 

registration requirement, a voter ID requirement. In 

other words, it's not merely that this facial challenge 

would be knocked out; there never could be one.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure that's the 

case. And if you look back at Marston, the voter 

registration --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Salerno says unless there 

are no cases, the facial challenge is inappropriate. 

And that -- in the real world that will never be true 

with respect to a -- a voter ID law, will it?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I hope not. But I think 

that the Court has shown --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It never will be true, will 

it?

 MR. FISHER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It never be -- if that's 

going to be the standard, there will never be a facial 

challenge.

 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure that that's 

terribly significant, because if you have an as-applied 

challenge --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There never will be there 

one, will there?

I don't know why not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, as to a pre-enforcement 

facial challenge to a law like this.

 MR. FISHER: I think it could be 

pre-enforcement and as-applied in a way that could have

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I want you to 

answer my question.

true.

 MR. FISHER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that scare you, 

Mr. Fisher, that there can't be a facial challenge?

 MR. FISHER: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, every facial 

challenge is an immense dictum on the part of this 

Court, isn't it?

 MR. FISHER: I think that's right.

and looking at the ceiling and saying, oh, we can 

envision not the case before us, but other cases. Maybe

it's one half of one percent or maybe it's 45 percent, 

who knows. But we can imagine cases in which this law 

could be unconstitutional, and therefore, the whole law 

is unconstitutional. That's not ordinarily the way 

courts behave, is it?

 MR. FISHER: I should hope not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, we've done that in the 

First Amendment area.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That is not the case that 

you are confronting.

 MR. FISHER: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, the reason they 

are bringing a facial challenge is because the horse is 

going to be out of the barn. They will have the 

election, and just what they are afraid of could happen, 

that the result will be skewed in favor of the opposite 

party, because there are people who have not been able 

to vote. So, if you're going to talk about what is the 

impact of this, they are in this bind after the 

election -- well -- they've always -- already lost that 

one.

 Now, there is something in the briefs that 

happened after this case was instituted, but we know 

from Marion County that there were 34 people who were 

not able to have a vote counted. And of those 34, only

two ended up qualifying after the fact. So, we know 

that in that one particular county, most of the people 

who were unable to satisfy the requirement initially 

ended up not satisfying it.

 Is that -- I mean that's not hypothetical. 

That's real. But it does give you some confirmation 

that it isn't mere speculation that there are going to 

be many people who will not -- whose vote will not 

count.

 MR. FISHER: With respect, Your Honor, for 

all we know, those may have been fraudulent ballots. It 

may well be the case that all 32 did not show up to 

validate their votes are fraudulent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the same board that 

said in all our experience, in all of our memory, there 

has never been an impersonator.

 MR. FISHER: And that goes back to how we 

would know, because without an ID check, it's impossible 

to detect this kind of fraud.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're worried 

about fraud --

MR. FISHER: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you're worried about 

fraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it 

through with you, is the registration system. As I read

the Indiana voter registration application, all a person 

has to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility 

bill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't 

have a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his 

Social Security; and if he doesn't have that either he 

doesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a 

number -- and you mail it in. And you're registered.

 So all a person who have to do if he wants 

to be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and 

he has a photo ID; he can go to the polls. So my 

question to you is this: given that system of 

registration, focusing on the issue before us, why don't 

you just say and we'll give to you -- you put on -- if 

you don't have a photo ID, we'll give you one. Now 

there it would not stand as an obstacle; that apparently 

is what Georgia has done. And it doesn't require people 

to go out and spend $10 or $5 or something digging up 

their birth certificate, which if you tried to do, is 

quite a job for many people.

 And therefore, you'd have all the things you 

want. All you would do is with the 43,000 people who 

don't have the IDs, you'd say we'll get you one. No big 

deal. You have a photo machine there when they come in 

to register; they have to go down; you take a picture of 

them and you hand it to them. And I would think that

that less restrictive way would satisfy your anti-fraud 

interests far better than the way you've chosen, but I 

leave my judgment out of it. I just would like you to 

talk through why that isn't a less restrictive way, 

which is far better in achieving your anti-fraud 

interests, or at least as good.

 MR. FISHER: Well, because I think we want 

to have an idea that has some integrity to it. I mean, 

this is a balancing test that the legislature itself 

went through, which is to say they wanted to adopt a 

form of identification that might be effective and has 

been proven effective and has been accepted the world 

over as the standard form of identification. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: We are going to give -- all 

we are doing is, we will give you the photo. It has 

nothing to do with validity. That photo proves that 

Mr. Smith who comes in and asks for it is the same 

Mr. Smith who registered to vote. And that's all your 

system does in the first place. So what is the answer 

to that?

 MR. FISHER: I think again that we, on the 

front end part of it is we are hamstrung on how we can 

regulate voter registration, in part by the National 

Voter Registration Act. Let me just make that part of 

it clear.

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not arguing about that. 

I'm saying your whole -- I'll repeat it once more. I'm 

saying your whole system is a system designed to assure 

that the person at the voting booth is the same as the 

person who registers. I accept that, absolutely right. 

And I'm simply saying given that, why didn't you say 

Mr. Proto -- Mr. Likely, like to register: "Come in. 

If you don't have a photo ID, we will give you one." 

Now, what's the objection to that?

 MR. FISHER: I think in part it's the 

administrative apparatus. I mean, we are buying into --

right now into a system that already exists, and in fact 

with voter registration at the DMV as it's required, in 

many ways that is what you have. You go to the DMV 

anyway for other things.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you -- you have 

your photograph taken when you register. You're really 

an out of state person, you go in and register, you make 

up an address, you come in, you have your photograph 

taken; it proves that you were the person that 

registers. It doesn't prove that you were the person 

that lives at that address, or that you are of such and 

such an age and whatnot, which the -- the means of 

identification that you require would show, wouldn't it?

 MR. FISHER: No, we don't. That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't, can you?

 MR. FISHER: I think there are problems with 

that. That -- that was a different battle --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And even so is, there 

anything that prohibits the State from confirming the 

validity of the registration at the polling place?

 MR. FISHER: No. I think that's the main 

point here, which is it's at that point where the ballot 

is being cast, which is where we want identification, 

and where we want to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why wouldn't you have the 

same from in being sure the registration is correct? I 

don't understand that.

 MR. FISHER: Well, we -- well, I think we 

may very well, but I think the policy --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why wouldn't you require 

photo ID then?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the policy struck 

nationally, under the motor voter, is to have an easy 

registration system, so that it may be problematic to 

introduce additional limits.

it tougher to vote than to register? That doesn't make 

sense to me.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the theory is 

easy --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The national policy it to 

make it both easy to register and easy to vote.

 MR. FISHER: Well, and tough to cheat, 

hopefully, is the backside of that, which is what the 

idea is trying to do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, you make 

-- rely on the argument that 40 percent of the 

registrants -- or not registrants, the people on the --

yes, registrants -- on the voter list are -- are not 

accurate. That argument is a little difficult to -- to 

take because what you're saying is we do such a lousy 

job on registration that we should be able to do a --

have a more stringent voting requirement. Why do you do 

such a lousy job on registration?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think that -- that part 

of the responsibility there does lie again with the 

National Voter Registration Act which limits how we may 

maintain those lists. The problem has grown since --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you were 

sued by the Federal Government because you did such a 

bad job.

MR. FISHER: There may be -- there's part of 

it is the responsibility on our end, but part of it is 

also the -- the hoops we have to jump through pursuant 

to the National Voter Registration Act, and we've got a 

situation unfortunately where with inflated voter lists, 

with reports of fraud around the country, the General 

Assembly is generally concerned about voter confidence 

and the legitimacy of elections, and that's precisely 

what this law is trying to target. Trying to reassure 

voters --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does Indiana stack up 

against other States in the inflation of the voter 

rolls?

 MR. FISHER: We are among the most inflated. 

I can't give you precise ranking but the expert that we 

brought forward said we are among the most inflated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are under a 

consent decree to do something about that?

 MR. FISHER: That's right, and we are taking 

those steps. Now I think it's important to bear in mind 

that -- that the parties to the consent decree at the 

State level, while they can't identify individuals who 

have -- have dormant registrations, and they can send 

those names, names that can be canceled to the local 

authorities, the local authorities are under no -- no

responsibility under the consent decree or otherwise to

we had indicated that there were a number -- in 1998, I 

think -- a number of duplicates and decedent 

registrations that were sent to the local authorities, 

only 30 percent of which were canceled.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you making the 

argument that you can place a heavier burden on voters 

to identify themselves because your State officials 

refuse to follow the law?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's part of it, 

is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I think that's the argument 

you were just making.

 MR. FISHER: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Even when we identify the 

duplicates, the local officials are still leaving them 

in the polls. I mean, surely you're not going to rest 

your case on that, are you?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the larger point 

is that when we've got a situation where there is an 

obvious gap in security at the polls, where the public 

expects to show ID -- and -- as they would in any 

ordinary, everyday situation -- that is going to create 

a lack of confidence, particularly when combined with

argument that there's a lack of confidence because our 

local officials won't cull the rolls of dead voters.

 MR. FISHER: Not explicitly. That is true; 

that's part of the argument, but the other part is that 

there is a reasonable and obvious step to take to ensure 

that there is no fraud at the polls.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe there is a 

reasonable, obvious step you can take to make your 

officials obey the law when you tell them how to do it.

 MR. FISHER: Well, we are limited even at 

that by the NVRA.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now wait a minute. Are you 

telling me that you are limited by some Federal statute 

from preventing local officials -- I'm sorry, from 

forcing local officials to take the action to cull the 

rolls of dead voters, when you have identified those 

dead voters for them?

 MR. FISHER: No, I'm not saying that, but I 

am saying --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then it's Indiana's 

responsibility to cull those rolls. Right?

No, not at all.

 MR. FISHER: No, that's not my theory. But 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One aspect of your system 

-- I know your time is about to expire -- but it seems 

to me that every indigent person in -- who doesn't have 

a photo ID is put to a burden that the mass of voters 

are not put to -- that is either the two-step process 

and not going to my local precinct, but having to go to 

the county courthouse. That burden is on every indigent 

person who doesn't have a photo ID, so we are not 

speculating about numbers. That would be true for every 

indigent person who doesn't have photo ID, right?

 MR. FISHER: Who -- right, and who would 

have to pay a fee to get -- to get the ID.

absentee without ID. But anybody who forgets their 

identification on election day, for example, would have 

to go through the same process, where they would cast a 

provisional ballot and then have to return to the clerk 

with in 10 days.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they can go home 

and get the identification and go back to their 

precinct; that's what the indigent can't do.

doesn't have ID but then needs to go to the DMV.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we thought that the 

birth certificate requirement for indigent people was --

was burdensome, are there any States that have 

alternates to birth certificates? Do neighbors come in 

and testify that this is the person? And I was going to 

ask the Petitioners' counsel if there's some areas where 

this statute -- where the central purpose and the 

central function of this statute can be preserved but 

there can be some reasonable alternatives for people who 

have difficulty?

category where there are some reasonable alternatives. 

With respect -- in Indiana -- with respect to the 

elderly who can swear that they were never issued a 

birth certificate, there is an alternate means of 

identification, but that's the only category.

 The other thing we run into is the REAL ID 

Act. If Indiana wants to have an identification card 

that can be acceptable in Federal facilities, it's going 

to have to have minimal criteria for issuing those photo 

identifications. And so I think with respect to that, 

it would not be permissible to get around a birth 

certificate, which is kind of a foundational document. 

I mean there are alternatives, such as a passport, but I 

don't -- you know, I don't mean to suggest that that's 

necessarily going to be easier than it is to get a birth 

certificate. It's just that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you need a birth 

certificate to get a passport?

 MR. FISHER: Well, that's what I mean.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. So maybe that's 

unconstitutional too.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FISHER: Yes. And it -- it's worth 

bearing in mind that this form of identification is 

necessary to do so many everyday activities, and it's

not as if the State of Indiana went out and created an 

entirely new system to impose on the entire electorate, 

that everybody would have to start from square one. The 

vast majority of voters are already in compliance with 

this law, and the decision of the General Assembly, that 

it is a reasonable step to take for a measure of 

election security to bring the State's voting system 

into the 21st century and to require the same photo 

identification that you have to show typically to get on 

an airplane, to get into many Federal courthouses, is a 

reasonable step in the right direction to preserve voter 

confidence.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

 Any system of voting that involves

Accordingly Petitioners cannot take issue that the 

constitutionality of some mechanism for ascertaining 

voter ID. And I take it from today's argument that they 

would concede the constitutionality of a signature match 

requirement. Likewise, nobody can really dispute the 

proposition that a government-issued photo ID is an 

awfully good way of verifying someone's identity.

 So the dispute really boils down to, in a 

system where the States can legitimately ask for some 

kind of basis to ascertain ID, can they insist on a 

particularly good one, the photo ID? And we would 

suggest that there's nothing in the First or Fourteenth 

Amendments that precludes that from happening.

 Now, with respect to the nature of this 

challenge, I think one thing that's very evident from 

the questions is this was a challenge that was brought 

to the statute on its face and was brought before there 

was any enforcement of the statute or any significant 

enforcement of the statute. Now, I would respectfully 

suggest that there's a better way to test the 

constitutionality of these statutes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that, 

General Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the 

one group of people where I think you can make a facial 

challenge and may not all speculating, and that's the

indigent people who can't get -- don't have the photo 

ID. They don't drive, and they can't get up the money 

to get the birth certificate or whatever else. They do 

have a burden that, it seems to me, the State could 

easily eliminate if they want those people to vote, and 

that is to say okay, do the affidavit, the whole thing 

in your local precinct; we'll make it easy for you and 

not send you away, send you off to the county courthouse 

to get it validated. Why -- why, if you really wanted 

people to vote, wouldn't you do it that way?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

mean I can understand that you're concerned with that 

aspect of the statute and the fact that you can't 

execute an indigency affidavit in the polling place. I 

don't know why that's a basis for a facial challenge 

though. In particular, I think if you look at the 

Plaintiffs, the individual members, if they are members 

of the Indiana party that have been identified, they've 

certainly identified people who do not have the ID 

currently. I'm not sure that they were specific as to 

whether they were indigent or not. I'm not sure the 

individuals, the nine individuals, were really parsed 

out that way. And I would think the far better way to 

go about dealing with that issue is to take as a 

starting point -- I mean you pointed out that there were

32 provisional ballots cast in the Marion County 

election. Now, I gather from the State that's something 

like 0.02 percent of the ballots cast. So it suggests 

that this is not a monumental problem, but those 32 

provisional ballots seem to me to be 32 possible 

plaintiffs with a much more concrete case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- than anything we have 

before us.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just on -- just on that 

one class of people.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's not going to 

change after the election. I mean here is a group of 

people who are being put to a burden of going someplace 

else. And my only question is, why couldn't the system 

make it easy for them if we really want to help America 

to vote, all Americans, and say we'll do it in the local 

precinct, somebody will be there to help you fill out 

the affidavit, instead of doing it in a way that's 

really going to discourage people from voting?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And, Justice Ginsburg, I 

mean I see your concern, and I think if we had an 

as-applied challenge that wasn't this kind of grab bag 

challenge that looks at all the various different

classes of people that might be adversely affected, if 

we had a challenge that focused on that particular 

issue, I would imagine -- I don't know for sure -- I 

would imagine that the State would probably put on some 

evidence that says, look, there's a reason we did it 

that way; we piggybacked on the general provisional 

ballot provisions and what we decided is that, if we had 

people executing indigency affidavits at the polling 

place, it would add to the lines as the the polls.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They didn't make that 

argument now. I mean we don't have to wait until after 

an election to hear that, any more than we have to wait 

until after an election to identify the voters that 

Justice Ginsburg has.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But with respect, Justice 

Souter, I mean that's not the way this challenge 

proceeded. I mean there was a challenge to everything 

under the sun, to the whole sort of -- this statute ab 

initio, and it wasn't something that really put the 

State on notice that that was the nub of the dispute and 

would put evidence in the record that might join the 

issue.

 And again I would say, of course, if there 

were that kind of as-applied challenge, one of the 

virtues of it would be that the remedy at the end of the

day would not be to strike the statute down on its face, 

but it would be an injunction consistent with the 

teaching of this Court in Nayot that said, look, you 

need to have -- you need to be enjoined to offer the 

affidavits at the polling place --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be a --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be a virtue, but 

one of the vices would be that it would be after the 

election and the entire matter would be academic for 

another 2 years, until another 2 years had passed.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so. I 

mean, at this point, like I said -- I mean we have these 

32 potential plaintiffs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The provisional ballots 

would be counted, I assume.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: What's that?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The provisional ballots 

would be counted. The ones that were unconstitutionally 

prevented from voting -- those claims would be counted.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, if the claim could 

be brought in sufficient time, I suppose it would.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if we assume that 

everyone who has a decent claim under this Act went 

through the hoops to get the provisional ballot at the

-- wherever the county office is and --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's an assumption 

which need not necessarily be made.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But, conversely, nowhere 

is it -- nowhere is it a rational assumption that all 32 

of these individuals has a great claim. It may be that 

some of them are people who just forgot their ID --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not 

concentrating --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- and for those people I 

don't think they have much of a claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I was trying to deal with 

this one category of person, and the State -- it was 

addressed, and the State said, well, we can't do it that 

way because that will lead to congestion at the polling 

place. But it seems to me that that is powerfully hard 

to reconcile with the claim that there are so few of 

these people it's not really a problem. If there are so 

few of them, then I don't understand why they should be 

put to the burden of going someplace other than the 

polling place.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

mean I think there's a rationale justification for that 

which is that, you know, if -- especially if there are

only a handful of these people, is do you really want to 

instruct every poll worker at every precinct on how to 

deal with this unusual situation or do you want to say, 

you know, that's sort of an outlying situation, let's 

instruct one poll worker at the county elections office 

how to deal with it?

 Now, at the end of the day, you may not be 

persuaded that that's the way to do it. I think that's 

a reasonable argument, but an as-applied challenge could 

focus like a laser beam on those particular voters and 

those challenges. You could have particular indigent 

voters in front of you.

 And it seems to me that that's the 

preferable way to adjudicate this kind of claims, and I 

think what this Court could do is this Court could 

reject the facial challenge that is before it here that 

leave open the possibility of that as-applied challenge, 

or one could certainly imagine a veteran who has a 

Federal photo ID without an expiration date who comes 

into court and says, look, it's irrational to make me go 

get a different form of ID. That as-applied challenge 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we did that, I assume 

challenges could be made in advance of the election.

they couldn't be. I mean it might depend a little bit 

on the nature of the challenge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably the 

challenges could be adjudicated. You have 10 days to go 

down to the courthouse when you file a provisional 

ballot, and if it turns out the election was decided by 

three votes and there are 30 provisional ballots, 

presumably the challenge can be brought at that point as 

well.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That is true, and there is 

a provision for judicial review under Indiana law, of 

the provisional ballots, if there's an ongoing dispute. 

But I also take the point that some of this could be 

taken care of well in advance of the election, which is 

actually, I think, a very healthy way to deal with 

election disputes. And so my hypothetical veteran with 

the card, he has got the card in his wallet right now, 

or her wallet right now. They can go get --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not unrealistic to 

assume it would be easier to file a lawsuit and go off 

with the burden of litigation rather than go back to get 

the second affidavit? If you're challenging two 

affidavits, you know, to have a Federal case over it 

seems a little bit improbable.

Justice Stevens, that it's easier to get somebody to 

help you out with the Federal case than it is with the 

second -- with the second affidavit. I don't know. I 

mean, you know, I think if you look around where there 

have been these laws --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Things called class 

actions, right?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. I think, if you look 

where there have been these laws, there have been -- the 

one observed phenomenon definitely is litigation.

 So I do think that these claims will be 

brought. I just really think that in choosing the mode 

of litigation, you know, Justice Kennedy for the Court 

in the partial-birth case said that as-applied 

challenges are the basic building block of adjudication.

 And this seems like a particularly 

appropriate case to apply that lesson, because I can 

imagine there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there 

is standing in this case to bring the facial challenge?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think it's a close 

question, Mr. Chief Justice. I would say that I think 

there is standing. I think the standing that exists 

here is the standing to represent the nine or so 

individuals that are addressed specifically on pages 49a

and 51a of the district court opinion. Those are 

individuals who do not have photo IDs.

 I think that as to the membership issue, 

boy, if the Indiana Democratic Party has any members, 

its probably these individuals, because they are poll 

workers and active in the parties.

 And what I would say about those 

individuals, though, is that it is telling that the only 

individuals they have been able to identify who don't 

have photo IDs also happen to be elderly individuals who 

can, by right, vote by absentee ballot.

 Now, that's not to say -- and I would -- I 

would concede there is a legally protected interest in 

voting in person sufficient to cross the Article III 

threshold. But I think, when you are looking for the 

real world impact, it is telling that the people they 

have been able to identify do have a ready mechanism 

available to them.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you look at the real 

world impact and you ask whether the Democratic Party 

has standing to challenge the law, is it relevant that 

the State legislature is split entirely on party lines?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: May I answer the question? 

You know, I don't think that's relevant in this -- I 

would hate to think that a party line vote would

necessarily give the other party standing as a general 

rule.

 I don't think that you would adopt that, and 

this goes out of the record, of course, to a recent 

study. But the one study that's been done actually 

shows that the Democratic Party did well in the 2006 

elections, and turnout went up a little bit.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you think it's 

fair to infer that this law does have an adverse impact 

on the Democrats that is different from its impact on 

the Republicans?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, if I could 

answer, I mean I would just say that, you know, if this 

was a cleverly designed mechanism by the Republican 

Party to disadvantage the Democratic Party, at least in 

2006 it looks like it went pretty far awry from their 

perspective.

Clement. Mr. Smith, three minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

law in the country. And what you have when you look at 

the range of laws that are out there in other States is 

a very different set of responses that occur when a 

voter shows up without an ID in hand.

 In Michigan and several other States, for 

example, the response is to say: All right, we are 

going to make you fill out an affidavit attesting to who 

you are, and that you are a registered voter; that you 

live in this precinct; and we'll let you go ahead and 

vote a regular ballot.

 That in those States they -- they consider 

that a sufficient safeguard while looking at the IDs of 

all the people who have the IDs.

 In Florida they have a different approach, 

which is to let you vote a provisional ballot, and then 

what they do is they judge your signature match later on 

in exactly the same process that's used for absentee 

ballots.

 We have a lot of information in this record 

about why it's okay to have absentee ballots allowed 

without an ID in Indiana, and they say, well, we have 

these specialized committees that know how to do 

signature matches; and they are trained; and so we get 

thousands of these absentee ballots in. But we can very 

carefully scrutinize them.

thing with respect to the provisional ballots cast by 

people who show up without their ID without --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who do you do with 

illiterates who don't have a signature? Do you match 

"Xs," or what?

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there going to be 

problems under any system you imagine?

 MR. SMITH: Yes, there are; and it's this 

Court's job under the Burdick line of cases to weigh the 

benefits and the burdens and come out with the 

appropriate decision about whether the legislature went 

too hard -- far.

 Let me talk a little bit about this facial 

versus as-applied approach. To paraphrase King Lear: 

That way lies madness, Your Honor. This Court has never 

looked at these issues on an as-applied basis.

 The Burdick test, in its very nature, is 

about facial weighing of systemic benefits and burdens 

from the particular rule. And there is a reason for 

that, because the concern is systemic; that the burdens 

that are being imposed, a whole range of them depending 

on the kind of people involved and their particular 

circumstances, will have an effect on the outcome of the

election overall.

 Imagine, if you will, what it would be like 

to try to have all these class actions being brought, 

some by the people who don't have IDs, some by the 

people who have IDs but don't have enough money. You 

would have to figure out exactly how much money people 

are allowed to have in order to be in this exempt class.

 The courts would then be creating exempt 

classes, trying to decide whether the legislature would 

have wanted an exemption drawn or not. The whole thing 

would be a complete and utter morass. And, ultimately, 

even if you did carve out an exception for indigent 

people or for some other group of people, you ultimately 

would leave untouched the real problem, which is the 

concern that even for people who are relatively --

suffer relatively minor inconvenience, maybe one percent 

of them are not going to show up and vote.

 And that's exactly what the legislature may 

have been trying to accomplish here. So that is not the 

way the jurisprudence in this area ever looks at it. 

Nobody applied the poll -- nobody challenged the poll 

tax as-applied.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to invalidate 

a statute on the ground that it's a minor inconvenience 

to a small percentage of voters?

MR. SMITH: That it imposes a range of 

burdens on people from quite severe to less severe, and 

those burdens vastly outweigh the -- any incremental 

state interest that is being served, Your Honor.

 That's our -- our analysis, and I think it's 

certainly completely consistent with every decision 

right up through Klingman a couple of years ago. That's 

the test that this Court applies.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said it serves 

no purpose. What if we determine that it does serve a 

purpose in preventing fraud. How are we supposed to 

weigh that against your asserted burden on the right to 

vote?

 MR. SMITH: Well, you have to make some 

judgment about the incremental, additional benefit above 

what's already been in place for decades, and it worked 

extremely effectively, Your Honor. And, obviously, you 

do the balancing. I'm just the advocate here. But it 

seems to me you have to say is there any real benefit 

here compared to these burdens?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you want to talk 

about increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our 

judgment does more harm than good; whether -- whether 

the remedy for -- for the inconvenience to a small 

number of people is to wash away the whole statute,

which in most of its applications is perfectly okay? 

Why don't we do that weighing of benefits and burdens of 

increments versus needs?

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think the 

number of people who are adversely affected is part of 

the analysis. But if you come in and you come to the 

conclusion that there is essentially no real, 

significant benefit from making all of these other 

people who have IDs show them, then the balance comes 

out that you throw the law out. That's the way the 

analysis works.
