CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-7412, 

Graham v. Florida. 

Mr. Gowdy. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. GOWDY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Sentencing an adolescent to life without any 

possibility of parole condemns him to die in prison and 

rejects any hope that he will change for the better. 

This sentence, like the death penalty, cruelly ignores 

the inherent qualities of youth and the differences 

between adolescents and adults. At --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you urging that in 

all cases, including homicide cases? Or are you drawing 

the line at homicide? 

MR. GOWDY: We are -- we are drawing the 

line, Your Honor, at -- at non-homicide cases because we 

recognize under the Eighth Amendment that we must look 

at societal consensus, and society has said that murder 

is different and has said that in the sentencing 

practices, as demonstrated by the fact that outside of

Florida judges and juries have imposed this sentence on 

just 30 non-homicide offenders in just 6 States. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thirty-eight States 

allow this sentence, though, don't they? 

MR. GOWDY: Thirty --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thirty-eight, 39. I 

know you have a little dispute, but the vast majority of 

States allow the imposition of this sentence. 

MR. GOWDY: The vast majority allow it and 

they have for some time, and we believe that the fact 

that it has been allowed for so long and imposed so 

rarely, as the States themselves have admitted, is -- is 

strong evidence of societal consensus. 

JUSTICE ALITO: You’re making a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the 

gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances 

of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely. 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I would -- I would 

disagree. I would -- if -- if there's 30 -- 31 States 

that have allowed it and have never imposed it, in -- in 

our judgment, that -- that's evidence that it's very 

unusual, and you couple that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No sentence can be -- can 

be imposed rarely?

JUSTICE SCALIA: When a sentence is imposed 

rarely, it becomes unconstitutional? 

MR. GOWDY: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not your position? 

What --

MR. GOWDY: Our position is that you are 

looking at two things. One, is it cruel? It's cruel 

because life without parole is unique, is particularly 

cruel to adolescents because it -- it gives up on the 

adolescent and determines that he is forever unfit to 

live in civil society. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't make it crueler 

to him. I don't see why it's any crueler to an 

adolescent than it is to -- what -- where do you draw 

the line? At 21? 

MR. GOWDY: We draw the line at 18, the same 

line that the Court drew in Roper. And it's cruel 

because of the inherent -- the inherent qualities of 

youth. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And you are making a per se 

argument, no? You can imagine someone who is a month 

short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no 

matter what this person does, commits the most horrible 

series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a

whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render 

the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter 

what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse 

whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine, 

cannot -- that person must at some point be made 

eligible for parole. That's your argument? 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, that's -- that's 

correct. The life -- yes. A life with parole sentence 

would be constitutional, and that may mean that person 

you describe still spends his entire life in prison, but 

life with parole gives some hope to the adolescent who 

has an inherent capacity to change. It gives him some 

hope that later in time he may be released. 

JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And so if it’s --

JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you, at 

what point must the parole consideration be given? 

There is a suggestion in your brief that maybe the 

Colorado statute, which says that a person can get 

parole consideration after 40 years, would be 

constitutional. Is that your position? 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, our position is that 

it should be left up to the States to decide. We think 

that the -- the Colorado provision would probably be 

constitutional. We will have to see what different

States do. I mean, but -- but, yes, even that long 

amount of time would give at least some hope to the 

adolescent offender. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole 

system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of 

20 applicants? 

MR. GOWDY: I think all that would have to 

be required, Your Honor -- I think that would be 

sufficient. All that would have to be required is a 

meaningful opportunity to the adolescent offender to 

demonstrate that he has in fact changed, reformed, and 

is now fit to live in society. It -- that's all. 

That's all we are asking for. 

We are not asking that it be automatic right 

to get back out. If Terrance Graham or Joe Sullivan --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 

your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite 

rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life 

without parole. But if you concede that it's all right 

to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration 

where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it 

suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty 

artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case 

we will get is somebody with life with parole after

50 years. 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, first, I’m -- I’m 

not conceding that with 50. The question was asked 

about 40. But I understand --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you saying there 

is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a 

distinction between 40 and 50 in that case? 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I'm saying that this 

sentence that we are here today before is unequivocally, 

unmistakably a condemnation that you will never be 

released from prison, and so this sentence clearly falls 

on the line of being cruel because it tells an 

adolescent, for an adolescent mistake, you can never 

live in civil society. 

There will be other sentences that people 

will argue are the equivalent of this sentence, and --

and people may argue that with a 50-year sentence. But 

this sentence here is unequivocal, and there is no 

question that it’s cruel because of -- of the fact that 

it rejects any hope that the adolescent can be changed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a fact that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I’m interested in -- in 

two different things and you can address them during the 

course of your argument. One is the assumption of the 

argument seems to be that there are in place parole --

throughout all the States -- parole systems which are 

effective, which are operating, and that they have the 

capacity to make accurate judgments about 

rehabilitation. What can I read -- what -- what studies 

do you have to -- that -- that comment on that? 

Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think 

you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is 

something you go over very, very, very -- let's see --

that's Sullivan. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That’s the other case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me. That's 

Sullivan, yes. 

MR. GOWDY: With leave, I will let 

Mr. Stevenson answer about the procedural bar. 

But on the first question, Your Honor, I 

would point you to the amicus brief filed by the various 

correctional officers that talk about the types of 

programs that can be done. I think that that has -- is 

very thorough and -- and would answer it far better than 

I can in a couple minutes up here. 

But, yes, to answer short, we -- we believe 

that -- that the parole systems in place can be 

effective to do this, and in all seven States where 

there are currently non-homicide juvenile offenders, 

they all have functioning parole systems.

Even Florida has it. Even though it -- it 

abolished parole in 1983, Florida still has 6,000 

parole-eligible inmates and last year they heard over --

they made over 1,700 parole determinations. So the --

the administrative burden to the State of adding these 

–-

JUSTICE ALITO: But Florida has abolished 

parole, has it not, going forward? 

MR. GOWDY: Going forward, it has abolished 

parole --

JUSTICE ALITO: So eventually, if things are 

allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board 

will go out of business. 

MR. GOWDY: And Florida could choose to make 

that sentence and instead impose a sentence, as its 

prosecutor recommended here, a 30-year determinant 

sentence, if Florida doesn't want to reinstitute parole. 

We are not saying it has to do parole. That’s just one 

of several constitutional options. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would you do 

if there were a crime spree and there were different 

jurisdictions? One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years, 

the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served 

consecutively.

think that the -- that you would get into the question 

about whether that sentence is the equivalent of life 

without parole, and there could be an argument made that 

if you -- obviously, if you sentence someone to 150, 

200 years, there’s no conceivable hope of ever release, 

150 years without parole. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the second jurisdiction 

has the obligation, but not the first? Is that the way 

it works? 

MR. GOWDY: I would think that the -- if you 

had that -- I would think that the -- that the judge 

making that sentence would have to take that into 

consideration, that this sentence is going to -- based 

on all adolescent conduct -- it has to be all adolescent 

conduct, not if some of the conduct is post-juvenile. 

But, yes, I would think that the -- that the second 

sentencing judge would need to take that into 

consideration. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So he -- he could sentence 

up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of 

the person in prison? That -- that would be okay? 

MR. GOWDY: I -- I wouldn't say that would 

be okay, Your Honor. I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's he supposed to 

do? How many years can he give --

MR. GOWDY: I think there has to be some --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There obviously does. What 

do you propose? I propose, you know, 1 year before 

his life expectancy. 

MR. GOWDY: Your -- Your Honor, I think that 

would be coming so close to the -- the constitutional 

line, it would be -- it would be difficult to see that 

as constitutional, but -- but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, 1 year before life is 

also unconstitutional? 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Two years before life? 

MR. GOWDY: Your -- Your Honor, there would 

definitely be a -- a difficult line to draw at that 

case. Life without parole, though, is unequivocal. And 

even that sentence that you are describing, there is 

some difference between it and life without parole, 

because only life without parole makes the unequivocal 

assessment that the adolescent cannot be returned to 

civil society. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- you are 

arguing for a categorical rule. 

MR. GOWDY: Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the 

other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always 

permissible. But we have a precedent that suggests in 

-- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality 

of the sentence to the crime. 

Now, we know from Roper that death is 

different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are 

different. Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the 

consideration of the juvenile status into the 

proportionality review? So that if you do have a case 

where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his 

18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime 

spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that 

case life without parole may not be disproportionate. 

But if it's -- and I know you would argue 

that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous 

crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant 

involved, then in that case maybe it is 

disproportionate. 

Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive? 

And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have 

been discussing. 

MR. GOWDY: Well, two things: First, Your 

Honor, Roper states, and the science -- states it based 

on the science, that at that age we cannot make a

determination about whether or not the adolescent will 

or will not reform. Even an expert psychologist, 

psychiatrist cannot do it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I understand. 

But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that 

determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make 

that determination at 18 years 1 month. 

MR. GOWDY: Well, anywhere you draw the 

line, Your Honor, you're going to come up with an 

example where you are 1 day before or 1 day after, and 

the Court in Roper struggled with where to draw the line 

between maturity and immaturity, and it concluded, 

rightly so, to draw the line at 18 based on both the 

science and the legislative determinations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is because, 

as they told us, death is different. And you do -- once 

you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere. 

I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with 

you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent 

allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case­

by-case basis. 

MR. GOWDY: I think it's because adolescents 

are different. Adolescents are different in that we 

can't tell at this age whether they are going to reform 

or not. And all we are proposing is that an adolescent

not necessarily be released, but that he be given a 

later opportunity. And it boils -- it just comes down 

to adolescents are different, Your Honor, and the 

determination can't be made at age 17 even for the most 

heinous crimes that are committed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any difference 

in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than 

otherwise? I think you suggested in -- in your brief 

that educational and vocational training is not given to 

people who are in for life without parole because they 

will never be out on the street so they don't need to be 

transitioned back. 

MR. GOWDY: If I understand your question, 

would it be different if those type of programs are made 

available to life-without- --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is, first, 

you say that they are not available. 

MR. GOWDY: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- that’s so? 

MR. GOWDY: Yes, that is generally true. 

And the -- and the very website that the State of 

Florida cites makes a point of saying that the programs 

are for the purpose of reentry into society, and so 

those are obviously the opposite of what life 

without parole is. You are never going to reenter

society. And it's generally true that those programs 

are not available to offenders who get life without 

parole, and that's what makes the sentence so 

particularly cruel, to give up on a kid at that point in 

his life. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what are the terms of 

incarceration? They just stay in their cells and –-

MR. GOWDY: Well, Your Honor, I think it 

varies obviously by facility by facility. But the 

sentence means you are going to stay in your cell and 

die there. You are going to stay in your cell for 60 or 

70 years, whenever you reach your natural death, and die 

there. 

You know, they -- they do have some limited 

freedoms, as the State of Florida has pointed out, the 

same types of freedoms that people on death row have. 

But ultimately both sentences mean that you are going to 

die in a State-controlled institution. And they are 

very hopeless --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think -- the same 

kind of freedom that people on death row have? I --

MR. GOWDY: Well, the State makes the point 

in their brief, Your Honor, that you have the right to 

exercise your religion, you have the -- you have the 

right to petition the courts.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I doubt whether this 

varies. I -- I don't know of any principle where if you 

are in for life, you are in solitary. 

MR. GOWDY: Well, I’m not -- I’m not -- you 

are correct. I'm not suggesting they are in solitary 

confinement. But they are locked up for the rest of 

their life, and they're not allowed to rejoin civil 

society even if, as some of the former juvenile 

offenders who filed a brief in this case, can 

demonstrate that they have become model citizens. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And why isn't the -- the 

most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are 

raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to 

permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take 

into account the particular circumstances of the 

juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that 

you are advocating, which would deprive the State of 

Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some 

-- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are 

short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve

imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole? 

Some of the actual cases that -- in which 

this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve 

factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't 

have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them. 

Raping an 8-year-old girl and burying her alive. Are 

you familiar with that case? 

MR. GOWDY: I am not familiar with that 

particular case. No. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Raping a woman in front of 

her 12-year-old son and then forcing the son to engage 

in sexual conduct with the mother. Are you familiar 

with that case? 

MR. GOWDY: Yes, Your Honor, I am familiar 

with that case. 

Your Honor, the reason, first of all, the 

Court has said and said so clearly in Kennedy that 

murder is different. In the Kennedy decision, you also 

said: Horrible facts, someone who raped their 

stepdaughter. But yet this Court drew a line and 

exempted from capital punishment adult defendants who 

commit horrible crimes. 

But to get to the core of your question as 

to why not do it on a case-by-case basis, because you 

can only make the determination about the adolescent

later in life. And I -- we would agree that there 

should be a case-by-case determination as to -- as to 

whether or not that offender should spend his whole life 

in prison, but we say it needs to happen later, once he 

has matured, once he's reached past adulthood, because

JUSTICE SCALIA: You assume -- doesn't your 

argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is 

deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this 

person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no 

longer a problem, we should let this person out. But 

that isn't the only purpose of punishment that we've 

acknowledged. One of the purposes is retribution, 

punishment for just perfectly horrible actions. And I 

don't know why that value of retribution diminishes to 

the point of zero when it's a person who's, you know, 

17 years 9 months old. 

MR. GOWDY: We are not suggesting that it 

goes to the point of zero. We’re not -- and we concede 

the State has a right to -- to exact retribution from 

the juvenile offender. And in this case, 30 years would 

have been a lot of retribution for Terrance Graham, both

MR. GOWDY: Well, Your Honor, we -- but a 

Juvenile is -- not only does he have an inherent 

capacity to grow; he is less culpable. And so to exact 

the most -- for a non-homicide crime whether you are 

adult or juvenile, this is the most severe punishment 

you can receive, and to exact that most severe 

punishment for a less culpable offender that the Court 

has recognized is a less culpable offender doesn't -- is 

too much retribution. We are not saying the State can't 

exercise retribution, but that life without parole is --

is too much for those types of crimes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gowdy, can I ask this 

question? 

MR. GOWDY: Yes, Justice. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: If your client in this 

case had been processed in the juvenile system instead 

of the adult system, what would the maximum penalty he 

could have received been? 

MR. GOWDY: He would have had to have been 

released when he was 22 years. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the choice is between 

that short a term and an indefinite term? 

MR. GOWDY: No, no, Your Honor. We -- we 

concede that the State of Florida may continue to 

prosecute juveniles in adult court and that makes sense

in order to get a term of years that is longer than you 

can get in juvenile court. And in this case, if the 

judge had gone along with the prosecutor's 

recommendation, it would have meant a 30-year sentence 

for my client, which would have been far longer than he 

could have gotten in the juvenile court. Worse --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The logic in Roper 

was very straightforward. It says, "Death is reserved 

for the worst of the worst." I think that was the 

quote. We know that juveniles are not the worst of 

the worst, for the reasons you have articulated, that 

they are not fully developed, don't have moral sense to 

the same extent as an adult. But life without parole is 

not reserved for the worst of the worst, and so it seems 

to me that the logic of our precedent suggests that you 

can't necessarily rely on the juvenile status to exempt 

them from a penalty that is not reserved for the worst 

of the worst, but perhaps it makes sense to consider in 

a particular instance whether the penalty is 

disproportionate, given the juvenile's characteristics 

that you suggest. 

MR. GOWDY: Well, I guess we will come back 

to the point that I think life with parole would be a 

long sentence, and I don't -- I don't see how you can do 

it on a case-by-case basis at age 17. You can certainly

disproportionality review generally in Florida and

MR. GOWDY: There is no -- no. Under 

Florida law, there is no basis to challenge a sentence 

as being excessive or disproportionate as long as it's 

at the statutory maximum.

prior to our death penalty jurisprudence, either. And I

Federal law in the Solem case.

whether you'd have to create a -- a procedure that does 

not exist in Florida for proportionality review. 

MR. GOWDY: Well, there would -- it would 

have to be strictly Federal law. It would have to be a

Graham have gotten this sentence and that the only State 

that has actually imposed it for a first-time armed 

burglary is Florida. And it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a problem 

with that argument in this case, because the sentencing 

judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as 

a recidivist, not as a first-time offender. He said --

Graham got a very light sentence, just 12 months in 

detention and then 3 years' probation, and the judge 

said: Now, you better toe the line or else you could be 

put away for a long time. 

And then he committed -- it really was –-

the sentence was for the later activities, even though 

they weren't proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I think 

that Graham admitted to a couple of -- to more armed 

robberies. Isn't that so? 

MR. GOWDY: He -- he admitted to the police, 

and I don't want to get too much into the facts, but 

that -- but even if Your Honor concedes that he was 

convicted of all those crimes, which he was not 

convicted of, but the judge, as you say, correctly 

relied upon for this sentence, then we only have two 

States that we know of that have imposed life without 

parole for a recidivist robbery or burglary crime, and 

that's California and Florida.

his juvenile offense. And maybe, in these horrible 

crimes --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. MAKAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The categorical rule that Petitioner seeks 

here would undermine what Florida and other States have 

adopted in terms of juvenile justice. And in 

particular, it would go against three major trends, that 

being strong punishment for serious violent crimes by 

juveniles; second trend, transfer laws allowing 

juveniles to be treated as adults; those laws have been

enacted in the last 15 years --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't -- I didn't hear 

the second. 

MR. GOWDY: I'm sorry. 

The three trends are: The strong punishment 

for juveniles that States have enacted over the last 15-

20 years; the various transfer and waiver laws that 

States have enacted over the last 10, 15, 20 years 

allowing juveniles to be transferred into adult court; 

and then finally, what is really at issue is parole. 

Parole has been eliminated in many States. Fifteen 

States have totally eliminated it in the last 10, 15 

years. So what they are seeking is a categorical rule 

that goes against the national consensus and the 

national trend. 

The concession here was that Graham's 

sentence could be even up to life as long as there is 

the possibility of parole. We believe that’s very 

telling. In their brief, they point out that Graham 

could have been sentenced to something just short of his 

actuarial life. His actuarial life is around 64 years 

old, which means just about a 46-year sentence. 

And the standard that we suggest here is 

that there cannot be any categorical rule, for the

reasons Justice Alito pointed out. We have --

arguing for a categorical rule of your own. You are 

saying that under a -- under -- juveniles under the age 

of 18, what, it's never -- it can be never determinative 

that they are juvenile in setting the sentence as a 

matter of Federal law? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we do 

agree in Florida and other States as well that age does 

matter, and we ask that there be three things that the 

Court look at. 

First, look at the legislative structure. 

Florida structure doesn't -- Florida structure is a very 

balanced, thoughtful approach, in waiving children into 

the adult court only when it's a violent crime and only 

under certain -- when certain ages are in play. Look at 

the age. It does play a role. The judicial discretion 

plays a role. The trial judge --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: Is there 

a minimum age when a juvenile can be transferred to --

to adult procedures? 

MR. MAKAR: It's a three-tiered system, 

Justice Stevens. And let me --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm just interested 

in one. Is there a minimum?

MR. MAKAR: Yes. The way in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that an arbitrary line, 

or how do you -- how do we know it shouldn't be higher 

or lower than the line? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, the legislature has set 

the line at 14-15 for certain crimes and 16-17 for 

others. And then for indictment, where it goes to a 

grand jury, there is no age limitation. That has been 

on our books for the better part of 50, 60 years, 

allowing indictment -- allowing the grand jury to make a 

decision about whether the particular juvenile shall be 

brought into the adult court. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the -- what 

is your objection to an approach that when you are 

dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that 

your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of 

Federal law consider the juvenile status of the 

defendant before that sentence is imposed? 

MR. MAKAR: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, not 

a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes 

a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can 

never make a difference? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, sure. And as I say, 

there's the three factors I would ask the Court to look

at. 

First, the structure that we have here in 

Florida, which many States have, that deal with the age. 

Age does matter. Ninety-nine out of 100 juvenile 

offenders in our system do not go into adult court, and 

an even smaller percentage of that ultimately get into 

the adult sanctions. 

The trial judges in Florida, unless --

unless it’s a very violent crime, have some discretion 

to sentence as to age. If you look at the transcript 

here in the joint appendix, the trial judge here 

struggled with this, struggled with age, and said: 

Juvenile sanctions are inappropriate; youthful offenders 

-- youthful offender sanctions are inappropriate; I'm 

going to sentence you to -- to adult. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but could I interrupt 

with one question? Isn't it correct that the age is 

relevant on whether or not to transfer the person to the 

adult system, but once he's in the adult system, age is 

entirely immaterial? 

MR. MAKAR: That's not accurate, Justice 

Stevens. Under the statute 985.226, 227, and 225, we 

have a system in which the grounds are set for when 

juveniles can be either mandatorily or discretionarily 

brought into the adult system.

And then under the statute 985, the 

punishment is graduated. In other words, for the lower 

offenses, the juvenile sanctions must be considered and 

the youthful offender sanctions must be considered. 

It's only in certain limited instances, like indictment, 

where it's a life offense, where the juvenile has been 

indicted for life, that the trial judge is forced to do 

adult sanctions. 

In this case, Graham was under the 

discretionary direct -- direct file, meaning that the 

prosecutor had discretion whether to bring the case or 

not. He brought it into the adult system. Graham 

accepted being processed as an adult. He was put on 

probation, and then --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't understand. 

Just to make sure I get the point correct: After the 

decision has been made to have them prosecuted in the 

adult system, at that -- after that decision has been 

made, is the age of the defendant a relevant factor in 

sentencing? 

MR. MAKAR: The age -- they get a 

presentence report. The age is woven in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, but 

statutorily? As a matter --

specifically say the trial judge --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is no. It's --

under the statutes, it's totally irrelevant after he has 

been transferred to the adult stage. Is that correct? 

MR. MAKAR: Not exactly, because the range 

of remedies the trial judge can impose is based upon 

what method by which the juvenile was transferred or 

waived into the adult court. In Graham's case, he was 

allowed to have juvenile and youthful offender sanctions 

considered because of his age. I mean, that's the way 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean the trial judge 

under Florida law does not have discretion to choose a 

lower sentence because of the -- of tender years of the 

defendant? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, absolutely, the trial 

judge does. And you can see the trial judge here 

grappling with that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the statute doesn't 

draw any distinctions once he is in -- in the adult --

MR. MAKAR: I guess the answer to your 

question is there is no specific statute that says the 

trial judge shall consider age specifically.

proportionality balance here, we think that certainly 

Graham's offense certainly is off the scales and would 

be grossly -- probably be -- it would be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- that's one of 

the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might 

think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the 

prosecutor had a different judgment of it. And Florida 

doesn't have any kind of proportionality review, doesn't 

have any review -- appellate review of the sentences. 

MR. MAKAR: Well --

surprised everyone in the courtroom with the -- with the 

sentence. Certainly it was far beyond what the

MR. MAKAR: Well, the prosecutor recommended 

30 years, that's correct, and the judge here entered 

life. As I say, that translates into -- essentially a 

46-year actuarial life sentence. That was within the 

trial judge's discretion, and particularly given the 

seriousness of the offenses that Graham committed. We 

are talking about violence. 

And violence does matter. This Court has 

said -- and certainly in oral argument in Solem and 

others, the -- violence versus non-violent acts plays a 

major role in sentencing, and it should play a major 

role as well when it comes to juveniles. 

I don't read Roper to say that it takes off 

the table lengthy sentences for violent crimes by 

juveniles. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

MR. MAKAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think 

that it categorically violates the Eighth Amendment for 

a 10-year-old to be sentenced to life without parole? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, the answer to that is it 

certainly raises a concern about the age. Age does 

matter. And as the age goes down, it does.

because this is a less culpable person. 

MR. MAKAR: Sure. It matters -- I think it 

does matter and it certainly matters from a legislative 

perspective, from a judicial perspective, and from an 

Eighth Amendment perspective. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about historical 

perspective? I mean, you might appeal to the fact that 

at common law, which was in effect when the Cruel and 

Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted, 12 years was --

was viewed as the year when a -- when a person reaches 

the age of reason. And -- and the death penalty could 

not be inflicted on anyone --

MR. MAKAR: Well, certainly that historical 

perspective has --

Sotomayor, I think that the way age plays a role is that 

we -- in our system in Florida, we have no one under the 

age of 13. And that's sort of provides us --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have no one? What 

was your answer? 

MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry. No -- no one in our 

system is under the age of 13 with life without parole. 

You know, there are very --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that because judges 

haven't chosen to impose it or because your legal system 

doesn't permit it? 

MR. MAKAR: No, the legal system permits it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How young could the 

youngest person in Florida be to be prosecuted as an 

adult and be eligible for life --

MR. MAKAR: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- without parole? 

MR. MAKAR: Under the indictment statute, 

there is no age limitation. So, theoretically –-

that that would be certainly violative of the --

of what law? 

In other words, I understood your submission 

to be that there was nothing in Federal law that 

requires different consideration of age. So when you 

say age matters, why? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, we suggest that it may 

matter in a particular case, and when you get to the 

gross disproportionality --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the authority 

of what law? Age matters in a particular case because 

of --

MR. MAKAR: Well, I -- I -- I think our --

country's traditions recognize it --

Eighth Amendment?

think just -- certainly age matters in the legislative 

branch, judicial branch, executive branch. It matters 

that we look at the age and make considerations about it 

when Florida has made those considered judgments. 

What we are saying is that if the Court 

decides to go down the path that's perhaps fraught with 

more line-drawing than one can imagine and decides that 

age will be a part of the proportionality, it creates 

serious problems. But here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Why is 

that? If you go down on a case-by-case basis, there are 

no line-drawing problems. You just simply say age has 

to be considered as a matter of the Eighth Amendment. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And then we apply a 

totality of the circumstances test --

MR. MAKAR: Well -- well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which means whatever 

seems -- seems like a good idea. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we apply the 

proportionality review that we articulated in Harmelin,

the Court, they are on the violent side of the line. 

They are out in the tail of the distribution in terms of 

seriousness of the offense. So it would be the same 

result in either case. I think perhaps --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not seriously 

suggesting that the crimes at issue here are comparable 

to a rape or a permanent infliction of serious 

disability or any of those other very violent crimes 

that are close to homicide that Justice Alito spoke 

about? There is a quantitative and qualitative 

difference between those, isn't there? 

MR. MAKAR: There is, but the legislatures 

make the judgment about how they are going to punish 

those. And in Florida, we have --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if we -- if we 

have already said that you can't impose death on an 

adult who hasn't committed a homicide, an intentional 

death, and so for an adult the most serious sentence 

that we can give them is life without parole, why should 

that same sentence be given to a juvenile who we have 

recognized as being less capable than an adult? And why 

should we permit it for a crime that's not comparable to 

a homicide and/or something akin in seriousness to that? 

MR. MAKAR: Because it is still a very 

serious, violent crime. We are talking about weapons

and guns and people's lives at risk. And the 

legislature has made the judgment in Florida and other 

States to say that that type of crime --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't it true -- and 

I think one of my colleagues already questioned you --

that the prosecutor didn't think that this merited life 

without parole. Didn't the parole supervisor say that 

this young man, Mr. Graham, was compliant with other 

conditions of his probation? He went to school. He did 

other things. It does suggest some hope for him. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I think the prosecutor 

certainly offered up to 30 years. And the trial judge 

who, as you can tell from the transcript, was familiar 

that there were these home invasions going on around our 

county, that there had been a task force established, 

and so forth, the -- the trial judge was aware of that 

and the seriousness of it. In one instance, one of 

Graham's codefendants actually killed someone as a part 

of a home invasion. These were serious problems 

afflicting our community in Jacksonville. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why the 

co-perpetrators got so -- their sentences were 

dramatically lower. Do we know why that was so?

testified and basically assisted the prosecution, so I 

believe he got a lower sentence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because he assisted the

MR. MAKAR: Right. The third one is in 

jail, life without parole on a murder charge, life 

without parole on the same charge Graham has for another 

home invasion, and then has the other serious sentences.

without prison --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: For this very offense, 

this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other 

than Graham had gotten life without parole. 

MR. MAKAR: Well -- well, Graham got life 

without parole, and it relates back to his armed 

burglary with assault and battery. He got the life 

sentence under that charge, which is then all part and 

parcel of the violation-of-probation hearing. There

were these secondary -- these second incidences of home 

invasions where Meigo Bailey was the codefendant who got 

life for murder and also for armed burglary as a part of 

one of the home invasions. So they -- you know, they 

got serious punishment. This is a serious punishment 

that was meted out to them. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he -- how do you 

answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the 

immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a 

teenager at the point of sentencing? That it's only 

after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has 

this person overcome those youthful disabilities? 

That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't 

accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the --

your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make 

a judgment until years later to see how that person has 

-- has done. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we 

respect that, and certainly in Roper that was the 

linchpin to the decision. Here we are in a different 

context that deals with these -- these terms of years, 

and there -- there’s no constitutional right to parole. 

And certainly that is a purely legislative decision to 

be made, and States have said we are not going to have 

parole.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say the 

same thing of -- of adults, of somebody over 18. You 

really can't tell how redeemable this individual is 

until he is in prison for some time; and, therefore, you 

should not give anybody life without parole. They --

they may all be savable. So we should defer -- defer. 

We shouldn't have any non-parole sentences. Everybody 

should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that 

-- that many jurisdictions used to take. Wasn't that so 

MR. MAKAR: True. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when there was parole 

for everybody? 

MR. MAKAR: And it --- and it goes to the 

core of the State's sovereignty to decide what laws to 

enact. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Florida does -- and 

every State -- recognize the difference between an adult 

and a minor. And you have to make the line. We have it 

at 18. But think of the teenager can't drink, can't 

drive, can't marry. There are so many limitations on 

children just because they are children. 

MR. MAKAR: And, Justice Ginsburg, we ask 

that the same respect for our juvenile justice system be 

given to those laws enacted in Florida that protect the

-- the juveniles. It is the legislature on the ground 

there and seeing what’s going on in our State that makes 

these decisions about who can drive, who gets the right 

to have a tattoo, or who gets --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they don't make it on 

a case-by-case basis. They say no juvenile can drink --

no juvenile. 

MR. MAKAR: That's true but at the same --

by the same token, the juvenile justice system in 

Florida -- and keep in mind we had a juvenile justice 

division -- department established in 1994 because of 

the severe problems as we outlined in our brief -- that 

Florida has a -- has committed resources and -- and 

programs and so forth to the juvenile justice system. 

So given all of that, that what the Court -- I am sorry 

-- what the State has done as -- as to age, that's why 

we say that it matters. 

What we are concerned about is that to 

pursue the categorical rule that they seek, the Court 

would have to, of course, abandon the various firewalls 

that would stand between terms of years and also the 

death penalty. 

But, in addition, if the Court decides to go 

down the proportionality route, my concern is the five 

principles in the Harmelin concurrence about the States

having the ability to have diverse juvenile justice 

programs and not have the -- sort of a lawnmower coming 

through and making them all uniform. The Harmelin 

concurrence, Justice Kennedy, talked about the deference 

in structuring these. And there’s going to be 

differences. Some States are going to have the most 

harsh laws. The Eighth Amendment doesn't dictate any 

particular penological theory. There’s great -- and it 

-- it would turn the Eighth Amendment analysis on its 

head to first allow this diversity among the States and 

allow strong medicine for certain types of violent 

crimes and then to kind of compare them and say, well, 

gosh, Florida is unusual; it's different; and that 

shouldn't be the case whatsoever. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we look just at 

deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference 

in life and life without -- life with parole and life 

without parole is just not a factor in deterrence. I --

I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other, 

but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for 

that intuition. 

Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is 

concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume 

that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's 

interest in keeping the accused, the –- the

defendant in custody for the rest of his life if he has 

been rehabilitated and is no longer a real danger? 

What's the State's interest? 

MR. MAKAR: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you could say 

retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case 

basis deciding when there should be retribution. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I think certainly the 

State of Florida's interest as among other States is 

first of all to punish. Certainly I think deterrence 

plays a role. We recognize that deterrence may have 

less impact on some juveniles, but it doesn't have -- it 

doesn't have zero impact. It does have some impact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me the 

deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume 

rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, but the deterrence goes to 

those who would commit the same act. Rather than 

deterring this particular individual, it goes to others 

who --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the question 

is: Will the difference between life with parole and 

life without parole deter anybody? I mean any -- that

MR. MAKAR: Well, I don't -- I have not seen

it really matter or not. I think that as a matter of on 

the street people do talk about these things. I mean,

empiricism on whether the committed juvenile feels a lot 

better knowing that he will get out when he is 75 years 

old than he would feel knowing that he was there for 

life.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have empirical 

studies about how much that improves the spirits of the 

committed juvenile? 

MR. MAKAR: I -- I have seen none, and it --

it goes to the question here, which is that Graham will 

be serving a lengthy prison term. And what he is 

seeking is essentially the right to get out at some 

point in the future and even saying that 40 years would 

be --

Do any of the briefs or any of the materials with which 

you are familiar discuss the rate of -- the difference 

between the danger of recidivism of a young offender and 

one who is, say, 40 or 50 years old? 

MR. MAKAR: I -- I don't have that at my 

grasp, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me sort of 

-- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the 

same sort of point. It seems to me that the older 

people are less likely to be recidivists than the 

younger ones, but is -- is there any empirical evidence 

that says that’s an incorrect or correct judgment? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, in terms of recidivism, I 

think, number one, violence matters. I think there are 

studies -- I can't quite put my finger on -- that 

says that the violent offenders tend to recidivate more 

than the non-violent. And that as one ages -- I think 

Judge Posner has written a book called "Aging and Old 

Age" that talks about -- in one of its chapters about 

how age matters, and that crime rates go down as -- as 

the population ages. So I mean there are those sorts of 

things out there that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, along those 

lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus 

briefs. Do you have a study about what age cohort is

responsible for most violent crime? 

MR. MAKAR: There are -- there are studies 

everywhere, and I have looked at many of them, and it 

appears that it certainly increases from age 13, and it 

goes up to 14. And it keeps going up until about 16, 

17, and 18. It peaks. It depends on the crime, and it 

depends upon what jurisdiction, and so forth. But it 

tends to peak in the early 20s, the late teens or early 

20s. So that's -- that's -- I think that's typical. 

One thing I would point out that I haven't 

had a chance to say: The empirical question in this 

case, I think, is very important because they are asking 

that a constitutional rule be established on studies 

that have just been generated literally over this summer 

and have not been subject to meaningful review. 

We have a concern with that. We think that 

the definitional questions that they have raised, you 

know, about the offenses and what is life -- is life --

the studies tend to focus on life. But what is life? 

Well, in Florida we have some juveniles who are serving 

prison terms that have 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-year sentences, 

but they are not included within that study. 

We also have in this case, for example, 

Graham, he had a -- let's say that the judge decided to 

give him 30 years for the main offense and 15 for the

second and made them consecutive. That's 45 years. 

Graham's actuarial life --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we are not sure that 

those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because 

your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not 

willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence 

amounts to life without parole. Maybe a 70-year 

sentence does. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, they’ve conceded, in their 

brief, that what this all boils down to is that if 

Graham wins and he gets to go back and be resentenced, 

that either the Florida legislature has to pass a law to 

reinstitute parole for this category of offenders, or 

the trial judge could say, okay, the actuarial table 

says you are going to live to be 64.2, we're going to --

I'm going to sentence you to something less --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was 

a parole system still functioning, so -- although it 

will be phased out over time, but for people who 

were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think 

the suggestion was that that system would take care of 

the handful of people, not more than that, that this 

decision would involve. 

MR. MAKAR: There is still a parole board. 

Its functions have been minimized greatly. It has not

been applicable to anyone since 1983. It would take a 

legislative act or perhaps even an executive act of some 

sort to reinstitute that board and to take account of 

these cases. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us just a 

little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the 

policies with respect to rehabilitation programs? If 

they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they 

don't need rehabilitation programs or that they might 

need them more. 

Had the rehabilitation programs been 

increased or decreased since the phasing out of parole? 

Or is it about the same? Or are they -- are they 

non-existent? 

MR. MAKAR: No, no. They are in existence. 

I cannot specifically answer that, Justice Kennedy, 

because I don't know all the different programs that are 

available. There's the various programs that deal with 

drug offenses and alcoholism and so forth. 

And there -- there are certain educational 

programs. For example, when Graham was in the county 

jail -- that was the county versus the State -- he was 

able to go to school. 

I don't believe there is anywhere near sort 

of the total absence and deprivation, sort of a Weems

brief that are -- enable -- they are able to have 

familial relationships. They can have the Maslow's

emotional needs and so forth are still available to be 

met in prison.

MR. GOWDY: Because the juvenile is 

different than an adult. A juvenile is less culpable. 

He's -- we know over time he will change and -- and 

potentially reform, as opposed to an adult. Once you 

are fully formed, you are more culpable and you don't

every single person? 

MR. GOWDY: No, Your Honor, and nobody was 

willing to say that in Roper, but, yet, the Court still 

drew the line at 18 for the death penalty in Roper. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Because the Court, up to 

this point, has said that death is different, and the

entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in --

in all other cases.

change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact.

transported or moved over to the noncapital cases. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I know you are not 

asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this, 

logically, is going? If death is not different, then

there should be uniform rules across the board. 

MR. GOWDY: Absolutely not, Your Honor, 

because those rules make no sense when you are talking 

about adolescents, who are different, because those --

which a Court recognized in Roper, that those rules 

can't be applied to adolescents because we -- you can't, 

as a sentencer, predict the future. 

And so, though death is different, it's not 

different in any critical respects here because the 

punishment, life without parole, just like death, says 

that the offender is forever irredeemable, is forever 

unfit to live in society, and must die in prison. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why does it say that? Why 

doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what 

this individual has done is so bad that, even if this 

person can be rehabilitated and would not present a 

danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this 

person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole? 

That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender. 

MR. GOWDY: Your -- Your Honor, I think the 

only difference here is -- between life without parole 

and life with parole, is that there will be a 

determination later, at age 30 or 40 or sometime 

thereafter, as to whether that is the right sentence. 

And the -- the parole official, just like

the judge, can consider the offense as the offender, as 

a juvenile. We're just saying that you can't make that 

complete determination at such a young age, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason States --

MR. GOWDY: -- and you will have a more 

accurate determination later. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason States 

and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in --

in recent decades was, with depressing regularity, 

prisoners released on parole committed crimes again. 

And I'm just -- is there any empirical 

evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 --

17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as 

opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds? 

MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, as my brother noted, 

I think that the evidence shows that, as people get 

older, they are less likely to recommit crimes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that -- I 

remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the 

cutoff, there’s sort of a magic age at some point, 

where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically 

don't engage in violent activity. 

MR. GOWDY: It -- it decreases over time, 

undoubtedly, and that’s -- that supports, I think, our 

argument here, that the -- that Terrance Graham, at age
