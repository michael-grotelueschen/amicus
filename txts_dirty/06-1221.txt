 (10:05 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in case 06-1221, Sprint/United Management 

Company v. Mendelsohn.

 Mr. Cane.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CANE: Chief Justice Roberts, and may it 

please the Court:

 Our basic principal of evidence of the need 

for foundation explains why the court of appeals should 

be reversed. An employment decision is made by the 

person who made it, the decision-maker. If some other 

person harbors bias, that's unfortunate; but it is not 

probative of claims by a plaintiff who is not affected 

by it. This Court's discrimination cases, both in the 

employment context and in other contexts, consistently 

focus on the decision maker's intent, not on the intent 

of other persons.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were to read the 

district court's minute order -- and this is that short 

minute order -- as saying that evidence of pattern and 

practice simply is not admissible, that would be error, 

would it not? Error to -- if the -- if that had been

his ruling, that would have been error. In my Court, 

you don't introduce pattern and practice. That can't be 

MR. CANE: Yeah, if the district court had 

held that under no circumstances could a pattern or 

practice of discrimination be shown, I think that would 

have been error.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there anything in the 

other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the 

district judge, that you think Respondents have called 

to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping 

view?

 MR. CANE: No. I don't think that's what 

the court was focusing on. The district court focused 

on the nexus of the disputed witnesses to the plaintiff. 

The district court did not hand out a cookie cutter 

ruling at the courthouse door. The district court did 

not say oh, this is a discrimination case, hear are the 

rules of evidence I apply in a discrimination case. 

What the district court here did was consider Sprint's 

motion in limine, which was grounded in the evidence 

that had emerged in discovery in this case.

 Plaintiff then responded to that motion in 

limine by trying to explain why the evidence was 

relevant given the facts of this case.

The plaintiff then filed a witness list, 

which explained what each of the disputed witnesses 

would say in this case; and the plaintiff finally made 

an offer of proof which again collaborated on what 

plaintiff contended the disputed witnesses would say in 

this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't really know, do 

we, what the district court's order was based on? 

Whether it was based on 401 or 403? Did the district 

court explain its order at all? It didn't, did it?

 MR. CANE: The district court did not 

specifically invoke rule 403. I think it's -- my 

reading of it that it is grounded in both 401 and 403.

 The motion in limine relied on both 401 and 

403, the district court told counsel that she wanted the 

jury to be focusing on the claims of this plaintiff and 

not be distracted by claims of others.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, to the extent it was 

grounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?

 MR. CANE: I don't think so, because I don't 

think there's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you have three 

supervisors, and one is discriminating and another is 

discriminating, isn't that some evidence that you're in 

an industrial situation in which discrimination goes on,

and therefore doesn't it have the tendency that amounts 

to relevance under 401?

 MR. CANE: We have here five persons, who 

out of 15,000 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about my 

question?

 MR. CANE: The answer to the question is no, 

it doesn't. As this Court taught in Teamsters --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No relevance at all?

 MR. CANE: A pattern or practice is not 

established by anecdotes. And what we have here are 

anecdotes of 5 persons out of the 15,000 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What about my question? We 

have evidence that there are three supervisors, two of 

them are discriminating. Isn't that some -- doesn't 

that have some tendency to indicate that in an equivocal 

situation, that one was -- it may not be strong 

evidence, it may not win the case, it may not be 

powerful, but it has the tendency that gets you over the 

line on 401, doesn't it?

 MR. CANE: That's why I started with the 

importance of emphasizing foundation. To --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to -- I don't 

want to emphasize my question, before we get the --

MR. CANE: For relevance to exist, there

would have to be a foundational showing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by that? 

You repeated several times there must be -- must lay a 

foundation. You do recognize, I think in your reply 

brief, that some other supervisor evidence would be 

relevant and admissible, but you refer to the 

foundation.

 Tell us what you think a proper foundation 

would be.

 MR. CANE: The foundation, Justice Ginsburg, 

would be some linkage between the decision making 

supervisor and the supervisors whose acts or conduct is 

assailed by the plaintiff. And if there's no showing of 

nexus other than the fact that they both happen to draw 

a paycheck from Sprint --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by 

"nexus"? If they both work in the same physical 

facility, is that a nexus?

 MR. CANE: No. I think the nexus requires 

more than a common zip code.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if you've got 20 

supervisors and you've got evidence that 19 of them have 

discriminated after making expressly discriminatory 

remarks. The 20th is the subject to the action. Is the 

evidence of the 19 admissible?

MR. CANE: I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is a nexus there?

 MR. CANE: I think, in a company that was 

not small, where a nexus could be inferred, that there 

was consultation or that there were directions from more 

senior management, then I think that would be an 

appropriate foundation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. So, if we've 

got 19 and there's a question of 1, we've got a nexus. 

If we've got three and there's a question, two are 

accounted for as discriminatory, and the question is the 

third, we don't have a nexus. Is that the way you're 

doing the math?

 MR. CANE: I'm sorry. Did I under your 

question to be three supervisors in the whole company or 

three supervisors out of this vast company that we're 

talking about?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: At this point, I'm saying 

three supervisors out of a whole company. Will that do 

it?

 MR. CANE: Not absent some reason to believe 

that they conferred or they received directions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Three supervisors, and 

that's all there is in the company. That consists of 

the company. Have a nexus then?

MR. CANE: If there were -- if two out of 

three, I think there might be an argument that at least 

it was a jury question at that stage.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. CANE: But here we're dealing with a 

70,000-employee company. We have five witnesses who are 

principally assailing two persons. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that it 

has to be a case-by-case determination? There's no 

absolute rule either way?

 MR. CANE: I think there -- there should be 

a guiding principle. And the guiding principle was that 

other-supervisor evidence should be presumptively 

irrelevant, and that would be the rule in the normal run 

of cases, at least in dealing with entities of this 

magnitude.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I assume it would 

be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the 

plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to 

call; the company would say we don't think they're 

relevant because, as you say, there's no connection 

between them, and then the judge would decide.

 MR. CANE: That's normally how --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's on the issue 

of relevance.

MR. CANE: That's normally how it would 

present itself, and indeed the district court normally 

would consider Rule 403 consideration if that's the 

case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. Did I hear 

mishear you? You said it's a 7,000-person?

 MR. CANE: 70,000. 7-0-0-0-0. Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's the way to do it, 

you didn't do it that way, did you? I mean, as I read 

it -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you 

made to the district court said that you have to be 

"similarly situated" -- "Plaintiff has to have been 

'similarly situated' with other employees" -- and you 

put that in quotes -- "similarly situated." And then 

you say "employees may be 'similarly situated' only if 

they have the same supervisor." Period. Not -- it 

wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence 

isn't important. And then you cite Aramburu, which is 

where the Tenth Circuit said that.

 So I don't see how you can say this wasn't a 

401 case. You were saying that weren't similarly 

situated, period. And then the district judge virtually 

quoted those words.

 MR. CANE: The motion was grounded in both 

Rule 401 and --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be, but the 

-- I don't see -- I mean, that may be, but this is the 

argument you made, and this was the argument the 

district judge adopted. Is that not so or is it so?

 MR. CANE: That is so, but what the district 

judge adopted was grounded in the offer of proof that 

had been made here and the evidence that was proffered 

here. The district court was not issuing a blanket 

ruling that would have governed any potential --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me --

JUSTICE SOUTER: How do we know?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. How do we know 

that's what the district court adopted? I have -- is it 

the order on 24a of the appendix to the petition?

 MR. CANE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't mention -- it 

doesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the 

district court is relying on.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't mention the 

offer of proof.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And didn't the Tenth 

Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition? That it 

must be the same supervisor? "'Similarly situated' 

requires proof that Paul Reddick was the decisionmaker." 

That seems as though that the district court thought

there -- it must be the same supervisor, and I thought 

that's how the Tenth Circuit read --

MR. CANE: And I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the district court.

 MR. CANE: That would be the rule in the 

normal run of cases where there is no showing of 

connection.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not talking about the 

rule. We're trying to find out what it was the district 

court did.

 Now, the court of appeals assumed the worst. 

I mean, assumed what makes the case the hardest for you, 

and that is the court of appeals assumed that the 

district court relied on 401. Is it customary to assume 

the worst?

 MR. CANE: No. I think it would be 

customary to assume that, particularly on an issue of 

evidence, that the district court was presumptively 

correct, and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If there's any basis on 

which the district court's decision would have been 

correct, the district court's decision is upheld.

 MR. CANE: It could be affirmed on that 

ground.

understand your answer. I'm confused here. What I 

said, and you seemed to agree, is different from what 

was just said, which you also seemed to agree.

 (Laughter.)

 I thought that you said in your brief that 

you have to have been -- quote -- "similarly situated." 

All right? "Employees must be similarly situated to 

Plaintiff." That's true, isn't it? I'm quoting the 

brief, from page 163. And then you say, "Employees may 

be similarly situated only if they have the same 

supervisor."

 Then the district court says that plaintiff 

may offer evidence who are "similarly situated" to her 

and then -- quote -- "similarly situated employees" --

quote -- "for the purpose of this ruling requires proof 

that Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the 

decisionmaker." That's why I thought it was fairly 

clear, since he used the same words and substituted the 

word "Paul Reddick" for the same supervisor, that he was 

taking that right from your brief where you made that 

general argument and said nothing about the particular 

case in those sentences.

 MR. CANE: The general rule applies because 

there was no showing here of any relationship between 

the decision at issue here and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want to defend 

the harder ground, I understand. But what Justice 

Breyer has just said is not necessarily so. The 

"similarly situated" argument applies under 403 as well. 

If they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would 

take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them, 

plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be 

outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated, 

and, therefore, that it is stronger proof. I don't see 

that one can tell from the district court's order 

whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403.

 And certainly, you just don't want to defend 

403. 	 I think you're digging a hole for yourself.

 MR. CANE: No, I absolutely want to defend 

403. If there was any minimal probative value here, 

Justice Scalia, all the countervailing 403 factors are 

present.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, don't we have to 

address 403 in any event? Because the Tenth Circuit 

ruled, as I understand it, ruled that the evidence could 

not be excluded under 403. It would have been an abuse 

of discretion --

MR. CANE: That is what --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- for the trial judge to 

have excluded it under 403.

MR. CANE: That is correct. Had the "me, 

too" evidence been admitted, then we would have had to 

respond with what might be called "not you, either" 

evidence. And then the plaintiff would have made a 

rebuttal to that showing, and we would have had trials 

within a trial on whether these couple of persons that 

plaintiff identified as potential bad actors were, in 

fact, bad actors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that be done 

typically at the motion in limine stage? I mean, do you 

establish whether or not there was discrimination in the 

"me, too" cases at trial or prior to the trial, outside 

the jury's --

MR. CANE: I think it can happen both ways. 

And really here it happened both ways, too, because 

although it was teed up as a motion in limine, as the 

trial evolved, the district court actually relaxed her 

ruling and expanded it to permit attacks both on 

Reddick, who was the direct supervisor, but also 

decisions made by Blessing, who was Reddick's boss. And 

the district court explained that, as she thought about 

it further, that additional bit of latitude should be 

given to both sides because there was evidence that 

Blessing had consulted with Reddick. And, in other 

words --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that didn't present 

the other supervisor, which I think is more -- a better 

way to comprehend this, because "me, too" could be 10 

witnesses working under the same supervisor. But these 

two people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain 

of supervisory command.

 MR. CANE: That's correct. And that to me 

is the proper test. If the decisionmaker's supervisor 

was demonstrated to be biased, then I think that has 

some relevance because it raises a question as to 

whether that bias --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not "other 

supervisor." They are both supervisors of this 

employee. She's in a unit that includes both superior 

officers. I thought that the issue here was simply 

other supervisors, witnesses who had worked for other 

supervisors, people for whom the -- with whom the 

plaintiff had no connection.

 MR. CANE: And, more importantly, the other 

supervisors were persons that were not shown to have any 

connection with the decisionmaker with respect to this 

plaintiff.

 And so, yes, if you are going to define 

"other supervisor" not to include the chain of command, 

then that's the reason why I think there is no relevance

and a Rule 403 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -- I thought 

you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor 

evidence could be relevant.

 MR. CANE: It could be relevant if there 

were a showing that the bias on the part of the other 

supervisors somehow tainted the decision making of the 

instant decisionmaker.

 And in the cases that Ms. Mendelsohn cites 

in her brief, those are all cases in which a directive 

was given from a more senior official to the 

decisionmaker.

 What we have here are decisionmakers in 

far-flung areas elsewhere within the company with no 

showing whatsoever that there is any relationship 

between them.

 Each of the five disputed witnesses here 

testified in deposition that they had no information 

whatsoever to shed about the decisionmakers with respect 

to Ms. Mendelsohn.

 And so in those circumstances there's no 

foundational showing of relationship, no foundational 

showing of nexus.

the plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to

show other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical 

evidence; or was it just these five people? Was that 

all that the plaintiff presented?

 MR. CANE: It was just these five people. 

The only statistics in the case were that the number of 

persons over 50 in this particular unit, the Business 

Development Strategy Group, actually increased; and that 

the oldest person at any particular level within the 

Business Development Strategy Group was retained and not 

laid off.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

spreadsheet evidence? I thought there was some effort 

to show a connection through the spreadsheet showing the 

age of the dismissed employees?

 MR. CANE: That spreadsheet was linked to 

some supervisor named Kennedy, who bore no relationship 

to this department and no relationship to these 

decisionmakers.

 Let's assume that -- that allegation is 

untested, but let's assume that Mr. Kennedy was 

correctly identified as a bad actor. Again, that has no 

relationship. It might have everything to do with any 

layoff decision made by Kennedy or made by someone 

Kennedy supervised. But it bears no relationship to 

Ms. Mendelsohn's circumstances because there was no

showing that a similar spreadsheet was used by any of 

her decisionmakers.

 Let's assume that Kennedy is, like the two 

others, Stock and Voorhees, perhaps a bad actor. That 

just doesn't shed any meaningful light on the 

circumstances of the plaintiff here; and even if it did 

shed some -- some bit of light --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I am somewhat puzzled. 

How many bad actors does there have to be before you can 

draw an inference that someone superior to the bad 

actors had a motivating part in the whole situation?

 MR. CANE: I don't know that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The inference they are 

trying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told 

everybody what to do.

 MR. CANE: And they had full and fair 

discovery to try and demonstrate that. But their own 

witnesses testified that they were unaware of any 

relationship between themselves and their decisionmaker 

and the plaintiff and the plaintiff's decision-maker.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record show in 

this 70,000-person company how many supervisors there 

were? Do we know that?

 MR. CANE: No. It doesn't say, Justice 

Kennedy.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this, though. 

Does it show whether the person more senior to the five 

supervisors involved here was the same person or a 

different person?

 MR. CANE: It is a different person. Sure, 

if you go far enough up the corporate ladder, eventually 

you will end up --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The next step up would be 

MR. CANE: Not the next step up, the next 

step after that, and not the next step after that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory doesn't 

depend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors 

are located, I take it, if there's a connection? In 

other words, if there's a lower-level supervisor who 

discriminates and that is somehow communicated to the 

supervisor in question, and whatever -- that you know, 

the point is that the other one wasn't disciplined or 

something, that would still -- under your theory that 

would be admissible, correct?

 MR. CANE: If a -- no matter what level, I 

would disagree that if a discriminating supervisor is in 

the chain of command and supervises the decisionmaker, 

then I think there's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking 

about a situation -- let's say it is a lower-level 

supervisor outside the chain of command who commits 

another "me, too" act, but that is communicated to the 

other in a way that suggests, for example, that the 

company tolerates it or accepts it.

 I take it that that would be potentially 

admissible subject to 403 under your theory.

 MR. CANE: I think that's right. If there's 

a showing the actual decisionmaker could have been 

tainted by it, I would agree with that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your -- does 404 

bear on the case, Rule 404 of the Rules of Evidence?

 MR. CANE: Yes, I think it does. I think 

that if you're going to have -- what we have here is, in 

effect, an assault on the corporate character of the 

company and not an assault --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Have we said that 404 

applies to corporations? Corporations have a character?

 MR. CANE: I don't think the Court has ever 

held that. I think the individual has a character, and 

there is no character-evidence problem with showing that 

a particular decisionmaker engaged in other 

discriminatory conduct, because I think that falls 

within the exception to 404. But where the

 OPENING ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 AS AMICUS CURIAE

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Evidence of discrimination by other 

supervisors within the company is sometimes but not 

always admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help 

prove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's under --

under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need 

403 to reach that conclusion?

 MR. GARRE: I think you need to look at the 

evidence under both rules, the first question being 

whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401. 

And that is a very low threshold set by the Federal 

rules. The second question being whether it may be 

excluded under Rule 403, which would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you think 

there are situations where other-supervisor evidence is 

not admissible under 401 itself?

 MR. GARRE: Yes. We do think that there are 

some instances where other-supervisor evidence is not 

admissible under 401. For example, if you have a large 

company and you have a plaintiff in the Chicago office 

claiming that her supervisor had it out for her and she 

wants to put on the testimony of an employee in the 

Seattle office who two years ago complained that her 

supervisor had it out for her, we think that that would 

not be relevant under 401.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but here you have a 

company of 70,000 people.

 MR. GARRE: You have a company of 70,000 

people, but you have allegations that supervisors in the 

same division, implementing the same company-wide 

reduction-in-force plan in the same timeframe and giving 

similar explanations under similar circumstances, 

engaged in discrimination.

 We think that the district dissenting judge 

in the court of appeals was right to say that evidence 

of that kind is at least marginally relevant, which 

would then put the focus on whether this evidence could 

be excluded under 403.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is hard to see what 

wouldn't be marginally relevant if you think that's 

marginally relevant. It has to be a different 

supervisor in a different time frame. I mean, sure.

 MR. GARRE: Well, I think you've got other 

situations as well, Justice Scalia. I think we've got a 

situation of a general comment of discriminatory animus. 

For example, older people just don't get it, something 

like that. I think the -- the -- by a different 

supervisor.

 I think even if that's within the same 

office, the plaintiff is going to be hard-pressed even 

to meet the minimum-relevance threshold. But the 

relevance threshold, as this Court has recognized in the 

Furnco v. Waters case and the Huddlestone case, this is 

a broad threshold that allows evidence in. And then we 

look at the other parts of Article IV of the Federal 

Rules of Evidence to see whether it may be excluded --

JUSTICE ALITO: How do you articulate the 

rule that separates these situations?

 MR. GARRE: Well, I would point to several 

criteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance. 

First, whether you're dealing with same alleged -- same 

kind of alleged discrimination and a common catalyst; 

second, whether the proffered witnesses are working in

the same corporate vicinity; third, whether they are 

alleging discrimination in the same time frame; four, 

whether they are alleging a pattern or practice of 

discrimination.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's the relevant 

factors, but what do you look at the factors to 

determine -- what's the test for determining whether 

they are sufficient?

 MR. GARRE: Well, you would look at the 

proffered evidence. For example, in this case you have 

evidence that all of the proffered witnesses were 

terminated under the same companywide reduction in 

force. You've got a common catalyst.

 In this case, you've got employees who 

worked in the same geographic vicinity, the headquarters 

of Sprint, the same office complex or at least the same 

vicinity. You've got witnesses who were terminated on 

the same day --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that relevant -- the 

same vicinity? You're -- you're --

MR. GARRE: I think it is more likely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Opposing counsel has said 

they are -- they are three supervisors up. What does 

the same vicinity have anything to do with this?

the same division, in the same vicinity, carrying out 

the same plan, providing the same distinct explanations 

in similar circumstances, a reasonable juror might infer 

that plaintiff's own --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if those supervisors 

RIF'd two thousands employees, and only three made this 

complaint?

 MR. GARRE: Yes, with respect to the minimum 

threshold of relevance. Keep in mind, once --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No matter how many 

employees were RIF'd, only three supervisors --

hypothetical case, three supervisors. No many how many 

employees were RIF'd, the three is sufficient so that 

these witnesses could testify?

 MR. GARRE: Well, I think if you're talking 

about pattern of practice, maybe doesn't -- certainly as 

a matter of law that's not a -- going to prove a pattern 

of practice, and the employer can make that argument to 

the district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could 

be limited or excluded. If you have got, for example, a 

-- a proffered witness who's complaining that 

supervisors in the same complex used the same 

distinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me --

for example, in this case, several of the witnesses were 

going to testify that their supervisors told them they

were being -- they were removed because their positions 

were being eliminated, and then they later found out 

that younger persons assumed their jobs.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So take it in this case, 

and in all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of laying 

the foundation for this evidence; is that not correct?

 MR. GARRE: The plaintiff has --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say the foundation 

is satisfied if they were the same supervisors in the 

same division, I thought.

 MR. GARRE: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write that 

in a case as a rule?

 MR. GARRE: The plaintiffs --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without reference to how 

many employees were involved?

 MR. GARRE: The plaintiff has the burden of 

showing that the evidence is relevant, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you said in your 

brief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a 

foundation. And that's the difference between you, I 

thought -- with respect to Justice Kennedy's question. 

Your brief takes the position that it is not necessary 

to lay a foundation in order to introduce 

other-supervisor evidence.

consequence more likely.

case confronted --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, one -- one would have 

some -- some tendency --

MR. GARRE: And Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about one instead of 

three? Would that have some tendency? I guess it 

would.

 MR. GARRE: It might. And that probably 

would be a strong candidate for exclusion under 403. In 

the Furnco case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, by the way, do you 

think this was excluded under -- under 401 rather than 

403?

 MR. GARRE: Well, we -- we acknowledge that 

the record isn't precisely clear on that. We think that 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then why should it be 

assumed it was done properly rather than improperly?

the reason why the evidence can't come in is because the 

-- the proffered witnesses didn't have the same 

supervisor. The order is on page 24.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

MR. GARRE: What the court excluded is any 

evidence of the pattern --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's very relevant to the 

403 determination.

 MR. GARRE: It's relevant, but not it's 

certainly not determinative, and we think in a case like 

this, where this kind of evidence is the critical 

evidence for the trial -- in the case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Picky, picky, picky on the 

trial court. I must say.

should be -- should be given -- it should be treated as

context of the motion in limine, it came up in the 

context of the motion for a new trial. And if you look 

at what the district court said in denying a motion for 

a new trial, she said again -- and this is on page 436 

of the JA -- she says, "none of the proffered evidence 

makes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this 

case discriminated against the plaintiff."

 That's relevance language, and you're quite 

right --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The determination of 

the relevance of the "me, too" evidence -- and I assume 

also the 403 status -- needs to be made at the motion in 

limine stage, or is it a question for the jury?

 MR. GARRE: Well, the district court serves 

as a gateway. District courts have tremendous 

discretion under the Federal rules to determine whether 

or not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it 

should be excluded under 403. So that determination is 

made by the district court.

 In some cases, as happened in the 

Huddlestone case -- that was a 404(d) case -- the court 

acknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and 

then the jury may instruct that that evidence is 

allowed.

the "me, too" evidence it's a "he said/she said" type of 

case, does that get admitted to the jury? Or is that 

excluded at the motion in limine stage?

 MR. GARRE: Well, if you're pointing to 

other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that 

are relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the 

employer would come in and present their counter 

evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're only 

-- it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if 

the company denies that the "me, too" episode even took 

place, don't you have to have a separate trial on that 

before you can determine whether it's even admissible?

 MR. GARRE: In our system we put that 

evidence before a jury. If it is relevant under the 

Federal rules, it is admissible. We put before a jury 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I get back to 

my -- the predicate to my question. It's only relevant 

if it happened.

 MR. GARRE: And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it seems to me 

we've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if 

it happened, but we don't know how we determine whether 

it happened or not.

MR. GARRE: In the Furnco case, the Court 

said that -- that the evidence doesn't have to 

conclusively demonstrate the fact. It simply has to be 

relevant. We put relevant evidence before juries, we 

instruct them on the consideration of that evidence, 

permit the defendants to put that evidence into context, 

and then we ask juries to draw a conclusion --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So an allegation --

an allegation of discrimination in a "me, too" context 

is automatically relevant?

 MR. GARRE: No. I think you'd look at it 

under the relevance threshold, and I think you'd look at 

it under 403. 403 is going to exclude a lot of this 

evidence. It is going to exclude the barely evidence, 

the barely relevant evidence. But it -- we would expect 

a trial court in this kind of situation to make some 

kind of findings as to why this evidence is excludable, 

and we would expect the court of appeals not to 

undertake a de novo 403 balancing in its own instance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, do I 

understand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit 

thought that the district court was ruling under 401, 

making a relevance determination, was that the court of 

appeals had a precedent in the area of employee 

discipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the

district court was following that precedent, but that 

precedent doesn't apply in this situation. So that's 

why the court of appeals, as I understand it, read the 

district court as just applying an absolute ban.

 MR. GARRE: That's correct, and that's the 

way this case was litigated all the way until to the 

reply brief in this case. If there are no further 

questions?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E. EGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. EGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 If we'll turn to 3a in the white book, the 

court of appeals properly understood that this was a 

blanket order based on only one fact. If you weren't 

supervised by Paul Reddick, it was not admissible. At 

page 2a, the court said prior to trial, Sprint filed a 

motion in limine seeking to exclude among other things 

any evidence of Sprint's alleged discriminatory 

treatment of other employees. Relying exclusively on 

Aramburu, Sprint argued that any reference to alleged 

discrimination by any supervisor other than Reddick --

it was irrelevant.

 Throughout -- and let me mention here, Your 

Honor, that the order of things was not as Mr. Cane got 

it. He said the order was grounded on an offer of 

proof.

 If I may address the chronology, on December 

15, 2004, Sprint filed its motion saying that if -- it 

is not the same supervisor, it doesn't come in. There's 

no mention, ever, about the facts of the proffer. 

Never. It never came up below. We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if you 

have a situation that's been referred to earlier, where 

you have four other supervisors that are presented as 

"me, too" evidence. They are in the Los Angeles office. 

The defendant's supervisor is in the Fresno office. Is 

that evidence relevant?

 MR. EGAN: It depends what the evidence is 

and what it is tied to, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is just that they 

-- they are alleged to have fired people for an 

impermissible basis under the age discrimination act as 

well.

 MR. EGAN: In your hypothetical was it was 

during the same common employer initiated action, such 

as a reduction in force?

that we're talking about a common employer-initiated 

event. We're not talking about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but doesn't 

that beg the question? We don't know. This isn't a 

pattern and practice case. You don't have evidence of a 

company-wide policy of discrimination. Take my 

hypothetical. There are just four people who are 

alleged to harbor age-based bias, and they -- in the Los 

Angeles office. No connection to the Fresno supervisor 

at all, other than that they work for the same company. 

Is that enough for relevance?

 MR. EGAN: If there is no connection, it 

might not be, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It might not be 

relevant.

 MR. EGAN: Might not be relevant. Let me 

say that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you assert that the 

mere fact that it is pursuant to the same reduction in 

force is enough of a connection.

standard arises out of Article IV, which is entitled 

"Relevancy and Its Limits." There are no categorical 

bars within Article IV except when -- Congress and the 

Court have mentioned, 401 has no categorical bar. The 

test is, does a fact have -- if evidence has any 

tendency to make a fact of consequence more likely than 

without it? So it depends. In rule 401, there is no 

categorical bar. In Article IV, if there are areas 

where there are problems, we list them. 407, 411 -- no 

mention of liability insurance. 410.

case the lower courts had used 404. We did not address 

it. I don't think anybody really did in a brief, other 

than the Government mentioned the Huddlestone case. The 

Huddlestone case is important because it said that there 

is no preliminary determination as to whether or not 

something is relevant. What you do is the court looks 

at all the evidence. The evidence that Ellen Mendelsohn 

wanted to offer has connections to it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well suppose you're -- if 

you're right on 401 and 402, would -- do we not still 

have to go on and decide whether it would have been a 

abuse of discretion for the trial judge to exclude this 

under 403?

MR. EGAN: Your Honor, I believe that --

JUSTICE ALITO: If we find that it would not 

have been abuse of discretion, then how could we affirm 

the Tenth Circuit?

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, I believe that what 

you have to do is look at what the court did, because 

what the court did was it ruled on what they presented, 

which was not anything having to do with the weight of 

the evidence, confusion of issues. There is nothing to 

indicate. And the court of appeals quoted its own law 

that says we are in no position to speculate. As a 

superintending court, they ruled only one thing -- a 

categorical bar of evidence that was before it, and they 

said that's wrong. You followed the wrong case law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought they said 

that it should be admitted. I thought they went to the 

opposite extreme.

 MR. EGAN: I'm not sure that they went to 

that extreme. Their language is this, Your Honor: They 

say, "Based on what we see" -- and they have the proffer 

in front of them at that time, and they also have the 

full transcript, which hasn't been talked about -- how 

Ellen Mendelsohn's case and her theory tied into these 

people.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did they?

MR. EGAN: Your Honor, in several different 

ways. Barred evidence of culture. We had evidence of 

culture from open remarks, that someone needs to be 

"blessed with lots of runway ahead of them" in order to 

get a good rating. Bonnie Hoopes said being told she 

was too old for the job right after she received that 

memo, being told openly and repeatedly, "I'm too old for 

the job." If there are too many --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are these episodes 

that were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at 

issue here?

 MR. EGAN: No, Your Honor, but this is on 

the question of culture.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't make the 

-- you don't suggest that he was even aware of these 

other anecdotes.

 MR. EGAN: We do not suggest, but what we 

say is that what was going on in the culture -- you've 

got a supervisor like Ted Stock, openly saying, "I can't 

wait for RIF's, so that I can get rid of the older 

people in my department." That supervisor's conclusion 

is that it's okay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're conceding 

that we don't even know that that comment was 

communicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here.

He may not have been aware of it. The supervisor -- he 

may have been in Fresno and that supervisor in Los 

Angeles.

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, what way do know is 

that they attended the same meetings, the key leadership 

meetings, that took place in January 2002 that covered 

something very important to our case -- the 

establishment of a forced ranking system and also a 

discussion of the RIF's that are ongoing and continuing. 

They're at the same meeting. It's after this meeting, 

where Jack Welch is presented to the group, that they 

come out with the philosophy of forced --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume there's no 

dispute over any direct evidence you have that the 

supervisor was being guided by a company policy or 

statement or the RIF program that was discriminatory. 

The issue here is whether or not you can bring in 

testimony that -- which has no demonstrated connection 

to the supervisor.

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, the rules of evidence 

simply talk in terms of "not demonstrate a connection." 

It doesn't exist. If we look at the rules of evidence, 

the standard -- and the standard we believe applies here 

-- is a two-step methodology. It would be, number one, 

what is the party -- the thing the party is trying to

prove, such as culture -- is that a subsidiary fact of 

consequence?

 Something that's been missed in the 

Petitioner's position and even in the district court, is 

that Rule 401 says that you have three levels of 

evidence. The ultimate issue, and the Petitioner has 

always said this doesn't prove that Reddick 

discriminated against Mendelsohn. That's the ultimate 

issue. We have many intermediary facts to which the 

evidence relates. They are facts of consequence, and 

the evidence had a tendency to show these facts of 

consequence. So that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to elaborate 

on that somewhat?

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I went through to kind of 

pin down what the facts of consequence were. I went 

through the offer of proof. I don't have my notes in 

front of me, but I think my recollection is right on 

this. It struck me that the admissible evidence that 

was indicated by the offer of proof boils down basically 

to this: There were three employees who would testify 

that, following their dismissal, some or all of their 

work was done by a younger person.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, sir.

JUSTICE SOUTER: There was one employee who 

would testify that he received -- she saw a spreadsheet 

in front of one supervisor that indicated age.

 There was one employee who would testify 

that her immediate supervisor had made 

age-discriminatory remarks.

 And another employee would testify that her 

supervisor's boss had made age-discriminatory remarks.

 Now, basically, out of this company of 

70,000, that seems to be the sum total of the -- the 

kind of circumstantial evidence of culture that you 

presented in the offer of proof.

 Am I selling your offer of proof short here?

 MR. EGAN: No, you are not, Your Honor. The 

-- you have hit it precisely. And we believe that with 

culture, it's the openness of what's going on. The 

openness. The number of events goes to weight. All the 

weaknesses and frailties of the evidence go to weight. 

And we never got to that portion of determining the 

weight of the evidence. The weight --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what should 

we do then? Sorry. Go ahead and conclude. But I want 

to ask this after you finish answering Justice Souter.

Justice Souter.

 MR. EGAN: Thank you, Your Honor. The --

this ties in, in several different ways, if I can take 

them all, to culture, to modus operandi, and this 

wouldn't require discriminatory conduct. For instance, 

the story line that jobs have been abolished and given 

to youngers. That's where that would be modus operandi. 

The fact that the office shadow rating system -- they're 

under the same rating system that's not supposed to 

apply to employees like Ellen Mendelsohn and those who 

we are presenting, but it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if even one of these 

three had existed? Only one these three?

 MR. EGAN: One of these three what, Your 

Honor?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: One of these three other 

employees who complained about age discrimination. 

Would that have the same tendency to show it?

 MR. EGAN: It depends what it's offered for 

because relevance does --

happens -- but under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not talking about 

somebody up at the top. I'm talking about somebody on 

the same level as the supervisor that you're concerned 

with. One other supervisor in this company of 70,000 

has -- is accused of having made age-discriminatory 

decisions.

 MR. EGAN: Well, if they're just accused, 

no, Your Honor. The assumption has to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, all of these are just 

accused. We have -- none of this has been proven.

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, we have not even 

addressed at any time the content of the decision -- I 

mean the content of the testimony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume the testimony 

at least shows these points that you and I agreed the 

offer of proof offers to prove.

 They're going to be met -- I think it's 

reasonable to suppose, they're going to be met by 

counter-evidence.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We're going to have 

litigation on these points, and they're going to take --

in effect, become subsidiary chapters in this trial.

And what concerns me, I guess, is that, at the end of 

the day, it's -- it strikes me as though there is reason 

to believe that the proof itself is not going to be 

anything close to overwhelming. We will have had a 

potentially confusing trial on this subsidiary 

third-party evidence. And we seem to be very close, if 

we have not gotten over the line, of the subsidiary 

evidence, in effect, being substantially misleading or 

prejudicial. And -- and basically I'm raising a 

question of weight under 403.

 What's your response to that?

 MR. EGAN: My response, because I'm hearing 

you talk about the mini-trial issues, first of all, as 

you know, it will not happen here. We had a pretrial 

January 29, 2007, after -- before Sprint had filed its 

petition for cert, in which we discussed will this be a 

longer trial. One and a half, maybe two days. The fact 

of mini-trials, Your Honor, it just doesn't happen that 

often. You can try joinder cases. I've tried joinder 

cases with eight plaintiffs, and you handle that with 

instructions. The answer isn't to keep out possibly 

probative evidence; the answer is to let --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what --

MR. EGAN: -- to let Sprint put on 

counter-evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens in this 

case? Let's say there are five "me, too" situations 

presented, and the court make a determination in each 

one, and the jury finds for the plaintiff. And then 

it's appealed, and the argument on appeal is, well, in 

three of those five cases there wasn't age 

discrimination and here's why. And that evidence is --

well then the court of appeals agrees, yes, those three 

cases shouldn't have been admitted.

 Is that reversible error?

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, I think that what you 

handle that with is limiting instructions. It would be 

the evidence of acts or statements of anyone else that 

you've heard are relevant only to the intent of Paul 

Reddick. Nobody would contend that Bonnie Hoopes was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, under my 

hypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals, 

let's say, determines that the alleged statements did 

not occur. That's the argument. And this was admitted 

to the jury in three of the five cases, and those 

statements did not occur.

 MR. EGAN: At least that's part of our 

adversary system, Your Honor, where we have both sides 

presenting and countering. The super- --

error on appeal?

when the court of appeals determines that three did not 

occur?

 MR. EGAN: If it's determined under your 

hypothetical --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's exactly what's 

sort of bothering me. You are the trial lawyer.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I'm not. And what's 

worrying me most about this is I will say something that 

will muck up quite a lot of trials. So, therefore, the 

sentence that jumps out the page here was where the 

court of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an 

extraordinary remedy that should be sparingly -- used 

sparingly.

 Is that a general rule?

 Because my impression was -- and this is why 

I asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401 

and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that 

last a thousand years.

 And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the 

trial under control is to say: Well, maybe there is 

some slight tendency here to make a fact more likely

than not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of 

time.

 And I thought that kind of decision is what 

trial judges are there to make.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, I thought 

this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that 

trial court judge unless that trial court judge is 

making an absolute rule, which he may have been.

 But as soon as we get into this case, I 

thought we might do quite a lot of harm by trying to let 

the court of appeals second-guess trial courts on this 

kind of thing.

 Now, I would appreciate your response to 

that.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor. That requires, 

under 403 requires, a balancing. And I think you must 

have, contrary to what -- all due respect -- Justice 

Scalia suggested, Rule 403 is the only rule that 

expressly says "substantially outweighs." We have no 

evidence here --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, how are we 

going to -- I'm not arguing about what it says so much 

as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court 

of appeals and the trial court to decide?

JUSTICE BREYER: And all I'm worried 

about -- and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth 

Circuit or elsewhere. I was an appeals court judge for 

a quite a while.  And I think we have never -- not 

"never," but hardly ever second-guessed a trial judge on 

that kind of question.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you tell me if the 

rules are different in the Tenth Circuit? Do they out 

there second-guess trial judges on this kind of question 

all the time?

 MR. EGAN: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If they don't 

normally, why should they here? If this kind of rule is 

-- as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other 

evidence, any other evidence at all. It may be 

relevant, or it may not be. It depends on the case. A 

waste of time or not depends on the case.

problem, and why is it an evidentiary exclusion before 

trial?

have no quarrel if the Tenth Circuit -- and I think the 

Tenth Circuit leaves room for sending it back, remand 

it, and then the court could still make rulings, as the 

Tenth Circuit said, on cumulative nature of evidence, 

hearsay objections. These haven't been addressed.

 Sprint has been --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, not -- I'm 

saying -- well, you got my point, but you're just not 

answering my question.

 MR. EGAN: I am sorry, Your Honor. I'm not 

understanding --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I don't want to repeat 

it. And I'm not talking about whether it is hearsay or 

not. I'm not talking -- I'm talking about whether it 

comes in 401, 402, 403. That's the issue.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor. Our -- we 

believe that it does. Because the evidence has a 

tendency to make more probable than without the evidence 

facts of consequence, on culture, on impeachment, on 

pattern, on pretext.

 That's our standard. We have no indication 

here that the judge ever engaged in a balancing -- none.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Egan, what if I think 

that, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been 

an abuse of discretion not to exclude it? What if I

think that?

 Then what happens with this case?

 MR. EGAN: If you believe that it is so 

clear, then, of course, that would be -- if you believe 

that it is so clear that it is an abuse of discretion 

not to exclude it, then that is the prerogative of the 

Court to do. But it must be done under this standard, 

Your Honor; that is, the judge looks at the evidence and 

asks the question like he would for submissibility.

 What would a reasonable jury say, and is 

there room for disagreement?

 If you have Federal judges, for instance, 

who disagree on admissibility --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I am worried about 

having five trials -- you know, one trial turning into 

six trials. I mean those are the factors that I am 

concerned about.

 MR. EGAN: I understand, Your Honor. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. EGAN: But let me just say this, if I 

might. Discrimination cases are important. In the 

McKennon case Justice Kennedy wrote for the unanimous 

Court in saying every time a single plaintiff advances 

the cause and prevails in a discrimination case, it 

serves the national public purpose.

So it's important. And the idea of there 

being cases on this, the court house doors should be 

open. The decision may be -- may be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if I assume 

your rule cuts the other way?

 Let's say in this company of 70,000 or 

17,000, or whatever it is, there are a thousand 

supervisors. Four or five are alleged to have 

discriminated on the basis of age.

 I assume the company can call the other 995 

and say: Are there any allegations against you? Did 

you fire people? And did you in some cases keep the 

oldest one?

 And then they have to -- you know, they say 

yes. So the, "me, too" evidence works both ways, right?

 MR. EGAN: Absolutely. And that is 

important, because in your Court, cases and 

jurisprudence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you are 

talking about culture, what is the culture of the 

company if 995 supervisors don't supervise -- don't 

discriminate in their decisions and 5 do?

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, the culture -- they 

have the right to bring on evidence, but the trial court 

retains the discretion. And I hope this answers Justice

Breyer's question, also. The court retains the 

discretion to keep out marginal evidence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe, just as an 

example, you could take Mr. Borel and Mr. Hoopes and 

explain why their testimony should not have been 

excluded under 403? As I read Trent, the only thing I 

have as to either one of them is that they were replaced 

by young women in their position. That's it as far as 

admissible evidence for either one.

 Now, if you do that, the 403 balancing 

there, why doesn't that lead to exclusion?

 MR. EGAN: Because John Borel's evidence 

goes to pretext, Your Honor. And pretext under the 

Reeves case is something that is highly, highly 

important,and highly important to the trial lawyer. His 

pretext evidence is twofold.

 He was going to get a job before he knew 

that he was RIF'd. He goes to apply for the job after 

the RIF, and he is told: Sorry, you've got a secret 

adverse rating.

 Now, mind you, the company says: We don't 

use these ratings.

 Now, in Ellen Mendelsohn's trial without 

corroboration, she's isolated. That's John Borel's 

important testimony in this case. John Hoopes -- he's

told by a vice president why can't you hire someone 

younger? Why would you hire someone age 48, which 

indicates that at Sprint, it's something that is 

determined to be okay. So that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if company can 

admit evidence to show the opposite of your "me, too" 

evidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the 

culture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to 

admit before -- to show the opposite culture? Certainly 

more than five if they say this isn't representative. 

You have to look at these 15 others.

 MR. EGAN: I can't pick a number, Mr. Chief 

Justice. And we're not saying that the five proves the 

fact as you said of proving culture. But it is evidence 

that is relevant to it. A reasonable juror --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. There are 

15, 30, or however many is equally relevant.

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

the testimony would not be admitted. But, Your Honor, 

this was after remand.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You told it can be done in 

a day and a half.  Because these five were excluded.

 MR. EGAN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry. What 

happened here was the remand or the reversal came down. 

We have a pretrial because we're going back to trial. 

We have a trial on January 29, 2007. Excuse me. A 

pretrial, and at that trial the court asked well, will 

this be a long trial, four weeks, five weeks? We say if 

you open up discovery, if they want to bring people to 

refute -- Sprint said no.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think that has any 

bearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's 

under review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth 

Circuit and that we're looking at here.

 MR. EGAN: Well, Your Honor, it goes to 

whether or not saying that there's going to be a lengthy 

trial it is some evidence as you look at what the actual 

experience is -- look at the cases cited by the 

defendant. We cited them in our brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They may have just thought 

the game isn't worth the candle. Just thought we've 

sunk so much money into this case by now and it's just 

not worth the risk.

MR. EGAN: That's fine, Your Honor. But 

they should be not take out the legs from the plaintiffs 

to try to prove their case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the problem that 

concerns me. It is not the question of whether the 

trial is going to last for three weeks. It is a 

question at the prospect that the trial will last for 

three weeks and they will have to go out and find other 

people in their organization and depose them and bring 

them in to show them it is not the culture. They just 

say it is not worth the candle. Just settle the case 

and get out. All of these things are relevant to how 

you rule on 403 it seems to me.

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, we're simply asking 

for balance, because other supervisors --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that get to the 

point, though, hasn't the last hour of questioning from 

the court shown that what we really ought to take place 

here is a remand to the trial court for a 403 balance?

 MR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. EGAN: If I might offer some concluding 

thoughts because my time is running down. The district 

court erred in categorically barring all other 

supervisor evidence. It was a categorical bar. When

you get into the chronology of what happened, you will 

see no indication otherwise. Neither Rule 401 nor Rule 

403 support such a blanket prohibition. As I mentioned 

under rule 401 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think the 

court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the 

evidence was admissible? Because as I understand your 

answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a 

403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the 

district court to undertake that.

 MR. EGAN: Your Honor, I think that what the 

-- my reading of the Tenth Circuit, for what it's worth, 

is that they were looking at the exclusionary order 

based on the wrong legal rule and said, we are going to 

reverse that. And that we see nothing that indicates 

that the evidence is overly prejudicial, since that's 

basically all that they were looking at.

 There could be, and we assume there would 

be, new motions filed upon remand, in which case we'll 

answer anything going to the merits because we've never 

been allowed to talk about the content of the testimony 

itself. Will it be cumulative? Is it overly 

prejudicial? We've got --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if on the remand 

that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in

the context of a motion in limine and not in the context 

of a new trial?

 MR. EGAN: It should be in the context of 

going back and being remanded, for the court maybe to 

make determination, but our position is in the context 

of a new trial the court can address any new motion that 

hasn't been made.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a new 

trial is required for the district court to make the 403 

determination?

 MR. EGAN: I think that you have to get back 

before the district court procedurally.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Has this Court said that 

403 determinations must always be made on the record?

 MR. EGAN: No, Your Honor, you haven't said 

that they should be on the record, but we're not asking 

for that. We're asking for some indication of what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought that's 

precisely what you are saying, that that there is no 

balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.

 MR. EGAN: Well, Your Honor, there should --

we believe, if -- as you write the opinion, there should 

be -- the court should show there work. You know, it's 

-- as I was taught in grade school, you your work so 

that we know what you did rule on. They should follow

the rules as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems very strange to me 

that we -- there's been -- the case went to the jury 

without the evidence you wanted to get in. The jury 

found for the company. Now if the -- if the trial court 

is going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we 

should then have the very same trial with a new jury? 

That doesn't seem proper.

 MR. EGAN: No, Your Honor, if may I answer 

that question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. EGAN: The only thing that can't happen 

on remand -- I want to make sure this is clear -- is 

that the judge can't exclude on the same basis that 

caused the problem the first time; that is, well, it is 

not Reddick; it's excluded. Not Reddick, it's excluded. 

Any other factors would be open.

think there are two reasons why no remand is necessary. 

The first, as Justice Scalia said, is that you assume 

that the order is correct. You don't assume that it's 

incorrect. The second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- how can we 

make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know 

why this district judge ruled as he or she did? We had 

a precedent.  It -- it dealt with employee discipline. 

We said, categorically, it's got to be the same 

supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant.

 The district judge was simply applying that 

case to this case.

 MR. CANE: Neither --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't any 403 

question. It was this doesn't some in.

 MR. CANE: Neither that case nor this case 

involved any attempt to show that foundation, the 

linkage between these other persons, these other alleged 

bad actors, and the decision here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- the 

point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an 

absolute rule: It doesn't come in. We know why he made 

an absolute rule; that was our precedent.

 MR. CANE: Well, I think the Tenth Circuit 

-- it -- it applied the incorrect presumption. It

should have applied the presumption that an evidentiary 

ruling is correct rather than incorrect.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How could ut have been? 

What about the date problem he just mentioned? You said 

-- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in 

limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't 

been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the 

trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly 

none in the notion that I could see.

 MR. CANE: Well, that always will be true in 

the case of a motion in limine. But the motion in 

limine anticipated the specific evidence that had 

emerged in discovery --

JUSTICE BREYER: But where does it say? I 

can't find in the motion, although there is something on 

disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I 

don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in 

this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it 

is a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time. Now, I 

just can't find that.

 MR. CANE: I don't think district judges can 

be expected to, you know, write opinions that are -- to 

be affirmed to be worthy of publication in F. Supp.2d. I 

think the district court considers the evidence thrown 

at him or her, and in this case all --

JUSTICE BREYER: Did anyone argue that 

before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the 

mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste 

of time? Did anyone argue that before December 15, 

2004?

 MR. CANE: That's the time when --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking yes or no; did 

they or didn't they?

 MR. CANE: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. CANE: Because that's when the court 

considered notions in limine. The court was not setting 

standards in anticipation of a trial until the trial.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said there were two 

points about 403.

 MR. CANE: Yes, the second is I agree with 

Justice Alito's observation, or I think it was his 

observation, that it would have been abuse -- an of 

discretion to admit this evidence anyway; and so that 

gets you easily by the 403 issue. I don't think you 

need -- there's a lot of court of appeals cases that say 

that where 403 factors are obvious, where they're 

implicit, there's not any obligation on the court of 

appeals' part -- or on the district court's part -- to 

-- to set them forth and explicitly engage in

rebalancing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you not think that 

there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit 

recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute 

bar? If we just assume in favor of the district court, 

when we don't know that the district court didn't take 

it as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law 

that should be clarified for the benefit of district 

courts. Either there's a categorical bar or there's 

not.

 MR. CANE: I think that, absent some showing 

of relationship of nexus, then the presumptive rule in 

the run of cases should be that this evidence should not 

be admitted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't want that 

clarification to be done at the expense your client, I 

take it?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. CANE: Of course not. Of course not.

 Let me respond to a couple of the Solicitor 

General's points. The Solicitor General in his brief 

said three things with which we agree: the plaintiff's 

burden to lay foundation; anecdotes don't comprise --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Government 

said it was not necessary to lay a foundation.
