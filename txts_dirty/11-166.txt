CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway 

Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank. 

Mr. Neff. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. NEFF 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. NEFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The question presented in this case is 

whether a secured creditor must be allowed to credit bid 

when its collateral is being sold under a Chapter 11 

plan. The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code 

plainly says no. 

Section 1129(b)(2)(A) provides that a 

Chapter 11 plan must be fair and equitable to a secured 

creditor that objects to it. 

It then provides three alternatives that the 

debtor can pursue to satisfy that test. Any one of 

these three alternatives can be used when assets are 

being sold, but only one of them requires the right to 

credit bid. 

Under subsection (i), the plan must allow 

the creditor to retain its lien and receive payments

over time, with the present value equal to the value of 

its collateral. 

Under subsection (ii), the plan must allow 

the creditor to credit bid when its asset is being sold 

free of its lien. 

But under subsection (iii), the plan must 

provide the creditor with the indubitable equivalent of 

its secured claim. 

The debtors have chosen to pursue a plan --

a plan sale without credit bidding under subsection 

(iii). 

The plain language of the statute permits 

that result. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how does one 

determine what is the indubitable equivalent of the 

creditor's claim? 

MR. NEFF: The indubitable equivalent will 

be determined at the time of plan confirmation, in our 

case, after the sale has been conducted, although not 

yet approved by the court. So the court will have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the sale --

something -- the sale can't go on without the court's 

approval. I mean, the -- the auction has to have the 

court's approval, right? 

MR. NEFF: Well, here's what happens

typically: The debtor files a motion, as we did in this 

case, to approve bid procedures. The court then 

determines whether those bid procedures are appropriate 

for the sale. 

The sale is then conducted. Then the debtor 

goes to plan confirmation; and, at the plan confirmation 

hearing, aside from establishing the 16 requirements of 

Section 1129 for a plan to be confirmed, the debtor also 

seeks to confirm the results of the sale. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so what qualifies as 

indubitably equivalent? 

MR. NEFF: The indubitable equivalent must 

be an amount that is at least equal to the amount of the 

secured claim. In essence, it's going to be determined 

by what the assets sold for, provided that the sale has 

generated the best possible price for the asset. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the -- suppose 

the creditor thinks that the -- the sale was --

undervalued the assets, that it -- it wasn't the 

equivalent? 

MR. NEFF: The creditor has an opportunity, 

at the plan confirmation hearing, to raise any issue 

with regard to the sale process, with regard to the 

auction that occurred -- has the opportunity to raise any 

other issue that may bear on the price that is received

at the sale that occurs. 

For instance, it could say, well, they 

conducted this auction, but I have an appraisal here 

that says the property is worth much more. So this 

can't possibly be -- my --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't the -- isn't the 

issue who is going to decide whether something is really 

the indubitable equivalent? Is it going to be the 

judge, which is what you would like? Or is it going to 

be determined through a particular bidding procedure --

MR. NEFF: Well, it's --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- namely, where there can 

be credit bidding, which is what the -- which is what 

the Respondent would like. 

MR. NEFF: It's going to be the judge, after 

reviewing what happens at the sale. The problem with 

allowing a creditor the right to credit bid under all 

circumstances is, in a case like ours, we don't believe 

we will ever get to an auction because no one else will 

show up. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Respondent 

thought that what the judge would determine would 

indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent, then 

there wouldn't be an issue here, right? 

The reason why there's an issue is because

they don't think that what the judge will decide will 

indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent. 

MR. NEFF: In this particular instance, I 

would suggest that the -- the creditor simply does not 

want the asset sold. It would rather take the asset 

back and hold it for some time period. So it's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that --

isn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he 

insisted upon security before giving the loan? 

MR. NEFF: Well, what they bargained for was 

that the asset be liquidated and all of the proceeds 

applied to their loan. And that's exactly what we 

propose to do under our sale procedure. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're 

depriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to 

hold on to the asset because he thinks it is, for 

perhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued. Right? 

MR. NEFF: Well, he -- he is denied that 

right under subsection (i), which is our traditional 

reorganization -- internal reorganization provision of 

Section 1129(b)(2)(A). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- did I cut off 

your answer to Justice Alito? 

MR. NEFF: Well, with regard to the 

indubitable equivalence, clearly, the judge is going to

make that determination. But that's no different than 

the judge making a determination under subsection (i) as 

to what the fair market value of the collateral is for 

purposes of determining the note that the creditor is 

going to receive and be paid off over time. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could the -- could the 

judge say, when the proposal is made to him, the only 

way I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent 

is to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is 

what we always do? Can the judge say that? 

MR. NEFF: If there is testimony provided to 

the judge that that is the way that will maximize the 

sale proceeds and that, in fact, you can't get 

indubitable equivalence unless you allow credit bidding, 

it would seem to me, under that circumstance, the judge 

would have that discretion. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you're, you're --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It makes no sense to me 

what you are saying because, under all circumstances, 

the credit bid, unless the property is valued higher 

than the credit bid amount, but then another bidder 

could do -- could make -- could enter that bid. 

MR. NEFF: Well, the problem is when --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The maximum value always 

has to be the value of the credit.

3 the creditor is willing to put it at risk that way. 

4  MR. NEFF: Your Honor, I would disagree. I 

think, in a situation like ours, no one else is going to 

6 come to bid because creditors who are -- or potential 

7 purchasers who are looking to buy a hotel have multiple 

8 opportunities to buy other hotels. 

9  So if they know that they are going to show 

up at a sale, where a creditor is owed substantially in 

11 excess of what the property is likely to sell for, they 

12 are not going to spend their time and effort doing the 

13 due diligence that is required to acquire or make a bid 

14 on an asset like a hotel. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And so what's wrong with that? 

16 I mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars. For the 

17 million dollars, he got an interest -- a secured 

18 interest in a piece of property. And that property is 

19 worth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth -- less 

than a million, and he says that's the deal. 

21  I -- I have a secured interest in this; I 

22 want the property. Now, you are better off because you 

23 can stretch out the payments over time, and maybe you 

24 don't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't 

see anything unfair about saying, give him the property

if he wants it. 

MR. NEFF: That, in essence, would be 

denying Chapter 11 relief to a host of debtors where 

their collateral is worth --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in accordance with 

(i), (ii) and (iii). I mean, I'm not saying skip those. 

MR. NEFF: What -- the problem is you are 

cutting off the bankruptcy process, really, before it 

has --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand that. 

mean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, I read 

this makes perfect sense. What they are trying to do is 

help the debtor a little, without mucking up the secured 

creditor's collateral. Choice (i), give the secured 

creditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on 

it. He has what he had before, and the debtor is better 

off because he can stretch the payments out over time, 

and that's one and two. 

Choice (ii), we give the creditor some new 

collateral. Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure 

it's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few 

exceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit 

bid. So he has it within his control. 

Choice (iii), something else which comes up 

in different situations, for example, a creditor who is

over-secured, see, and -- and they want to sell the 

piece of property. And he says, sure, I will let you 

sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent, 

give me this other property over here that you own, that 

has no liens at all. And the judge can look at that and 

say that's fair. That's what (iii) is basically about, 

as far as I could understand it. 

So it all makes sense to me. And I don't 

understand why you would want to have a rule saying that 

(iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding. 

MR. NEFF: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the whole thing, 

as I am seeing it at this moment. So I'll give you a 

chance to reply. 

MR. NEFF: Thank you. Your Honor, I don't 

see subsection (iii) as having the limiting language 

that it should have if, in fact, it was meant to be 

something other than what is in subsection (i) or 

subsection (ii). There is no language that says, except 

as provided for in subsection (i) or (ii), relief other 

than --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't have the 

language, which is why we have a case. But, I mean, 

trying to interpret it in a way that makes sense, what 

is wrong with what I said as a way that makes sense?

mean, why, since we are trying to give the -- the 

creditor the indubitable value, at the very least -- the 

best way to do that would be let the creditor credit 

bid. 

MR. NEFF: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So why not? And you can 

read it. You don't have to read it the way that -- that 

you want. You could read it the opposite way, too. 

MR. NEFF: If you are looking at it from the 

perspective of the creditor saying well, this -- -

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm looking at it from 

the perspective of a bankruptcy system --

MR. NEFF: Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that is trying to get 

secured creditors what they have their security in, 

while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able 

to stretch out his payments. 

MR. NEFF: I agree. And there are other 

parties and interests in -- in a bankruptcy case, 

including, obviously, unsecured creditors, that get 

nothing, if the result is all the creditor gets is the 

relief from the automatic stay to foreclose on the 

collateral, when you have this great discrepancy between 

what it’s owed --

anything, anyway? I mean, your brief suggests that, 

somehow, there are these unsecured creditors in the mix 

who are going to receive some benefit if your 

understanding of this statute goes forward. 

But, you know, in a circumstance like this, 

doesn't the secured creditor either get the property or 

get the money from the property, and the unsecured 

creditors are out of the mix regardless? 

MR. NEFF: Well, in our particular instance, 

obviously, there are some senior liens that would be 

paid, including things like mechanic's liens and real 

estate taxes. There are other costs that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But those are -- those 

continue forward. So even if the secured creditor got 

the property, there would be mechanic's liens on the 

property, isn't that right? 

MR. NEFF: That's true, although resolving 

them pursuant to a plan is usually a better resolution 

for them, by providing more certainty and -- with regard 

to the result, and a more quicker resolution, usually, 

as opposed to being relegated only to State court to 

fight them. In our --

MR. NEFF: I was only going to say that, in 

our particular instance, the stalking horse had agreed 

over a future time, after it obtains the property, to 

provide for recovery to general unsecured creditors. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- let's look at the 

text. Little (ii) provides for exactly what you want to 

do here. What you want to do under (iii) is precisely 

what (ii) says, except you want to eliminate, subject to 

Section 363(k) of this title, right? 

Does it -- does it make much sense for a 

provision to say you can do it three ways: number (i); 

number (ii), you can have this sale subject to credit 

bidding; and number (iii), after -- after saying that, 

specifically, oh, you can have this sale, not subject to 

credit bidding? 

That's -- that's not a very sensible 

statute. Why -- why go through that -- that problem 

of -- of saying number (ii), if you could have left it 

to number (iii) anyway? 

MR. NEFF: Subsection (ii) provides that, if 

you allow credit bidding, regardless of the price that's 

achieved, that that is deemed to be fair and equitable 

treatment of the secured creditor's claim. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's just not true 

from what you just said, meaning what you just said is

that the buyer, obviously, is paying other things off, 

and by definition, he's deducting that from the purchase 

price. No one gives a purchase price for a piece of 

property and agrees to pay something else and gives the 

highest price for the property once they've done that. 

So what you're asking for is permission for 

the debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and 

that's what I thought a secured interest prevented. 

MR. NEFF: With regard to Justice Scalia's 

question, all I was trying to point out is that, in 

subsection (ii), regardless of the -- the price that is 

achieved as long, as you allow the secured creditor the 

right to credit bid --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why doesn't he get --

MR. NEFF: -- that's the fair and 

equitable --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why doesn't he get 

everything that the buyer is promising to everyone else? 

For that, indubitably, is part of the price because he 

is giving out money to others. That's part of the value 

of this property. So why isn't the creditor -- the 

secured creditor, entitled to all of the proceeds from 

the property? 

MR. NEFF: The secured creditor will get all 

the proceeds from the property.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still haven't

MR. NEFF: There are other benefits that the 

secured creditor -- that will get, that will increase 

the -- the price that is received by having sold the 

property in bankruptcy. For instance, when you sell 

through a plan, you avoid the payment of transfer taxes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. NEFF: So, clearly, to the extent that 

the transfer taxes being saved are in an amount that 

exceeds what ultimately goes to the unsecured creditors, 

these --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still haven't 

answered my question. If the buyer had money that he's 

willing to give up to others, why isn't he putting it in 

the purchase price? Why isn't that part of the price? 

MR. NEFF: It would be our obligation to 

show at confirmation that the creditor is paying the top 

dollar for the asset. If the creditor desires to pay a

bonus or a premium on top of that, we would have to show 

that, nonetheless, that the secured creditor is 

receiving the indubitable equivalent and either have to 

show by argument that -- a savings on the transfer tax 

or some other way that this is not causing the secured 

creditor to not receive the indubitable equivalent. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could -- could you 

explain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit 

bid, if property is sold during the plan, but not 

permitting it when it's sold at plan time? 

MR. NEFF: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that delay the 

bankruptcy in every situation? I can't actually 

understand what benefit, other than delay of the 

bankruptcy process, that would occasion. 

MR. NEFF: Is your question why we always 

have it under Section 363, but not under the plan? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-hmm. 

MR. NEFF: Section 363 allows the sale of 

property outside the ordinary course of business during 

a bankruptcy case. It can be done as quickly as on 

21 days' notice. So it can be done on a very truncated 

basis, or even more quickly if the debtor can show that 

there is cause, some reason to have an even faster sale. 

There is no requirement that you show that any of the

plan requirements in Section 1129 must be met. 

So there are good reasons to have this 

protection for the secured creditor when you are selling 

under Section 363 outside of a plan context that don't 

necessarily exist when you are selling in the course of 

a plan because a plan takes a much longer time period, 

usually at least 2 months' notice, if not much longer --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Neff, don't you feel 

sorry for the United States? The United States is often 

in the creditor situation, and the United States cannot 

come up with cash. 

Are they going to run to Congress and get an 

appropriation for each -- each security case it has? 

What -- what do you propose we do with the United 

States? The United States just can't take any security 

interests anymore or what? 

MR. NEFF: Well, no, I don't think that that 

is the case. And I did see that in their brief, and I 

don't know the extent that, in practice, that actually 

occurs because, for instance, they pointed out the SBA 

loans. Those are typically guaranteed loans. So there 

would be a motivation, at least by the principals of the 

debtor, to maximize the return to the SBA. 

But as far as them not being allowed to 

credit bid, there are -- they have the opportunity to

seek --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't understand. 

MR. NEFF: Well, they can seek from the 

Bankruptcy Court a greater role when the asset is being 

marketed for sale to ensure that they are receiving top 

dollar on their claim. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't have that 

right now? They don't have that right now? 

MR. NEFF: Well, when we sell assets, the 

debtor typically has the control over how it's going to 

be marketed and sold. They may give some input rights 

to the secured creditor, but they're usually not going 

to give the secured creditor the veto power over how to 

conduct the sale. 

But I -- I would suggest that, when you have 

a situation with a creditor that truly cannot bid cash, 

that -- that there would be an opportunity to impress 

upon the judge that they need to have a greater role 

when you are actually marketing and selling the 

property. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Neff, can I understand 

how your system would actually work in practice? 

Suppose you have an -- an auction, and there is -- the 

top value was $500. And then you have the secured

creditor, let's say, is in the position of the United 

States and comes in and says, we couldn't credit bid, 

but we -- excuse me -- we couldn't pay cash, but we 

think it's $750. 

MR. NEFF: Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And, now, the court has to 

decide whether it's $500 or $750, after the auction has 

gone forward. What happens? 

MR. NEFF: The court is going to review the 

process to actually sell the asset -- you know, who 

was -- where was it marketed, who knew about it, who 

showed up at the auction, how many bids were made --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now, let's say the 

court says, You know, I think that the government is 

right; it's really $750. But you've already had a sale. 

MR. NEFF: Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and you've sold it 

for $500. 

MR. NEFF: There has been no closing. The 

closing doesn't occur until the plan confirmation 

actually occurs. And, in fact, that's how you would do 

it after this Court's ruling in 2008.

yes, well, you know, I -- I guess that that price is 

probably so low because nobody could credit bid. I 

mean, wouldn't that always be a -- a frailty of 

whatever -- whatever price it sold for? Wouldn't it 

always be? 

MR. NEFF: No, because you are going to have 

situations where creditors -- secured creditors will 

credit bid amounts that have no relationship to the fair 

market value, what we call, for instance, loan-to-own 

lenders, where their only interest is actually getting 

the title to the property. So you are going to have 

situations that -- where the credit bid does not equate 

to market --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that might be, but --

you know, it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to 

figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or 

for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher 

bids than -- than if you allow them to bid for cash 

only. 

MR. NEFF: The problem is, when you are 

dealing with larger assets, like what we are dealing 

with, you are not going to get a sophisticated buyer to 

come in to bid against a lender that can credit bid, 

particularly in a situation like our case, where the 

lender has said, I simply want the property back.

secured creditors receiving the --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: You said -- look, in subsection 

7 (iii), if it applies here -- I assume there's -- suppose it 

8 doesn't apply here. There is a safeguard against having 

9 no bidder. 

Bidders who would bid more than what the 

11 creditor thinks it's worth, the creditor will want them 

12 in this. And if they -- he doesn't want it in, it's 

13 because he thinks it's worth more in his own hands. So 

14 what's the problem? 

But there is a problem the other way. The 

16 problem the other way -- and I'm not saying it's this

18 stalking horse, we would like you to put this up at a 

19 low price and give us a job. And if they keep the 

creditor out, well, that's a big incentive. 

21  And they are the ones who know what a hotel

have in a bankruptcy, individuals who may be 

6 self-interested, yet they are supposed to be fiduciaries 

7 for the estate. It's part of our roles as lawyers to be 

8 the fiduciaries as well. 

9  Our particular instance, it's not a concern 

because the property is being marketed to a wide array 

11 of people. There's no requirement that they keep the 

12 management company, and there's every opportunity for 

13 any other hotel company to come in -- or any other 

14 strategic buyer --

being hired by the stalking horse, if he wins.

make sure that stalking horse gets the property. And 

that incentive is destroyed -- or at least doesn't work, 

if you allow the creditor bid. 

MR. NEFF: Interestingly, the process 

actually works a little different than that. 

You -- Debtors will go out -- and their 

financial advisers will actually go out and try to 

market the ability to be the stalking horse, to actually 

try to get the best stalking horse bid. 

In this particular instance, what we got was 

the -- ultimately, the $55 million. We are confident 

the property, ultimately, will sell for more. 

JUSTICE ALITO: When this procedure is 

followed, how often does a buyer, other than the 

stalking horse, obtain the property? 

MR. NEFF: I don't know from a statistical 

basis -- and, you know, a stalking horse, if they have 

the -- the -- a break-up fee, they have that built-in 

cushion. And in our case, I would point out the judge 

had not yet approved the break-up fee, but it was a 

standard 3 percent of the -- of the bid price. So I 

don't know what -- what percentage it is, and -- you

JUSTICE SCALIA: The judge has to approve

MR. NEFF: That's part of the bid 

procedures. 

And buyers -- more sophisticated buyers --

and when you deal with bigger assets, they're used to 

the process being this way, that there is going to be a 

stalking horse and that there is going to be some sort 

of protection. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The vast majority of 

bankruptcy courts have permitted credit bidding in these 

situations. So if the vast majority of bankruptcies 

have stalking horses, then the norm is working, without 

us having to rule in your favor. 

MR. NEFF: I would say the vast majority of 

cases occur under Section 363, where there is no 

question, because of 363(k), that there is the right --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And stalking horses 

still come in. So it's not as if the 363(k) procedure 

is failing in maximizing prices.

363(k), almost invariably, the secured creditor 

supports, so there is no question, but that there is 

going to be a transaction occurring, whereas --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- say it again? I 

didn't -- I didn't understand that. 

MR. NEFF: When you are selling under 

Section 363, because of 363(k), there must be a right to 

credit bid; and, in most situations, the secured 

creditor wants the assets sold when you are doing a 

Section 363 sale. So there is no question, in the minds 

of a buyer, but that there is going to be a transaction. 

And there is a reason to spend your time and effort 

learning more and doing due diligence about the asset. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- Well, this 

is a case, though, where you would not want the asset 

sold. In other words, looking at it, he thinks, for 

particular, unusual situations, this is vastly 

undervalued; I am holding an asset that is going to 

appreciate if I hold onto it. So he doesn't want the 

asset sold. 

MR. NEFF: That's correct. And -- and it's 

our belief that the Bankruptcy Code provides the 

ability, in subsection (iii), to conduct the sale and 

pay the secured creditor the indubitable equivalence of 

its claim.

current market conditions, but to the extent that the 

secured creditor brings in an appraisal, that will

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Secured creditors bargain for the right to 

be repaid in full or, if not, to foreclose and take the 

collateral that secures their loan. 

When a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan is going 

to cram down a plan over the objection of a secured 

creditor, Section 1129(b)(2)(A) gives the secured 

creditor the ability to protect those rights, regardless

of the proposed treatment of its collateral. 

Specifically, when the plan proposes, as 

here, to sell the collateral, free and clear of the 

secured creditor's liens, and give the secured creditor 

nothing but the proceeds from that sale, clause (ii) 

entitles the secured creditor to bid what it is owed in 

the absence of cause to preclude it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or -- or he is 

entitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his 

claims. You really do just kind of elide the fact that 

the statute says, "or." 

MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. We give full 

meaning to the "or." We don't dispute that these are 

three alternative ways to cram down a plan. The 

question here is or what? And the question is the scope 

of the alternatives and in which circumstances they 

apply. 

And, here, Congress turned its attention to 

precisely the situation at hand and determined what the 

requirements were, but not just the requirements for a 

sale free and clear. It's not like clause (ii) says, if 

you sell it free and clear and you allow credit bidding, 

then that's one way to go. It's not just the 

requirement of credit bidding. It also sets forth the 

only exception to credit bidding. And Petitioners'

reading would read clause (iii) to be a much bigger 

exception. 

Now, Petitioners here tried and failed in 

the Bankruptcy Court to prove cause, and they don't 

appeal that. So they are trying to create a much bigger 

exception to the exception Congress allowed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They tried and failed to 

prove what? 

JUSTICE ALITO: Cause. 

MS. MAYNARD: Your Honor, cause. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Cause. 

MS. MAYNARD: So under -- we reprint -- the 

1129 clause (ii) is on 20a in the red brief at the back. 

And it -- it provides: "For the sale, subject to 

Section 363(k) of this title, of any property that is 

subject to liens securing such claims free and clear of 

such liens." And that refers you to 363(k), which is 

also at the back of our brief. 

And 363(k) provides that, "Unless the court 

for cause orders otherwise, the holder of such claim may 

bid at such sale; and if the holder of such claim 

purchases such property, such holder may offset such 

claim against the purchase price of such property." 

So my point is clause (ii) is not just, if 

you let them credit bid, then that's one way to go to

fair and equitable. It's you must let them credit bid, 

unless cause is shown. And they tried in the Bankruptcy 

Court, Justice Scalia, to prove cause. And the district 

court found against them on that point, and they don't 

appeal it. I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your friend 

on the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address 

different ways of protecting the secured creditor. (ii) 

is procedural, right? You can go through these 

procedures, and you can cram down, so long as you are 

going through these procedures, which include credit 

bidding. 

Or you can cram down if you ensure that he 

receives the indubitable equivalent, a substantive 

protection. What is wrong with that reading? 

MS. MAYNARD: I don't think that's a fair 

characterization of the three clauses, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because all three of the clauses have both 

procedural and substantive components. And essentially, 

what Petitioners seek to do here is exchange their 

preferred procedure, which is a sale without allowing us 

to credit bid, followed by a judicial determination of 

whether whatever number that sale produces is high 

enough to be our secured claim. 

But the whole point is, if the secured

creditor is willing to bid one more dollar of what it's 

owed at the sale, that is the value of our secured 

claim. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that, really, 

the heart of your argument is that the real value of 

this property is greater than the value that you think 

the Bankruptcy Court would assign to it, if this were 

done under subsection (iii)? 

MS. MAYNARD: That is definitely the fear, 

Justice Alito. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why? Why do you have that 

fear? 

MS. MAYNARD: Because valuations are 

inherently uncertain, and Congress knew that. And in 

this Bankruptcy Code, Congress tried to move away from 

judicial valuations for precisely that reason. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But doesn't clause (i) 

depend upon a judicial valuation? In clause (i), the 

Court has to say, what is the present value of your 

property, so that it knows what the right income stream 

is. 

MS. MAYNARD: That's true, Justice Kagan. 

But, if you proceed through clause (i), the code 

provides a secured creditor with a different protection 

against undervaluation. So the whole code structure is

set up to protect the secured creditor against the risk 

of undervaluation of its claim. And that's the Section 

1111(b) election. So Section 1111(b) election allows 

the secured creditor who is undersecured and is afraid 

that their -- their value of their property will be 

misvalued in a clause (i), to elect to have their entire 

face value of their claim treated as secured. 

So here, the lenders are owed more than 

$130 million. If they were to proceed under clause (i), 

the lenders would have the option to have that whole 

$130 million treated as secured. And that would be the 

value of the secured claim. 

And, under clause (i), yes, we would then be 

subject to the judicial determination of the present 

value of whatever a note paying out $130 million would 

be, but two protections we would have. They wouldn't be 

determining the principal. The principal -- the face 

value of the note would have to be $130 million; and the 

lien that we would retain would be $130 million. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: How about in subsection 

(iii), where it talks about substitute collateral? 

That's completely a judicial valuation, isn't it? 

MS. MAYNARD: That would be true, but I 

think, in that situation, we would also have the option 

to make the 1111(b) election. And, therefore, they

1 would have to substitute collateral that would be up to 

2 the $130 million mark. So it's true -- and it's true 

3 that Congress did leave this other, but it is an other. 

4  And I think -- I think another way to --

another point to make that clear is the fact that clause 

6 (ii) expressly has a role for clause (iii), and it 

7 doesn't come into play until after the sale at which the 

8 secured creditor gets to credit bid. And --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is it about the 

auction -- what is it about the auction process that you 

11 think is likely to produce or creates an -- an 

12 unacceptable risk of producing a valuation that is --

13 that is too low? Is it because of this -- the use of 

14 the stalking horse or -- or what is it about the 

process? 

16  MS. MAYNARD: If the secured creditors 

17 aren't able to come in and bid their credit and if the 

18 secured creditors can't, as is a real risk, raise enough 

19 cash to bid the amount of their credit in cash -- and, 

in some instances, as with the government, they’re -- they 

21 can't -- they actually can't. 

22  But, in a lot of these complicated loans, 

23 there are multiple lenders, and it would be very 

24 difficult to come up with the money to put in. And they 

are, therefore -- you are taking out of the marketplace

one of the most knowledgeable bidders about this 

property. And there is no good reason to do that. 

These -- it's not like they are bidding funny money. 

They -- they have already put in $142 million. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there is, 

of course, a good reason, which is consistent with the 

policy of the Bankruptcy Code, which is you do want to 

look out for the other creditors as well. And if the 

secured creditor is getting, indubitably, the value of 

this security, why don't you weigh in the balance at 

least the interests of -- of the other creditors? 

MS. MAYNARD: There will be no cash for 

anyone junior to these creditors, unless these creditors 

are paid in full, regardless of whether everyone bids in 

cash or we bid in credit. This property is well under 

water. There -- there is no equity in it. The secured 

lenders have lent them 142 million --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe in this 

particular case, but that's not going to be true in 

every case, and we are asked to issue a ruling that is 

going to apply in every case. 

MS. MAYNARD: In every case where the 

property is under water, there will be -- in every case 

in which the secured creditor has a lien on the 

property, the secured creditor takes first. So until

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but

security is worth a lot less than -- than it was, 

6 obviously, when it was -- was purchased. Or a lot less 

7 than -- a lot less than the claim that it was meant to 

8 secure. 

9  MS. MAYNARD: Everyone agrees that the 

property is under water, but it's important to note that 

11 the valuations in this case that have been filed in the 

12 district court, in conjunction with the relief from the 

13 stay, the appraisals are different by tens of millions 

14 of dollars, what the property is worth. 

And if you allow that to go to a judge, to 

16 decide whether it's enough, that's an inherently 

17 uncertain process. And -- you know, judicial valuation, 

18 the -- the court -- tens of millions of dollars, the 

19 judge could decide, and it might not be a fact that we 

could overturn, if that goes to a fairly erroneous finding.

want to sell the property, and he still wants his 

security, and they have to put in equivalent property 

that wasn't mortgaged, but I was just guessing. 

MS. MAYNARD: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what is it 

really -- what is it really used for, in your opinion? 

MS. MAYNARD: The legislative history, 

Justice Breyer, suggests two meanings for it. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What? 

MS. MAYNARD: Two examples. And that's what 

you see in the case. There aren't very many clause 

(iii) cases. There will be many more, if this Court 

holds that this is permissible. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I'm sure. 

MS. MAYNARD: But that -- there aren't very 

many clause (iii) cases. And they abandon --

abandonment of the collateral. So, in other words, they 

could decide just to turn all of the collateral over, 

and that would be the indubitable -- that would be res 

ipsa, our secured claim. I mean, that -- the -- we have 

collateral in everything they own, the hotel, the 

garage, all of the proceeds. 

Or, as Justice Kagan was suggesting, some of 

the cases involve providing a substitute lien. But the

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I was thinking. 

MS. MAYNARD: -- courts are very hesitant to 

do that. And it would have to be really -- because it 

is -- you know, you are stripping our lien. You're 

supposedly giving us an equal lien. So -- you know, 

maybe if you can imagine -- maybe if these creditors 

owned the airport at the Dulles -- you know, a hotel at 

the Dulles Airport and a parking garage, and one could 

say it's exactly the same risk factor and everything, 

and we're going to swap that in for this. But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

the -- what's the purpose -- if you permit credit 

bidding, why do you go through the sale at all, if it's 

always -- if the credit is always going to be higher 

than the value? Why don't you just turn over the 

property under (iii)? What -- why do you -- why do you 

go through the sham of a sale? 

MS. MAYNARD: It's not a sham, 

Justice Sotomayor, because the creditor -- secured 

creditors don't often want to run a hotel and parking 

garage. They may not want the property. So what they 

are interested in doing is maximizing the value, getting 

back as much as they can of the money that they --

they get the highest price from someone else and then 

let that other person have it, is that it? 

MS. MAYNARD: That's definitely one of the 

strategies. And if they -- so they -- so what clause 

(ii) allows a secured creditor -- it allows the secured 

creditor to choose whether it takes its property, which 

was the right it had prebankruptcy, or whether it's 

enough. But if you leave it to their system -- and

one that -- that goes to something Justice Kagan asked 

earlier, which is -- is -- when there's some dispute 

about priority or whether there might be senior liens. 

So, in this case, the -- the bankruptcy 

judge provided at 44(a) and 45(a) -- because there --

there are some real estate taxes that would be senior to 

our liens, and there's a debate about whether the 

mechanic's liens are senior or not. 

And so the bankruptcy judge provided that --

that -- that, here, it would be appropriate for us to 

either put up cash, in that amount, the amount of the 

potentially senior liens, or to offer -- you know, some 

security to cover those, in the event that they turn up. 

And that is an example of cause. And that is --

clearly answers the concern that there may be others. 

No one junior to these creditors is going to 

take anything. And all making us cash bid would do, 

assuming the secured creditors are able to come up with 

the cash to bid in this amount, would be to endless --

just to pointlessly cycle money into the estate, and 

then, if we're the winning bid, through the estate and 

back to us, at the risk of their siphoning off the money 

that really shouldn't go to anyone else because we 

have -- the cash collateral is these secured 

creditors' -- the hotel and the parking garage are all

these secured creditors' collateral. 

Now, the Petitioners say this is going to --

if you let the secured creditors bid, this is going to 

chill credit bidding. Well, they tried to prove that in 

the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court, at pages 

43(a) and 44(a), rejected that as a matter of fact. 

But, anyway, as a matter of theory, their 

proposal -- who would bid in their proposal? Their 

proposal is you do the due diligence, you have to prove 

you have the money, you put up the bid, and then at the 

back end, you know that the secured creditor is going to 

be able to come in and tell the bankruptcy judge, I 

would have bid more with my secured credit. So anyone 

who bids knows that there's the potential that it's all 

going to be a waste of time. 

And then how do you do it over at that 

point? Once everybody has shown their hand, put their 

bids in, what, are you going to take a mulligan after 

the -- after the bankruptcy court says, no, they're not 

getting their indubitable equivalent because I find they 

would have bid more in their security? 

Well, that's just -- that -- who's going to 

bid in that situation?

does it work in practice? Is this something that is

subject of extensive negotiation? The secured creditor 

says, well, I'm interested in bidding in a credit bid, 

but I appreciate that that's going to make it difficult 

for you to get cash. 

And you've got these unsecured creditors who 

would want -- and so, what? I'm not going to credit 

bid, so long as -- or I will only credit bid up to this 

particular amount; or let's sit down and work out a 

deal, negotiate over exactly how we're going to handle 

my security. Is -- is that really how it happens? Or 

is that not -- or not. 

MS. MAYNARD: I think all those things are 

ways that it can happen, Mr. Chief Justice. And, 

certainly, counsel was distinguishing the --

during the plan sale requirement, where he concedes 

that, if you do a 363(b) sale -- you know, 363(k) 

applies, but he says it's not a problem because you can 

negotiate. 

There are actually many negotiations in a --

in a plan sale context. And it would be odd, I would --

I would suggest, that you can do a cramdown plan over 

the secured creditor's objection and have less credit 

bidding rights than you can when you agree to do it. 

And so, in the end, there's nothing wrong 

with the secured creditor coming in and bidding its

credit and taking the asset. After all, they already 

put in $142 million. They're owed $130 million. The 

debtors have no equity in -- in this process. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't that be a reason 

for saying that there's no adequate -- there's nothing 

under (iii) that would be the indubitable equivalent? 

In other words, one thing is to say that, if 

you -- if (ii) -- if you fit into (ii), that's it, you 

don't go to (iii). Another is to say, well, you can go 

to (iii), but it's most unlikely that there would be the 

indubitable equivalent of allowing credit bidding. 

MS. MAYNARD: I don't think that latter way 

would be the better reading of the statute, Justice 

Ginsburg, because Congress turned its attention to this 

precise problem and decided that the best way to protect 

the secured creditor against the risk of undervaluation 

was to allow it to -- to bid. And I -- and I think, for 

the reasons I said earlier, the system that they propose 

is -- is not a workable system or a good system, and it 

wouldn't be good to have there be uncertainty about the 

auction -- about whether or not it was going to 

ultimately -- you know, go through. 

And as long as the secured creditor is 

willing to bid at the -- at the auction its secured 

credit, put its money where its mouth is, that is the

value of its -- of its secured claim, and so it could 

never be the indubitable equivalent to go under (iii), 

where it's not allowed to bid. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: The Petitioner suggests that 

the usual rule that the specific governs, rather than 

the general provision, doesn't apply in this case 

because the specific is not a subset of the general. 

What's -- what's -- what's your view about that? 

MS. MAYNARD: Well, this Court's never 

applied the rule in that way. And I think the Court --

it's -- it's always the case that, when the Court's 

looking at these kinds of problems, that the general 

provision could be read to encompass what the party 

before the Court is seeking to do. 

But the -- when Congress has set up a 

precise scheme -- and, here, I think it's important to 

realize it's not just the requirements, but also the 

exception to the requirements -- and then, also, the way 

that (ii) is -- refers to (iii), and (iii) doesn't kick 

in until after the sale --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I lost you. I lost you. 

MS. MAYNARD: Okay. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just the 

requirements, but the exceptions to the requirements. 

What are you referring to?

MS. MAYNARD: The for cause. 

So by reading in 363(k), Justice Scalia, 

it's not only the requirement of credit bidding, but 

also the only exception. 

But then also, if I could just elaborate 

this -- the point about how it refers to clause (iii), 

on 20(a) of our brief, we set forth the text. The final 

clause of clause (ii) says that, once the sale goes 

through, the liens attach to the proceeds of the sale. 

And the treatment of those liens on the proceeds are 

done under clause (i) or clause (iii) of this 

subparagraph. 

So clause (ii) contemplates that there will 

be some judicial determination of indubitable 

equivalence, but only after the amount of the 

proceeds -- because -- after all, what we're trying to 

determine here is the value of the secured claim. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said, earlier, 

we have never said that the specific has to be a subset 

of the general. How do -- how would it otherwise be 

specific and the one general? It seems, if they are not 

a subset, then they are alternatives. I don't see how 

the whole doctrine makes any sense, if the specific is 

not a subset of the general.

Justice Kagan's question or I misunderstood their point. 

I thought their point was looking specifically at the --

the facts of the Speedy Trial Act case and saying 

because it's a list and it says, "includes," and then 

there are subsets under the list, that's how I 

understood their argument. 

Yes, it's certainly true -- like, take the 

venue statute case -- you know, the general venue 

provision clearly covered patent infringement suits. 

But then there was a specific patent infringement venue 

statute, and the -- the patent infringement statute 

didn't say it was the exclusive patent venue statue, and 

the general venue statute didn't say, "except as 

otherwise provided in the code," yet this Court said, 

well, the patent -- Congress turned its attention to 

patent infringement suits and created this venue. And 

that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when we say, our 

doctrine says the specific controls over the general, 

the specific is a subset of the general? 

MS. MAYNARD: Yes, to the extent that I 

think it's always fair to say that what the party who's 

claiming they fit within the general does could 

definitionally possibly fit within the general. We --

position of -- that actually many secured creditors are 

in these days, which is that we have constraints on our 

ability to cash bid at the sale of our collateral 

through a bankruptcy. And the detailed cramdown 

provisions of Chapter 11 are designed to protect the 

rights of secured creditors. 

The essence of being a secured creditor, of 

course, as the Court has suggested, is that the secured 

creditor has bargained for the right either to get its 

money back or to get the thing that secures its loan, to 

get its collateral.

And the type of sale that is contemplated in 

clause (ii) of Section 1129(b)(2)(A) is precisely 

designed to guarantee that the creditor will get the 

benefit of its bargain. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have got a whole 

cadre of U.S. trustees that, presumably, can look out 

for the interests of the poor United States. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in most Chapter 

11 cases, the U.S. trustee doesn't play a role because 

it's a debtor in possession. And so the trustee is not 

in charge of the property of the estate. The debtor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we were 

worried about the situation where it's a creditor. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Where the -- where the 

United States is a creditor. That -- that's true. But 

if there's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In those cases, of 

course, the trustee's there, right? 

MS. HARRINGTON: The trustee is there. But, 

if the debtor proposes a plan that wouldn't allow the 

United States to credit bid at an auction that is 

selling its collateral, then the United States is 

usually out of luck because the Antideficiency Act 

prevents us from bidding cash. 

Now, I would like to respond to one -- one

sort of assumption that has seemed to permeate the 

conversation here, which is that a secured creditor will 

always have an incentive to bid the full amount of its 

claim at an auction of its assets, where the auction is 

supposed to be free of liens. That is actually not 

true. 

As my friend Ms. Maynard suggested, unless a 

bank is trying to get into the business of running a 

hotel or running whatever business is the collateral, 

the creditor will only want to take the property if it 

thinks it can make a profit by then turning around and 

selling the property. 

So if there is an auction, where there is a 

cash bid, and the creditor thinks that the value of --

the amount of the cash bid is actually a fair valuation 

of the property, the creditor has no incentive to bid 

higher than that in credit because it has no expectation 

of getting more money than that when it then takes the 

property and turns around and sells it. 

So allowing the credit bidding won't have 

the effect of serving as a veto on what would be a fair 

sale price by a cash bidder. The -- the secured 

creditor's incentive is only to bid up to what it -- up 

to what it views as the value of the property and not a 

penny more because it's not trying to take the property

just for the property's sake. In most cases, it wants 

to take the property and then sell the property. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, of 

course, it could bid up if it thinks that there are 

going to be other bidders, right? It has a lot more 

flexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent 

of its security interest. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, it has more 

flexibility because it has already put up its money. 

But every bidder has that incentive that you suggest, 

which is to try to make sure that it's -- to sort of 

game the system a little bit and -- and -- and make 

everybody put their money where their mouth is. 

But Congress gave secured creditors a right 

to have a role, where they get to put their money where 

their mouth is, any time there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just begs the 

question, Congress gave them a right -- I mean, that's 

what we are deciding, right? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely. And -- and 

Petitioner is certainly correct, that the phrase 

"indubitable equivalence," an unusual phrase in the 

statute, that that phrase is broad enough to cover any 

type of disposition of a secured creditor's claim, 

including the sale of property free of liens.

But Congress also enacted two much more 

specific provisions right next to clause (iii). And, in 

those provisions, number (i), which governs -- governs 

the retention of liens on -- on collateral, and number 

(ii), which governs the sale of -- the sale of 

collateral free of liens, there are very specific 

protections written into clauses (i) and clause (ii). 

And this Court's interpretive canon that a specific 

provision will trump a more general provision, where 

both could apply, would seem clearly to apply here. 

If a plan proposes a disposition of a claim 

that is addressed by a clause (i) or a clause (ii), it 

doesn't make any sense to allow them to strip out 

protections that are provided in those clauses by 

purporting to go under the more general standard of 

indubitable equivalence. 

That is especially true because the type of 

judicial valuation of the property that would take place 

under Petitioners' type of scheme is not guaranteed to 

make sure that the creditor gets what it bargained for, 

which is either its money or its property, but that is 

exactly what clause (ii), that type of auction, is 

guaranteed to do. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reference? 

In clause (ii), we were just told, the -- the last

1 clause refers to "under clause (i) or clause (iii)." 

2 What -- what is the reference in (ii) to clause (iii)? 

3 What does that mean? 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, the type of sale 

contemplated in clause (ii) is, essentially, a 

6 liquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a 

7 property. And so you -- the sale would, essentially, 

8 liquidate the lien. And then clause (ii) provides 

9 that -- that there would need to be a replacement lien 

on the proceeds of the sale. That replacement lien 

11 would then have to be treated under clause (i) or clause 

12 (iii). 

13  I think it's fair to say, in most 

14 situations, what happens is that the proceeds of the 

sale are handed over to the secured creditor, which is 

16 essentially a clause (iii) treatment of the lien on the 

17 proceeds, in the sense that, if the lien on the proceeds 

18 is a lien on the pile of cash, if you hand over the pile 

19 of cash, you're surrendering the collateral that is 

securing that lien, which is the classic example of 

21 indubitable equivalence. That is one of the examples 

22 cited in the legislative history and in Judge Hand's 

23 opinion in In re Murel.

permeates the Petitioners' brief is that valuation -- that

the value of collateral is something we can all know and 

agree upon. 

But valuation is an inherently difficult 

undertaking. And this Court has recognized that, when 

Congress enacted the code in 1978, it shifted the 

preference to move from judicial valuation towards 

market valuations. 

And, here, Congress, in clause (ii), 

expressed its view that -- that the type of market that 

would value this property would include one of the most 

interested market participants, who is -- which is the 

secured creditor who has an interest in the property. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, valuing 

property is what bankruptcy judges do all the time, 

right? 

MS. HARRINGTON: They -- they definitely do. 

But I think, here, Congress provided that this would be 

a situation where the secured creditor would have a role 

in valuing the property, and even under -- as Justice 

Kagan pointed out, even -- I think it was Justice 

Kagan -- under clause (i), the judge has a role in 

valuing the property because we have to determine the 

present day value of the cash stream that the creditor 

would be owed.

I think one way that's important is that it 

protects -- it prevents debtors from cashing out 

creditors at a low value, at a point where the -- in the 

market where the value of the property is low because 

they retain the lien for the full amount. 

The same thing is true here. If this is a 

particularly low point in the market and the creditor is 

trying to sell the property at auction -- I'm sorry --

the debtor is trying to sell the property at auction, 

the creditor can come in and take the property and 

realize any -- any upside down the road. 

If there are no further questions? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Neff, you have 4 

minutes remaining.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. NEFF: With regard to the market 

valuation, we are doing a market valuation, as this 

Court instructed in the 203 North LaSalle case from 

1999, by having an auction, and, after that auction, 

still having to prove up that we've given the 

indubitable equivalence by showing what occurred at that 

auction. And, if the lenders would like to bring, at 

that point, their appraisals and show that we didn't 

achieve that amount, then we are not going to be able to 

satisfy the indubitable equivalence standard. 

Secondly, with regard to the role that 

subsection (iii) plays in subsection (ii) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What you just said is, so 

long as they come in with some appraisals that are above 

what -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's 

not the indubitable equivalent? 

MR. NEFF: If they can --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because you've got to have 

at least one appraiser who says it's -- it's worth more. 

Is that all it takes? 

MR. NEFF: Right. The -- the question --

it's a very high standard. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Indubitable is indubitable. 

MR. NEFF: It's a very high standard. And

as long as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you have one honest 

appraiser who says --

MR. NEFF: If it is a creditable appraisal 

and we were unable to achieve that, then we will have a 

very difficult time satisfying that standard, but the 

process will have been allowed to play out, which is 

extremely important because those of us who have done 

debtor work know how many times a lender doesn't want to 

do something, and, ultimately, you have a sale or 

otherwise some sort of disposition of assets, the price 

gets high enough, and they are willing to go along with 

it. 

So with regard to the market test --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what happens if you 

go to the judge and the judge says, there is one higher 

bid, so I can't say it's indubitable? Then what 

happens? 

MR. NEFF: Then -- then you would have to 

provide additional consideration to the secured creditor 

to get it to the level that the judge would find it to 

be indubitable. 

So it's no different than at any plan 

confirmation hearing, if you say, judge, my plan is 

dependent upon the interest rate being set at 5 percent.

The judge says, well, I find it should be 6 percent. 

You have to find a way to bridge that gap. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that assumes that you 

can just pull out a wad of cash from your back pocket, 

but, mostly, the debtors are not in that position. So 

it just seems like a gigantic waste of time. 

MR. NEFF: It's -- it's more so that the --

the purchaser would have to come up with that -- would 

have to come up with that or find some other way to 

bridge that gap. 

It's not really a waste of time because, 

again, you are allowing the process to -- to play itself 

out. Too many times, we see, with secured creditors, 

they're unwilling to deal with debtors because they have 

gotten them in the particular situation. And then, when 

you are able to actually have an auction, they are 

surprised by how high the bidding gets because 

bankruptcy auctions are very fulsome events and -- and 

create -- can create quite a lot of bidding that can 

really generate very high -- high value for the 

property. 

As far as the role that (iii) plays in (ii), 

it's a bit convoluted; but, if you pursue a plan sale 

through subsection (ii), you don't have to show 

indubitable equivalence, as long as they are allowed to

credit bid. But if, in fact, they don't credit bid or 

they -- they are topped and you are able to raise cash, 

that cash must be treated in an indubitable equivalence 

way or in accordance with subsection (i). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm a person 

who believes that, in the business world, the greatest 

security is just knowledge of what courts will do. And 

what the two courts who have agreed with you have done 

is contrary to what the majority of courts have done 

for -- for the longest time. 

What's the value for us upsetting the norm? 

MR. NEFF: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the business 

value for upsetting the norm? 

MR. NEFF: With regard to what courts have 

done for a very long time -- for the 30 years that that 

has been referenced have been primarily in section --

with regard to Section 363 sales, as opposed to plan 

sales. What it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That means, because 

people didn't think they could do it in plan sales. So 

why should we upset the expectation? 

MR. NEFF: It's also difficult, in a 

bankruptcy situation, to keep the case alive long enough 

to get to plan confirmation, particularly if it's a -­

if it's a business that's struggling financially because 

the secured creditor has an ability to get relief from 

the automatic stay. So that's why we would have more 

Section 363 sales. 

But, with regard to the benefit, you look at 

a case like Philadelphia -- or a case like the Pacific 

Lumber out of the Fifth Circuit, which allowed an entire 

enterprise to be restructured out of a very positive 

sale of the timberlands that would not have occurred if, 

in fact, the Court had required credit bidding because 

the lender simply would have taken back that one crucial 

asset around which the entire enterprise was 

restructured. 

So I think, from a debtor's perspective, 

that is, obviously, of -- of great --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They could have gone 

under (i) and -- and given the secured lender what he's 

entitled to, which is a future stream of payment. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- please. 

MR. NEFF: They could have gone under (i) 

if, in fact, that -- that the lender would have been 

precluded from making a Section 1111(b) election and 

also precluded from credit bidding because credit 

bidding's not required under subsection (i), and an
