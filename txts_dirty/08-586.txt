 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v. 

Harris Associates.

 Mr. Frederick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 In 1970, Congress amended the Investment 

Company Act to provide a cause of action when an 

investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with 

respect to compensation.

 The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment 

for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty 

that Respondent here no longer defends.

 For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's 

judgment should be reversed. First, under the Court's 

longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty 

requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure 

and good-faith negotiation.

 Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what 

the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other 

transactions for similar services.

And, third, applying that standard here, 

Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for 

providing virtually identical advisory services in 

arm's-length transactions with institutional investors.

 With respect to the first point, the 

standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this 

Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which 

the Court said that a fair result in the 

circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important 

component of a fiduciary duty.

 Congress was aware of that standard when it 

enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company 

Act. The SEC brought the case to the Congress' 

attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that 

Congress intended to incorporate.

 Applying that standard, where Pepper said 

that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person --

the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions, 

applied here, the best way to understand how that 

fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what 

Harris is charging for same or similar services at 

arm's-length to institutional investors.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is Harris a fiduciary in 

the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate 

director? Or does his fiduciary duty differ? Is it

higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a 

trustee?

 I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does 

fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what 

kind of fiduciary you are?

 MR. FREDERICK: The basic concept, 

Justice Kennedy, is the same. There are two components, 

where there must be full disclosure of information and a 

fair result, and that fair result translates in 

different contexts in different ways. Here, because of 

the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect 

to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee 

charged.

 But, as Professor Dumont points out in her 

amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that 

is well known in various circumstances of the law, and 

as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the 

fee.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would the test for 

compensation in this case be the same as any director or 

any officer of a corporation?

 MR. FREDERICK: The difference here, Justice 

Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of 

an arm's-length transaction may be achieved. The 

directors can fire the head of a company. They can call

for changes.

 Here, the investment adviser has appointed 

the members of the board. As this Court said in the 

Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an 

arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to know, is 

the fiduciary duties the same? Is the fiduciary 

standard the same, without getting into how its applied?

 Is the fiduciary standard the same for 

Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate 

officer or a corporate director, always the same?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. The concept is fair 

result through full information and good-faith 

negotiations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And for lawyers?

 MR. FREDERICK: For lawyers --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Lawyers have a fiduciary 

obligation to their clients; right?

 MR. FREDERICK: That is true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So courts should review 

lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair 

result.

 MR. FREDERICK: That is how courts do it 

every day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are 

asked to make fee applications for reasonableness.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this is 

different. I mean, this is part of an expense of a 

fund. They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they 

have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay 

for management advice.

 So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees 

to make sure they are fair?

 MR. FREDERICK: The lawyers' fees in which 

context, Mr. Chief Justice? I'm not sure I understand 

the question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel for the 

fund.

 MR. FREDERICK: Counsel for the fund is --

that is actually not at issue here, but the issue of 

what constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in 

various circumstances.

 The statute prohibits fees that are 

unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund. 

The concept here is that the board cannot fire the 

investment adviser. So in evaluating the fairness of 

the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal 

indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and 

that is the key principle here because this adviser is 

using the same manager to provide the same research 

analytics from the same research group, from the same

meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating 

them to different accounts and charging those to whom it 

owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at 

arm's-length.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was in this 

record, was there not, a submission by the adviser 

comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what 

institutional funds were charged, but explaining the 

differential in terms of the services provided, that 

more services were provided to the fund and less 

services were provided to the institutional investors.

 MR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Ginsburg, that 

is where there is a disputed issue of fact for which 

summary judgment is not appropriate, because the 

plaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services 

provided to the institutional investors were greater, 

even though they were being charged a lower amount of 

money.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would have the 

burden? You said that is an issue that has not been 

decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for 

remand. Who -- would you have the burden if they came 

forward and said, look, this is what our situation is. 

These are the services. Would you have the burden to 

show that in fact they were comparable and the

differences did not warrant the differences in the fee?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would have the 

burden?

 MR. FREDERICK: We have the burden.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's different from 

normal trust law, isn't it?

 MR. FREDERICK: It is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Normally where you are a 

fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was 

reasonable.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So Congress evidently did 

not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.

 MR. FREDERICK: We disagree with that last 

part, Justice Scalia. We agree that Congress did make 

modifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily 

would have been brought at common law for breach of 

fiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing 

the burden of proof on the investor. Where we disagree 

is that when they used the phrase "fiduciary duty" they 

intended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty 

had meant at common law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- if you 

are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair

fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that 

the fund beat the industry average for his category of 

fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years. Does he get 

double the normal compensation of the average fees? 

Does he get triple? 50 percent more? How is the court 

supposed to decide that?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there is an issue of 

fact as to how relevant performance is. They didn't 

give the money back when their performance lagged behind 

the market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case. So the 

question of whether or not a performance metric is 

relevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to 

less --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, surely you 

think it is. When you say they don't give the money 

back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees 

should be the same regardless of whether they outperform 

by 10 percent or not?

 MR. FREDERICK: My point, Mr. Chief Justice, 

is that when they charge the same amount, buying the 

same stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the 

same performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund 

should be charged twice as much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there is 

different parameters, right, in the sense that you're

trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to 

the mutual fund. If you are advising a pension fund, it 

is not the case that they are trying to attract 

pensioners who have other choices.

 MR. FREDERICK: But the investor doesn't 

gain because of the marketing skill of the adviser. 

Simply having a larger asset pool which increases the 

fee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the 

individual benefit of the investor. And the point of 

this statute was to provide protection against investors 

so that when the adviser charged excessive fees that 

excess would be returned to the fund for the pro 

rata benefit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said that Congress 

used "fiduciary" in a special sense. Then -- then, I 

have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing 

for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that 

this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard 

that officers and directors of corporations have. Then 

you say that Congress used it in this special sense. So 

that doesn't quite square.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Kennedy, let 

me just add the extra words of the statute, because what 

Congress said was a fiduciary duty "with respect to 

compensation." And so when I say special sense, I mean

that Congress used additional words to elaborate on the 

circumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be 

examined.

 Here what is happening is that an 

arm's-length transaction for the same services -- the 

same manager is going out and touting his services to 

the institutional investor, but simply charging them 

half as much money for providing the same portfolio of 

management.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do technological 

changes make a difference in terms of disclosures 

required? These days all you have to do is push a 

button and you find out exactly what the management fees 

are. I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and 

it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you 

can make whatever determination you'd like, including to 

take your money out.

 MR. FREDERICK: The fact that an investor 

may know going in what the fee is does not address the 

problem Congress was intending to address, which is that 

as larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the 

mutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits 

of economies of scale. And that's the central point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we could look 

at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't

get those benefits he can go look at another fund. It 

takes 30 seconds.

 MR. FREDERICK: And that again doesn't 

address the problem Congress was trying to get at, which 

is to protect the company, not the individual investor. 

The individual investor might lessen the damages that 

that investor suffers, but the fund, the people 

remaining, continue to pay excessive fees.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but he protects the 

company ultimately, because when investors leave the 

company that is charging excessive fees to go to other 

companies, the company that they are leaving sees that 

something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to 

its adviser. Why doesn't that affect the company at 

issue?

 MR. FREDERICK: A large number of assets 

under management in mutual funds, something like 26 to 

35 percent according to materials that are in the 

record, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is 

essentially locked into the fund that his or her company 

chooses to make that investment. And even as to 

investors who are not locked in, there are significant 

tax consequences where over time an investor might be in 

the Oakmark Fund and have to suffer large tax 

consequences in order to get the benefit of the

statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Companies --

companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s 

all the time. The employees are not happy with the 

return they are getting because the company has limited 

their choices, they change. It happens all the time.

 MR. FREDERICK: And Mr. Chief Justice, as 

the Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this 

is a unique cause of action in which Congress was 

intending to protect the entire corpus of the investors 

in the fund, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You told me just a 

little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't 

interested in protecting investors; they were interested 

in protecting the companies.

 MR. FREDERICK: The company is comprised of 

the investors, Mr. Chief Justice. What the right of 

action does not do is to provide individual damages to 

the investor who brings the suit. The recovery inures 

to the entire benefit of all the investors.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I unpackage 

your argument a little bit. Because using the word 

"fair fee" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to 

be fair in relationship to something. And so what is 

your definition of what that something is that it's fair

to, and -- or unfair against? And start from there, 

because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying: 

Look, a fair fee is paying market value. If one takes a 

sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between 

the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as 

required, that's the market. So that's fair. You're 

saying it's something else. What's that something else?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, what the Court said in 

pepper is that fair is what is reflective of what an 

arm's-length agreement would produce.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So you start 

there.

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So let's 

stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard, 

which is -- that's fair. What would an arm's-length 

transaction produce? And let's go to what seems to be 

part of your argument and sort of what everyone's 

skirting around, which is what's the proof that a 

particular transaction is not arm's-length?

 The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying, 

it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the 

disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can 

decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and 

once they choose to it's a fair price. It's an arm's-

length transaction. You are saying not, and that's 

what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of 

why not? Why is --

MR. FREDERICK: Because the directors can't 

fire and walk away from the advisor. In any arm's-

length transaction, if I sell you a car and you don't 

like the price can you walk away.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- now, that's 

begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a 

reasonable fee. It did say fiduciary duty, but it 

didn't -- there is a subtle but very important 

difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee 

and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.

 MR. FREDERICK: True. There are two 

components: Was there full information and good faith 

negotiating; and was the result fair. In Pepper, the 

Court said if the result is not fair there can be a 

breach of fiduciary duty.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still begging the 

question, fair against what.

 MR. FREDERICK: Fair against what the 

adviser actually charged for same or similar services to 

an outsider who had the right to walk away.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I don't 

understand your statement that they can't fire the

investment adviser. Maybe they can't fire him, but they 

can insist that he accept a lower fee, right? Surely 

they can do that, can't they?

 MR. FREDERICK: They --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can they insist that he 

accept a lower fee? Can they do that.

 MR. FREDERICK: In practical terms, no.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

 MR. FREDERICK: Because the adviser picks 

the board of directors.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, no, that's something 

different. Let's assume you have a disinterested board 

of directors, which is what the statute requires. You 

tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't 

fire the adviser. It seems to me, while they can't fire 

him, they can say: We are going to cut your fee in 

half. Whereupon they don't have to fire him. He will 

pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser. 

Doesn't that work?

 MR. FREDERICK: There is actually no 

evidence in any record I am aware of where that has 

actually happened. The directors have no leverage. And 

that's the problem the Court -- this Court recognized in 

the Daily Income Fund case.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The fiduciary duty imposed by section 36(b) 

prohibits an investment adviser's fee from being outside 

the range that arm's-length bargaining would produce. 

The courts below erred by failing to consider evidence 

about what the investment adviser in this case charges 

its unaffiliated clients when it provides services that 

Petitioners claim are, in fact, comparable to the 

services at issue here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think Congress used 

the term "fiduciary" in a very special sense here? I 

will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case. 

If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable 

and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I 

thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty. But 

apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower 

duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee. I

just find that quite a puzzling use of the word 

"fiduciary."

 Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or 

in some special sense, fine.

 MR. GANNON: Well, we do think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me an odd 

use of the term "fiduciary." I don't know why Congress 

didn't use some other word.

 MR. GANNON: Well, we do think that the term 

"fiduciary duty" is here used to counterbalance the lack 

of arm's-length bargaining that exists between the board 

of directors and the investment adviser, and we do think 

that it drew upon the established term of art in 

Pepper v. Litton, the case that counsel for Petitioners 

was already referring to. That's a case that actually 

involved corporate directors and there the same test, 

the same ultimate standard, was stated, which is whether 

the bargain carries the earmarks of an arm's length 

bargain and whether it's inherently fair.

 And so we do think that in the development 

of the legislation in 1969, the memorandum that the SEC 

submitted to Congress in 1969 explained that the shift 

from reasonableness to fiduciary duty largely achieved 

some procedural objectives of shifting the focus from 

the board of directors to the investment adviser, and

the text of the statute specifically makes it a 

fiduciary duty with respect to receipt of compensation.

 We think one salutary affect of that was to 

-- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the 

Court's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the 

single most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to 

the Pepper v. Litton test, whether the bargain fell 

within the range of what arm's length bargaining 

otherwise would have achieved.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we are 

going to have regulation of what fees can be charged, 

you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC 

has issued. It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC 

regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?

 MR. GANNON: Well, in the abstract, it might 

make more sense, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the choice 

that Congress made here was to counterbalance the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are not 

suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that, 

are you?

 MR. GANNON: Well, even under this statute, 

the SEC has the authority to file suits under section 

36(b).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it filed any?

 MR. GANNON: It hasn't filed any since --

since 1980, Justice Ginsburg. I think that the SEC in 

this context -- it has -- it has primarily directed its 

resources and energies into encouraging there to be 

better disclosure of fees, both the disclosure of 

information to the board, disclosure to investors, 

better education to shareholders so that they would be 

able to go --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it must be aware of 

the -- of the divergence between the fees that 

investment advisers charge to these companies and what 

they charge to other clients. Isn't the SEC aware of 

that?

 MR. GANNON: It is aware of that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet has brought no 

suits against this industry?

 MR. GANNON: Since 1980 it hasn't used 

section 36(b). It has used less formal mechanisms in 

the context of examinations and investigators -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA: For disclosure, just for 

disclosure. But that suggests to me that the SEC may 

think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and 

that the comparison with investment advice given to 

other entities is -- is not a fair one.

 MR. GANNON: Well, when the SEC helped draft 

the statute in the 1960s, it recognized that there was

this systematic disparity between the amounts that 

mutual funds were being charged by investment advisers 

and the amounts that investment advisers were charging 

their unaffiliated clients, and in the 1969 memorandum 

that I referred to, which is reprinted in an appendix to 

the amicus brief by John Bogel in its entirety, the SEC 

mentioned that comparison as being something that may 

well be relevant in proving in an individual case that 

that particular investment adviser's fees are excessive.

 And we think that the test here of whether 

under all the circumstances, which is what section 

36(b)(2) points the Court towards, of having to weigh --

having to weigh the board's approval of fees in light of 

all the circumstances, that those circumstances include 

things like the evidence that petitioners have presented 

here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, the -- all 

the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's 

Gartenberg case?

 MR. GANNON: Well, it also comes, 

Justice Ginsburg, from the text of section 36(b)(2).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in -- in that case, 

at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you 

don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what 

institutional investors are paid.

MR. GANNON: The footnote that you are 

talking about did point out that in that case the 

comparison that the plaintiffs were attempting to draw 

between the money market fund at issue and a pension 

fund wasn't a particularly relevant one, because the 

services at issue were so different. And here the 

parties appear to dispute how different the services 

are. And at the summary judgment stage, the Respondent 

stated that it disputed how comparable the relevant 

services were.

 The district court and the court of appeals 

considered that dispute immaterial because, instead of 

comparing, instead of determining whether this 

investment adviser is selling the same services at half 

the price to its unaffiliated clients who actually can 

engage in arm's length bargaining, those courts simply 

said that if it -- if it falls within the range that is 

charged by other mutual funds, that would be acceptable. 

And we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the statute 

does not say, in considering the rates you look at all 

the circumstances. Am I right? It says, in considering 

whether to defer to the board, you look at all the 

circumstances.

give the board --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The board.

 MR. GANNON: -- such consideration as is 

deemed appropriate under all the circumstances. That's 

correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But isn't 

that different than saying, in looking at what the rates 

should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all 

the circumstances? It may well be that you don't defer 

to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all 

in deciding what you do look at.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that it 

demonstrates that the Court is obligated to look to all 

the circumstances simply to determine whether the 

board's approval -- how much weight it should be given.

 And as this Court explained in Daily Income 

Fund, the entire point of section 36(b) is to provide an 

independent check, the -- independent of the fact that 

the directors approved the fees. We think that an 

appropriately informed board that asks the right 

questions, that gets the right information and fully 

considers the sort of factors that are discussed --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if they agree to 

pay double the price?

 MR. GANNON: We think that -- that the right

process followed by the board would be probative, but 

something like double the price may -- may demonstrate 

that that is an unfair bargain.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's what --

are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of 

action or breach of duty when there isn't full 

disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length --

normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but 

assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction 

range in the market?

 MR. GANNON: If there was a lack of full 

disclosure, that might in the abstract be a breach of 

fiduciary duty even under the Seventh Circuit's test. 

We think that if it didn't actually have an effect on 

the fees, then it wouldn't be actionable here because 

there would be no actual damages flowing from the lack 

of disclosure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if there is full 

disclosure, your position is in every case a court must 

decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.

 MR. GANNON: A court would need to decide 

whether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that 

it falls outside the range of fees that arm's-length 

bargaining would have arrived at, and that's a cause of 

action that would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how much deviance, 

and what is the scope of the range?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the term of 

art of "fiduciary duty" doesn't necessarily demonstrate 

how much deviance away from the range there would be. I 

think that depending upon the segment of the market the 

range might be more or less narrow.

 In segments of the market where services are 

more commodified and standardized, perhaps with index 

funds, there might be a much narrower range of fees that 

are arrived at through arm's-length bargaining, and even 

-- and smaller disparities might be inappropriate there.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How is the -- how is the 

standard you've just described different from a standard 

of reasonableness?

 MR. GANNON: It -- I think that the chief 

way it differs from reasonableness, Justice Kennedy, is 

in saying that the Court doesn't actually have to decide 

what the single most reasonable fee is. But as the SEC 

explained in 1969, the shift from reasonableness to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I would be very 

surprised if "reasonableness" always meant one -- one 

figure. It could mean a range.

fairness inquiry that this Court referred to in Pepper 

v. Litton as being part of the fiduciary duty status as 

to whether the transaction --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question 

going back to Justice Kennedy's early question? Do you 

think the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case 

is different from the fiduciary status of a president of 

a corporation?

 MR. GANNON: I -- I -- I think that it is 

different from the status of a president of a 

corporation; that -- that the term of art, "fiduciary" 

which Congress was invoking here can mean different 

things in different circumstances.

 Pepper was a case that involved corporate 

directors. The chief difference here and what Congress 

was intending to counteract was the inherent structural 

impediment to arm's-length bargaining between the 

investment adviser and the board of directors. And 

that's what makes that high burden that was used in 

Pepper v. Litton for controlling shareholders the 

relevant analogy, we believe.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The point that Mr. Gannon just made and that 

Mr. Frederick made before, that there was some 

structural impediment to negotiations between a mutual 

fund board and adviser, is at the heart of this dispute, 

because that is a judgment that Congress made. The 

Investment Company Act in the first instance delegates 

responsibility to the board of directors to approve 

fees. A fee may not be approved that does not have the 

consent of a majority of the independent trustees in the 

first instance.

 The independent check on fees that is 

erected by section 36(b) --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume -- let's 

assume that all of the independent board of director 

members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is 

negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who 

does the evaluation, looks at them and says: I think 

this is really a great deal, guys. And they just fell 

for it. Is that a process that would guarantee an 

arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress 

intended in this act?

 MR. DONOVAN: It may not and it may give

rise to a cause of action. But as I started --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which cause of action --

MR. DONOVAN: A cause of action --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- under what?

 MR. DONOVAN: It may give a cause of action 

under section 36(b) if the circumstances you described, 

Justice Sotomayor are -- have an impact upon the fee. 

And the reason --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, then their process 

is part of your definition of "fiduciary duty"? A court 

has to look at the nature of process?

 MR. DONOVAN: If there is an impact upon fee 

that is outside of the range of what could have been 

bargained. The reason for that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now -- now you are 

adding what has been added, which is outside of the 

range, correct?

 MR. DONOVAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.

 MR. DONOVAN: If I understand your question 

correctly, will a process flaw alone justify a 

section 36(b) cause of action? My answer is no. Will a 

process flaw that affects a fee justify a 36(b) action? 

Yes, it will.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But what you

are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is 

fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm's-

length transaction, there is no cause of action?

 MR. DONOVAN: No, I -- I -- I doubt that as 

well. There are two separate causes of action, I can 

imagine, under 36(b): One, a process flaw that has a 

fee impact; and second, a fee that is so far outside of 

the bounds of what could have been bargained that it 

justifies independent review.

 The question under 36(b) is whether, having 

delegated responsibility in the first instance to a 

board, there is a reason to second-guess their judgment. 

And the independent check that Mr. Gannon referred to at 

section 36(b) or (a) should not be a de novo judicial 

review of the size of the fee for a couple of reasons, 

the first of which is section 36(b)(2). That statute 

instructs courts to give such consideration as they 

consider due to the deliberations of the board. What 

did they see? What did they get? Did they negotiate?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a wonderfully clear 

command, isn't it? Such consideration as is 

appropriate? What is the language? Read it. What is 

it?

 MR. DONOVAN: The language is "such 

consideration that the court considers due under the

circumstances."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DONOVAN: But there would be no reason 

for that instruction at all, Your Honor, if a court were 

to make its own judgments about what is fair and 

reasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it's meaningless. It 

tells the court to make its own judgment. Such 

consideration as the court deems due. Give it 

whatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like. 

It's utterly meaningless to me.

 MR. DONOVAN: What I think Congress was 

doing was considering what the source of the common law 

had been before. The corporate context, 

Justice Kennedy, I think was what inspired. At 

corporate law, a decision would not be second-guessed by 

a court unless there was a reason to do so, unless the 

judgment of directors and the presumption of regularity 

that attached to their decisions could for some reason 

be second-guessed. Was there a process flaw? Was it so 

far out of bounds?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is "so 

far out of bounds"? In other words, you are saying, you 

can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said,

too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent

 MR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Double, as they say 

is the case here?

 MR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Double, as they say 

is the case here?

 MR. DONOVAN: As the plaintiffs say is the 

case here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. DONOVAN: I suggest there is no 

numerical basis, because in fact every kind of mutual 

fund and ever stripe of mutual fund is different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then you say: 

Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell 

me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the 

bounds.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, I think -- the first 

comparative would be other funds of a similar stripe. 

So, for example, you could imagine that a mutual fund 

with the same investment objective and style that is two 

times might be inappropriate. You could also imagine a 

different circumstance where, passively managed funds 

for example, a multiple of fees would be inappropriate.

You could also, though, imagine a case where 

there is substantial risk taken, where the types of 

securities that are invested in are unusual, where 

substantial differences could be justified.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test that the 

court of appeals here applied?

 MR. DONOVAN: Pardon?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test that the 

court of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want 

us to affirm?

 MR. DONOVAN: The court of appeals did not 

apply the test. Judge Easterbrook --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So we should remand it for 

application of the test that you propose?

 MR. DONOVAN: I don't think you have to. 

And the reason is because of what the district court 

did. And there I get to, Justice Ginsburg, what you 

said. The -- the argument is made that services are the 

same. In fact, that is not the record. And if you look 

at page 161 of the Joint Appendix and following, there 

is a list of services that the trust -- the investment 

adviser gave to the trustees in this case, about all of 

the services that they did for their fee in the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely that's a disputed 

fact, isn't it? And you want us to dispose -- or you

want this to be disposed of on summary judgment. The 

other side says the services aren't that much different.

 MR. DONOVAN: They are very different. Page 

161 and following will tell you how. And the district 

court at page 360 -- 16a, excuse me, of the district 

court's opinion, notices that the services were 

different. So, under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't talking about 

this particular case. It was talking about in general, 

wasn't --

MR. DONOVAN: No, he was talking about this 

case, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that they claim 

that you were receiving additional payment for the 

services, or some or at least a substantial number of 

the services, that you claim are attributed by the 

difference. So they're saying if you compare apples to 

apples, you are charging twice the amount. If you 

compare apples to oranges, there are differences because 

the oranges were different, but you were getting paid 

for those oranges separately. I think that was their 

argument.

 MR. DONOVAN: That is their argument and 

it's not accurate, Your Honor.

of disputed fact. So let's go back. Are you disavowing 

the Seventh Circuit's approach? Because I read your 

brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending 

their market approach that says so long as the process 

was fair, any fee is okay. That's how I thought they 

had reached their conclusion.

 MR. DONOVAN: I think what Judge Easterbrook 

said, and we don't agree, is if there is deceit of 

directors that would justify a cause of action under 

36(b). But in the absence of, in his words, "pulling 

the wool over the eyes of the trustees" --

-- I am using his words in terms of case --

MR. DONOVAN: I do --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're disavowing 

that?

 MR. DONOVAN: I do not defend that, because 

I can imagine, as your hypothetical asked earlier, 

directors or trustees who -- are not paying attention --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your positions is no 

different than the solicitor general's, that there has 

to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a 

fair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being 

outside the range an arm's length transaction?

right when she describes Gartenberg as the standard. Is 

this a result that could have been fairly bargained at 

arm's length. Where we part company is with respect to 

two things: One is, she says and Mr. Gannon said today, 

that the most important consideration is a comparison to 

other kinds of fees, and that is required in the 

calculus in the district court. In fact, that would 

make mandatory what the SEC rules only make 

discretionary.

 Chief Justice, you asked earlier about the 

SEC's rules in this area. And in fact, they compel 

disclosure of fees charged by advisers to their funds 

and their conflicts of similar investment objectives. 

They do not require disclosure of accounts within an 

advisor's business operations that are institutional 

accounts. Now to be sure --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That are what?

 MR. DONOVAN: That are -- advisers --

institutional accounts adviser services. If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the fund 

adviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did 

disclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the 

difference between what were charged mutual funds, what 

were charged institutional investors, and then explained 

that the services were different and that justified the

difference. But they weren't trying to think, no, we 

don't have to come forward with this information.

 MR. DONOVAN: That's precisely correct, Your 

Honor. In this case the trustees did have the 

information. The adviser did disclose it, but the SEC 

does not require them to ask that question. All it 

requires them to do is if they do ask the question, if 

they do study the material, they must disclose the 

weight they put on to it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you were appointed 

to a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful. 

I'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as 

I am satisfied with your results.

 Now, would you, for example, not have in 

your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other 

people that don't have someone like me setting his pay? 

Wouldn't that be in your mind?

 MR. DONOVAN: It could be, sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, so wouldn't that be a 

normal question to ask?

 MR. DONOVAN: And the trustees did ask it 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know if they 

asked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the 

district court opinion, I think we are reversing -- we

are reviewing -- sorry. We're reviewing.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I have laryngitis; I don't 

speak accurately.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think we are reviewing a 

-- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard, 

and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't 

say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask 

him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn, 

but we would like to know what he charges when he asks 

for money from people who do not have this kind of 

supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different 

to ask him why.

 MR. DONOVAN: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so what's the problem 

then with saying that in the opinion?

 MR. DONOVAN: There is no problem with 

saying that if it is a relevant consideration.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's pretty unusual 

that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the 

case in front of us a case where it would be relevant. 

You may have an answer to the question. There may be a 

perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.

 MR. DONOVAN: The difference, Your Honor, is

that the Solicitor General and the plaintiffs would make 

the question and the answer dispositive in every case. 

I would acknowledge as --

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer dispositive? 

Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the 

answers would be quite different.

 MR. DONOVAN: Precisely.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- but you 

no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an 

issue. There might -- I mean, maybe there is some. 

That's the only issue, whether this should be 

dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to 

take into account where relevant?

 MR. DONOVAN: It is a factor that I consider 

that is likely to be relevant --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you have no objection to 

send it back and say look, of course this is relevant, 

perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?

 MR. DONOVAN: My objection -- my objection 

to sending it back is only that that analysis was done.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did -- but in the 

Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have 

to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then 

there might be cases where it's so out of line. And he 

said the comparison would be to other mutual funds. He

excluded the comparison with institutional investors. 

So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying 

this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds 

pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?

 MR. DONOVAN: I think the Seventh Circuit 

made that comparison. Judge Easterbrook did say that 

the services of institutional accounts ordinarily are 

different from mutual fund accounts. I agree that in 

the first instance, the first comparator usually should 

be mutual funds, and regrettably Judge Easterbrook did 

not cite to the record for the reasons to identify those 

differences. But it is in fact in the record, and there 

is no other record that suggests that they were the 

same. All we had below was the assertion that on the 

one hand, an advisory contract for an institutional 

account said advisory services. And in the other we had 

a mutual fund advisory contract that said advisory 

services.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you 

should look at the range and how far it's off, do you 

mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if 

it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least 

look further at whether there was a fair process? Or do 

you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the 

rates you just look how far it is off.

MR. DONOVAN: I look at it in the Gartenberg 

sense, Your Honor. And the reason is because as I --

from what I said the first question is, is when do you 

ask courts to substitute their judgment?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's probably --

you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you 

understand the Solicitor General's position to be your 

understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?

 MR. DONOVAN: I believe they interpret in 

the Gartenberg sense. I think that the Solicitor 

General's position and the Respondent's, with respect to 

the standard that you ought to apply, is Gartenberg.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do about 

Gartenberg? That is to say, the key sentence you can 

read either way. The key sentence could mean -- it just 

depends on tone of voice. You must charge a fee that is 

not so disproportionately large that it bears no 

reasonable relationship to the services rendered and 

could not -- could not have been the product of 

arms-length bargaining. Or you could say, look, it's 

unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where 

there is no reasonable relationship. And if there is no 

reasonable relationship, how could it have been the 

product of arm's-length bargaining?

upside down. I think they turned it upside down --

JUSTICE BREYER: You object if we turn them 

upside down?

 MR. DONOVAN: I think they turned them 

upside down for a reason, and the reason is 36(b)(1), 

which imposes the burden of proof upon --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying the tone, 

be a little careful here.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So we can say the substance 

is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to 

look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable 

it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if 

it's not reasonable, how could it be? Got to get an 

answer to that, okay? So, that way you see the tone is 

be careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter. 

How's that?

 MR. DONOVAN: I would accept the proposition 

that it is reasonable if it is outside of what could 

have been bargained at arm's length. I think they 

turned it upside down the fact for the reason that the 

statute reverses the burden of proof and I think that 

they also acknowledge that it is a process-oriented 

thing for judges to do, because after all you are asking 

here a standard for judges to apply in a contested

situation that recognizes the responsibility of the 

board in the first instance. That's what 36(b)(2) is 

all about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you give us 

the citations of the parts of the record that you say 

render it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower 

court to consider a comparison with non- -- with 

institutional charges?

 MR. DONOVAN: Yes, Your Honor. I start at 

page 16a and 17a of the district court's opinion where 

at page 16a at the bottom the district court said the 

services supplied are different. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: At 16a of the Joint 

Appendix you are talking about?

 MR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, the 

petition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the petition.

 MR. DONOVAN: Correct, it's 16a of the 

petition, which is Judge Kocoras' opinion. At the 

bottom of the page you will see that he said, the 

services Harris provided to institutional clients varied 

but in all events were more limited than those provided 

the funds.

 If you then go on to page 17, he goes 

through with respect to each of these three funds and

chronicles the fees they paid and by comparison the fees 

charged to institutional accounts with similar 

investment objectives. The statement by the plaintiff, 

Petitioners here, that the fee charged was a 2X 

multiple, does not refer to that array of institutional 

accounts. It takes one in order to make the comparison 

what it is.

 And then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to 

page 32a of the district court's opinion where he 

describes what appear to be disputed issues of fact. 

And what he said those dispute issues of fact were about 

were what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the 

negotiation process, in substance, what they would have 

done had they been negotiating, rather than the 

trustees. It is not a dispute about the ultimate test, 

was this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been 

reasonable.

 To be sure, throughout a record that is as 

large as this one, you could imagine the parties 

disputed lots of things. What you could not fairly 

dispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using 

comparable funds and using institutional accounts, as 

Judge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could 

not have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test, 

there is no need for remand.

If, as I suggest and as the Solicitor 

General suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate 

standard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.

 This Court has to be sure, on occasion, and 

it is rare, both announce the test and apply it in the 

same circumstances.

 In circumstances where courts are looking 

for guidance on what the standard is and how to apply 

it, I suggest this is a case in which affirming what the 

district court did would be appropriate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

petitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did 

not provide full and accurate information? And they 

mention particularly concerning economies of scale, 

profitability, and several other matters, that what 

everybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not 

occurred.

 Is that a disputed issue of fact or of 

further inquiry?

 MR. DONOVAN: I don't think it is, Your 

Honor. And, again, I would go back to what Judge 

Kocoras said on 32(a).

 There was absolutely suggestions in the 

record by the plaintiff that they would have negotiated 

differently, but, for example, with respect to

ostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things, 

profitability and the rest, this was because the 

plaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for 

costs differently and said, had you accounted for costs 

and allocated them the way I did, you would have reached 

a negotiated result that was different.

 Well, that just isn't what happened. That's 

why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of 

the negotiation. Would the negotiation have been 

different?

 The plaintiffs say, I would have done it 

differently, but that's all they said, and it's not a 

misrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for 

costs differently.

 Finally, I would -- the other question you 

asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm 

sorry. It's at page 161 and following, where the 

background of all the difference in fees and the 

difference in services is chronicled.

 You can tell, from the pull-out charts at 

page 171, what fee is charged for each of these mutual 

funds and what fee is charged for institutional 

accounts.

 If you take the plaintiffs' point of view 

and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is

always required and may be dispositive and is always a 

fraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are 

the, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is 

fair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as 

opposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual 

funds to a trial.

 On this record, these were funds that had 

best in class performance for fees that were at or below 

industry averages.

 That is not a record upon which a reasonable 

person could conclude that the adviser has over-reached. 

That is at the heart of fiduciary duty. I see my time 

is about to expire.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK: At this recording here did 

not make findings -- this was a summary judgment case, 

and in fact, the Court didn't find that the disputes 

were nonexistent.

 In fact, on page 30a, the district court 

said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a

very important distinction because the joint appendix 

that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in 

which it is disputed whether or not these were similar 

services.

 The Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the 

portfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar. On 

512, the Harris fund manager testimony that, when he 

buys a stock, he buys it for all mutual funds and 

independent accounts, with the same investment 

objective.

 On 505 to 506, the Harris research director 

testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and 

independent accounts share equally all work done by the 

research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris 

fund manager says all of our analysts do research for 

all of our clients.

 There is disputed evidence here as to what 

constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are 

comparing apples to apples because the record indicates 

that there are separate contracts for the additional 

fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the 

additional services provided.

 We're simply talking about comparisons of 

money management, but --

correct, that these funds have better than average 

performance and lower than average fees?

 MR. FREDERICK: In one small aspect of the 

damages period, that is correct, and after that was 

found, they had lower than average performance and 

higher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice. It's a 

damages period that encompasses several years.

 If I could go back to the point, though, 

about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he 

was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary 

represents the punctilio of honor, and that is 

contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating 

at arm's-length.

 It surely cannot be the case that, where you 

are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher 

standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge 

twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length 

for services that you are providing.

 The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in 

fact, had the opposite language that you are averting 

to, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court 

said, "The test is essentially whether the fee schedule 

represents a charge within the range of what would have 

been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the 

surrounding circumstances."

that, picking out what the essence was, you would get 

pretty close to what you are arguing for, without 

getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a 

trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or --

you know, there are a lot of questions here that could 

float around, of any language we use.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's right. The Second 

Circuit that went on to flip it and say, we had to prove 

a negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has 

to prove in any law case, by showing it -- it is so 

disproportionate it could not have been achieved at 

arm's-length, and that is where we think the court --

courts have gotten this wrong.
