CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 08-240, Mac's Shell 

Service v. Shell Oil Products, and the consolidated case. 

Mr. Lamken. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN 

ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS 

COMPANY, LLC, ET AL. 

MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Congress enacted the PMPA to regulate two 

specific, but important, actions: Franchisors' 

termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of 

the franchise term and the franchisors’ non-renewal of 

the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's 

term. 

The statute responded to complaints about 

franchisors exercising broad contractual rights to 

terminate the franchise relationship that was not 

addressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that 

was not previously addressed by State law. But Congress 

left all other aspects of the franchise relationship to 

State law. 

Because the term "terminate," at the very

least, requires an end, we and the United States agree 

that the First Circuit erred in upholding a so-called 

constructive termination, where the dealers continued to 

receive each element of the statutory franchise -- that 

is the premises, the trademark, and fuel --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that 

you don't really object to the recognition of 

“constructive termination,” if that phrase is used the 

way it is used elsewhere in contract law? 

MR. LAMKEN: We don't believe that in contract 

law constructive termination exists or in the analogous 

State franchise statutes that existed at the time that 

the Congress enacted the PMPA. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I thought -- I thought 

that if you had a lease and the landlord fails to 

provide heat, that you can move out and he will be 

deemed to have constructively evicted you. 

MR. LAMKEN: That's right. The term 

"constructive eviction" we would -- we believe does 

exist, along with "constructive discharge." But the 

precise terms that Congress used here were "terminate," 

"non-renew," and "cancel," which are drawn from the law 

of contracts and the U.C.C., in particular, and from 

State franchise statutes. We --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- on that point,

the government differs with you. The government says, 

as Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing 

as constructive termination, and you must terminate. 

MR. LAMKEN: Yes. It's not so much that we 

differ; it's that our fallback position is the same as 

the government's, but they do not endorse our primary 

position, which is that there is no such thing as 

constructive termination. 

We believe it would be a mistake to recognize 

constructive termination in this context for three 

reasons: The first is the one I already mentioned, is 

that, in the most analogous context that existed at the 

time Congress acted, State franchise statutes that used 

terms like "terminate," "non-renew," "cancel," the terms 

that Congress used, there was -- the notion of 

constructive termination was frankly unheard of. 

Even today, under those statutes it is not a 

well-accepted concept, having been rejected by 

approximately half the States to have considered it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but all -- under 

one view, all the dealer is doing is mitigating damages. 

In other words, the deal is off. He's in effect been 

terminated. You're saying, well then, he has to pack up 

and leave. He can stay and still reduce the damages you 

are going to have to pay.

MR. LAMKEN: On the contrary, Your Honor. 

It's not so much -- there isn't a mitigation of damages, 

any more than an employee claiming constructive 

discharge, for example, would be mitigating damages by 

staying in her job. The settled rule, even when 

constructive claims are recognized, is that an employee 

claiming --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there --

MR. LAMKEN: -- constructive discharge must 

move out, must quit the job, and the tenant claiming 

constructive eviction must leave the job. That is the 

nature, even where constructive discharge and 

constructive termination -- constructive eviction 

claims, are recognized. That is the settled rule. 

If you have something else, for example, 

there’s a breach of contract, you can claim your breach 

of contract, and you can sue for damages while 

continuing to operate. But if you're going to claim 

that it wasn't a mere breach of contract, but in fact it 

was a constructive termination, that you've lost all the 

rights to continue to operate -- you may not get fuel, 

you may not get --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've lost the 

rights to operate at a particular level. In other 

words, if they say -- I don't know how the deal works,

but, you know, you've got to charge $10 a gallon or, you 

know, you've got to close the convenient mart or 

whatever, you have lost the right to operate at that. 

The terms of the lease under which you were operating 

have been effectively terminated. That doesn't mean you 

can't still make money, and it doesn't mean you have to 

give that up, but --

MR. LAMKEN: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but the deal has 

been terminated. 

MR. LAMKEN: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you 

have confused breach with termination. The failure to 

give the rights on the terms provided in the lease or 

the agreement would be a breach of contract. But 

termination in contract law has long been understood to 

be something entirely different, which is the absolute 

refusal to provide the elements such that it's obvious 

to any observer that there is -- these elements will not 

be resumed. 

Corbin on Contracts, for example, describes 

termination as occurring "when either party, pursuant to 

a power created by agreement or law, puts an end to the 

contract,” “extinguishing future obligations of both 

parties to the agreement."

about it? Contract --

MR. LAMKEN: Pardon. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does Williston 

say about it? 

MR. LAMKEN: Williston didn't actually address 

that. Corbin addresses it because he talks about the 

U.C.C., and the U.C.C. in turn says: "On termination, 

all obligations" --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is leaving the 

premises the sine quo non of a termination? 

MR. LAMKEN: It's the sine qua non of any 

termination under this statute, we would believe, if you 

recognize constructive termination. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But aren't there -- aren't 

there some operators that own their own premises? 

MR. LAMKEN: That's right. That's why it 

would have to be a determination of one of the three 

franchise elements. The way the statute's written, each 

of the different --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So only one of the three 

would suffice in your view? 

MR. LAMKEN: That's right. Each of these 

separate elements is treated as a franchise, and you can 

have the termination of any one of the three, and that 

is a termination of the franchise --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just --

MR. LAMKEN: -- defined within the agreement. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just testing your view, 

suppose there are two franchisees, and in each case the 

oil company reduces the amount they're paying for the 

gas. One franchisee can't afford it, leaves, quits --

termination. The other franchisee has a considerable 

amount of savings, and he protests, but he stays in 

business. Different result? 

MR. LAMKEN: Well, in our view the result 

would be the same in both. Neither of those would be a 

termination, because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. In my first, he 

ceases to operate and he moves out of the premises. 

MR. LAMKEN: Right. In our view it has to be 

the franchisor that terminates, not the franchisee. But 

if one accepts the construct of the constructive 

termination, those would be different results, because, 

at the very least, termination requires an end to one of 

the franchise elements. And the individual who sues, 

having not -- having -- still receiving all the 

franchise elements, hasn't been terminated in any sense 

of the word. 

But the key thing is he actually has a breach 

of contract action. Raising the price unreasonably on

an open price term has long, uniformly, comprehensively 

been addressed by State law, like U.C.C. 2-305. 

So the answer always is you can sue for 

breach of contract. And Congress wasn't worried about 

the fact there might be breaches of contract that 

ordinary contract remedies don't sufficiently remedy. 

Congress's concern was the exercise of contractually 

broad rights to terminate and non-renew the 

relationship. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the government comes up 

here, as I think they will in a few minutes, and tells 

us that there is such a thing as constructive 

termination, do you know what hypothetical they give us 

to illustrate how that would work? I mean, it's their 

argument, but I'm curious. I will be curious to know 

how you would respond to that. 

MR. LAMKEN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, there is a 

small universe of cases in which there is a constructive 

termination without leaving the premises, without 

severing the fuel, et cetera. 

MR. LAMKEN: I don’t --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't know what 

they're going to -- how you would respond to that? 

MR. LAMKEN: Yes. I think the government

doesn't think that constructive termination extends to 

cases where you continue to receive all three franchise 

elements. They would believe that constructive 

termination requires at least one of those three 

elements to end, just as it does --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your position is that the 

franchisor has to be the one to terminate? 

MR. LAMKEN: That's our position, yes. The 

franchisor has to be the one that exercises the 

termination. The notion of constructive termination, 

where the franchisee effectively abandons the premises 

in response to conditions it thought intolerable, that 

that is a constructive termination, and it was not a 

concept that existed under the most analogous statutes 

under the contract law from which the terms 

"termination," “non-renewal” --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that the franchisor can 

do outrageous things -- triple the rent, double the 

price of the fuel -- and you would say, even so, there’s 

-- that doesn't count as a termination because the 

franchisor hasn't terminated? 

MR. LAMKEN: That's right, and precisely 

because all those things were comprehensively and 

uniformly addressed by contract law, uniform contract 

law. The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you'd just have a 

magic words test. 

MR. LAMKEN: No, it does not reduce -- I mean, 

because we -- we agree that there can be a termination 

by deed as well as by words. For example, the outright 

refusal to provide the fuel, provide fuel at all, would 

be a termination. You don't have to say we are hereby 

rescinding all of your rights under the contract. At 

some point, it becomes obvious, clear to any observer. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what happens after 

that? Don't you take the position that the station 

owner then has to refuse all other elements of the 

contract, right? 

MR. LAMKEN: If -- no, our position would be 

that where the station owner abandons in response, that 

would not be an actual termination. The government 

would take the view that that’s a constructive 

termination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait, wait --

MR. LAMKEN: And the problem this gets you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said there is a 

termination by the company if it fails to provide one of 

the three basic elements, right? 

MR. LAMKEN: Yes, that is correct, Justice 

Scalia.

MR. LAMKEN: Well, there has been a 

termination of the franchise, which is defined as having 

three -- effectively three separate franchise 

agreements. Each of the different elements is treated 

like it's a different contract or a different agreement. 

So if you terminate one, there has been a termination of 

the franchise, because the franchise is defined to 

encompass all three elements. You’ve got to get --

separate contracts, and in this case there are actually 

two contracts as opposed to three. And, yes, the way 

the statute's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And they are not contingent 

on each other, so that at any time the company could 

terminate one of them and stick the station owner with 

the other two? 

MR. LAMKEN: Well, one could imagine a 

situation where the trademark is withdrawn, but you can 

continue to be a lessee of the premises and market the 

fuel as an unbranded --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not continues to be. You 

must continue to be. 

MR. LAMKEN: Yes. But the contract could be 

written that way, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That sounds like a very 

strange way to write the contract.

statute was to define the franchise --

MR. LAMKEN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really think that 

that's how those contracts should be interpreted? 

MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, sometimes they are, 

for very good reasons, written as independent contracts 

and sometimes they will be dependent contracts, 

depending on the nature of the relationship between the 

parties. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is -- what is the 

difference between your understanding of an implicit 

termination, which is what I take it you have just been 

describing, and a constructive termination? 

MR. LAMKEN: I think an implicit termination 

is one that’s objectively viewed as ending the nature of 

the relationship of the parties. The contract's over. 

You no longer have the right. Fuel will not be coming. 

You may not use our trademark, or you may no longer use 

our premises. 

A constructive termination, as I understand 

the concept, could be something -- and this is the 

difficulty with the concept -- something like charging 

too much, an excessive price, which is a breach of 

contract, which would prevent a reasonable franchisee

from continuing to accept that element. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So if the franchisor 

completely refuses to supply gas, that's an implicit 

termination? 

MR. LAMKEN: That's as good as --

JUSTICE ALITO: But if he charges $1,000 a 

gallon, that's not a termination? 

MR. LAMKEN: Right. That's correct. And the 

difficulty is -- that would be a breach of contract 

remediable under State law. And the difficulty is, the 

moment you move this into the issue of price, suddenly 

the issue of price -- how much the franchisor can charge 

is a question of Federal law, in a statute that just 

talks about termination and non-renewal. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you put 

forth this dichotomy between breach of contract and 

constructive termination. I don't know why something 

can't be both. 

MR. LAMKEN: Oh, in fact, in order to be 

constructive termination, something would have to be a 

breach of contract. I think the government would 

concede that. It has to be wrongful. For example, 

insisting on your ordinary contractual rights cannot be 

a constructive termination. It must also be a breach of 

contract, which is precisely why it doesn't add very

much to -- it’s unlikely that Congress intended to 

incorporate it, because those things that already 

breached the contract were already addressed by State 

law. There was no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And could you, Mr. Lamken, 

straighten out what happened in the district court? 

Because I take it there was an award for breach of 

contract as well as one for termination and they were in 

an identical amount. So what happened to the breach of 

contract? 

MR. LAMKEN: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The award? 

MR. LAMKEN: The actual damages here -- the 

amounts were overlapping. And so everything that they 

will recover, the amounts of compensation recovered for 

termination, are covered by the breach of contract 

claim. The difference between the two is about 

$1.4 million worth of attorney's fees and expert costs 

that are covered by the PMPA, but would not be provided 

under contract law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a rather significant 

difference. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the company have to 

do in your view to effect a genuine termination and not 

a constructive termination?

notice that’s required, say that they are terminating, 

that this is -- in the words of contract, we are 

extinguishing the future operations; or they can engage 

in conduct which an objectively reasonable observer 

would have to understand gives that exact same message. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that constructive 

termination? 

MR. LAMKEN: No, it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the conduct is you 

stopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me. 

MR. LAMKEN: It's an actual termination. And 

the problem is, once you get into -- you get into 

constructive termination, you get the question of: 

Well, is it a constructive termination to raise the 

price by 1 percent or, as the case entirely involves 

market --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand what 

your number two consists of unless it consists of an act 

that the other side would call constructive -- or the 

government would call constructive termination. 

MR. LAMKEN: I think sometimes there is an 

unclear line between what some people call an implicit 

or informal actual termination --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

MR. LAMKEN: -- and what other people would 

call a constructive termination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think there’s always an 

unclear line between those two. 

MR. LAMKEN: But I don't think -- in the 

highly unusual case of $1,000 per gallon or things like 

that, that might be the case. But in the ordinary cases 

you see a 1 percent increase in gas prices in highly 

volatile petroleum markets. For example, in this case, 

where Shell raised its prices considerably but was still 

charging less than Exxon and Chevron, as the joint 

appendix 225 and 237 made clear, that's what you end up 

with as claims for constructive termination, if you 

recognize constructive termination. 

But Congress was worried about actual 

terminations, the exercise of contractual rights, broad 

contractual rights, to terminate that were formerly not 

regulated, not breaches of contract that were already 

regulated by -- comprehensively, by State law. 

If I may reserve the remainder of my time for 

rebuttal. Thank you.

SUPPORTING SHELL OIL PRODUCTS COMPANY, LLC, ET AL. 

MR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The government agrees with Shell that, because 

there was no termination or non-renewal in any 

meaningful sense of the word, the dealers failed to 

state a claim under the PMPA. But, Justice Ginsburg, 

you are correct: The government parts company with 

Shell about what the term -- word "termination," does 

cover. Shell would limit the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When would you -- when 

would you measure your constructive termination? At 

what point would the statute of limitations begin to run 

or stop under your definition? 

MR. O'NEIL: When the franchisee is actually 

forced to end one of the statutory elements of the 

franchise in response to the franchisor's conduct. And 

that's the same test that would be applied in the 

constructive discharge or constructive eviction context. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you would say 

that the franchisee in this situation would have had to 

say: I can't pay the increased amount of rent without 

the subsidy; I'm going to stop. 

MR. O'NEIL: That's correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what about the 

statutory right for a preliminary injunction? When 

would that right kick in, in this situation? 

MR. O'NEIL: It --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because the preliminary 

injunction stops the change of a contract price -- of a 

contract term, obviously, or it continues it. So when 

-- at what point would --

MR. O'NEIL: If a franchisee is faced with 

franchisor conduct that will leave the franchisee with 

no alternative but to abandon a statutory element, then 

the franchisee in that situation can go in and say that 

he is in the equivalent position to someone who has 

received a piece of paper saying: You are hereby 

terminated. And we would say that for purposes of 

seeking preliminary injunctive relief, that the 

franchisee can claim that he has been terminated for 

those purposes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And for -- if for whatever 

reason the judge says no at the preliminary injunction 

stage, that's the end of it; the franchisee just has to 

leave the premises?

MR. O'NEIL: Well, a judge would only deny a 

preliminary injunction if either there were no serious 

question going to the merits on the termination question 

or if the balance of hardships did not tip in the 

franchisee's favor. And then the franchisee would be in 

a very difficult position to claim that it was in some 

kind of catch-22, because by definition the judge would 

have found that the franchisor is in a worse condition 

by having to continue the relationship. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the franchisor stops 

delivering gas. There are three -- three different 

obligations under the contract. What does the 

franchisee have to do to show that he has accepted it as 

a termination? Why does he have to leave the premises? 

That's another contract, is -- is what the --

MR. O'NEIL: Justice Scalia, we -- we agree 

with Shell on this. The statute defines "franchise" by 

three elements: The supply of fuel, the use of the 

leased premises, and the use of the trademark. So 

someone who is still on a gas station premises that had 

the Shell sign above them but that had no fuel would not 

be operating a gas station franchise, and that would be 

a termination even if the franchisee did not actually 

pick up and leave the premises. So we would call that a 

termination.

JUSTICE ALITO: If the conduct on the part of 

the franchisor is raising the price of gas, how does the 

factfinder determine whether it's sufficient to justify 

a constructive termination? And assume that the 

franchisee leaves -- the price of gas is raised, and 

this particular franchisee says: I can't operate if gas 

is sold to me at that price. What's the standard for 

determining whether there was a constructive 

termination? 

MR. O'NEIL: The test is, first of all, 

whether the franchisor's conduct was wrongful -- in 

other words, in violation of the agreement between the 

parties; and whether a reasonable franchisee in those 

circumstances would have no alternative but to do what 

that franchisee did and to abandon the premises. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But what's a reasonable 

franchisee in that situation? Presumably some have a 

small profit margin; some have a bigger profit margin. 

Some could operate if the price of gas is raised; some 

could not. How is that to be determined? 

MR. O'NEIL: Well, it's the same kind of 

question that juries ask all the time -- juries answer 

all the time in constructive discharge and constructive 

eviction cases. 

Indeed, we think it may be easier to answer

that question in this context, because constructive 

discharge and constructive eviction will often turn on 

intangible psychological factors like the level of 

indignity that an employee would suffer before leaving 

his job. Gas station franchises are operated for -- to 

make money, and if it would be impossible for a 

franchisee to do that, then a reasonable franchisee in 

those circumstances would have no choice but to --

JUSTICE ALITO: You are putting a jury in sort 

of the situation of a -- of a rate regulator, aren't 

you, if you do that? 

MR. O'NEIL: No. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Was it a reasonable rate? 

MR. O'NEIL: No. The question is whether it 

would be so intolerable -- not whether the rate is fair, 

but whether it would be so intolerable that a reasonable 

franchisee, a rational franchisee who is economically 

motivated, would have any alternative but to abandon it. 

And if the franchisee could continue in business, then 

it is not a constructive termination. The franchisee 

might have a claim for breach of contract, but as long 

as -- as long as it would not be a fitting response to 

actually abandon the premises, then that is not a 

constructive termination.

supposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a 

reasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he 

has a contract claim, right? And then at that magical 

point, the contract claim is converted into a claim 

under the statute? 

MR. O'NEIL: When --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't the contract claim 

alone enough? 

MR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice Scalia, the whole 

point of the PMPA was that State law remedies were 

inadequate in that narrow context where the franchisee's 

very existence was threatened. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: "In the context of 

termination" is what the statute says. 

MR. O'NEIL: Yes, and under well-established 

background principles of the law that Congress was 

drawing on when it enacted the PMPA, termination was not 

limited solely to explicit termination. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what are these --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What background principles 

were they? I don't know about constructive termination. 

There was constructive discharge and constructive 

eviction. But --

MR. O'NEIL: The relationship here is in 

essence one of landlord and tenant. And so it was

natural for Congress to draw on that body of law, as 

well as the body of law governing the termination of 

other kinds of relationships like employment, for the 

meaning of the -- of "termination" under the PMPA. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. O'Neil, I thought that 

there were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the 

tenant is not required to leave the premises because, as 

awful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to 

go. 

MR. O'NEIL: Justice Ginsburg, I am not aware 

of those cases, and I think the general rule is the one 

that -- that is -- is broadly stated in the cases, which 

is that if the franchisee -- excuse me, if the tenant 

wants to claim constructive eviction, they need to leave 

the premises. That is a bedrock principle of the law, 

that in order to claim constructive eviction, you 

actually have to leave. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So what happens -- in other 

words, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to 

clear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and 

horrible-smelling things all over. And then the 

franchisee leaves, but the franchisor says: Hey, I 

didn't want you to leave; that's your problem. I mean, 

that's constructive eviction or constructive 

termination?

termination. And that is how the law operates in every 

other area in which this doctrine applies. So if a 

civil rights plaintiff claims discrimination on the 

basis of race or gender, she cannot stay in her job and 

at the same time claim that she was fired. I mean 

that's --

the three contracts has been terminated? 

MR. O'NEIL: Well, as I said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The other two continue --

continue in effect?

And that's how the Act defines franchise. It defines it 

by all three elements of the franchise, and so if one of

business and convert their stations to direct 

operations. Nevertheless, Shell and Motiva argue that 

conduct designed to force the dealers out of business is 

insufficient to invoke statutory protection because the 

dealers were not deprived of any of the statutory 

elements of the franchise, and they remained in business 

for some period following the rental increase. 

If accepted, the practical effect of Shell and 

Motiva's position will allow franchisors to circumvent 

the PMPA and terminate franchises at any time, at any 

reason, by simply increasing the burden on their 

operations.

business owners who have invested their livelihoods in 

operating these franchises. They are trying to keep the 

business operational against perhaps all odds and 

perhaps --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test? 

MR. FARRAHER: Pardon me, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the test? Because if 

you say we are going to give an action to a person who 

didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to 

get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into 

a Federal action every single breach of contract or 

serious breach of contract that there is, which is the 

precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed 

this statute. 

So, what is your test as to we know that your 

case is the lions and tigers case? 

MR. FARRAHER: Justice Breyer, I believe that 

you hit on two points: First off, what is the test 

sufficient to invoke a constructive termination? And

whether or not abandonment of the franchise is required 

by the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't put it that way. 

I’d say constructive termination means you didn't 

terminate. Okay? That's what "constructive" means. It 

means you didn't do it. But sometimes a franchisor 

could act in such a way that the law should treat it as 

if he really did. All right? I can imagine a test for 

that. 

But we have the second problem here, is that 

even if the conduct was designed -- it's equal to 

terminating it -- this individual didn't leave. 

MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: So he was still there running 

the business. That's the part I would like to test for. 

MR. FARRAHER: The test, Your Honor -- first 

off, with respect to whether the conduct is sufficient 

to force a termination, we believe the First Circuit's 

standard of materiality, which is effective to end one 

of the components of the statutorily defined franchise, 

is sufficient. 

With respect to the second part of your 

question, which is why didn't these dealers leave the 

station, and --

for deciding -- even though the first part is met, how 

you apply it when the person didn't leave? I understand 

a person who left. He left. 

MR. FARRAHER: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The franchisor says: I 

didn't tell him to leave. And then you go look to see 

if the franchisor's conduct was so bad, it was the same 

as if you told him to leave. I've got that part. 

The part I don't have is what happens if he 

doesn't leave? Because one thing we know, the conduct 

wasn't so bad that this person left, because he didn't 

leave. That's that second part that's bothering me. 

MR. FARRAHER: And Your Honor, I'm not sure 

there’s a test for that, but certainly the statute 

doesn't contemplate that the dealer would have to leave. 

For example, the injunctive remedy in the statute would 

allow a dealer to come in --

JUSTICE BREYER: I need -- the injunctive 

remedies in the State court? 

MR. FARRAHER: They are different, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. But the 

reason I need a test is because the other side is

as contemplated by the statute.

for a test. Maybe this would help you. If you are the

First Circuit used a materiality standard that said that 

the lease was effectively ended. And in the context of 

the statute, the franchise as defined by the three 

elements, what the judge asked the jury to determine 

was, was the agreement that Shell entered into with 

these franchisees, with the essential component being 

the subsidy, was that effectively eliminated --

JUSTICE ALITO: What does that mean, 

"effectively eliminated"? The -- the First Circuit 

said, if "the breach of the lease was such a material 

change that it effectively ended the lease, even though 

the plaintiffs continued to operate the business" -- I 

have no idea what that means. What does it mean to 

effectively end the lease even though the lease 

continues? 

MR. FARRAHER: Yes, Your Honor, Justice Alito. 

The statute contemplates a distinction in the 

relationship between a franchise, which is a set of 

contracts, and a franchise relationship. A franchise 

relationship continues after the expiration of the -- of 

the franchise. 

In this case here what the judge was charging 

the jury was -- what the question was, was the breach of 

the lease so material that it effectively ended the --

the agreement that Shell had entered into with its

In other words --

JUSTICE ALITO: I know, but could you put that 

in somewhat more concrete terms, or can you not get any 

more specific than to say the lease is effectively 

ended? 

MR. FARRAHER: We -- we think that that 

certainly was a sufficient standard. The circuit courts 

that have decided the issue have arguably employed a 

lower standard. They have talked about a breach of one 

of the franchise agreements being sufficient. But 

certainly we believe the First Circuit set an 

appropriate standard here with the materiality being --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any 

area of the law, other than this one, if you are right, 

in which a termination includes a non-termination; that 

is, where a constructive termination includes situations 

where the operation continues? 

MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, certainly in our --

in our briefs we have referred to cases where 

constructive evictions in some settings will allow a 

tenant to stay in a premises. Certainly, the -- the 

majority of the cases decided in the discharge context 

or an eviction setting do require what you have

no case in which there’s a constructive eviction but 

where the lessee remains on the premises. Maybe I 

misheard. 

What is -- what is your principal case where 

the lessee remains on the premises, but there is a 

constructive eviction? 

MR. FARRAHER: Justice Kennedy, on page 38 of 

the main brief in the footnote, we've cited two cases in 

New Jersey that allow for that proposition. Certainly, 

conceding that the majority of the courts have held that

eviction setting is a necessary prerequisite to the 

claim. But we also recognize that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we -- can -- perhaps 

to bring this to more practical terms, you can walk 

through with me. I'm going to assume that if a 

franchisor changes a rent term and the franchisee 

refuses to pay, wouldn't the franchisor at some point 

give a notice of termination? What franchisor is going 

to sit through months and months and years of waiting 

for payment before kicking someone out? Is it -- is

concede that in all likelihood, a franchisor would take 

some affirmative conduct, whether that be through a 

notice of termination or other step. But, yes, that 

would happen. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or -- or, so that in 

almost all situations, at least with respect to the 

leased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the 

termination would be -- would have to happen. 

MR. FARRAHER: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do we need to make 

a constructive eviction theory when, on a practical 

basis, there always in this situation has to be a notice 

of termination, at least with respect to the premises 

part? 

MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, I -- I 

respectfully disagree. And I think the government and 

Shell would both concede that written notification, 

although required by the statute, is not necessarily 

always going to be given. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know. But at some point 

the franchisor is going to have to take over the 

premises, either by trying to evict the person or 

locking them out. No -- no rational franchisor is going

to raise rent, not have the franchisee pay, and fail to 

terminate the agreement. 

MR. FARRAHER: That -- that may be true, Your 

Honor. But in this case here what Shell's position is 

that they can -- they can -- and -- and put such 

intolerable conduct at issue, for example, raising the 

rent by several hundred percent, and that doesn't 

constitute a termination in any respect, even if -- even 

if the dealer were to leave. 

They argue that they must affirmatively 

withhold one of the statutory elements of the franchise 

from the dealer. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the franchisee could 

always just stop paying the rent. He doesn't have to 

leave the premises. 

MR. FARRAHER: That's right, Your Honor. And 

again -- again the statute doesn't contemplate -- and --

and we have to, again, go back to the statute to 

recognize what the word "termination" means in the 

context of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. 

Certainly, Shell envisions that it means that there must 

be an end to the relationship. 

The Solicitor would concede, I believe, that 

the dealer could remain on the premises if there was 

such sufficient conduct to force them out of business

that a reasonable person would think they have no 

ability to continue in business. But then the Solicitor 

imposes a condition that that franchisee must seek an 

injunction in order to have a claim under the Act. 

Our position is that the injunction is a form 

of a relief to protect the franchisee, to maintain the 

status quo. But the existence of a claim under the 

statute does not depend upon whether or not the 

franchisee seeks the injunction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't -- you 

didn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge 

Zobel thought it was -- it came much too late. 

MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, this -- this case 

has had a -- a long history to it. The case was 

initially filed as In the matter of Tsanikilides in the 

U.S. district court and assigned to Judge Zobel. Our 

prior counsel did seek an injunction. It's not clear on 

the record why that injunction was withdrawn at the time 

that the Tsanikilides case was dismissed. 

But then when the Marcoux or the Mac's Shell 

case was re-filed, it’s correct that the dealers did not 

initially move for injunctive relief. And I think there 

were two reasons for that. Number one, it was always 

contemplated with Judge Zobel that this matter would 

proceed on an expedited basis, that discovery would lead

to trial within a very short period of time. 

And, number two, even though there is a 

relaxed standard for injunctive relief, it was not clear 

that the dealers would be able to sufficiently meet 

their burden of proof to demonstrate to the court that 

an injunction should be issued. 

Again, we are dealing here in a practical 

effect of asking an oil company on a national basis to 

be enjoined from implementing this change in rent that 

they had brought about. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain to me --

the question I brought up before -- what was the 

difference of the elements between the recovery that the 

jury gave for constructive termination and for breach of 

contract? 

MR. FARRAHER: The damages awarded were 

precisely the same, and the judge instructed the jury 

that, in fact, there would be no double recovery for 

the -- for the dealers here, that they would only 

recover once. The breach of contract was pled as an 

alternative theory. And the difference being that under 

the PMPA the dealers were also awarded their attorneys’ 

fees and expert witness fees as well, which was a -- a 

number north of a million dollars. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The problem that -- that I

see here is that if in fact you are right, that the --

the franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view. 

Did that breach rise to a termination? Did it rise to 

that level? 

Now, it's simply a question, since he breached 

the contract, of what court you are going to sue in, in 

your view. If this isn't a termination, you sue in 

State court; if it is a termination, you sue in Federal 

court. 

So, why -- why wouldn't we say, well, let him 

sue in State court, because if the person stays on the 

premises, everything becomes blurred. If you require 

him to leave the premises, then it's clear. If you were 

to let him stay on the premises and also argue it's a 

termination, we are going to have people coming into 

Federal court because they think there are more damages 

or something, I guess, or whatever reason. There will 

be a whole lot of unclear cases. So it's better to have 

a clear line. 

MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, again, the --

the reason that the dealers are coming to Federal court 

is because Congress enacted a statute to protect them --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are going to say they 

have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't.

fact that you have a right to. My question is a 

practical question: What's the harm of sticking to the 

clear line that is normally there in other cases, in 

this case not depriving your client of a remedy at all? 

MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Just saying he goes to State 

court to get it. 

MR. FARRAHER: I disagree with the Court that 

the client is not being deprived of a remedy. The 

remedy available in the statute in one part is 

injunctive relief. And while the dealers did not avail 

themselves of that in this particular case, the lesser 

standard and the lack of a need to show irreparable harm 

protects the franchisee under a Federal cause of action 

as distinguished from a contractual-based cause of 

action. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a million 

dollars, right? That's the difference. You get 

attorneys’ fees and expert fees in the Federal action, 

and presumably you don't in the State action. 

MR. FARRAHER: We -- we -- we do in this case, 

Mr. Chief Justice. But in a case where a dealer comes 

to the court for relief and they have available to them 

the injunctive remedy, which does not require the 

irreparable harm component be demonstrated, it keeps the

dealer in business. Certainly Congress intended to 

protect franchisees. They intended for competition in 

the marketplace to continue. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have the 

option, right? If you accept the idea that there’s a 

constructive termination under your view, even if you 

don't leave, I guess you have the option to stay in 

business or to leave at any time. 

MR. FARRAHER: They certainly do, Your Honor. 

And -- and what happened here, obviously, is that the 

oil company imposed such onerous conditions that they 

expected dealers would leave. And, in fact, in 

Massachusetts within the time period of the 

elimination -- the formation of Motiva, within a 5-year 

period thereafter, the numbers dropped almost by 50 

percent. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have a choice, you 

know. So, here's your choice, dealer: Stay there and 

sue in State court, and by the way, if they are charging 

you too much money under the contract and you are really 

hurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they 

are doing, go get an injunction in State court. See? 

They have injunctions in State courts. That exists.

choice. Move out. 

MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then if you move out, you can 

sue under Federal law, and you will get all these other 

things like the extra million dollars or something. So, 

move out and get the extra money, or stay there and sue 

under State court. Why is that a bad choice? 

MR. FARRAHER: It's -- it's a bad choice, Your 

Honor, because it puts the dealer in a position of 

having to determine whether they should abandon their 

lives’ works in order to benefit from a -- from a 

Federal cause of action. It's a bad idea because in the 

oil company's view, we don't get to make that choice, 

even despite their bad conduct unless they affirmatively 

stop providing us with one of the -- one of the 

statutory elements of the franchise. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, your -- your 

approach puts -- puts the company -- the oil company in 

a very strange position. It doesn't know whether it has 

a contract or not. It -- the contract is terminated if 

your client says it's terminated. If he doesn't say 

it's terminated, it's not terminated. I mean, a very 

weird contract where you -- you’re subject to the whim 

of the other party as to whether the contract continues 

or not.

MR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I think in the --

with -- again, with the injunctive relief available, a 

court could in the initial stages without the aid of 

discovery determine whether -- what the parties' 

obligations are during the course of the litigation. 

Here the dealers continued to pay the exorbitant rents 

that were being charged. So I would argue that the oil 

company was at no point in time harmed by virtue of the 

claim and then the proceedings that ensued. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know. They --

you know, if they knew that they were pulling out and --

and were claiming a termination, they might have been 

looking for somebody else to take over the franchise. 

MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, I think, as a 

practical matter, that would not have happened during 

the pendency of the litigation. So, again, to the 

extent that the -- an injunction had been sought, it 

would have helped to preserve the status quo, and in 

this case, again, here, the oil company was not in any 

way, shape, or form harmed by the dealers' pursuit of 

their claim because they continued to pay their rent, 

for those that remained in business, and those that went 

out of business obviously stopped. 

Your Honors, if I may turn to the other claim, 

which is also present in this case here, the claim of

the non-renewal, both the government and Shell have 

suggested that the statute imposes some sort of a 

mandatory mechanism requiring the franchisor to give 

notice and then the dealer seeking an injunction within 

90 days in order -- in connection with the non-renewal 

claim. 

I think, as a practical matter, we need to 

start with the proposition of what the jury found here, 

and the jury found that, in this case, the oil company 

added new terms to the lease specifically for the 

purposes of converting the franchise-operated stations 

to direct operations. They wanted the dealers out of 

business, and they wanted to take over operations of 

their stations. 

Had the oil company issued a notice of 

non-renewal when the parties didn't reach agreement on 

the terms of the agreement and this case had proceeded 

to a trial, there is no question, but that the result 

would have been exactly the same as the result is here. 

So the question we are facing is whether or 

not this mechanism that they have advanced as being 

the -- the only way, the exclusive remedy to proceed is, 

in fact, such, and we would argue that, in fact, it is 

not. Both the government and the Solicitor have 

conceded already that, while the statute requires notice

in the normal course, that, certainly, notice can be 

side-stepped, and that conduct can give rise to notice. 

The next question then would be whether or not 

the dealer must seek injunctive relief as a prerequisite 

to maintaining a claim, and we argue that there is 

nothing in the language of the statute suggesting that 

the injunction is mandatory. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The theory of it is to 

protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a 

company that says, we are not going to renew your lease. 

And they are unreasonable, and the dealers think. The 

statute says: Fine, don't renew it, okay? And, here, 

we’ll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt. 

If you really think he's wrong, go sue for an 

injunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra 

bonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff. 

So we protected you a lot. 

Now, why should there be a third thing that 

the statute says nothing about, which nobody's ever 

heard of? You just stay there, and you say: I'm going 

to just do business every day, just like nothing 

happened, and I write the words under protest. 

I mean, why would Congress have gone to all 

that trouble if that's all you have to do?

the language of the statute itself, while the -- while 

Congress provides for injunctive relief, which would be 

applicable equally to non-renewal claims as it would to 

termination claims, and while the statute speaks to 

notice, again, applicable to both, there is absolutely 

nothing in the statutory language that says this is a 

mandatory exhaustion of remedies. 

You must seek an injunction --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but there is a purpose, 

and the purpose is that this system at least brings a 

judge in to see if that dealer really does have enough 

of a claim to get this relaxed injunction. But your 

system leaves it 100 percent up to that dealer. It 

could be heard of that dealer really doesn't have a good 

claim, and all he does is write the words "under 

protest." 

MR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have a judge in 

it, at that stage, under your interpretation. 

MR. FARRAHER: We think that our case, 

certainly, is distinguishable from the other two 

circuits that have addressed the issue. In our case, 

our dealers filed a lawsuit before they were presented 

with the leases for signature. They told the oil 

company that they were signing under protest, with a

reservation of all their rights. 

It was the oil company that presented the 

leases to them on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. They 

said, there will be no negotiation of these terms, and 

you must sign, and if you don't sign, we are going to 

issue a notice of non-renewal. And then that pins the 

continuation of the dealers' business on the hopes that, 

even with a relaxed standard, a trial court is going to 

issue an injunction. 

And I certainly don't think that the statute 

or the Congress intended for the dealers to risk their 

businesses on the likelihood of getting the injunctive 

relief --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I ask you, 

have you accepted the majority's reasoning in the Dersch 

case, the Seventh Circuit case, with respect to 2805(f)?

doesn't apply to the right to preserve your claims of

MR. FARRAHER: The Seventh Circuit, if I 

understand the case correctly, Your Honor, says that 

there’s no implied cause of action under 2805(f) 

standing alone, that if a franchisor is insisting upon a 

term that includes a waiver, as in connection with 

non-renewal, then the Dersch decision in the Seventh 

Circuit would say that that might be actionable under 

2802(b)(3) because they have introduced a term that is 

not agreed upon and is designed for the purposes of 

forcing the dealers out of business. 

I don't know that we have taken an opinion, 

whether or not there’s an independent or implied cause 

of action standing alone under 2805(f). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I would have thought 

your strongest argument would have been that, if we have 

a statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or 

State rights, if there has been a non-renewal on 

reasonable terms, there has been a breach of that 

obligation under the statute, then you had a right to be 

renewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving 

you unreasonable terms -- "unreasonable" being defined 

within the statutory constraints -- they impose 

conditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you 

out; those are the two conditions -- then you had a 

right to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a

Marini and Ireland case that you cite, and I think

left part of the premises, and it was a constructive

the best response I have to that proposition is that we 

are not dealing in a traditional landlord/tenant context 

here. We are dealing under a statutory scheme that 

Congress enacted to protect franchisees, and we need to 

look within the meaning of the statute as to what 

termination means. 

I would also say that, in the landlord/tenant 

context, while the, perhaps, outdated notion of a 

constructive eviction would require the tenant to leave, 

cases seem to suggest, in a more modern sense, that the 

relationship between the landlord and the tenant is more 

of a contractual relationship in nature and, as such, 

allows for the traditional remedies available under 

contract law, in turning -- including self-help and 

rescission, et cetera. 

If there are no further questions, thank you 

very much. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Lamken, you have 5 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN 

ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS 

COMPANY, LLC, ET AL. 

MR. LAMKEN: Thank you. 

I believe the debate in this case comes down 

to about three issues: The first is what is the 

relevant background principle we think Congress was 

looking to when it used the words “terminate,” 

“non-renew,” and “cancel” in the statute. We think the 

most analogous background principles they would have 

been looking to were contract law and the State 

franchise statutes that existed at the time Congress 

acted. I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it 

true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's 

feeling that the common law rules were really not 

sufficient because, under the common law, of course, 

they could just non-renew because they wanted to take 

over the franchise themselves. And under the statute, 

that is not permissible. So there’s a major change 

that's created by the statute, which suggests, to me, 

that maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting 

common law. 

MR. LAMKEN: Right. There was a deficiency in

the common law, but it was limited to one point, and 

that was termination and non-renewal. It wasn't that 

breaches of contract -- and as the government has 

explained, a breach of contract here is a precondition 

to a constructive termination claim -- were 

insufficiently remedied by State law. That was not the 

issue before Congress. 

The issue before Congress was that there was a 

contractual right to terminate at will or for trivial 

reasons or to non-renew for no reason or bad reasons 

even, and that is what Congress regulated, was 

terminations and non-renewals, in that sense, not 

breaches of contract that turned out to be really bad. 

The second thing is that because there was a 

comprehensive State remedy, there is particularly little 

reason to read this statute, this narrow statute, 

expansively, particularly given that this is an 

expressly preemptive -- a potentially conflict 

preemption statute, which could have the effect of 

displacing State law. 

When you're looking at a statute that’s 

narrowly looking at termination or non-renewal, you 

would not ordinarily expand those terms to include 

really bad breaches of contract, because that has the 

potential to displace State statutory and potentially

State common law under the preemption clause. 

And, finally, the last piece that comes up is 

the problem of evasion. The issue becomes sort of, 

well, people can just get around this statute if there 

is no constructive termination cause of action. And the 

answer to that is: There is no problem with evasion, 

because everything that’s covered by constructive 

termination has to be a breach of contract. State law 

has this comprehensively covered. Increasing the price 

terms on an open price term? U.C.C. 2-305, under which 

plaintiff's recovered here, has that covered. So the --

extending the Federal statute really adds very little. 

And the second point is that even under the 

PMPA today, constructive termination has been rejected 

-- every -- except in the narrow area of assignments, 

under the theory that an assignment followed by a breach 

is somehow a constructive termination, a theory which I 

don't think we or the government thinks makes any sense. 

But that's where it exists. And yet there’s no record 

outside the area of assignment of these grand evasions 

by boosting up all the prices in violation of the 

contract. 

And the risk of expanding constructive 

termination here is it projects Federal law into 

deciding whether or not it's going to prohibit

particular price terms, particular conditions, 

particular things dealing with the rent and the 

premises, something that Congress stayed away from and 

left to the States. What Congress regulated here were 

the narrow issues of termination and non-renewal, not 

the substantive content of the franchise relationship. 

If there are no questions, we ask that the 

judgment with respect to termination be reversed and the 

judgment with respect to non-renewal be affirmed. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

So the case is submitted.
