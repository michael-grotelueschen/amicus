3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case No. 10-895, Gonzalez v. Thaler. 

Ms. Millett. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court: 

The court of appeals in this case had 

11 jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal, but in doing so, 

12 it decided the case wrongly. 

13  Mr. Gonzalez's petition for habeas corpus 

14 was timely because it was filed within a year of the 

conclusion of direct appellate proceedings in the State 

16 court and at the -- within a year of that court's ending 

17 of his appeal process. 

18  With respect to jurisdiction, jurisdiction 

19 existed because a certificate of appealability was 

issued. It rested upon a substantial showing of the 

21 denial of a constitutional right. 

22  To be sure, the judge in issuing that 

23 certificate did not identify the substantial 

24 constitutional question required by 2253(c)(3). That is 

a requirement. It is mandatory, but it is not 

3

1 jurisdictional. 


2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he had 


3 identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue? 


4 Does that give the court the authority to consider a 


different constitutional issue, a Fourth Amendment 

6 issue? 

7  MS. MILLETT: Yes, it does. Once -- this is 

8 a gatekeeping function to identify which case, which 

9 appeals should go forward and claim the attention of the 

court. But the text of the statute and 22 -- that's on 

11 page -- excuse me -- page 3a of the appendix to the blue 

12 brief. It provides that an appeal may not go forward, 

13 and if a certificate is issued, appeals may go forward. 

14 The operative language here in (c)(1) is that this is 

about an appeal going forward. 

16  So, once the certificate identifies issues, 

17 the appeal goes forward. It's much like 1292(b), where 

18 certification of questions comes to an appellate court, 

19 and they decide whether to take interlocutory review. 

Once they do, they're not bound to just those questions. 

21 The entire order comes up for review. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if it 

23 identifies something that is not remotely a Federal 

24 constitutional issue? By the terms of the COA, it's 

quite clear, you know, whether it is a State law issue or 

4

1 something else. There's no constitutional plausibility 

2 on the face of it. 

3  Does that still work for you? 

4  MS. MILLETT: It -- it works in the sense 

that it's not a jurisdictional bar to going forward. It 

6 is a violation of (c)(3). If timely raised by the 

7 State, then it can either be dismissed or revisited by 

8 the original judge. An appeal from the authorizing 

9 judge --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you decide whether 

11 it's a jurisdictional bar? You acknowledge that the 

12 issuance by a judge of a certificate of appealability is 

13 a jurisdictional step; right? 

14  MS. MILLETT: This Court so held --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is jurisdictional. If 

16 he doesn't do that, there's no jurisdiction. 

17  MS. MILLETT: Because this Court held in 

18 Miller-El --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So -- so, the issue 

is whether (c)(3), which says the certificate of 

21 appealability "shall indicate which specific issue or 

22 issues satisfy the showing required," whether that 

23 provision is a requirement for the validity of the 

24 certificate of appealability. If it is, then there's no 

jurisdiction, because the certificate of appealability

1 is invalid. 

2  MS. MILLETT: Well, I don't --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that right? 

4  MS. MILLETT: I don't agree that the 

so-called content validity of a document that is post 

6 hoc certifying a gatekeeping requirement is itself 

7 jurisdictional, because there is a --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's take the Fourth 

9 Amendment, I mean, which says, "no warrants shall issue, 

but upon probable cause." Okay? So -- but then it goes 

11 on, "supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly 

12 describing the place to be searched and the persons or 

13 things to be seized." Is the warrant valid if indeed it 

14 does not meet those requirements of being supported by 

oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the --

16  MS. MILLETT: No, a warrant may well not be 

17 valid if it doesn't --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It won't be valid. It will 

19 just be invalid. 

MS. MILLETT: But the certificate of 

21 appealability is invalid as matter of law here. It's an 

22 incorrect -- it's an incorrect action by the court. 

23 That doesn't make it jurisdictional. It's just --

24 warrants aren't jurisdictional, either, in that sense. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Just to take a kind of nutty

1 example, Ms. Millett, suppose that a judge took a blank 

2 piece of paper and typed the words "certificate of 

3 appealability" on top and issued it. Still jurisdiction 

4 to take the appeal? 

MS. MILLETT: Still jurisdiction to take the 

6 appeal. Of course, one would expect -- one would expect 

7 either the court of appeals judges or the State, 

8 which -- both of which have every incentive to check on 

9 these things, to raise the issue. But the question 

is when something happens --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, what counts as a 

12 certificate of appealability is I guess the question. 

13 All you need is those three words, and then you have a 

14 certificate of appealability --

MS. MILLETT: Well, I think it --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- such that jurisdiction 

17 attaches? 

18  MS. MILLETT: No, there's more to it. I 

19 mean, it's not issued by the clerk's office, right? The 

statute requires a judge to do this, a Federal judge, 

21 circuit judge or justice -- circuit justice -- to issue 

22 this. And these are -- these are officials who are 

23 sworn to uphold the law and the Constitution. And when 

24 they do this, when they make these determinations, they 

aren't handing these out like candy; they're deciding

1 that their court, their colleagues, maybe themselves, 

2 should invest resources in this process. 

3  So, the fact that a certificate is issued is 

4 not simply a piece of paper coming out. I think it is 

fair to presume that it is a deliberate determination by 

6 a judicial officer. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under Justice --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett, suppose, 

9 instead of having the statute broken down into (c)(1), 

(2), and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one 

11 paragraph that says: You must have a certificate of 

12 appealability, and this is what the certificate must 

13 contain. No division into (2) and (3). Would you still 

14 maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph 

is jurisdictional and the rest is not? 

16  MS. MILLETT: Well, my position would be 

17 harder for precisely the reason you phrased. And as 

18 Justice Scalia was asking, how do we tell? These are --

19 these are jobs of statutory construction, and the fact 

that Congress broke these two steps out and broke (c)(3) 

21 out by itself, and there's a noticeable turn in the 

22 language by the time you get to (c)(3) -- (c)(1) says 

23 "no appeal shall be taken." That sounds jurisdictional. 

24 (c)(3) says a document "shall indicate" issues after the 

fact.

Official 

1  The important thing to understand here is 

2 that you not only have the language shifting materially, 

3 but your starting presumption, the starting presumption 

4 here, is that we need a clear direction from Congress 

before we decide that something is jurisdictional. And 

6 this Court has faced language far more emphatic than 

7 (c)(3). For example, in Reed --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the Petitioner asks 

9 for a certificate of appealability on 10 issues, and the 

circuit judge says, I'm granting it on issue 1, I'm 

11 denying it on issue 2 through 9 -- 2 through 10. 

12  Is there jurisdiction to consider 2 through 

13 10? 

14  MS. MILLETT: There is jurisdiction to 

consider. It's obviously within the discretion of the 

16 court. They could also determine not to. And I say 

17 that, again, because the language talks --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: No, in that situation then, 

19 if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are 

made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the --

21 would the panel be obligated to do that? 

22  MS. MILLETT: No, it wouldn't. It would not 

23 be obligated to, because what (c)(1) says is this 

24 determines when an appeal comes forward, the whole 

appeal comes forward.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: It could do that without 

2 issuing a new -- without issuing a certificate of 

3 appealability, without saying we think that the judge 

4 who issued the certificate of appealability was 

incorrect, that jurists of reason could disagree on 

6 issues 2 through 10? 

7  MS. MILLETT: Well, I think -- I think 

8 whether you have -- the panel would then have to do 

9 the paperwork of doing a new certificate of 

appealability or adjusting its own decision in the 

11 course of its ruling, explain that we've decided to 

12 reach these is not, I don't think, of jurisdictional 

13 significance, which way they --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Millett --

MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me you beg 

17 the question when you say that the issue is whether the 

18 appeal will go forward. That's precisely what -- what 

19 the issue is here, whether it is that the appeal will go 

forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will 

21 go forward. That's exactly what we're talking about. 

22  MS. MILLETT: Well, it's a statutory 

23 construction question, whether Congress --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems that the 

structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward 

10

1 on a particular issue, and not in -- not in general on 

2 -- on who knows how many issues. 

3  MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, with 

4 respect, that's not what the statute says. Congress 

could have written the statute that way, but I think it 

6 would be extraordinary to tell courts that an appeal 

7 comes forward but we're only going to allow you to look 

8 at this precise issue decided by one judge. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: It says it doesn't come 

forward -- doesn't come forward unless there is a 

11 certificate of appealability. 

12  MS. MILLETT: Yes. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: And then it says the 

14 certificate of appealability shall indicate which 

specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required. 

16  MS. MILLETT: But in nowhere --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I read that as 

18 saying you -- we're going to have an appeal but just an 

19 appeal on the issue that's identified. 

MS. MILLETT: First of all, I mean, courts 

21 can certainly do that as a matter of discretion, but 

22 whether they are compelled --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that would exclude 

24 this case, wouldn't it, because there is a 

constitutional issue? It's a speedy trial issue. But 

11

1 that issue was not reached below, because the case was 

2 dismissed as untimely. So, the only constitutional 

3 issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be 

4 adjudicated by the court of appeals. Isn't that right? 

Is there another constitutional issue other than the 

6 speedy trial issue? 

7  MS. MILLETT: There -- there are other 

8 issues that were raised. I think for our purposes that 

9 the strongest one that was most clearly substantial is 

a speedy trial one. And that's the one that we 

11 identified --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a little odd that 

13 you would identify that issue for the court of appeals 

14 when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it 

wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was 

16 dismissed at an earlier stage. 

17  MS. MILLETT: Well, I think, Justice 

18 Ginsburg, your question actually captures why these 

19 mistakes happen by court of appeals judges. The court 

of appeals judge presumably -- and again, I'm just 

21 presuming here. This Court's seen this mistake happen 

22 before. And I think what -- the judge that looked at 

23 this didn't make a determination there wasn't a 

24 substantial constitutional question, had to know that 

that was there. 

12

1  But for the court of appeals' purposes, 

2 they're just going to sort out the procedural question, 

3 and if it's timely they're not going to address speedy 

4 trial in the first instance. That would go back to the 

district court. So, that's one of the reasons I think 

6 just as a practical matter why this mistake happens 

7 sometimes in this certificate of appealability process. 

8  But the fundamental question here is one of 

9 statutory construction: Did Congress make clear, clear 

at the level we require for jurisdiction, clear that we 

11 -- at the level we would require for holding -- and I've 

12 never seen this anywhere in this Court's precedent --

13 holding that an individual pro se prisoner who does 

14 everything reasonably possible, fully and timely 

complies with all obligations, will still have his right 

16 to first habeas on a substantial constitutional claim 

17 irretrievably jurisdictionally foreclosed because the 

18 court of appeals judge miswrote a certificate 

19 documenting a judgment that the officer made. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you -- can you make 

21 the argument -- does it help you, in distinguishing the 

22 notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice 

23 of appeal has to say the judgment or order that's being 

24 appealed? 

That's almost clerical. It doesn't require 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 any -- any discretion on the part of the judge or 

2 extensive review of the record, whereas in the COA, 

3 there has to be an element of judgment in deciding what 

4 the constitutional issue is. Does that help you 

distinguish the two? 

6  You rely on the fact that the notice of 

7 appeals cases were decided before our -- our case 

8 indicating that it has to be clear language. 

9  MS. MILLETT: I think certainly that there's 

that point. I think what's important to recognize is 

11 that there's actually a similarity between this Court's 

12 notice of appeal cases in something like Houston v. 

13 Lack, the mail -- prison mailbox rule. You have a 

14 specific textual jurisdictional requirement in the -- in 

the rules, that require filing a notice of appeal 

16 with the clerk of the district court. And this Court 

17 said, look, when it comes to prisoners who have done 

18 everything humanly possible within their control to meet 

19 the jurisdictional requirements, we are not going to 

interpret these rules -- as part of the presumption, we 

21 don't interpret rules to strip away jurisdiction from 

22 individuals who have done everything humanly possible, 

23 particularly when the facts on the ground are that the 

24 statute was satisfied. 

The facts here are that it was met, and

1 there's every reason to think that Judge Garza made that 

2 determination --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --

4  MS. MILLETT: -- but didn't want to go into 

the speedy trial --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: You've done everything 

7 humanly possible, and just because of the mistake of a 

8 -- of a district judge, it can't go forward. But that 

9 happens. 

What if the district judge does -- makes a 

11 mistake and -- and he thinks that there has not been a 

12 substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 

13 right? He makes a mistake about that. What happens? 

14  MS. MILLETT: That can be appealed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The same -- the same 

16 terrible result --

17  MS. MILLETT: That can -- that can be 

18 appealed. There are -- you can -- you can -- there are 

19 processes for attempting to appeal single-judge orders. 

Within every court of appeals, they have rules for that. 

21  The difficulty here is that you have a pro 

22 se prisoner who thought he won. He got something that's 

23 hard to get from a court of appeals judge, and that's a 

24 certificate of appealability. And he did it by 

providing documentation of a substantial speedy trial

1 claim, a speedy trial claim unlike this Court has ever 

2 seen, a 10-year gap between indictment and trial and 

3 then conviction on nothing but eyewitness testimony. 

4  He documented that for the court, did 

everything he could. And it isn't until this Court that 

6 the State says, hang on; there was never any 

7 jurisdiction over this whole case. They didn't tell the 

8 court of appeals judges that. They didn't say anything 

9 until the case came to this Court. And that type of 

trap --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: But is it necessary for you 

12 to go -- is it necessary for you to go as far as you 

13 seem to be going? Would it be possible to read (c)(3) 

14 as mandatory but not jurisdictional? 

MS. MILLETT: That's --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: So that if -- well, I 

17 understood what you just -- your argument to be that it 

18 doesn't even have any effect, that so long as there's 

19 any document that's called a certificate of 

appealability, then anything can be considered by the 

21 court of appeals panel without the issuance of a -- of a 

22 certificate of appealability covering the issue. 

23  But if it's mandatory but not 

24 jurisdictional, then if the State moves or maybe if the 

court, if the panel, sue sponte identifies the fact that

1 there may be an error, there's an opportunity for a new 

2 certificate of appealability. If nothing is done, 

3 then -- then there isn't a problem. It's not a 

4 jurisdictional issue that lingers forever. 

MS. MILLETT: No, I'm sorry if I misspoke. 

6 I absolutely agree that it's mandatory and, if timely 

7 raised, must be dealt with. I think it's an open 

8 question whether if it's not raised until you're 

9 actually before the panel, whether the panel then has to 

identify one of its judges to issue a certificate or it 

11 can simply in the course of its opinion say we've 

12 determined that this should go forward, even though the 

13 initial -- would you have to go through a formal 

14 amendment process or you just do that as part of your 

decision? I think either one will accomplish the same 

16 result and will comply with the statute, the functional 

17 gatekeeping requirement. 

18  But the separate question which your 

19 question -- your comment leads to is that in looking at 

this, would Congress have wanted this gatekeeping 

21 function to be subject to perpetual review and revision, 

22 obligatory perpetual review by the panel? You couldn't 

23 accept that your colleague found that there was a 

24 substantial question; all three judges would again have 

to revisit that and determine that it's substantial.

1  This was set up as a gatekeeping 

2 requirement, and it was meant to be a -- a promotion of 

3 efficiency, not to cause more work, not to cause more 

4 paperwork, to sift out cases, identify the appeals that 

merit the time and resources of the court. And once 

6 that's identified, the more efficient process is not to 

7 make the certificate of appealability a whole side show, 

8 a whole other layer of processing, ping-ponging cases 

9 back and forth between this Court, courts of appeals; 

courts of appeals, single judges. 

11  We simply -- we try -- we look at this and 

12 we determine that a judgment was made by a judicial 

13 officer sworn to uphold the law; a substantial showing 

14 was made. And the fact that it wasn't written down as 

the statute likes is a problem; it should have been 

16 raised, but it wasn't raised, and we don't start all 

17 over. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Millett, as I 

19 understand the State, the State is not contending that 

(c)(2) is jurisdictional. So, you're -- you're arguing 

21 against a position they haven't taken. They -- they 

22 don't say that there's no jurisdiction if in fact there 

23 has been no substantial showing, so that the court of 

24 appeals has to review that. They're just saying that

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, before your 

13 time expires, I'd like to ask one question on the 

14 merits. 

In Jimenez, we held that the most natural 

16 reading of 2244(d)(1)(A) is to read it like we read 

17 2255. And we read 2255 to say that finality is reached 

18 when direct review -- and direct review concludes when 

19 the court affirms a conviction or denies a petition, or, 

if the defendant forgoes direct review, when the time 

21 for seeking such review expires. 

22  Isn't that what the Fifth Circuit did --

23  MS. MILLETT: No, what the --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with -- with 2244? It 

read it exactly the way we read it in Jimenez?

2 -- we're -- we're happy to take the language of Jimenez 

3 which --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know, but you're not 

taking its holding. 

6  MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry? 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You -- you take language 

8 from it --

9  MS. MILLETT: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but I read -- I read 

11 Jimenez to say that the court should be reading this 

12 alternative "or" language in exactly the way the Fifth 

13 Circuit did. 

14  MS. MILLETT: This Court said in Jimenez 

that the -- quote, I'm quoting here, "the language 

16 points to the conclusion of direct appellate proceedings 

17 in State court," as -- end quote, as a -- as a moment 

18 of finality. And that is the test that we're asking 

19 for. The conclusion of direct appellate proceedings in 

State court in Texas is the issuance of the mandate. 

21 Clay and Jimenez together prove our point. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Jimenez held that it's 

23 an either/or. If you do direct review, you do it from 

24 the time that it's final, that it concludes or, if 

you've forgone direct review, when the time for seeking

1 review expires. 

2  MS. MILLETT: And two responses to that. 

3 First, that simply begs the question that we're presenting 

4 in this case of when the direct review ended. That's our 

argument in the case, is that prong. When did that 


6 direct review prong end? 


7  And the second -- the second aspect of this 


8 is to understand what happened in Jimenez. The whole 


9 argument there was that you've got to -- by the State, 


was you're only -- you stopped -- remember, Jimenez had 

11 stopped at the intermediate court of appeals as well. 

12 And the State's argument was you stopped at the 

13 intermediate court of appeals originally; so, you're 

14 only in the expiration of review prong. 

And this -- but then he went back 4 years 

16 later, I think it was, and got the court to reopen, 

17 started -- had a whole new direct review process going 

18 on. And this Court said -- rejected the argument that 

19 because he didn't go to the intermediate court, we don't 

look at the direct review prong; we only look at 

21 expiration of review prong. We don't look at that. We 

22 stop and we look to see is the State done. And 

23 whichever of those two prongs you're in -- and it may 

24 depend on what time the question is asked. Whichever 

prong you're in, the last -- the last of those will

1 determine when your judgment becomes final. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Millett, let's 

3 take a look at the text of 2244(d)(1). It says the 

4 limitation shall run from the latest of. And then it 

gives four dates essentially, four sections, each of 

6 which produces a date, (A), (B), (C), and (D). And (A) 

7 is the one that's concerned here. And (A) says the date 

8 on which the judgment becomes final, and then it gives 

9 two ways by which a judgment can become final. And the 

two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right? You 

11 lose or you abandon your process. 

12  So, I just don't understand your argument, 

13 quite honestly, because it seems to me that (A) says the 

14 date, a single date, on which the judgment becomes 

final. When is that going to happen? Well, for some 

16 people it's going to happen when they lose, and for 

17 other people it's going to happen when they quit. 

18  MS. MILLETT: First of all, the language 

19 forks out again, and so it says the date on which the 

judgment becomes final, and then there's the two options 

21 for finality. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. Two ways for it to 

23 become final: They lose or they quit. 

24  MS. MILLETT: Well -- and the question in 

this case is, how do we know when that -- that direct

1 review process, what you're calling the lose prong, 

2 ends? And it's when the State says it’s done. Because the 

3 point of this is not an exhaustion prong. The point of 

4 2244(d)(1)in particular, but 2244(d) generally, is to 

say, as this Court talked about, is the State done? This 

6 supports federalism. 

7  Ex parte Johnson, the case that we cite, 

8 footnote 2, says, until the mandate issues, the appeal 

9 continues. And so, the notion of --

JUSTICE KAGAN: There's no suggestion in 

11 section (A) that there's ever going to be a conflict 

12 between these two ways of a judgment becoming final. 

13 There is no suggestion that one is going to have to pick 

14 between them. Subsection (A) is most naturally read --

again, it says "the date" -- as there's just going to be 

16 one date. And some people, the date of finality is 

17 going -- you know, it becomes final because they lose. 

18 Other people, it becomes final because they quit. But 

19 subsection (A) suggests a single date, not two dates 

which you then have to choose between. 

21  MS. MILLETT: One, I don't think the text 

22 compels that one way or the other. It says when does it 

23 become final. And so, let's ask the questions: When 

24 did direct review conclude --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does -- it does

1 suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion 

2 of direct review is you've gone up the ladder, and 

3 that's it. And the second part is, well, if you don't 

4 go up the ladder, you just stop. Then when your time 

to go up the ladder has ended, that's it. It -- it 

6 seems that there are those two possibilities, as Justice 

7 Kagan put it so well: You lose or you quit. 

8  MS. MILLETT: And the issue is -- and I hate 

9 to call it the "lose prong" -- but when did he lose? 

When did the State say, we're done and we've decided 

11 this case is over, this appeal is over? And that was 

12 when the mandate issued. This is only about when that 

13 prong happens. And because you can have --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you would have a 

difference between 2255 and 2254. And on the State 

16 level, you would have a variety of times because some 

17 States -- they don't all make it the mandate. They 

18 don't set finality at the mandate. There may be 

19 different -- there may be different periods of time 

before the mandate issues. So, you would have various 

21 time periods for State prisoners. But if you were a 

22 Federal prisoner, then you would have -- there would 

23 only be the one --

24  MS. MILLETT: No. You have the exact 

same test. The answer is easier in the Federal system

1 because when direct review is concluded -- this Court 

2 said in Clay, look, if all we had to look at was 

3 conclusion of direct review -- it didn't say we didn't 

4 know it -- we don't -- there would be no conclusion for 

the mandate --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not talking about a 

7 test. I'm talking about time periods. There -- there's 

8 a uniform time period for 2255 petitions.  There would 

9 not be a uniform time period for 2254 petitions. 

MS. MILLETT: That's a result -- but that's 

11 already a result of Jimenez, which had this whole 

12 reopening process that I -- unless the Federal system 

13 were to do that, there -- as this Court noted in Wall v. 

14 Kholi, you can have discretionary applications that can 

be called direct review as well. Direct review is not 

16 the linear process that has tried to be portrayed here. 

17 And the time ultimately is the same. 

18  What happened in Clay -- these things are 

19 equivalent. You have the same test. Sometimes the 

outcome is different based on what the individual does 

21 and what the State law allows, but you have -- this is 

22 supposed to protect federalism. And the only way to 

23 protect federalism and comity interests is to respect

1  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

2  MR. MITCHELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

3 please the Court: 

4  The Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to 

review the district court's dismissal of Mr. Gonzalez's 

6 habeas petition because the document issued by the 

7 circuit judge in this case fails to qualify as the 

8 required certificate of appealability under 2253(c)(1). 

9  Justice Kagan asked my opponent how one 

should determine whether a document counts as a 

11 certificate of appealability. The answer is found in 

12 Section 2253(c)(3). "A certificate of appealability 

13 under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue 

14 or issues satisfy the substantial showing requirement" 

in paragraph (c)(2). 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with your 

17 friend that the only fault here was on the part of the 

18 judge and not the Petitioner? 

19  MR. MITCHELL: We agree that the judge is at 

fault. The Petitioner did mention in his application 

21 for a COA his speedy trial claim. So, I don't believe 

22 we can fault Mr. Gonzalez for the way he applied for a 

23 COA. But at the same time, Mr. Chief Justice, 

24 Mr. Gonzalez, if he had the opportunity to qualify for a 

COA under 2253, should have the opportunity to seek a

1 new COA, if this Court were to conclude that (c)(3) is

3  JUSTICE BREYER: But what are -- I mean, 

4 what are we arguing about? It's a -- he should have 

filled in the blank and said there's a Speedy Trial Act 

6 issue, and he didn't. The judge didn't. He should have 

7 done it; he didn't. 

8  MR. MITCHELL: Right. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: So, now I am the court of 

appeals judge, I get this, and I say, oh, my God, he 

11 forgot to fill in the right number; I'll tell you what, 

12 I'll fill it in, and I'll sign my name. Is that legal? 

13  MR. MITCHELL: If the court of appeals judge 

14 does it? 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm a judge in the court of 

16 appeals. I have the case here. I say -- I say: Oh, my 

17 God, I've read the appendix. I don't always read 

18 appendices, but sometimes I do. And I notice that 

19 there's blank here, and it's supposed to say Speedy 

Trial Act. So, I get out my pen, and I say Speedy Trial 

21 Act, SB. I sign it. Okay? Now, is everything okay? 

22  MR. MITCHELL: If he does that before the 

23 court of appeals issues its judgment, we believe that's 

24 permissible under the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, what are we

1 arguing about? Why not just say, look, this is like the 

2 Copyright Act registration requirement? 

3  MR. MITCHELL: Right. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's not 

jurisdictional in the sense that the court has to look 

6 through all these appendices itself to see that 

7 everything is perfect. It's just something you should 

8 do. And if you didn't do it, then in an appropriate 

9 case, the judge could do it himself or waive it or 

whatever makes sense in the circumstance. What's wrong 

11 with that? 

12  MR. MITCHELL: The problem in this case, the 

13 court of appeals did not do that. They entered judgment 

14 without a valid certificate --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose we say -- if 

16 they entered judgment without it, we will assume, nunc 

17 pro tunc, they did it. 

18  MR. MITCHELL: Okay, because Mr. Gonzalez --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: What is the horrible thing 

about that? 

21  MR. MITCHELL: Mr. Gonzalez can't qualify 

22 for a COA under the standards this Court has set forth 

23 in Slack and Miller-El, because his speedy trial claim 

24 encounters an insurmountable procedural obstacle. This 

is precisely the type of case that 2253 and Slack and

2 appellate courts. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mitchell, do you think 

4 the court of appeals could do it nunc pro tunc without 

-- without first making the determination that the trial 

6 judge was supposed to have made? 

7  MR. MITCHELL: A circuit judge can issue a 

8 COA under the statute. So --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: But he would have to make 

the determination required by (c)(1), no? 

11  MR. MITCHELL: He would have to make the 

12 determination, yes. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And --

14  MR. MITCHELL: As I understood the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that wouldn't 

16 necessarily point him just to the Speedy Trial Act. 

17 He'd have to see what other constitutional claims are in 

18 the case, right? 

19  MR. MITCHELL: That's correct. And often 

the courts of appeal will have their own circuit rules 

21 that govern how litigants should seek certificates of 

22 appealability, and there may be a process that the 

23 litigant would have to invoke in order to get one. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: You tell me. This is a 

statute the purpose of which was to speed things up,

3  MR. MITCHELL: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: -- while focusing on issues 

that really do have constitutional issues. Now, 

6 suddenly what's worrying me -- and I don't have the 

7 definite answer -- is if I adopt your interpretation, 

8 this is jurisdictional, I am somehow increasing the 

9 workload of the courts of appeals because they will have 

to have staff people going through to see whether every 

11 i is dotted and every t crossed and they did have all 

12 the right things there, and the pain of doing that is if 

13 you don't do it, then you have to do these things over 

14 again. It will be too late. People will get another 

argument. 

16  MR. MITCHELL: But, at the same time, many 

17 other appeals that should not have been taken will be 

18 cut off at the district court as they should be. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are -- are you 

accepting Justice Scalia's point that the certificate of 

21 appealability doesn't have to jurisdictionally describe 

22 the substantial constitutional issue? 

23  MR. MITCHELL: No, it must describe the 

24 constitutional issue.

2  MR. MITCHELL: No, as I understand 

3 Justice --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're saying that this 


was deficient because, both, it didn't indicate the 


6 issue and because it didn't describe the substantial 

7 constitutional question. 

8  MR. Delaney: Our contention is that a 

9 certificate of appealability must indicate a specific 


constitutional claim under (c)(3) to qualify as a 

11 certificate of appealability under (c)(1). 
12  JUSTICE KAGAN: General Mitchell, but you say 
13 that (c)(2) is not jurisdictional; is that correct? You 
14 say (c)(1) and (c)(3) are, but (c)(2) is not? 

MR. MITCHELL: That's correct. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: And if that's right, why? 
17  MR. MITCHELL: (C)(2) is phrased differently 
18 from (c)(3). (C)(3) describes the essential content of what a 
19 certificate of appealability must contain. (C)(2), by 

contrast, simply says that a certificate of 

21 appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the 
22 applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial 
23 of a constitutional right. It's defining the conditions 
24 under which a COA may issue. A wrongly issued COA is 

not necessarily one that is patently defective so that

1 it no longer deserves the title of certificate of 


2 appealability. 


3  JUSTICE KAGAN: But (c)(3) says "shall 


4 indicate" which specific issues satisfy the showing 


required by (c)(2). It just seems as if all of these 

6 are a little bit of a piece, and, you know, you can stop 

7 it at (1) or you can go on to (2) and (3). But it seems 

8 to me sort of hard to make the jump here and leave (2) 

9 out of it. 

MR. MITCHELL: Well, perhaps analogy from 

11 other areas of appellate jurisdiction -- sometimes a 

12 district court may issue a final judgment for the wrong 

13 party. Perhaps he entered summary judgment, and he 

14 shouldn't. That final judgment may be erroneous, it may 

be wrongly issued, but it doesn't mean it deprives the 

16 appellate court of jurisdiction to review what the 

17 district court did. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we back up and tell 

19 me why which statute we're dealing with, 2253 -- why 

that's jurisdictional if "jurisdiction" means, as we 

21 have said, that class of cases that the court is 

22 competent to hear. So, I look at 2254. That's State 

23 habeas. 

24  MR. MITCHELL: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Federal petition by a

1 State prisoner. And 2255 is a petition by a Federal 


2 prisoner. So, those are the class of cases. The 


3 class of cases are habeas cases, '54 State prisoners, 


4 '55 Federal prisoners. 


MR. MITCHELL: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: 2253, it seems to me, is 

7 a processing rule that applies to both categories.  It 

8 applies to '54, and it applies to '55, but the classes 

9 of cases are identified in '54 and '55. So, I would 

write 2253 as a mandatory processing rule but not -- not 

11 a rule that tells us what class of cases the court is 

12 competent to here. 

13  MR. MITCHELL: Well, 2253(a) reads as though 

14 it's a grant of appellate jurisdiction. It says that in 

either the habeas corpus proceeding or in a 2255, the 

16 final order shall be subject to review on appeal by the 

17 court of appeals. It doesn't mention the word 

18 "jurisdiction," but it's phrased in the way that is --

19 seems as though it's conferring appellate jurisdiction 

in cases where a habeas petition or a 2255 motion 

21 precedes the finality in the district court. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that it doubles as --

23 2254 is jurisdictional; 2255, and then 2253, which tells 

24 how you are to proceed under either one of those, is not 

simply a mandatory how you do it but jurisdictional.

25

Official 

1  MR. MITCHELL: Right, 2253(a) is the 

2 provision that establishes appellate jurisdiction in 

3 habeas cases. And then subsections (b) and (c) narrow 

4 that jurisdictional ground and define the conditions 

under which a litigant cannot take an appeal and in 

6 which cases the courts of appeals cannot exercise 

7 appellate jurisdiction. 

8  This Court also has held in Miller-El that 

9 the issuance of certificate of appealability is a 

jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal. And in 

11 holding that, it relied on a long history of treating 

12 both the COA and the earlier certificate of probable 

13 cause. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The feature of this case 

that I think is very unsettling is there is an issue for 

16 the court of appeals to decide. It's the timeliness 

17 issue. The court of appeals could not decide the speedy 

18 trial. If -- if this case were to fail because the 

19 trial judge didn't identify the speedy trial issue when 

the court of appeals in no way could reach that issue in 

21 this case, isn't that something only a -- a distinction 

22 only a lawyer could love? 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  MR. MITCHELL: Well, we view the purpose of

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you say -- if you say 

6 that -- here's Judge Gaza, and he says: Yes, there's a 

7 statute of limitations question here; it has to be 

8 decided before we get to the speedy trial. But if the 

9 judge felt that the speedy trial issue was not 

meritorious, then why would he grant a certificate of 

11 appealability on the threshold question that you have to 

12 decide before? Because, it seems to me, it would be a 

13 waste of everyone's time if the judge thought that the 

14 speedy trial issue had no merit. 

MR. MITCHELL: He can't grant the COA under 

16 Slack. If the constitutional claim has no merit, 

17 then --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Right, but presume, General 

19 Mitchell, that he thinks that it does, but he just 

forgot to write down "speedy trial." And the question 

21 is: Why that forgetting to write down "speedy trial" 

22 should make a difference here given that, as Justice 

23 Ginsburg said, in any event the court of appeals 

24 couldn't reach it because of the procedural issue that 

it had to reach first?

6 a case where he had a substantial Constitutional claim 


7 and the circuit judge simply forgot to write it down, 


8 the statute requires that the constitutional claim has 


9 to be indicated in writing in the certificate. That 


serves --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm a little 

12 confused, okay? And I think it's what Justice Ginsburg 

13 was trying to get at, and Justice Breyer, which is: 

14 What you are requiring and you're saying the statute 

requires if, is that for the district court to always reach 

16 the merits of any argument presented in a habeas petition, 

17 to figure out whether it's a substantial argument before 

18 it dismisses on a procedural ground. 

19  MR. MITCHELL: He doesn't have to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that seems to be 

21 what you're -- you're wanting to happen because a judge 

22 would have to say: I'm dismissing on a procedural 

23 ground, and I believe that the claim is more than 

24 nonfrivolous, that it has a substantial basis.

ground is the easiest, they go that way. I'm sorry. If

11  MR. MITCHELL: Right. He doesn't have to 

12 decide the merits of the speedy trial claim. He just 

13 needs to take a peek at the constitutional claim and see 

14 if it has some chance of being substantial. And if it 

encounters a procedural bar, as it does in this case, 

16 because Mr. Gonzalez never sought direct review in the 

17 Texas Court of Criminal Appeals --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what do we do then? 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- maybe it's 

a good time -- you're a good bit more than halfway through 

21 your argument. Maybe it's a good time to switch to the 

22 merits. 

23  MR. MITCHELL: Yes. Thanks.

1 which first establishes the date on which the 


2 conviction, the judgment became final as a potential 


3 starting point for the 1-year limitations period and 


4 then establishes two prongs for determining when that 


date of finality occurs. Finality, under the statute, 

6 can occur either at the conclusion of direct review, or 

7 it can occur at the expiration of time for seeking such 

8 review. And the Fifth Circuit correctly held that the 

9 conclusion of direct review prong applies only when the 

habeas applicant pursues direct review to its natural 

11 conclusion, by obtaining either a judgment or a denial 

12 of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United 

13 States. 

14  The expiration of time prong should govern 

all other cases, those in which the habeas applicant 

16 allows the time for seeking direct review to expire 

17 before reaching this Court. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, it seems to me that 

19 Ms. Millett's best argument is an argument just about 

the oddity of what would happen if we adopt your 

21 construction of the statute, which is that the time 

22 begins to run before a habeas petitioner actually can 

23 file a State habeas petition, and whether that's so odd 

24 as to make this a -- a wrong way to construe the 

statute.

Official 

1  MR. MITCHELL: In some cases, that will 

2 happen. There will be habeas petitioners who have 

3 concluded their direct review process, or they've -- in 

4 this case, they've allowed the time to expire. But the 

statute of limitations will start running for Federal 

6 habeas; yet, they won't be able to quite yet go to State 

7 court. But the --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this -- in this very 

9 case, that was so, right? Because the -- the period for 

discretionary review expired in August. 

11  MR. MITCHELL: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the mandate issued on 

13 September -- some date in September. 

14  MR. MITCHELL: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there could be no 

16 State habeas until the mandate issued. So, the days in 

17 between would count against the defendant on the speedy 

18 trial clock, even though he would -- he could not have 

19 filed a State habeas; he could not have stopped the 

clock by filing a State habeas. 

21  MR. MITCHELL: That's correct. And it's 

22 only a 45-day window or so in this particular case. And 

23 in most cases, it should only be a few weeks or months. 

24 No one is going to lose their entire 1-year clock

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens if it 

3 happens? 

4  MR. MITCHELL: Well, if that were to happen, 

then the prisoner should file a protective habeas 

6 petition under Rhines v. Weber. He should file it in 

7 Federal district court and then ask the district judge 

8 to use the stay-and-abeyance procedure that this Court 

9 approved in Rhines, and then wait for his opportunity to 

seek State postconviction review and return to Federal 

11 court --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that make any 

13 sense? Isn't it easier to read it, the statute, the way 

14 your adversary suggests, which would protect both the 

right to direct review and the right to collateral 

16 review? 

17  MR. MITCHELL: Well, the Fifth Circuit has 

18 had this regime now for almost 8 years, since Roberts 

19 was decided. And as far as we know, no habeas 

petitioner has had to file a protective habeas petition. 

21 And even if it occasionally will happen, it's not much 

22 different than what we currently deal with on mixed 

23 petitions, when a habeas petitioner needs to use the 

24 stay-and-abeyance mechanism in Rhines. 

One other point back on jurisdiction. It's

2 vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the 

3 appeal, but the only reason we requested a dismissal of 

4 the appeal is because Mr. Gonzalez should not get a 

certificate of appealability under the standards of 

6 Slack and Miller-El. 

7  If there are other habeas applicants who are 

8 victims of (c)(3) errors committed by circuit judges, 

9 and that error is discovered later in the appellate 

process, the proper remedy should be normally to allow 

11 that habeas applicant to seek a new certificate of 

12 appealability --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why then? I mean, 

14 you can read the statute differently. You can say: I'm 

now the court of appeals judge. I look at it. Lo and 

16 behold, there are two blanks. But on the basis of what 

17 I've read in the briefs and the record, I can say that 

18 the appellant has made a substantial showing of a denial 

19 of a constitutional right. I know the record, and he 

has these things there. And also, I know what they are. 

21 Okay? 

22  So, I fill in the blanks, or the chief judge 

23 of the circuit fills in the blanks with the panel's 

24 approval. Now, the only reason for doing that is that 

it saves everybody a lot of time and that it costs

3  MR. MITCHELL: Because it would also -- Your 

4 Honor's proposal would allow habeas applicants such as 

Mr. Gonzalez to take appeals when the statute precludes 

6 them from taking them. And --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, you're giving the 

8 conclusion. 

9  MR. MITCHELL: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I've just said the statute 

11 doesn't. They can take the appeal, and they're not 

12 going to get anywhere because of this error of the lower 

13 court judge --

14  MR. MITCHELL: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- unless the court of 

16 appeals, having looked at the record a little bit, 

17 discovers that there is a substantial constitutional 

18 question, and they know what it is, and then they fill 

19 in the blanks. 

MR. MITCHELL: That doesn't necessarily --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: And in the language -- it 

22 allows that, I believe, and the purpose would allow it, 

23 for, after all, the purpose is to be more efficient, not 

24 less efficient. And I can't think of any harm that's 

done reading it that way.

1  So, you tell me what is the harm that's

3  MR. MITCHELL: Several harms. One of the 

4 functions of 2253(c) is to protect the habeas applicants 

who have substantial constitutional claims, and avoid 

6 their habeas petitions from being crowded out in a sea 

7 of meritless petitions, all of which can go up on 

8 appeal if circuit judges --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They can't, you 

see, because I'd have to be able to fill in those 

11 blanks, or goodbye. So, it doesn't get any meritless 

12 ones up there. The only ones that come up are merit --

13 merited. 

14  MR. MITCHELL: Well, it would have to be 

both merited and also not encounter an insurmountable 

16 procedural obstacle, which is the problem that plagues 

17 Mr. Gonzalez position here. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh no, if there's an 

19 insurmountable obstacle -- although, as in this case 

perhaps we don't reach the constitutional issue -- there 

21 is one there, so it is appealable, but we say we do not 

22 reach it because there is this impossible procedural 

23 obstacle that here blocks it. 

24  There we have a system that seems more

4  MR. MITCHELL: Well, if States are allowed 

to waive (c)(3), it will open opportunities for 

6 gamesmanship. For example, a State's lawyers could 

7 decide whether to invoke (c)(3) based on the strength of 

8 opposing counsel.

2 people below don't really know what district courts are 

3 granting COAs on? 

4  MS. O'CONNELL: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and do -- circuit 

6 courts don't understand what the issues are somehow by 

7 the opinion below? 

8  MS. O'CONNELL: No. I think that the -- the 

9 court of appeals in this case understood exactly what 

the issue was. In footnote 1 of its opinion, it said 

11 the Petitioner has briefed these four other -- these 

12 four constitutional claims in addition to the procedural 

13 claim that was in the certificate of appealability. A 

14 COA was not granted on any of those issues; so, we don't 

have jurisdiction to consider them. 

16  Nobody has made a determination in this case 

17 that there is a single constitutional issue that could 

18 potentially warrant habeas relief for Petitioner. I 

19 don't think it's a matter of the courts being confused. 

It's a matter of what the -- what the statute is trying 

21 to do is getting everybody to focus up front on why this 

22 case should go forward in the court of appeals. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, if someone on the 

24 court of appeals noticed that, yes, the certificate 

pinpoints the only case -- only question that the panel

Official 

1 can decide at this juncture, but there is a lurking 

2 constitutional question, then isn't 28 U.S.C. 1653 

3 exactly what the panel would do? That is, 1653 says 

4 that defective jurisdictional allegations can be amended 

in the trial or the appellate court. And so, all that 

6 would have had to have happened is very much in line 

7 with Justice Breyer's questions, is the judge on 

8 the panel said, oh, the certificate of appealability 

9 didn't mention the speedy trial issue. So, counsel, 

would you like to amend, or we on our own will amend to 

11 put that question in? 

12  MS. O'CONNELL: That could certainly happen. 

13 There should be a presumption -- if the court of appeals 

14 amended the certificate of appealability, an appeal 

could go forward on that issue. That didn't happen in 

16 this case. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the appeal couldn't 

18 go forward on that issue because that issue hasn't been 

19 decided below. The one thing we know is the speedy 

trial issue -- the case cannot go forward on the speedy 

21 trial issue. Isn't that right? 

22  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, I don't --

23 first of all, I don't think that's right.

1 the district court kicked this case out on a procedural 

2 issue doesn't mean that the court of appeals couldn't 

3 reach the substantive issue if it reversed the 

4 procedural issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How common is it for 


6 courts of appeals to reach substantive issues in the 


7 first instance --


8  Ms. O'CONNELL: Well, it --


9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- when there's no 


decision of the district court? 

11  MS. O'CONNELL: It certainly could send it 

12 back, but if that issue was briefed and if it was 

13 briefed again in the court of appeals, the court of 

14 appeals certainly could decide it. There's no bar to 

the court of appeals deciding --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't -- wouldn't the 

17 most sensible procedure be -- let's forget the 

18 intricacies of 2244 and '53. But you -- you have a case 

19 where there's a statute of limitations question, and 

that has come up for review. Wouldn't the court of 

21 appeals 99 out of 100 times say now the substantive --

22 since we've decided that the case is timely, then it is 

23 district court's function to resolve the substantive 

24 issue? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Even if the court of appeals

25

Official 

1 would normally do that, this Court said in Slack that if 

2 the court of appeal -- or if the district court kicks 

3 the case out on a procedural ground, the certificate of 

4 appealability has to indicate at least that the 

procedural issue is debatable and also that a 

6 constitutional issue in the case is debatable. 

7  Nobody has ever made that determination in 

8 this case. If -- if a court of appeals judge would have 

9 noticed it and reissued a new certificate that certified 

that constitutional question, that would be fine, and 

11 the case could go forward, but if this --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the court of 

13 appeals -- if a court of appeals judge can do that, can 

14 we do that? 

MS. O'CONNELL: This Court could do that. 

16 Section 2253(c)(1) gives circuit justices the authority 

17 to issue amended certificates of appealability. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You read -- you read 

19 that to be any circuit justice or only the circuit 

justice from the circuit in which the case comes from? 

21  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the court has 

22 procedures in place where, like, an application for a 

23 certificate of appealability would normally go to the 

24 circuit justice and then, I suppose, could be referred 

to the Court.

certificate of appealability. That might --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Circuit judge -- or a 

7 circuit judge or judge? 

8  MS. O'CONNELL: A circuit justice or judge. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Right. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: So, I could just sign this 

12 tomorrow and that would moot this case and get rid of 

13 it. 

14  (Laughter.) 

MS. O'CONNELL: I don't think so. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Because Justice 

17 Breyer is not the circuit justice for the Fifth Circuit. 

18  MS. O'CONNELL: Under this Court's 

19 procedures the application, I think, would have to go to 

Justice Scalia --

25

Official 

1 were to issue a certificate of appealability, if the --

2 if the Court determined that there was actually a 

3 debatable constitutional issue in this case, which no 

4 Federal judge has done to this point, I don't think that 

it could still reach the procedural issue that's 

6 presented in the second question. 

7  The court of appeals didn't have 

8 jurisdiction to issue a decision on that -- on that 

9 question. So, the only remedy would be for this Court 

to vacate that opinion and either send it back with an 

11 order to dismiss if it didn't think there was a 

12 debatable constitutional issue, or let the court of 

13 appeals reissue its opinion or redecide the case how it 

14 wants to. 

I don't think the Court should issue a 

16 certificate of appealability in this case. Because it 

17 has to go back anyway, it makes more sense to let the 

18 court of appeals tell us if -- if what they thought is 

19 that there was a debatable constitutional issue here on 

the speedy trial claim. It's not clear at all that they 

21 did think that. Footnote 1 of their opinion says they 

22 -- the Petitioner briefed the speedy trial claim, but we 

23 don't have jurisdiction to consider it. It indicates 

24 that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. --

2 that the speedy trial claim was implicitly included in 

3 the certificate of appealability. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, could I just 

clarify your argument? You disagree with the State of 

6 Texas, isn't that right, because you think (c)(1), 

7 (c)(2), and (c)(3) are all jurisdictional; is that 

8 correct? 

9  MS. O'CONNELL: That's right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I mean, (c)(2) is -- it 

11 appears to make a substantive inquiry jurisdictional, 

12 that in any case a court is going to have to make 

13 this -- is going to have to ask itself whether a 

14 substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 

right has been made, and that would seem to be a very 

16 odd thing to do for jurisdictional purposes. 

17  MS. O'CONNELL: I -- I don't think it is, 

18 Justice Kagan. It's no different than under section 

19 1331. A court would have to take a peek at the merits 

to see if there is a -- a Federal question in the case 

21 before letting it move forward. It's just looking at 

22 what the class of cases is that section 2253(c) --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, in most cases, the 

24 Federal question inquiry is just: Look, I'm looking at 

your complaint. Do you cite a Federal statute? Do you

1 cite a Federal constitutional provision? If so, there's 

2 a Federal question in the case. 

3  What (c)(2) says is, have you made a 

4 substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 

right? That's a very different inquiry. 

6  MS. O'CONNELL: It is, and once a judge 

7 issues a certificate of appealability on that question, 

8 it should be presumed that it's been satisfied. 

9  What we're saying in -- when we say that 

(c)(2) is jurisdictional is that if it becomes --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is it a jurisdictional 

12 rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that 

13 it's been satisfied? That's a sort of odd thing to do 

14 for jurisdictional rules, right? Jurisdictional rules, 

we sua sponte have to look at them, and we have to be 

16 serious about them. 

17  MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. But if a -- if a 

18 district judge or a court of appeals judge has made a 

19 determination that there's a constitutional issue that's 

debatable, going forward that seems to be something that 

21 would be extremely hard to overturn. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: So, if the panel looks at 

23 the merits of the constitutional issue as to which there 

24 is a reference in the certificate of appealability, when 

it -- when it writes its opinion it first has to ask 

53

1 itself, was there a substantial showing? And if there 

2 wasn't, then it will say we'll dismiss this claim. 

3  And then -- but if it says, well, there was 

4 a substantial showing, but it's wrong, then we'll 

affirm. Is that -- is that right? 

6  MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think that could 

7 happen. In most cases, it's not going to be an issue. 

8 If somebody certified that it's debatable, then somebody 

9 has made that showing. If it turns out -- like, for 

example, if there was, if the petitioner had said my 

11 right to testify at trial was violated, they wouldn't 

12 let me testify; and then that issue is certified and 

13 then it turns out when it gets to the merits panel that 

14 he did in fact testify and it was a totally frivolous 

claim, yes, I think that the court of appeals should 

16 dismiss the case at that point for lack of jurisdiction. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Then let's go on to (c)(3), 

18 because (c)(3) seems to be just a documentation 

19 requirement. In other words, let's presume that (c)(2) 

has been satisfied; there was a substantial showing 

21 made; and there is a documentation error and (c) --

22 under (c)(3). Why should that be jurisdictional? A 

23 sort of -- you know, there has been a substantial 

24 showing made. There's a documentation error. It's an 

error that the habeas petitioner has absolutely no

3  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Kagan, I think it's 

4 because we don't actually know that a substantial 


showing has been made until a Federal judge tells us 

6 that. We could -- you know, you could assume that a 
7 substantial showing was made. It's not clear that --
8 that Judge Garza thought that or that any judge on the court of 
9 appeals thought that.

21 Texas -- in Texas -- only about 1 percent file

4 presented because the Petitioner here didn't seek review 

in the highest State court. The situation is not 

6 presented because the Petitioner did not file a cert 

7 petition. 

8  MS. MILLETT: Well, the question is what one 

9 means by the so-called natural conclusion of direct 

review. Now, statistically -- this is a statutory 

11 provision written for State prisoners by Congress, to 

12 address State prisoners; and if the natural thing that 

13 happens in the world is 99 percent do not even seek 

14 review in the State's highest court -- and I'm 

extrapolating from Texas; I don't know all 50 States, 

16 but I have no reason to think that's anomalous. 

17 Ninety-nine percent don't file petitions for 

18 discretionary review. What kind -- why would Congress 

19 have written this statute in a way that's going to 

create a gap, that is going to cause prisoners who 

21 wouldn't otherwise file to now file? Instead of 2,000,

6 3 years, in the 2,000-ish range.  Convictions in the 


7 State, more than 100,000 range. And so --


8  JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying 99 percent of 


9 the -- of the defendants who take an appeal through the 


Texas system don't file a petition with the Texas Court 

11 of Criminal Appeals? Or is it 99 percent of those who 

12 don't do that and then file a Federal habeas petition? 

13 I would imagine it's the former, right? 

14  MS. MILLETT: I'm talking about the former. 

Right. But the point --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 

17  MS. MILLETT: The point is that – the argument 

18 here is -- we are --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Because under Federal habeas 

review, these petitioners are not going to be in good 

21 shape, right? They're going to have their claims 

22 unexhausted or defaulted. 

23  MS. MILLETT: They -- they may or may not. 

24 As we pointed out, in the Kinsey case the Texas court 

of -- the Texas courts have actually entertained a

1 speedy trial claim in -- at both levels. It was raised 

2 on direct review, and then it wasn't, but -- right. It 

3 was also -- they raised in both forums. So, it casts 

4 some doubt on the procedural default argument advanced 

here, but you're right. Of course, there -- there are 

6 issues here, but the question is whether Congress wanted 

7 a gap. 

8  In Johnson v. United States, this Court 

9 construed 2255, I think it was subsection (4) there, the 

one on -- if a conviction is overturned that was used to 

11 enhance. And then when do you -- what is the timing to 

12 come back and file a habeas claim to change your 

13 sentence that relied on a now-vacated prior conviction. 

14  And this Court said we're not going to 

construe this language to create a gap between when 

16 the -- when the finality attaches and when the time that 

17 you can actually file for postconviction review 

18 commences. 

19  The whole point of this, of 2244, was to 

respect State processes. It's not another exhaustion 

21 requirement; it's respect the State. And Texas couldn't 

22 be clearer: In Ex parte Johnson footnote 2, it says the 

23 appeal continues -- sorry, may I finish the sentence? 

24  The appeal continues until the mandate 

issues. Federal law shouldn't change that.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just have a -- I 

2 don't understand the 99 percent figure. That includes 

3 people who entered a plea bargain and presumably gave up 

4 the right to appeal? 

MS. MILLETT: It's 99 percent of -- the 

6 way --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, 99 percent of 

8 the convictions that are entered. So, that would 

9 include all the plea bargains. Those people obviously 

didn't appeal, is what --

11  MS. MILLETT: Some of them did. Mr. Jimenez 

12 was a plea bargain. Some of them do. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Thank you, 

14 counsel; counsel.
