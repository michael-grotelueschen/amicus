 Ms. Anders. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MS. ANDERS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 and may it please the Court:

 Section 145 of the Patent Act permits a 

11 person who has sought a patent from the PTO and believes 

12 that the agency has wrongly denied his application to 

13 seek judicial review of that decision in district court. 

14 The Federal Circuit in this case held that the plaintiff 

in a section 145 action may obtain a more favorable 

16 standard of review, de novo review, by flouting the 

17 PTO's rules during the examination process. 

18  Under the court's approach, a plaintiff may 

19 present to the court material new evidence that he 

refused or failed without cause to present to the PTO. 

21 And as his reward, he is given de novo review of the 

22 PTO's expert determinations on all of the relevant 

23 issues. 

24  For three reasons, that unprecedented regime 

should not be allowed to stand: First, principles of

Official 

1 administrative deference and exhaustion require that the 

2 PTO be given the opportunity to apply its expert 

3 judgment to all of the reasonably available evidence. 

4 For that reason, section 145 should be interpreted as a 

safety valve proceeding that permits applicants to
 

6 introduce evidence to the court that they reasonably
 

7 could not have presented to the PTO.
 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you only get a 145
 

9 proceeding when you have new evidence?


 MS. ANDERS: No. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I have no new 

12 evidence and -- and I want to challenge. Can I bring a 

13 145? 

14  MS. ANDERS: Yes, section 145 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

16  MS. ANDERS: -- permits any applicant 

17 dissatisfied with a decision of the PTO --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: And on what basis does the 

19 court decide the case? De novo?

 MS. ANDERS: No, the Federal Circuit has 

21 held that in those cases substantial evidence review 

22 applies, and where the Federal Circuit gets that is this 

23 Court's case in Morgan v. Daniels. That was an action 

24 under section 145's predecessor. There was no new 

evidence in that case, and the Court held that this was 

4

25

Official 

1 a proceeding in the nature of a suit to set aside a 

2 judgment, the judgment of the expert agency which had 

3 made this determination, and that, therefore, because 

4 this was administrative review, a deferential standard 

of review should apply. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

7  MS. ANDERS: So, it's quite clear that 

8 when --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: How close a predecessor is 

the predecessor? 

11  MS. ANDERS: All of the material language is 

12 -- is the same. There's -- there's no material 

13 difference for purposes of this case. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Morgan case 

involved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the 

16 would-be patent holder; it was an interference 

17 proceeding, wasn't it? 

18  MS. ANDERS: That's correct, Justice 

19 Ginsburg. It was an interference proceeding, and that's 

because, at the time, section 145's predecessor applied 

21 equally to interferences and to ex parte patent denials. 

22 But the Court's reasoning, its discussion of -- of the 

23 predecessor statute, did not distinguish based on the 

24 fact that this was an interference. And also this 

Court --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that -- it's 

2 interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its 

3 companion cases, not companion in the sense of being 

4 heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- Radio 

City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of 

6 today. They don't talk about deference. They don't 

7 talk about substantial evidence. They talk about 

8 whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that 

9 their factfindings based on their expertise have to be 

overcome with some convincing evidence. 

11  So, they're talking in different language, 

12 but the concept they're talking about is one where the 

13 court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters 

14 that involve their expertise and give them weight, 

substantial weight, essentially, and only overturn it if 

16 the court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, 

17 "thoroughly convinced" that they were wrong. 

18  So, what's wrong with that standard? 

19 Everybody likes the deference language of today, but 

they were very clear in what they were saying: If the 

21 PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was 

22 based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change 

23 it, court, unless you're thoroughly convinced they were 

24 wrong.

 Is there anything wrong with that? With

Official 

1 that articulation of what the standard should be in all 

2 situations, whether there's new evidence or no new 

3 evidence? 

4  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think here we are 

suggesting that in -- in 145 actions, when there is new 

6 evidence, the -- Morgan's "thorough conviction" standard 

7 should apply. And that reflects the fact that the court 

8 needs to look at the new evidence, but because the PTO 

9 has made an expert determination, as the Court said in 

Morgan, that determination should not be overturned 

11 unless there's a high degree of certainty. 

12  And I would note that that is essentially 

13 what this Court did just last term in Microsoft v. i4i. 

14 There the Court said that when a third party is 

challenging the validity of a granted patent, that the 

16 third party should have to show invalidity based on a 

17 heightened burden of proof, clear and convincing 

18 evidence. And that reflects the same wisdom that --

19 that underlies --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let me tell 

21 you what my problem is with this case. It is the issue 

22 that Verizon raised and the lack of connection between 

23 the district court's holding and the circuit court's 

24 holding. The district court excluded the affidavit for 

the proposed arguments on the basis of them being new 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 arguments that Board rules precluded them from raising 

2 at the stage they did. The circuit court described the 

3 affidavit as new evidence. And the Verizon amicus brief 

4 says: Court, be careful, because it's not really clear 

what's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new
 

6 argument.
 

7  And that question troubles me, for the
 

8 following reason: Verizon posits that the issue of
 

9 whether a description is specific enough is a legal
 

question to which the PTO is not entitled to deference. 

11 Why, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board 

12 precedent, is that right? And can you explain why this 

13 affidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and 

14 not merely new argument?

 MS. ANDERS: Certainly, Justice Sotomayor. 

16  I think the district court did characterize 

17 this as new evidence, and the reason it did that was 

18 because Mr. Hyatt made a concerted strategic decision 

19 here to present his affidavit as new evidence. In form, 

this is -- this is factual evidence. This is a 

21 declaration containing proffered testimony that Mr. 

22 Hyatt would offer if there were a trial. So, it is in 

23 form factual evidence, and in order to take advantage of 

24 the possibility of introducing new evidence in the 

section 145 action, Mr. Hyatt argued that this was 

8

Official 

1 new factual evidence that should --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

3 -- other than that it's in the form of an affidavit, 

4 tell me what in the content was new evidence? I want to 

get away from the labels, and I want to get to the 

6 substance because I've looked at all of these 

7 submissions, and it sounds like what I read in briefs 

8 every day. 

9  MS. ANDERS: Certainly. I think whether or 

not the -- the ultimate question of whether the written 

11 description is sufficient is a question of law. It 

12 would be one that rests on several subsidiary 

13 factfindings, including what the ordinary skill in the 

14 art is, what a person of ordinary skill in the art would 

understand when he reads the specification, and where in 

16 the specification there is support, there is description 

17 support, for the claims that shows that Mr. Hyatt 

18 possessed the invention that he claimed. 

19  And so, I think when you look at what 

happened at the PTO, the examiner said: Despite my 

21 expertise, I can't tell where in the specification your 

22 claims are supported. This is at 258 -- it's a 250-page 

23 specification reprinted in the joint appendix. It has 

24 over 100 pages of diagrams, source code, and 117 claims. 

And so, the PTO asked for this information; Mr. Hyatt 

9

Official 

1 refused to present it or he didn't present it, and then, 

2 on rehearing, the Board said that he had not had any 

3 cause not to present this new -- this new argument. And 

4 so, at that point, Mr. Hyatt went into the 145 

proceeding, and he was -- he characterized this as 

6 factual evidence in order to get around, presumably, or 

7 it would be reasonable to try to get around, the Board's 

8 ruling that he couldn't present new evidence. 

9  Now, you certainly could characterize this 

as legal argument. We believe that we would win on that 

11 ground as well, even if this were new argument, because 

12 certainly the PTO is entitled to enforce its rules here, 

13 and both the district court and the panel found that the 

14 PTO did not abuse its discretion in -- in holding that 

Mr. Hyatt had forfeited his right to raise this 

16 argument. But that's not -- that's not an additional 

17 question presented that we -- that we added here because 

18 it's a very case-specific question. 

19  But at any rate, the -- the entire case has 

now been litigated on the basis of this being factual 

21 evidence --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your case is stronger if it 

23 isn't new facts, right? That's what you'd say. 

24  MS. ANDERS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your case is stronger if in

1 fact it's only new argument and not new fact. 

2  MS. ANDERS: Certainly. I think it should 

3 be very clear that we would win on that ground. The en 

4 banc court here characterized this as new factual 

evidence and applied a rule that will -- will govern, if 

6 it's left to stand, in all 145 actions, which would 

7 permit applicants to withhold evidence from the PTO. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, one of the 

9 problems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very 

strange to have two proceedings, one where you go 

11 directly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and 

12 then this other one where you go to the district court, 

13 where if that's not, as Judge Newman said, a whole new 

14 -- whole new game, then why would Congress create two 

judicial review routes, one in the district court 

16 reviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in 

17 the Federal Circuit, if there's no difference? That is, 

18 if in both of them, it's not de novo review; it is 

19 reviewing what the -- what the agency did under the 

ordinary standard for reviewing agency action. 

21  What's different about the -- the 145 

22 proceeding? 

23  MS. ANDERS: Well, in the 145 proceeding, 

24 the applicant has the ability to introduce new evidence 

that couldn't be presented to the PTO. And I think --

11

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: But what kind of evidence is 

2 that, Ms. Anders? 

3  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think there are two 

4 primary categories, both of which can be very important 

in the examination proceedings. The first is oral 

6 testimony. The PTO doesn't hear oral testimony, but it 

7 is routine in the examination procedures for --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, in the 145, an applicant 

9 can take all his written affidavits and say: I want to 

present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but 

11 live. 

12  MS. ANDERS: He could -- he could certainly 

13 bring that to the district court, yes. Now, the 

14 district court always, under general evidentiary rules, 

can say: I believe this evidence is cumulative; so, I'm 

16 not going to hear it. 

17  But to the extent that the district court 

18 believes it would be helpful to hear oral testimony, for 

19 instance, if the PTO's determinations involve 

credibility decisions, then certainly the district court 

21 could hear that testimony, and that's often how these 

22 proceedings have been used. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: But to the extent the 

24 substance of that testimony was something that he could 

have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view,

Official 

1 would be out of bounds. 

2  MS. ANDERS: There would have to be a 

3 reasonable justification for not having presented it --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: There has to be a 

reasonable -- some kind of justification. Can you work 

6 with the word "equitable"? I mean, this was an 

7 equitable action, and could you say that the -- to the 

8 district court, well, of course, you -- assuming you'd 

9 win on the second question. But on the first question, 

this is not an on/off thing. That's your real objection 

11 to the de novo standard. 

12  You say: But these are equitable actions, 

13 and generally an individual should not be allowed to run 

14 around the PTO. So, you better have some kind of 

reason, but leave it up to the -- to the district courts 

16 to work with that word "equitable" and to -- it seems to 

17 me there will be a lot of shading cases here where you 

18 can't quite tell if it is new or isn't new and some 

19 parts are and some aren't. But just leave it up to the 

district court and say: Take into account the fact that 

21 people should not be allowed to run around the PTO and 

22 work equity. That's kicking the ball back. 

23  Now, if you like that, let me know. If you 

24 don't like it, tell me what we -- why -- what should 

we -- you want an absolute rule? Tell me why.

15

20

25

Official 

1  MS. ANDERS: Well, the standard we're 

2 proposing is that the district court has discretion to 

3 determine whether there was reasonable cause not to 

4 present the evidence to the PTO.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And if it says there isn't, 

6 then it can't hear it? I mean, imagine you're sitting 

7 there as a district judge, you think: Oh, my God, they 

8 should have presented it, but this is the key matter 

9 forever. Do I really pay no attention to it at all?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think it's no different 

11 from exhaustion or forfeiture rules in any other 

12 context --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Except you have a history 

14 here.

 MS. ANDERS: The Board applicant has the --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: You have the history of the 

17 pre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the 

18 evidence in. 

19  MS. ANDERS: Well, certainly in the early 

cases, they took new evidence in. But by 1952, which is 

21 when Congress re-enacted this provision, you have the 

22 lower courts applying the Morgan standard and saying: 

23 Based on Morgan's reasoning, because we know that the 

24 PTO is the primary factfinder, because we know their 

decision is so important, we will apply limitations on 

14

20

25

Official 

1 new evidence because we don't think that that
 

2 evidence --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: But then you really do go
 

4 back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your
 

understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable 

6 opportunity to present -- I mean, it's very, very 

7 narrow. It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that 

8 nobody would want to present and no judge would want to 

9 hear. And other than that, you're basically saying in 

all circumstances, well, they could have done that in 

11 the PTO. So, then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem, 

12 which is these are two channels that are exactly the 

13 same. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you were beginning to 

answer that by saying, well, you can't have oral 

16 testimony before the PTO. But what else? I asked you 

17 what would be -- what's different about 141 and 145 on 

18 your view. And you said one thing is oral testimony. 

19 What else?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, the other primary 

21 category of evidence that could come in would be 

22 evidence that has a temporal component. If there's a 

23 lot of evidence that could be relevant to patentability 

24 that develops only slowly or that might arise very late 

in the process. So, for instance, obviousness is a --

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 is a very common ground of rejection. But one thing 

2 that can be relevant to obviousness is if the invention, 

3 once disclosed, has commercial success. So, this type 

4 of sales evidence can -- can develop very late in --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought that your 

6 brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of 

7 evidence, a person can go back to the PTO. Is that 

8 right? 

9  MS. ANDERS: For the most part, the record 

closes once the -- once the applicant files his brief on 

11 appeal to the Board. And then it can be months or years 

12 before the Board issues its decision. 

13  Now, there are -- there are a couple of 

14 avenues through which an applicant could still introduce 

new evidence even when the Board is considering the 

16 appeal. But both of those, as the process goes --

17 that's the request for continuing examination and the 

18 continuation application. Both of those have increasing 

19 down sides that require the applicant to abandon his 

appeal or give up some of his patent -- the patent term 

21 that he would presumably get. So --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if 

23 the new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling? 

24 The PTO says: Look, we're not -- we're not going to 

issue a patent because you didn't show us that, you 

16

25

Official 

1 know, the valve in the back of the thing or whatever 

2 was -- was novel, and we think that's important. So --

3 and the applicant goes to, under 145, to the district 

4 court and said: Well, I didn't submit that evidence 

because I didn't have any idea that that was going to be 

6 a significant issue, and I'm -- you know, I'm sorry, 

7 but, you know, I have a good basis for not thinking of 

8 that, and here it is. 

9  Is that the type of new evidence that could 

be admitted? 

11  MS. ANDERS: Well, in the first instance, 

12 the PTO's procedures actually provide -- they actually 

13 provide for this situation, and that's when the Board or 

14 the examiner enters a new ground of rejection. Then, at 

that point, the applicant has the right to reopen 

16 prosecution that -- introduce new evidence --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this is an 

18 exception? I thought you were telling us earlier you 

19 generally can't get --

MS. ANDERS: Right. Yes. I'm sorry. This 

21 is -- this is an exception --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh. 

23  MS. ANDERS: -- that would apply when 

24 there's a new ground of decision. That is something 

that Mr. Hyatt could have tried to take advantage of.

1 He -- he didn't. He simply sought rehearing. But in 

2 any event, both the district court -- the district court 

3 carefully considered the Board's grounds of rejection 

4 and decided that this wasn't -- that these weren't new 

grounds of rejection, and the panel affirmed that. 

6  But to get back to the difference between 

7 141 and 145, I think Congress separated these two 

8 proceedings out in 1927. Before that, you had gotten an 

9 appeal first on the record and then -- and then the bill 

in equity under 145. So, Congress separated this in 

11 1927, and it appears from the legislative history that 

12 it's concerned with streamlining the proceeding and 

13 having more efficiency in -- in patent appeals. 

14  So, it would be reasonable to conclude that 

there would be some number of applicants who -- probably 

16 the majority of applicants, who wouldn't have new 

17 evidence, who could go to 141 and simply get a final 

18 decision from a court after one court proceeding in the 

19 court of appeals.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What evidence --

21  MS. ANDERS: But --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, please, continue. 

23  MS. ANDERS: Simply that there are -- for 

24 some number of other applicants, it was important to 

provide a safety valve because the PTO couldn't consider 

18

Official 

1 oral testimony and because certainly, at the time, oral 

2 testimony was a major concern in interference 

3 proceedings, where you'd often have two inventors saying 

4 I invented it first; no, I invented it first.  And you'd 

have this credibility fight. So, it was very important 

6 at the time to provide a safety valve proceeding for 

7 those applicants. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said that you 

9 could -- you could go into court on 145 even if you had 

no new evidence. 

11  MS. ANDERS: Yes, and Morgan, in fact, was a 

12 case like that. It appears some applicants may have 

13 done that, but --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you do -- in that 

case, would there be any difference between 141 and 145 

16 other than you go to a different court? 

17  MS. ANDERS: No, I don't think there would 

18 be for an applicant who had no new evidence at that 

19 time. But I think the -- the other alternative, to 

treat 145 as an entirely de novo proceeding that allows 

21 any new evidence that the applicant failed without cause 

22 to present to the PTO, thereby obtaining de novo review, 

23 it's -- there's no evident policy justification for 

24 Congress to provide it.

2 middle position. Often, in trial court evidence 

3 problems, the judge says, well, it goes to its weight, 

4 not the admissibility. And it seems to me that's what 

Judge -- the en banc majority was saying, that the fact 

6 that it was not presented before or that it points in a 

7 different direction from what the PTO found goes to its 

8 weight, not its admissibility. In other words, they 

9 will give consideration to the fact that it wasn't 

introduced and -- and maybe discount it as a result, 

11 unless there's a reason. So, it just depends on the 

12 facts of the case. 

13  Number one, am I reading or am I summarizing 

14 the en banc majority correctly? And, number two, why 

isn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so, 

16 as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning 

17 to 145? It's -- it performs a function that 141 does 

18 not. 

19  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think you're correct, 

Justice Kennedy, that -- that the en banc court believed 

21 that administrative deference principles didn't weigh 

22 against its conclusions because the district court could 

23 give more weight to the new evidence. 

24  But that is not an adequate response, we 

don't think, because this is still de novo review. So,

1 once the applicant introduces new evidence, the manner 

2 in which the district court evaluates the PTO's 

3 conclusions has entirely changed. This is no longer a 

4 deferential standard looking at the evidence. This is 

actually a de novo review, with no deference given to 

6 any of the PTO's factfindings, even on the evidence 

7 before it. And we don't think that's a sensible way to 

8 read the statute because there's no basis in the text of 

9 the statute for a bifurcated standard that would provide 

for deferential "thorough conviction" review when 

11 there's no new evidence, but then de novo --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then -- then you're 

13 saying that we -- that we should choose either between 

14 your position or Judge Newman's position.

 MS. ANDERS: Well, Judge Newman's position I 

16 think is inconsistent with Morgan, because Morgan was a 

17 section -- Revised Statute 4915 action. It was a 145 

18 action with no new evidence. And the Court there said 

19 that the "thorough conviction" standard should apply 

because this was administrative review. So, to hold 

21 that 145 requires de novo review even when there's no 

22 new evidence would be to overrule Morgan. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure why --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But Morgan only talked about 

the standard of review; isn't that right? Morgan has

1 very little to say about what types of evidence ought to 

2 be admitted in this proceeding. And one thing we could 

3 do is to separate out these two things and say, you 

4 know, we think that there's a basis for one, for, let's 

say, giving the government a fairly deferential standard 

6 of review -- call it clear and convincing, call it 

7 thorough conviction -- but go the other way, rule 

8 against you, on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says 

9 nothing about.

 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think Morgan did not 

11 directly address this -- the admissibility of new 

12 evidence, but by saying that the PTO is the primary 

13 decisionmaker and that the court should not lightly set 

14 aside what the PTO does, it invoked administrative 

deference principles, which in turn show why all of the 

16 reasonably available evidence needs to be presented to 

17 the agency. 

18  And -- I do think that it -- it wouldn't 

19 make sense to have a de novo standard of review for 

patent denials any time new evidence comes in, largely 

21 based on this Court's decision in Microsoft. There, the 

22 Court rejected the argument that a third party who had 

23 no opportunity to present evidence to the PTO should not 

24 be held to as high a standard of review. So, it would 

be particularly perverse here to say that de novo review

1 should apply whenever a patent applicant puts in any new 

2 evidence that --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't know that 

4 that -- I think you're confusing the nature of the 

review, which is de novo, new, with the -- the burdens 

6 that attach to the proof. Those are two different 

7 concepts. And so, that's what Microsoft said. Don't 

8 confuse burdens with standards of review. That it's de 

9 novo review is one thing, but even in de novo review, we 

often give more weight or presumptive weight to some 

11 facts as opposed to others. And that's what I think 

12 Morgan was talking about. Morgan was very clear: 

13 Whether it was new evidence or not, you give -- you 

14 accept as valid whatever the PTO does, and you require 

to be thoroughly convinced by new evidence or not that 

16 they were wrong. 

17  I don't know why that standard can't apply 

18 in any situation. I think that's what Judge Newman 

19 intended, although he didn't say that.

 So, why are we confusing the standard of 

21 review with the burden? 

22  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think that the 

23 presumption of validity and the need to give deference 

24 to the PTO's determinations are essentially two ways 

of -- of saying the same thing. As Microsoft noted, the 

23

1 presumption of -- of validity comes from the assumption 

2 that the agency is presumed to do its job. That's what 

3 Judge Rich said. And that in turn is what the Court 

4 said in RCA, where it announced the presumption of 

validity, and there it relied on Morgan. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have two problems with 

7 your argument. The first is -- and I know that it may 

8 be unique to me because many of my colleagues say that 

9 you don't rely on legislative history, but I'm not 

relying just on legislative history. I'm relying that 

11 the legislative history is replete with the commissioner 

12 of patents himself saying that section 145 required de 

13 novo review. And witness after witness tried to argue 

14 for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that 

it required de novo review. 

16  Second, our cases repeatedly describe it as 

17 de novo review. So, you got to get past that. 

18  And then you got to get past that between 

19 1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side. But there 

are plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and 

21 a very respected jurist, Learned Hand, saying that if 

22 you exclude new evidence, it should only be if it's on 

23 principles of estoppel, that someone intentionally 

24 withheld evidence from the PTO.

 So, how do you deal with a record that 

24

Official 

1 doesn't basic -- that doesn't support your basic 

2 argument? 

3  MS. ANDERS: I think the record does support 

4 our argument, Justice Sotomayor, because what you see in 

the early 20th century after Morgan had construed this 

6 as administrative review -- you referred to the 1927 

7 hearings. There, I think many of the people used the 

8 phrase "de novo" in a very loose way that probably was a 

9 result of its dating before the APA. They referred to 

it mostly as -- as a contrast between the original 

11 action and the appeal. And that's the same thing you 

12 see in the early cases. For instance, Globe-Union 

13 referred to this as a de novo proceeding, even as it 

14 said that the thorough conviction standard should apply 

and new evidence should be limited because this was 

16 administrative. So, I don't think you can place very 

17 much weight on the use of the term "de novo." 

18  I do think it's notable that every time 

19 there was an objection in the cases before 1952, the 

courts applied limitations on new evidence. Dowling, 

21 the case you referred to -- that was -- that was dicta; 

22 the court discussed the standard but didn't actually 

23 apply it there. And so, I think the most natural 

24 inference is that in 1952, Congress looked to Morgan and 

it looked to these cases, and it viewed this as an

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

7  MR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

8 please the Court: 

9  The language of section 145, the structure 

of the judicial review provisions in the Patent Act, the 

11 long history of the provision, and this Court's 

12 constructions of its predecessors all make clear that 

13 the Government's argument that a plaintiff is barred 

14 from introducing new evidence in an action under section 

145, except in the unusual if not extraordinary 

16 circumstance where the applicant had no opportunity to 

17 introduce the substance of that evidence, is incorrect. 

18  Section 145 does not follow the modern norm 

19 of on-the-record review. Such review is afforded under 

sections 141 to 144. And no principle of administrative 

21 law supports the Government's "no opportunity" standard 

22 in situations where Congress has authorized a trial de 

23 novo to obtain relief from adverse agency action. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem I have 

with your submission: You say there are basically two 

26

1 routes to get review of a denial by the Patent Office. 

2 The first is, under 141, you appeal to the Federal 

3 Circuit, right, and in that situation, you're limited to 

4 the record before the agency --

MR. PANNER: Yes, Your Honor. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- on which you 

7 lost. And there's deference to the agency, which ruled 

8 against you. 

9  Under 145, you can add new evidence, you 

could address questions that the PTO raised, saying you 

11 don't -- you haven't dealt with this valve in the back, 

12 and you could say, well, here's new evidence dealing 

13 with that. There's no deference to the agency, and to 

14 some extent you can pick which judge you want to hear, 

to the extent you can -- can do that. 

16  Why would anybody proceed under section 141 

17 instead of 145? 

18  MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, to be clear 

19 about what is permitted under section 145, it is correct 

that new evidence can be permitted to go to issues that 

21 have been properly ruled on by the PTO in the course of 

22 ruling on the ex parte application. 

23  The reason that appeals to the -- to the 

24 Federal Circuit are quite common is because often the 

issue that is the basis for the rejection is a legal

1 issue. And as to those issues, there's de novo review 

2 in the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit will be 

3 ruling on those legal issues in time in any event. It 

4 is really in the circumstance where there is a factual 

question as to which new evidence is relevant, where the 

6 applicant will avail himself of what --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, that in -- in 

8 every case where it's anything other than a purely legal 

9 issue, you would go under 145?

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, if you had 

11 evidence that you wanted to present, and the remedies at 

12 the PTO were inadequate for one reason or another. But 

13 in thinking about the practical implications of the 

14 procedural option that section 145 affords, it's 

important to recognize that this procedure has been in 

16 place for generations, and it has been understood by the 

17 patent bar as reflected in decisions of the --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know. 

19 That's why I'm -- I'm really confused, because I take it 

that people don't often use 145, right? They almost 

21 always appeal to the Federal Circuit. 

22  MR. PANNER: Well, I think that the number 

23 of cases involving rejections that are taken up into 

24 court are somewhat limited, in part because applicants 

often have an adequate remedy before the PTO. But where

1 there is a circumstance where there has been a final --

2 a Board action, a case like this one, where the --

4 grounds, because the grounds of written description had 

been identified in the examiner's decision, but where 

6 the reasoning that justified the rejection was quite new 

7 in the decision of the Board and where there were --

8 there was factual evidence that the applicant wanted to 

9 submit to a generalist district court to permit the 

district court to understand where in the specification 

11 the support for these elements --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Ms. --

13 Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the 

14 PTO that lets you deal with these -- that sort of 

something came up that you didn't think about, and you 

16 can address that. 

17  MR. PANNER: Your Honor, what -- what 

18 Ms. Anders was referring to, I believe, is the 

19 possibility to reopen where there are new grounds for a 

rejection. There were no new grounds here because it 

21 was still a written description rejection. The 

22 applicant did argue in -- in filing for rehearing that 

23 the explanation that the Board had provided was one that 

24 he had not been able to discern from the examination --

the examiner's rejection.

1  And if you just look at the record in this 

2 case, when the examiner said that there was support 

3 lacking for the features that were -- where the Board 

4 eventually did -- did affirm, there is no explanation as 

to what element was missing, why the -- why the feature 

6 was not supported in the specification. The Board 

7 provided that reasoned explanation, and the applicant 

8 tried to respond, and the Board refused to -- to accept 

9 it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think -- in terms of 

11 the second question on the standard of review, I'm 

12 somewhat -- I'd like your response to the approach, that 

13 where there's ambiguity -- I mean, you're going to win 

14 if there's no ambiguity. But if there's ambiguity, I 

think that 1946 makes a difference. That is, preceding 

16 that time, every agency went its own way, and you had 

17 dozens of specialized methods of review. And the whole 

18 purpose of 50 years of administrative law has been to 

19 try to create uniformity across agencies in a vast 

Federal Government. 

21  And now, what was obviously worrying me in 

22 the first case and this case, too --

23  MR. PANNER: Yes, Your Honor. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that we're chipping 

away at that, and that will be very hard for lawyers and

1 for ordinary people to understand if we suddenly go back 

2 and create specialized rules in favor of each agency 

3 that always wants a specialized rule, of course; they 

4 think what they do is terribly important, which it is, 

I'm sure.
 

6  But that's -- that's why I'm saying if
 

7 ambiguity on the standard of review, you go with
 

8 uniformity.
 

9  MR. PANNER: Right. Well, there's really
 

two points, Your Honor: With respect to standard of 

11 review, which is separate from the question of the 

12 admissibility of the evidence -- on standard of review, 

13 the APA says that where there's a trial de novo, the 

14 standard is whether the finding is unwarranted by the 

facts under (2)(F). So --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that begs the 

17 question in a sense because they're interlinked. I 

18 mean, the same reasons would support that it's not a 

19 trial de novo even if you introduce some new evidence.

 MR. PANNER: Well, I think that --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: It is a -- it is an old 

22 trial with some new evidence, and there will be a 

23 thousand different variations on that theme. 

24  MR. PANNER: I think that goes to Justice 

Sotomayor's point really, which is that there is a trial 

31

Official 

1 de novo, and clearly at a minimum what the courts are 

2 talking about when they refer to this, not 5 times, not 

3 10 times, but dozens of times, this Court several times, 

4 lower courts pervasively, when they are talking about a 

de novo proceeding, they're talking about the fact that 

6 the applicant can introduce new evidence to attempt to 

7 overcome the adverse action that was -- was entered by 

8 the agency. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, the new 

part -- I get that. 

11  MR. PANNER: Okay. And then the question 

12 becomes, what is the appropriate standard of review when 

13 there is new evidence going to this question? And the 

14 answer here goes I think to -- section (2)(F) says that 

there's a -- the question is whether it's warranted by 

16 the facts. There is then the question of what weight 

17 may be afforded to a particular agency -- agency 

18 determination. At a minimum, the fact that there has 

19 been a rejection shifts the burden. When an applicant 

goes to the PTO, there's an assumption of an entitlement 

21 to patent, unless the PTO can show that the applicant is 

22 not entitled to that patent. So, the burden is on the 

23 PTO. 

24  Once there has been a proper rejection by 

the agency and the Board has ruled, then the applicant 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 bears the burden. So, at a minimum, there has been a 

2 shifting. And the applicant would then bear the burden. 

3 And as a practical matter, as the Federal Circuit 

4 indicated, the district judge will weigh the evidence 

before it, including the new evidence and the findings 

6 by the agency, in making its determination as to whether 

7 the applicant has carried -- carried his burden to show 

8 that he's entitled to the patent. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the judge does that, 

what -- how does he articulate the weight that he gives 

11 to what the PTO find? Does he say I give deference to 

12 this? I give substantial deference? This was all 

13 discussed -- page 9 of your brief, you summarized what 

14 the majority opinion of the en banc court did.

 MR. PANNER: Yes, Your Honor. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in that connection, on 

17 this same line, do you -- do you agree with that 

18 summary? 

19  MR. PANNER: I do, Your Honor. That is to 

say that what the Federal circuit recognized is that in 

21 determining the weight to give to new evidence and 

22 determining what weight to give to the determined --

23 prior determination of the agency, it's appropriate for 

24 the district court to look at the circumstances of the 

new evidence. And one of the things that's -- this is

3  In Microsoft, there was obviously concern by 

4 this Court that there not be shifting standards of proof 

that would be confusing to a jury and could lead to 

6 collateral litigation about that. Where a district 

7 judge is making a determination about a factual issue, 

8 the district judge can as a practical matter quite 

9 reasonably determine what was before the Board, what did 

the Board decide, what was the basis for that, how 

11 strongly supported is it, versus how -- how -- to what 

12 extent is this new evidence something that really 

13 requires me to look at this anew. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in line with 

Justice Breyer's question, can you give us an example of 

16 some other agency review proceeding that is somewhat 

17 like this, or is this just unique? 

18  MR. PANNER: I don't think it's entirely 

19 unique at all, Your Honor. That is to say, for example, 

in proceedings where there's orders to pay money by the 

21 FCC, the findings of the agency are given prima facie 

22 weight in an action -- in an enforcement action. And 

23 so, new evidence is permitted, and the district judge 

24 would make a determination based on the record and the 

new evidence. But the party or the agency seeking to

2 factual findings to -- as prima facie evidence where, if 

3 there was no contrary evidence, it would actually 

4 establish those facts.

 There are other administrative review 

6 schemes that do afford trial de novo in which the -- you 

7 know, there may be more or less deference to whatever 

8 the agency did depending on -- on what the record may 

9 reflect about the considered judgment of the agency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there limits on the 

11 new evidence that can be produced? Are there any 

12 limits, in your view? 

13  MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

14 the principle of estoppel that was recognized in Barrett 

is not one that we're -- we're challenging. That is to 

16 say, in a circumstance in which an applicant -- and, of 

17 course, that was an interference proceeding, and it's 

18 perhaps easier to foresee this happening in an 

19 interference context, but in that case, the plaintiff 

had actually suppressed, had directed witnesses not to 

21 answer questions that went into a particular factual 

22 area and then, when -- after appeal and when the 

23 district court action was brought, attempted to 

24 introduce the very evidence that he had -- that the 

applicant had deliberately suppressed. And the district

3 principle that --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, if you're 

willing to accept that, then what about broadening that 

6 to prevent people from running around the PTO, and 

7 simply saying unless the -- unless the person, the 

8 potential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has 

9 shown he can show that he's innocent, that is to say it 

wasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part 

11 of a trial -- of a strategy, unless he shows he was 

12 totally without sin in some form of words in not 

13 introducing the evidence the first time, he can't 

14 introduce it now?

 MR. PANNER: I think the difficulty with 

16 that, Your Honor, is not only is it inconsistent with 

17 the practice of the courts, which have always recognized 

18 that, but it also ignores the fact that there needs to 

19 be decisions that an applicant makes about what evidence 

to present to the PTO. And there may be good cause for 

21 not presenting evidence in the PTO that becomes quite 

22 relevant once --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, say that. Say unless 

24 he can show that there was good cause for his not having 

introduced it before the PTO, he -- the -- the court now

2  MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, we would --

3 we would certainly meet that good cause standard in this 

4 case, but the thing that I think is difficult about that 

standard is that it could potentially lead to all sorts 

6 of collateral litigation. In a typical case, for 

7 example, an applicant will seek to introduce new expert 

8 testimony that either was not or was -- is additional to 

9 whatever was at issue -- was offered in the PTO. Often, 

expert testimony will not be offered at all in an ex 

11 parte application. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, give us a standard 

13 and how is what -- the good cause that you're somehow 

14 willing to accept different from the Government's 

reasonable cause standard? And equity seems to have 

16 required an intentional or bad faith withholding. Is 

17 that what you want to limit yourself to? What do you do 

18 with sort of the in between? The intentional and the 

19 grossly negligent.

 MR. PANNER: Justice Sotomayor, to be clear, 

21 the proper standard is -- does not permit exclusion of 

22 evidence because there was good cause to present it and 

23 it was not. 

24  The standard for -- which we think is 

supported in the cases is one that would permit the

administrative review contexts, would be -- would be 

6 applicable and could lead to the exclusion of evidence. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what do you see the 

8 limits of that estoppel -- equity principles? I think 

9 that's what Justice Breyer was -- was referring to. 

What would be the contours of your equity limits? 

11  MR. PANNER: And I think that looking at the 

12 -- at the cases that were decided before 1952, which 

13 everyone seems to -- to agree is -- is the magic date, 

14 the furthest that any court went was the decision in 

Barrett. And it's interesting that the panel decision 

16 in this case also relied on the idea in Barrett. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a little bit 

18 unfair, to characterize the cases as limited to that. 

19 Some talked about negligence.

1 evidence --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, I agree. 

3  MR. PANNER: -- was from Barrett, and that 

4 was a case that involved, again, directing a witness not 

to answer, the suppression of inquiry into a particular 

6 factual area where the applicant then -- changing his 

7 story and claiming a different date for reduction of 

8 practice and a different basis for reduction to practice 

9 than had been argued before the PTO -- attempted to 

introduce the evidence that he had suppressed. 

11  So, that's a very different circumstance. 

12 And the courts -- the decisions are actually at pains to 

13 say that Barrett should not be over-read. The Third 

14 Circuit in the Carborundum case said that; the Nichols 

case, which we've we cited in our brief, said that; and 

16 of course, as you pointed out, Judge Hand observed that 

17 in the -- in the Dowling case. Globe-Union said that. 

18 So, even the cases that the Government itself relied on 

19 were -- accepted evidence, despite the arguments that 

were made by the defendants in those cases that this was 

21 evidence that should have been excluded because it could 

22 have been presented, and -- and did consider it. 

23  And that brings us, I think -- there has 

24 been a lot of discussion about Morgan and the standard 

of review and what Morgan has to say about that. And

1 the critical point that this Court recognized in 

2 Microsoft was that Morgan is one of the early cases and 

3 then -- and Radio Corporation is another that depend on 

4 an idea of the presumption of validity, which of course 

was then adopted by Congress in section 282 as a 

6 statutory presumption, that was given that common law 

7 meaning that required clear and convincing evidence. 

8 But the clear and convincing evidence is to overcome the 

9 grant of a property right to the defendant in those 

cases. 

11  What's critical in Morgan is the fact that 

12 the -- the Patent Office had granted a patent to the 

13 defendant, and it was a challenge to the validity of 

14 that patent that the plaintiff's case relied on. And 

it's -- and that's absolutely clear because the Court 

16 cites to Johnson v. Towsley, which is a case involving a 

17 land grant. And what the Court says is our presumption 

18 is that when the executive has the power to give 

19 property rights, we don't get to review it.

 Now, in this case, we see a limited 

21 exception because there's a statute that actually tells 

22 us we have to do it, but that exception is going to be 

23 limited. But if you look at what Morgan relies on, 

24 Morgan is not relying on agency expertise; it's relying 

on agency authority, which is a different matter. And

1 so -- and the authority that the agency had to grant a 

2 property right. In the -- in the conception of a -- of 

3 the court of 1893 and the administrative law that 

4 existed in 1893, the fact that there was no property 

right being challenged in an action where there was an 

6 effort to overcome a rejection means that this idea 

7 about the presumption of the validity of the rights that 

8 had been granted by an executive department doesn't come 

9 into play. There had been no rights granted by the 

executive department, and there's a new proceeding in 

11 which, to quote Professor Merrill's article, the court 

12 had "the whole case." And that's really reflected in 

13 the language that Congress chose. 

14  Now, of course, that -- the differences 

between what Congress provided under section 145 and the 

16 modern administrative review do lead to some -- to some 

17 questions. There is the question, you know, what should 

18 the standard be if there is no new evidence? Which --

19 you know, which the court looked at.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on that I think you 

21 -- you're not taking the position that Judge Newman did. 

22 I think -- didn't you say that if no new evidence is 

23 introduced in a 145 proceeding, then the court engages 

24 in APA-style review?

 MR. PANNER: Your Honor, Judge Newman said 

41

1 that if there -- that all -- all findings should be de 

2 novo in a section 145 action, but the -- the majority of 

3 the en banc court said that if there's no new 

4 evidence -- relying on what the Federal Circuit had held 

for many years, that if there's no new evidence, then 

6 the standard would be the substantial evidence standard 

7 that would apply on appeal. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- and that --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you agree with that?

 MR. PANNER: We haven't taken a position on 

11 it, but let me suggest --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I noticed that. 

13  MR. PANNER: -- why it might be right, Your 

14 Honor, which is that section 141 and section 144 do --

this Court in -- you know, held in Zurko that once you 

16 are in a situation where there is no new evidence -- and 

17 as an aside, Zurko emphasized that Morgan was a case 

18 that was on no new evidence. Where you have a case 

19 that's on no new evidence, there -- the APA standard of 

review, substantial evidence, arbitrary/capricious 

21 review, applies. And it might -- this might be the sort 

22 of narrow circumstance where to apply a de novo 

23 standard, even though that may be otherwise suggested by 

24 the language of section 145, would create an anomaly, as 

-- as this Court recognized in Zurko.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me you were 

2 introducing such a gamesmanship. Anybody who wanted to 

3 get out of substantial deference under the APA just has 

4 to present an expert. That -- that's what makes little 

sense to me, trying to -- now we're hair-splitting in a 

6 very minute way. 

7  MR. PANNER: Right. I don't -- I don't 

8 think --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Articulate a standard 

that would -- Newman is suggesting total de novo review 

11 with no reference to any kind of presumption applied to 

12 the PTO decision. Another way --

13  MR. PANNER: I'm not sure --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to look at it is the 

way I suggested, which is it doesn't matter whether 

16 there's new evidence or not; what is the level of 

17 respect that you are going to give to the PTO factual 

18 findings? 

19  MR. PANNER: Right. And, Your Honor, I 

think that the standard of proof is one of -- is the 

21 preponderance of the evidence. And the question of what 

22 weight -- as the Federal Circuit said, what weight to 

23 afford to that prior finding of the PTO would depend on 

24 what the record showed. That is the -- as the facts of 

the case may appear -- in section 145, it requires the

1 district court to look at the findings and look at the 

2 new evidence and to then make the determination. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Be -- as in the language 

4 of Morgan, be convinced that the PTO was wrong?

 MR. PANNER: As section -- as I say, the 

6 language of Morgan deals with the circumstance in which 

7 there's a challenge to the validity of an issued patent. 

8 The action that was at issue, the action as to which the 

9 validity was being challenged, was not the denial of the 

patent to the applicant; it was the fact that the PTO 

11 had issued a patent to the defendant in that case. And 

12 so, there was a collateral attack, effectively a 

13 collateral challenge to the validity of that issued 

14 patent. And that's why Radio Corporation of America 

cites Morgan, and that's how, you know, it's relevant to 

16 the -- this Court's, you know, decision in Microsoft, 

17 that the statutory presumption of validity carries this 

18 heightened standard of proof. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: My goodness. Suppose 

you're a lawyer, back to the Chief Justice's question, 

21 as you are, and you have the client there, and you're 

22 thinking, you know, if he puts all his evidence before 

23 the PTO, and they say no, we've had it. I mean, there 

24 we are. But if we hold back something, well, then we're 

going to get not -- get de novo review and a district

2 back something, we run into the estoppel rule. 

3  My goodness. You're -- you're in a mess, it 

4 seems to me, trying to advise a client what to do in 

that situation. Better not say hold something back; on 

6 the other hand, if he does he's pretty -- how do you 

7 deal -- you see? 

8  MR. PANNER: I think the -- I understand the 

9 concern, but the practicalities of patent prosecution 

practice are that no applicant would hold back evidence 

11 in an effort to -- to produce that sort of tactical 

12 advantage because once --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because -- I'm 

14 sorry. Go ahead.

 MR. PANNER: I think because it's -- it's 

16 frankly more straightforward and easier to try to meet 

17 those objections in the Office. That's what usually 

18 happens, is that there's a dialogue with the examiner to 

19 try to meet the grounds for rejection.

 One of the things that I think is important 

21 to take into account with respect to the context of this 

22 case is there were a vast number of rejections. There 

23 was not just a rejection on written-description and 

24 enablement grounds, but there were rejections for double 

patentings; there were rejections for anticipation; 

45

Official 

1 there were rejections for obviousness. And every single 

2 one -- every single one -- of those grounds for 

3 rejection was overcome in the appeal before the Board. 

4 And many of the written-description rejections were 

overcome in the appeal before the Board. And at -- with 

6 respect to every one, if one goes back and reads the 

7 examiner's decision, the examiner did provide an 

8 explanation as to what was lacking with respect to 

9 certain -- certain elements of the claimed invention, 

and with respect to every single one of those, the Board 

11 reversed. 

12  So, where the applicant was provided a fair 

13 opportunity to try to meet the concerns, the applicant 

14 did so, and the Board ruled in his favor. And he again 

attempted -- there's no question of sandbagging here. 

16 The -- the applicant brought these arguments to the 

17 Board in the rehearing petition, in the request for 

18 rehearing, and said here's my answer to your more 

19 focused explanation. And they -- they refused to hear 

it. 

21  So, as a practical matter, I think that --

22 and you don't have to take my word for it, again, 

23 because this procedure has been in place for so long, 

24 and problems have not arisen. And even if there were 

uncertainty as to what the precise standard for

1 admissibility was, the applicants would have every
 

2 reason to test that and to -- to try to do something
 

3 along that line if that were a realistic option and
 

4 favorable.


 The fact of the matter is that that has not 

6 happened because the applicants have every reason in the 

7 world to pursue the application with vigor before the 

8 Office. And the Federal Circuit, which, of course, is 

9 more familiar with the -- the patent application process 

than any other court, had no concerns that the rule that 

11 they were adopting would lead to abuses. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess, as a 

13 practical matter, these things all end up before the 

14 Federal Circuit anyway, right?

 MR. PANNER: That's right, Your Honor. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose that 

17 -- if you had the same case and one is coming up under 

18 the 141 and the other under 145, I suppose it's 

19 theoretically possible they could reach different 

results because of different standards of review. 

21  MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, you can't do 

22 both. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I know. 

24 I'm not saying -- the point is that although they all 

come before the Federal Circuit, they may come to them

1 in a very different posture that would cause the Federal 

2 Circuit to rule differently if you had the same case 

3 under one and under the other. 

4  MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I -- it 

wouldn't be on the same record. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

7  MR. PANNER: If it were on the same record, 

8 then presumably the -- the issue that would be presented 

9 would be quite similar. The only time I can see that --

so, in other words, if there were a different record, 

11 it's true that the Federal Circuit's review of the 

12 district decision would be -- it would be the difference 

13 that this Court recognized in Zurko. It would be the 

14 court/court standard of review, which is -- gives 

perhaps slightly less weight to the decision of the 

16 district court than the court/agency review. But that 

17 doesn't seem like an advantage. In the -- in a 

18 circumstance at least where an applicant has prevailed, 

19 the applicant would be more likely to see the victory 

taken away by the Federal Circuit. 

21  Unless the Court has questions.

1  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS
 

2  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

3  MS. ANDERS: Thank you.
 

4  This is an action for judicial review of
 

agency determination. This is an action that -- that 

6 requires the patent applicant to -- to seek a property 

7 right from the agency, to have it denied, and to 

8 challenge that in court. And as a result, this Court 

9 said in Zurko that this is review of an agency 

determination, and, therefore, Morgan's deferential 

11 standard should be carried forward into the APA. 

12  And in construing Morgan, the Court in Zurko 

13 did not consider that it was -- whether a property right 

14 had been awarded or not; it was simply that the agency 

had made a determination in its expertise. And I think 

16 that goes to why it would not be sufficient for the 

17 court simply to weigh the evidence differently. In 

18 every other agency -- judicial review proceeding of 

19 agency action, the rule is that the agency is the 

primary decisionmaker. The agency has to consider the 

21 evidence first and make a determination. That aids 

22 judicial review. It allows the agency to apply its 

23 expertise. And we generally don't think of the court as 

24 being the one who should make the first determination on 

issues of fact. And that's particularly --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you have a strange 

2 statute here. I don't know any statute that -- that 

3 reads this way. "As the facts" -- "as the facts" --

4 where is it? "As the facts may" --

MS. ANDERS: Yes. "As the facts" --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: "As the facts in the case 

7 may appear." That's --

8  MS. ANDERS: Well, that language was in the 

9 statute in Morgan when the Court construed this as 

judicial review. And I think that -- there would have 

11 to be a compelling reason in order to interpret the 

12 statute to permit an -- to permit the applicant to 

13 introduce evidence that he failed without cause, without 

14 justification, to provide to the agency.

 And I don't think that Mr. Hyatt has shown 

16 any such justification. And --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I guess the 

18 compelling reason is the statutory language and 

19 especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence 

question. I mean, it -- the standard that you suggest 

21 just can't be derived from the statutory language; isn't 

22 that right? 

23  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think certainly there's 

24 an exhaustion requirement within the statute. The Board 

has to have considered the application. And, therefore,

1 it would make no sense to have the Board consider the
 

2 application if it didn't have to consider all of the
 

3 evidence that was provided.
 

4  So, I think in that sense, you know, the
 

standard that the Federal Circuit put in place and that 

6 Mr. Hyatt is proposing really is providing --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why didn't the court 

8 just say what you said? If it -- if -- not the court; 

9 Congress. If you admit that Congress intended a section 

145 action to permit new evidence, if it wanted to limit 

11 that evidence to something that could not have been 

12 found with due diligence or whatever your limitations 

13 are, why did it speak more broadly? I mean, the 

14 statutory language suggests "as the facts in this case," 

not in the case before the PTO. As law and -- "as 

16 equity might permit." 

17  This is very broad language. 

18  MS. ANDERS: Well -- so, the language could 

19 be taken to suggest that some new evidence is 

admissible, but I think then we look to the fact that 

21 this -- just like section 141 is a judicial review 

22 proceeding, and there should have to be compelling 

23 reason before we deviate from the normal deferential 

24 standards that apply when a -- when a court is reviewing 

an agency's determination.
