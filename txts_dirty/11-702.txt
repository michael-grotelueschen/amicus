3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-702, Moncrieffe v. Holder.

 Mr. Goldstein. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you 

9 very much. May it please the Court:

 Today's undercard is an immigration case. 

11 Adrian Moncrieffe was convicted of possession with 

12 intent to distribute marijuana, under Georgia law, the 

13 question in the case is whether he was thereby convicted 

14 of a controlled substances offense, which is a 

deportable offense, but also an aggravated felony of 

16 illicit trafficking in drugs, which would mean that the 

17 Attorney General has no discretion to cancel his 

18 removal. 

19  Now, everyone agrees that, under the Georgia 

statute, there is going to be some conduct that would be 

21 a Federal felony, but it's also undisputed that the 

22 Georgia statute regularly involves prosecutions that 

23 would be Federal misdemeanors. So --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. You use that 

word, "regularly." Do you have statistics on that?

1 Were they provided in the briefs? 

2  MR. GOLDSTEIN: They were not. We do not --

3 we attempted very hard to collect them. This is the 

4 information I can give you about Federal and State 

prosecutions of marijuana cases in the United States. 

6  In the State system, the most recent 

7 available data -- it was published by the Department of 

8 Justice in 2006, but we have no reason to believe that 

9 it's changed materially -- in 2006, there were roughly 

750,000 prosecutions in the States for marijuana 

11 offenses. 

12  By contrast, in the Federal system, we have 

13 data from 2010. And we have two different kinds of data 

14 here that's a little bit more granular, and that is, for 

prosecutions under 841(b)(1), which is the trafficking 

16 provision, there were 6,200 cases. 

17  For prosecutions under 841(b)(4) -- which is 

18 the provision we say you ought to look at here -- and 

19 844 -- which is the possession provision -- combined, 

there were only 93 prosecutions in 2010. 

21  And what we think that illustrates is that 

22 there is a massive amount of activity in the States 

23 doing things that show that this -- and this case is 

24 perfectly commonplace, we think. It's consistent with 

the other cases that we've seen published by the BIA.

1  Adrian Moncrieffe possessed --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- it's a massive 

3 amount of conduct that -- that the statute contemplates? 

4 The statutory scheme -- I just didn't hear. I just 

didn't hear. 

6  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. I apologize. Yes, 

7 Justice Kennedy, that's right. 

8  The Georgia statute, which just refers to 

9 possession with intent to distribute, contemplates both 

social sharing of marijuana -- this case, for example, 

11 1.3 grams of marijuana, which is less than --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you -- now, Mr. 

13 Goldstein, when you say, "this case," is there any proof 

14 in the record that there was a small amount and no -- no 

remuneration? 

16  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, 

17 although this is -- we believe the case is proceeding 

18 under the categorical approach, the answer to your 

19 question is yes.

 So let me take you to two places. One is 

21 going to be at the back of the blue brief, where we have 

22 the chemist's report, so page 19. This is from the --

23 the record in the immigration proceedings. 

24  And on page 19 of the appendix to our blue 

brief -- we just agreed because there was so little 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 record material, that we wouldn't have a joint appendix 

2 in the case. We just published it at the end of our 

3 brief -- it says, "Material weight less than 1 ounce. 

4 Approximate weight is 1.3 grams."

 And for those of us who've been fortunate 

6 enough not to experience the drug laws a lot, that's 

7 less than half the weight of this penny. So it's -- I 

8 think everybody agrees, a small amount. 

9  Now, on the question of no remuneration, 

what I have to offer you is the Georgia statute --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I don't 

12 understand. 

13  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Material weight says less 

than 1 ounce --

16  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- parentheses, 

18 "Approximate weight is 1" -- 1 -- oh, I see, 1.3 grams. 

19  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 1.3 grams. 1.3. 

That's -- that's very, very, very, very little. 

21  So then, on the question of remuneration --

22 and I should just step back and explain, the reason 

23 we're talking about this is that the Federal misdemeanor 

24 provision, 841(b)(4), says that it's not a felony, and 

thus, it wouldn't be an aggravated felony, if it's a 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

Official 

1 small amount and no remuneration. And Justice Ginsburg 

2 asked about the -- what's in the record about that. 

3  Now, there isn't record evidence about no 

4 remuneration, but there is one significant fact. And to 

know that fact, you have to look at the Georgia statute, 

6 which is also at the end of our brief. It's on page 9 

7 of our appendix. 

8  This is the statute he was prosecuted under. 

9 It's the second provision, Section 16-13-30(j)(1). And 

I'll just read it. "It is unlawful for any person to 

11 possess, have under his control, manufacture, deliver, 

12 distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell" --

13 sell -- "or possess with intent to distribute 

14 marijuana."

 And he was not charged with and he was not 

16 convicted of selling. And so we think that should 

17 negative any indication -- any implication that he might 

18 have gotten remuneration for this. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You -- we are discussing 

the categorical approach, but let's assume he had pled 

21 guilty. And in his allocution, he had admitted to not a 

22 smaller amount or to remuneration. Would -- would an 

23 immigration judge, under the argument you're making 

24 today, have to ignore that allocution? Or would he be 

able to apply the modified approach and find this

Official 

1 gentleman an aggravated felon? 

2  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Under our rule, the plea 

3 colloquy is irrelevant, but we would win under a rule in 

4 which it was relevant.

 So, to start with the former, we say that 

6 the categorical rule applies. There's no -- the only 

7 reason that you would look at the modified categorical 

8 approach here is to know that it was a possession with 

9 intent to distribute conviction, rather than a sale 

conviction, but that evidence would still come in. It 

11 would be highly relevant. It's the basis that this 

12 Court explained in Carachuri-Rosendo, that the 

13 immigration judge would deny cancellation of removal. 

14 Right?

 That factor would still be highly relevant. 

16 The Attorney General would exercise his discretion in 

17 such a case. Now --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the issue with 

19 this case. None of these immigrants are being let out 

automatically. They are still felons subject to 

21 removal. The only issue is whether --

22  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, this -- you said still 

23 felons. We --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- they're --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But that's exactly right.

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- they're still subject 

2 to removal --

3  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- either way.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: So -- you know, lawyers 

6 often try and avoid the strength of the other side's 

7 case. And so let me just confront what I think is a big 

8 argument of theirs. 

9  They say our position is underinclusive 

because the Georgia statute does include conduct that 

11 would be a felony. You just gave an example of it. 

12  But our point is that our underinclusivity 

13 is a problem, but it's not a big problem, it's not as 

14 big as their problem, because, as this Court explained 

in Carachuri-Rosendo, the offense still is removable, 

16 and the Attorney General will just deny cancellation of 

17 removal. 

18  Now, the reason they have a much bigger 

19 practical problem is that their rule is overinclusive. 

It treats, as felonies, some convictions that should be 

21 misdemeanors. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I see that. There's 

23 something I really don't understand in these cases 

24 because the other cases, our precedent's been around a 

long time, so I would have guessed that, under that 

9

Official 

1 precedent in these other statutes, the obvious thing to 

2 do -- the obvious puzzle here is not the Federal 

3 statute, it's the State statute, what is this thing he 

4 was convicted of about?

 So you'd pick up the phone, and you'd phone, 

6 at random, four U.S. attorneys -- not U.S. attorneys, 

7 but four State attorneys --

8  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: -- who work with the 

statute in Georgia, and say, now, look, the indictment 

11 here says possession with intent to distribute, and I 

12 can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount. 

13 Now, is it your policy, if he was selling it, to charge 

14 under the sell? Is it your policy if he's not selling 

it to charge under intent to distribute? Is it totally 

16 random whether you say sell or intent to distribute? 

17 What's your policy? Okay? 

18  Then we get some answers. Then we'd have an 

19 idea whether what you're saying is right. Now, you 

could do that, but they could do it, too. Anyone could 

21 do it. And then we'd have some actual facts about 

22 whether this charge -- really, it corresponds to the 

23 misdemeanor or the felony in the Federal statute. 

24  So why -- I'm not -- I mean, that isn't a 

brain -- that isn't -- doesn't require -- it's not

1 rocket science, okay? So why has no one done it? 

2  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because I don't think 

3 anybody would believe me if I went to an immigration 

4 judge and I said, judge, I promise, I promise that the 

fact that this isn't a possession with intent to 

6 distribute case means that there are never cases in --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to say, 

8 "never." The question is what kind of a statute is this 

9 State statute?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. We -- I think --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: And the kind of statute 

12 that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute 

13 people --

14  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- with small amounts when 

16 they don't sell. 

17  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: If your version of what 

19 that felon intends to distribute --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: The distinction there is 

22 really picked up by the district attorneys. 

23  And if it's not, then they may be right, 

24 because -- because then intent to distribute may well 

often include, as it does under Federal law, people who

1 sell stuff. 

2  MR. GOLDSTEIN: We have not read this 

3 Court's cases to suggest that we call the State 

4 attorneys. We have read the Court's cases to engage in 

ordinary statutory construction, and sell means sell --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. You didn't. 

7 In any words, nobody did it. 

8  So my other question --

9  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which is the only other 

11 one I really have, aside from making that suggestion. 

12 But here, what happened to this person? 

13  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: He was -- was he sentenced 

under 16-13-2(a)? That is, was he sentenced to 

16 probation? Which would be evidence in your favor, I 

17 think. 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: But was he, or wasn't he?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If he was, what 

22 it says in this provision is that the Court may without 

23 entering a judgment of guilt. So there was no judgment 

24 of guilt.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

2 completes it, he then is discharged without court
 

3 adjudication of guilt.
 

4  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.


 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and shall not be 

6 deemed a conviction, it says for purposes of this code. 

7  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why are we saying he 

9 was convicted of anything?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Because the 

11 government's position is -- and the Eleventh Circuit has 

12 agreed with it -- and just to -- just to make sure 

13 everyone is on the same page, and that is, the Federal 

14 statute is triggered by a conviction.

 Justice Breyer has just made the point that, 

16 as a matter of State law, he was not even convicted 

17 because he got first offender treatment here, which is a 

18 point in our favor. It does show that it was a small 

19 and non-serious offense.

 The reason is that there is a Federal 

21 definition of convicted that's independent of the State 

22 definition of convicted. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that question's 

24 not before us today.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. 

13

25

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, isn't 

2 the reason we don't look at the particular facts and 

3 particular case and don't depose four district 

4 attorneys, is that the Court has adopted a categorical 

approach precisely to avoid that type of inquiry in --

6 whatever it is, 750,000 cases? 

7  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's correct. And 

8 it's an even stronger point in our favor because worse 

9 than interviewing four district attorneys is having a 

fact-bound inquiry into every one of these immigration 

11 cases. Remember --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I'm sorry. 

13 We don't need that because we've adopted a categorical 

14 approach.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 841(b)(1)(D) lists 

17 the elements and conviction in -- Georgia, right? 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Conviction in 

Georgia under their provision satisfies -- has each of 

21 those elements. And under our categorical approach, 

22 that's the end of the inquiry. 

23  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is one way of looking 

24 at it. We disagree, for reasons I'll explain. I will 

note in our favor that the Attorney General doesn't even

1 defend that position anymore. 

2  Remember, that they do not argue that you 

3 can just look at the conviction. They want to have the 

4 fact-bound inquiry into every one of these cases. And 

the reason is that, if you apply the categorical 

6 approach to --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They want to do that 

8 at the tail end, right? 

9  MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, they want to do it in --

in every single case at the beginning. 

11  So I can just make clear everybody's 

12 position. There really --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, I didn't hear. 

14  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They want to do it in 

16 every --

17  MR. GOLDSTEIN: In every case at the 

18 beginning. So I'll --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: At the -- at the beginning 

of the State prosecution? 

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, in the middle -- at the 

22 beginning of the immigration proceedings. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. 

24  MR. GOLDSTEIN: So let me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get on --

15

15

20

25

Official 

1 I didn't understand that to be their position at all.  I 

2 mean, I suppose we -- I certainly will ask them because 

3 they're probably better able to articulate their 

4 position, but --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. So let me explain. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

7  MR. GOLDSTEIN: So our position is it is a 

8 controlled substances offense, and you take account of 

9 the seriousness of the offense in cancellation. Their 

position is that it is presumptively, but only 

11 presumptively, an aggravated felony. And in every 

12 single immigration proceeding, when you have a case like 

13 this, the noncitizen can come forward with fact-found 

14 evidence, not limited to the record of conviction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, it's 

16 because they are trying to mirror the Federal statute, 

17 which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes 

18 that like an affirmative defense. The burden is on the 

19 defendant to show those two things, to get out from 

under the main statute. 

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what the Government is 

23 suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can 

24 get.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, let me just say first, 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 I do want to make -- just want to focus on what the 

2 parties' positions are. And they do have this 

3 fact-found inquiry in every one, so I do want to turn to 

4 what I think is probably their second best argument. I 

was talking about the underinclusiveness as the first 

6 one. 

7  Their second one is they want to draw an 

8 analogy between this and what would happen in a criminal 

9 case. So they say, take the conviction and imagine that 

the conviction is all the facts that you had in a 

11 Federal criminal prosecution, and then you would have a 

12 burden on the defendant to -- to prove that he was 

13 subject to the misdemeanor. 

14  We have several points about that. The 

first is this is not a Federal criminal prosecution. 

16 The Federal statute involved is the Immigration and 

17 Naturalization Act, and it tells you that you are 

18 supposed to look at the conviction itself and determine 

19 whether it corresponds to a Federal felony.

 This further proceeding doesn't exist, and 

21 it's exactly the argument that was rejected in 

22 Carachuri-Rosendo. And let me talk about why --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said Carachuri. That 

24 case involved, in -- in order to hold for the 

government, you would have to go outside the record of 

17

1 the State conviction. You'd have to add something that 

2 wasn't in the State conviction. 

3  And it's the same thing here. To get to 

4 where you want to go, you have to add something that 

isn't in the State conviction. 

6  MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, we disagree. What the 

7 Court said in -- I agree with the beginning of how you 

8 characterize the Carachuri case. What the Court said is 

9 we don't go beyond the -- the conviction itself.

 We -- And it's true that, in that case, the 

11 government wanted to go beyond the record to go up. But 

12 here, what they're saying is that you should go beyond 

13 the record to figure out if you should go down. And 

14 what the Court said is, no, you look at the conviction 

itself. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the 

17 conviction? 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the conviction 

mean? You say the categorical approach. 

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is it the categorical 

23 statute under which you have been convicted or, as you 

24 seem to be saying, the indictment?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is what you are convicted

1 of. So here, he was convicted of possession with intent 

2 to distribute. The other side's argument is, well, if I 

3 had just possession with intent to distribute, that 

4 would be a Federal felony. So we acknowledge the 

strength of that point. But our --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is he convicted of that? 

7 Or is he convicted of violating Georgia Code 16-13, 

8 whatever it is? 

9  MR. GOLDSTEIN: As I was -- I mentioned very 

briefly to Justice Sotomayor, when you have a divisible 

11 statute like this, that includes possession with intent 

12 to distribute, sell, possess, all of those things, you 

13 use the modified categorical approach to figure out 

14 which one applies.

 And so we know he was convicted of 

16 possession with intent to distribute, and that's common 

17 ground between the parties. It's not the whole statute. 

18 It's just the --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Goldstein, 

assuming he was convicted of that, as you suggest, you 

21 have an underinclusiveness problem. The Government has 

22 an overinclusiveness problem. 

23  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: If you assume that this 

statute covers and is regularly used to cover both sets

1 of people, both people with these very minor offenses
 

2 and people with much more major offenses --

3  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- the at least apparent
 

attractiveness of the government's position is that 

6 they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem. 

7 And they have done it by sticking on -- and -- you know, 

8 one can ask where this comes from in the statute --

9  MR. GOLDSTEIN: I hope we will.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- but they have done it by 

11 sticking on something that attempts to address their 

12 overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really 

13 misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and 

14 people who are really aggravated felons get classified

16  And you have no similar cure for your 

17 underinclusiveness problem. So why shouldn't we go with 

18 their problem, which at least attempts to solve this 

19 problem?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, two reasons. First, 

21 they don't have a real solution; and, second, Congress 

22 solved our problem. 

23  And this is what Carachuri-Rosendo says, and 

24 that is when you have an underinclusiveness problem just 

like ours, the statute fixes it because the statute

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't follow --

1 disagree with, Justice Ginsburg. Maybe I can just read 

2 to you what this Court said about this exact issue in 

3 Carachuri-Rosendo. 

4  It said that, when you have a very -- this 

very underinclusiveness problem, it is solved by the 

6 statute because the attorney -- all that happens under 

7 our rule -- it's still a deportable offense, and the 

8 Attorney General denies cancellation of removal. 

9  So if could just read, very briefly -- and 

this is from the Supreme Court Reporter, at page 2589. 

11 "We note that whether a noncitizen has committed an 

12 aggravated felony is relevant, inter alia, to the type 

13 of relief he may obtain from a removal order, but not to 

14 whether he is, in fact, removable.

 "In other words, to the extent that our 

16 rejection of the government's broad understanding of the 

17 scope of aggravated felony may have any practical effect 

18 on policing our Nation's borders, it is a limited one. 

19 Carachuri-Rosendo and others in his position may now 

seek cancellation of removal and thereby avoid the harsh 

21 consequence of mandatory removal, but he will not avoid 

22 the fact that his conviction makes him" --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all that follows 

24 from, in Carachuri, the government wanted to go outside 

the record.

3  The upshot of our position is that
 

4 Mr. Moncrieffe has committed a controlled substances
 

offense, and anyone else in his position has committed 

6 one. And if there is a serious drug amount, the 

7 Attorney General will deny him cancellation of removal. 

8 I have --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that the 

Attorney General could just issue some kind of directive 

11 telling all administrative law judges and officials to 

12 deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commits 

13 these kinds of offenses? 

14  MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- it's an interesting 

question that I have puzzled about at length. I think 

16 the answer is no for a very particular reason, however, 

17 and that is the Attorney General has no such categorical 

18 rules. 

19  We think it's a point in our favor that the 

Attorney General, in the application starting with 

21 212(c) before the 1996 Act, which is discussed in St. --

22 this Court's decision in St. Cyr, through the present 

23 has instead applied a holistic look at all of the 

24 circumstances.

 What he certainly can do is direct the

1 immigration judges to place special weight -- and this 

2 was the rule before 1996, by the way. If you had a 

3 serious offense, you had to show special equities that 

4 would justify your not being removed from the country. 

And so we think that's the most likely outcome. 

6  A per se categorical rule would be very 

7 unlike what we understand the Attorney General to do in 

8 any other circumstance. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it -- would it be 

permissible -- I had the same question. Would it be 

11 permissible --

12  MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or would you be back up 

14 here saying that this violates the statute?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we think we would win, 

16 so I wouldn't be back for this client. But I think 

17 there would be a substantial argument that it would be 

18 arbitrary and capricious because it would be so unlike 

19 anything the Attorney General does in other 

circumstances. 

21  But they would have --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to?

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.

17 directive. 

18  MR. GOLDSTEIN: And I think our argument 

19 that it's arbitrary would be supported by the fact that 

this Court would have ruled that he couldn't do the 

21 identical thing on the front end. But it's an open 

22 question, and it's not presented here. 

23  I had said that there were two flaws in 

24 the -- sort of their characterization of the over and 

underinclusiveness problem. The second one is they

Official 

1 don't have a real solution. This is a big problem. 

2  Under these State convictions in which the 

3 amount of drugs and whether there was remuneration are 

4 irrelevant, it's going to be extremely difficult for 

uncounseled noncitizens who are in jail, who don't have 

6 access to tools of communication, to prove to an 

7 immigration judge this fact-bound inquiry, which they 

8 are inserting into every single case, that their offense 

9 actually corresponds to a misdemeanor.

 So while you say that they have provided the 

11 solution, I don't know where it comes from in the 

12 statute, but we think it is not a practical solution. 

13 And that problem is even worse in the many contexts that 

14 are not just straight removal.

 We said in our opening brief, and the 

16 government's response ignores, that there are many cases 

17 in which immigration officials have to make these 

18 decisions about whether it's an aggravated felony much 

19 more on the fly, without the opportunity to call 

everybody in and --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any 

22 statistics -- if you take the whole universe of 

23 convictions under the Georgia statute, what percentage 

24 of them are for these minor offenses and what are for 

the major? Do we have any handle on that at all?

Official 

1  MR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't. We tried. I'm 

2 sorry. We were unable to do it. The Department of 

3 Justice has better relationships with prosecutors, and 

4 so maybe it -- it will have that information for you. 

But, I can say -- it's possible. 

6  But I can say that the -- it is absolutely 

7 commonplace, from looking at the case law, for the 

8 States to tackle this small social sharing of a couple 

9 of marijuana cigarettes. This is -- that's the 

distinction between 93 prosecutions under -- or 

11 convictions under (b)(4) and possession in the -- in the 

12 Federal system and 750,000 in the States. Federal 

13 prosecutors leave these to the States. 

14  Which brings me back to my other answer to 

Justice Ginsburg's pointing out the government's 

16 argument about a parallel between this and a Federal 

17 criminal prosecution. 

18  And the reason they want to do that, Justice 

19 Ginsburg, is that in a Federal -- actual Federal 

criminal prosecution, the burden of proof never matters, 

21 including because Federal prosecutors almost never bring 

22 these cases. 

23  So here's what we tried to do: This 

24 statute, (b)(4), was enacted in 1970, some 42 years ago. 

We tried to identify one case in 42 years in which the 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 burden of proof in the Federal case made any difference 

2 at all, and we were unable to. And I would be really 

3 interested to know if my friend is able to identify one 

4 case in 42 years, which it actually made a difference.

 And the reason is, in an actual Federal 

6 prosecution, the FBI agent would come in and say, here 

7 are the drugs, and they were trying to sell it to an 

8 undercover officer. It's never the case that it 

9 actually -- the defendant is in a position of trying to 

prove that it was a misdemeanor. 

11  But what they are trying to do is to take 

12 that rule, which is derived from Apprendi, that there is 

13 a burden of proof so that the government doesn't have to 

14 indict that it wasn't a (b)(4) offense, and take the 

silence of the State record, where these facts are 

16 completely irrelevant, the quantity and remuneration, 

17 and transpose them into the Federal system and take 

18 great advantage of the fact that the record is silent. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Goldstein, there are 

at least 93 cases, all right? So --

21  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I don't know and I'm 

23 not going to ask you to prove to me how the burden of 

24 proof was met or not met in those. But let me give you 

a different hypothetical.

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume Georgia has 

3 the Federal statute, but in -- differently than the 

4 Federal statute, it has a sale-distribution provision, 

and it has a small amount, no remuneration statute. 

6  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would happen in 

8 those States? 

9  MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are about 15 of those 

States, and in those States, if you weren't convicted 

11 under the small one, then you would infer it wasn't a 

12 small amount and no remuneration, and the person would 

13 have committed an aggravated felony. 

14  Our issue arises only when you have a 

situation in which the State is prosecuting people under 

16 the statute that would be a Federal misdemeanor. If the 

17 State --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Go 

19 ahead.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. If the State has a 

21 different system, as a material number of States do, in 

22 which they track the Federal system, and they have a 

23 small provision or a remuneration provision -- which 

24 another nine States have a remuneration provision -- in 

those situations, if you have a conviction that isn't

1 under that social sharing provision, it's an aggravated

4 statistics, I think, assumes that Georgia and other 

States are prosecuting every case that comes before them 

6 because that's how you get -- you know, of these 750,000 

7 nationwide, so much more than must involve tiny amounts. 

8  But, of course, perhaps they don't prosecute 

9 the cases involving tiny amounts, so that most of those 

cases, or some percentage of them, may in fact also 

11 involve the serious type of conduct addressed by the 

12 Federal statute. 

13  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I have one really good 

14 example of a prosecution for a small amount. It's this 

case. 

16  And we don't deny that there are --

17 Mr. Chief Justice, please do not misunderstand me to be 

18 arguing that every Georgia conviction or that 80 or 

19 90 percent of them are the small ones. What I'm trying 

to tell you is that a lot of them are just like this 

21 one, and I think the data bears that out. 

22  And the question before you is, under a 

23 categorical approach, is it fair to presume that they're 

24 all felonies? Is it fair to presume that what Congress 

recognized here is that there would be a correspondence

17 require neither remuneration nor more than a small 

18 amount. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the free pass? 

The free pass is mandatory as opposed to discretionary

23 never have an aggravated felony for this conviction 

24 under any State that did not make an element of the 

State offense to disprove -- no remuneration or more

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those convicted 

3 individuals would still be subject to deportation. 

4  MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, they would still 

be subject --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And nothing would stop 

7 the INS judge from considering the amount of drugs, 

8 correct, that the individual actually was involved in, 

9 and that could be introduced through hearsay -- through 

almost any document, correct? 

11  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, you're talking about 

12 the discretionary cancellation of removal proceeding? 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

14  MR. SHAH: It's true, Your Honor, that could 

come in there. But Congress specifically enacted this 

16 aggravated felony provision to take away that discretion 

17 from the Attorney General. The motivating factor 

18 behind --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, do you -- do you 

suggest that the immigration judges don't know that and 

21 that they wouldn't weigh that desire heavily in a case 

22 in which a -- the convicted individual is proven to have 

23 sold the larger amount? You still think they are going 

24 to cancel?

1 said when it passed this very provision was that 

2 immigration judges were granting too much discretionary 

3 relief to this very class of criminal aliens, and that 

4 is why it implemented this aggravated felony.

 Now, Petitioner says it's not going to have 

6 a big deal on immigration -- big impact on immigration 

7 policy for the reason that you suggest, the Attorney 

8 General can do it at the back end. But that --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, will you pause 

right there. I don't -- you just made the argument that 

11 your position on Castro-Rodriguez is wrong. You say 

12 Congress took away the Attorney General's discretion. 

13 Then you come back and say, well, we're going to 

14 exercise that discretion under -- under 

Castro-Rodriguez, and this Petitioner in particular can 

16 take advantage of it. 

17  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it's not an 

18 exercise of discretion under Castro-Rodriguez. We, at 

19 the tail end, have an inquiry that, I think, mirrors the 

CSA scheme. 

21  Remember that this aggravated felony 

22 provision in the INA incorporates by reference the CSA 

23 scheme. What the CSA scheme provides is, as a default 

24 matter, any conviction for possession with intent to 

distribute marijuana will be a felony. But the CSA 

33

1 scheme also provides a narrow mitigating exception for 

2 those who distribute just a small amount socially. 

3  What our scheme does is that --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- is the 

authority for that Castro-Rodriguez? 

6  MR. SHAH: I'm sorry? 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the authority for 

8 that the decision in Castro-Rodriguez? 

9  MR. SHAH: To -- to have that secondary 

proceeding? 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

12  MR. SHAH: Well, I think it comes from the 

13 statute, the INA, which incorporates the CSA scheme. 

14 Because many of the State provisions don't offer that 

same affirmative mitigating exception that the Federal 

16 scheme does, what Castro-Rodriguez does is it looks to 

17 the INA, which incorporates the CSA, and then provides a 

18 similar mechanism in immigration court. 

19  But it's not an unprecedented inquiry. The 

Board has been doing similar inquiries for at least a 

21 quarter of a century. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Shah, the Board 

23 may have been doing these inquiries, but I just don't 

24 understand the statutory argument because the way the 

statute -- the way your own statutory argument runs is

1 that if the conviction -- the State conviction, was a 

2 conviction for possession with intent to distribute, 

3 then those are the elements of a Federal -- of a Federal 

4 felony.

 And so the person -- and an aggravated 

6 felony. So you say, under the elements approach, this 

7 person has committed an aggravated felony. And the 

8 statutory directive is that, when a person has committed 

9 an aggravated, felony, he is deportable, and there is no 

exercise of discretion that can come into play. 

11  And so your whole back-end process, which 

12 says, oh, well, maybe not, maybe he's not automatically 

13 deportable, it doesn't come from the statute, and it 

14 seems to run into the statutory language, which says an 

aggravated felon must be deported, the end. 

16  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I agree. The 

17 government could have taken the hard-line approach that 

18 it's game over under the categorical inquiry because the 

19 elements --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's what the 

21 statute says, and that's what your own statutory 

22 analysis says. 

23  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I don't think it's 

24 inconsistent with the statutory scheme. In fact, I 

think it's consistent.

1  And here's one way to think about it: 

2 This -- this particular aggravated felony is a little 

3 bit complicated because it incorporates by reference, in 

4 two different levels, the CSA. Congress -- let's assume 

Congress rewrote the aggravated felony definition to
 

6 eliminate the incorporation by reference.
 

7  I think what the equivalent -- the
 

8 functionally identical formulation would be -- the
 

9 definition of the aggravated felony is, "any
 

distribution of a controlled substance, unless the 

11 defendant shows that it involved a small amount of 

12 marijuana for no remuneration." 

13  That would incorporate both the presumptive 

14 felony provision, any distribution of controlled 

substance -- you have the same two elements -- and then 

16 it would add in the proviso that it's in the CSA 

17 mitigating exception. Functionally identical. 

18  Aggravated felony is, "any distribution of a 

19 controlled substance, unless the defendant shows that it 

was a small quantity for remuneration." 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is --

22  MR. SHAH: What our inquiry does is --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. I'm 

24 sorry.

 MR. SHAH: Sorry. What our inquiry does is

1 allow the board to get to that second part of the 

2 definition, the "unless" clause, and that mirrors 

3 exactly other aggravated felony provisions in the INA. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you've answered 

Justice Kagan's question by -- she said, doesn't your 

6 own interpretation of this statute require the opposite 

7 result and -- or the -- the harsh result? 

8  And you say, well, suppose Congress wrote a 

9 statute this way. But that wasn't her question. The 

question is --

11  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I'm not positing --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you said that 

13 Congress could write a new statute. Of course, Congress 

14 could write a new statute, but what about this one?

 MR. SHAH: I'm not positing a new statute. 

16 I was simply taking out the incorporation by reference, 

17 so we could look at it in a different way. I think it's 

18 functionally identical to the provision at issue here. 

19 And I think it's --

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I'll just read you, 

21 Mr. Shah, this sentence from your brief -- and I could 

22 read you a thousand of these in your brief. "Because 

23 Petitioner's Georgia conviction necessarily established 

24 that he knowingly possessed marijuana with the specific 

intent to distribute it, that conviction constitutes an 

37
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 aggravated felony." 

2  Well, if that conviction constitutes an 

3 aggravated felony, he has to be deported, and there is 

4 no exercise of discretion that this statute allows.

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I -- I would 

6 say that it presumptively creates the aggravated felony, 

7 and it's because of that --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now, you've just put 

9 in words into your brief.

 MR. SHAH: Well, well --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and -- and really, truly, 

12 you say this 10 or 15 times. 

13  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, the heading to 

14 the brief says, "presumptively," and so I didn't use 

that word every time, but I think the point is that it 

16 would be the -- the aggravated felony has that unless 

17 clause. 

18  And if you look at other aggravated felony 

19 provisions in the INA, such as the one reproduced on the 

top of page 34 of the government's brief, it defines an 

21 aggravated felony as certain document fraud crimes, and 

22 then it has a clause that says, "unless" -- "unless the 

23 alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed 

24 the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting or, 

abating only the alien's spouse, child, or parent to

1 violate a provision of the INA." 

2  So you could say ball game over, once you 

3 have shown the document fraud crime under the 

4 categorical approach. But the INA specifically has a 

provision that says, unless the alien can show that he 

6 committed the offense for the purpose of assisting and 

7 abetting --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this is -- this 

9 is a new position for the government. My understanding 

is that you -- your clients were on the other side of 

11 this position in Castro-Rodriguez itself; is that not 

12 correct? 

13  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

14 that we categorically deny that you could have this sort 

of proceeding. And in the op to this case -- I know 

16 Petitioner says this is a new position in this case. 

17 Pages 13 through 16 of our op embrace Castro-Rodriguez 

18 as the right way to do it. I think it's --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that was a 

change in the government's position, wasn't it? 

21  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I can say that the --

22 the government did dispute the particular facts in 

23 Castro-Rodriguez. I can't say that they categorically 

24 rejected the availability of that sort of inquiry. And 

that sort of inquiry is not new.

3 36, that was a precursor to the controlled substance

so if you look at the language of that precursor 

6 provision, essentially, it said any aliens deportable 

7 for a drug offense, unless that drug offense involves 

8 simple possession of marijuana of 30 grams or less. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what does -- in a 

case in which the Attorney General can cancel removal, 

11 putting aside this case, what are the sort of things he 

12 looks at in deciding whether or not to cancel removal? 

13  MR. SHAH: It's a balance of equities. 

14 After, assuming that the -- the alien has established 

the three eligibility criteria set forth, it will be a 

16 balance. It's a favorable exercise of discretion. It's 

17 a balance of the equities. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So one of the 

19 things, presumably, is the amount of drugs involved, 

whether they were for intent to distribute for 

21 remuneration -- all the sorts of things that you say he 

22 can consider under the provision that says he does not 

23 have the authority to cancel removal. 

24  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, those are the sorts 

of factors that might be open to consideration, but what

1 Congress did is it took away the ability for the

 Now, Justice Sotomayor, if I can go to 

6 your --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Each time you get -- you 

8 say that, you get back into the hole that Justice Kagan 

9 has been asking you to climb out of. If -- if Congress' 

intent was to bar discretion, then I'm not quite sure 

11 how you get to your alternative to get out of your --

12  MR. SHAH: Your Honor --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- overinclusiveness 

14 argument.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, this will bar 

16 discretion in the vast majority of cases, and here's 

17 why. -if I could go back to the data question that you 

18 asked, Justice Sotomayor, we do have Federal data, and I 

19 interpret the data a little bit differently than my 

colleague. 

21  What data we have is that, over the last 

22 decade, there have been over 60,000 convictions under --

23 under Section 841(a), for crimes involving something 

24 more than possession of marijuana. 60,000. There have 

been, in those 10 years, exactly 20 that have been

1 sentenced under Section 841(b)(4). 

2  My colleague combines 844(a), which is a 

3 possession offense, but if you isolate out of the data 

4 only those who qualify for the mitigating exception, 

those who are charged with distribution of marijuana, 

6 but only have a small amount of remuneration, you have 

7 20 out of over 60,000. 

8  I think this is a fairly atypical case. To 

9 the extent this Petitioner --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -- do you agree with 

11 Mr. Goldstein when he says, in reality, it's not an 

12 affirmative defense, that the defendant never has to 

13 prove the amount? 

14  MR. SHAH: I -- I don't agree with that 

because if it were, in fact, the case that the 

16 government had to disprove the -- the small amount and, 

17 more importantly, the remuneration element, that would 

18 be a very different statute. Every court of appeals and 

19 lots of the Federal --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, counselor. 

21 I -- the government can do it very easily. If you have 

22 less than an ounce of marijuana and nothing else from 

23 which you can infer an intent to sell or distribute, and 

24 you have no proof that this individual's engaged in drug 

trafficking, what more does a defendant have to show?

1  MR. SHAH: Oh, I --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does it raise his 

3 burden of proof? 

4  MR. SHAH: I'm not saying it -- the 

defendant has to show more. I believe Justice -- I 

6 thought Justice Ginsburg's question is what would the 

7 government have to show to disprove it. And I think --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I guess my point is 

9 that one, which is don't the facts that the government 

have either show it or not show it in virtually every 

11 instance? 

12  MR. SHAH: I think it's a very different 

13 question. If you put the burden on the government to 

14 show that, in fact, no remuneration was involved, the 

government would have to meet its burden in a criminal 

16 case to show beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no 

17 remuneration at all. That is going to change the result 

18 in a large number of cases where there is a relative --

19 it's going to be the universe of cases where there is a 

relatively small amount of drugs involved. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It would be less than an 

22 ounce. 

23  MR. SHAH: Right. But in -- and in that 

24 universe of cases, in fact, the presumption is probably 

going to be that it's not for a distribution or

1 remuneration. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go back to your 

3 substantive argument? 

4  MR. SHAH: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. This is a --

6 you are right. It's an unusually crafted statute. And 

7 really, what the issue is, generally, what you have with 

8 lesser included offenses is you have a base offense and 

9 then an enhancement that goes up. You commit the base 

offense --

11  MR. SHAH: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of burglary, but if 

13 you did it with an explosive or you did it with a 

14 dangerous weapon, it goes up.

 MR. SHAH: That's exactly right. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And applying the 

17 categorical approach is relatively easy there because 

18 either the State offense includes the addition or it 

19 doesn't.

 This is sort of in reverse. You've got a 

21 statute with the same elements that can be either a 

22 misdemeanor or a felony. And you're saying it can be 

23 either under the CSA, but we have to assume it's the 

24 greater because --

3  MR. SHAH: I -- I think it's because of the 

4 proper interpretation of the statute. Apprendi might 

have influenced that interpretation of the statute, but 

6 every court of appeals that has interpreted this statute 

7 has said that the -- the default punishment, is this 

8 punishable up to 5 years --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's under 

Apprendi. 

11  MR. SHAH: Well, both before and after 

12 Apprendi, Your Honor, this statute was interpreted the 

13 same way. Apprendi didn't change anything because there 

14 were no sentencing factors or elements --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the point. 

16  MR. SHAH: -- to get to the 5-year --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Didn't we -- didn't we 

18 talk about the categorical approach in footnote 3 of our 

19 case in Carachuri?

 MR. SHAH: Uh-huh. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where we said that, in 

22 talking about the generic Federal offense, whether it's 

23 a felony or not, that we can't look at just strictly the 

24 elements of the crime, but we have to also look at the 

sentencing factors because, when we're talking about

Official 

1 what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal 

2 law, we have to look at both. 

3  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, what Carachuri 

4 involved was something very different. It involved a 

recidivism factor, an aggravating factor. When you are 

6 talking about an aggravating factor, Apprendi 

7 jurisprudence has treated those somewhat equivalent to 

8 an element because it raises the statutory maximum. And 

9 so when you are trying to decide whether something is 

punishable as a felony, it's natural to look at the 

11 aggravating factor. 

12  The other thing I would say about Carachuri 

13 is that it's easily distinguishable on the grounds that 

14 Justice Ginsburg raised. It -- the government's 

argument in Carachuri was much more difficult. The 

16 government was trying to rely on a recidivism factor 

17 that was not part of the predicate conviction. And it 

18 was trying to rely on that factor to elevate what was 

19 otherwise a misdemeanor under both State and Federal law 

to a felony. 

21  Here, the predicate conviction itself has 

22 all the elements that are required for a Federal felony 

23 under the CSA, namely possession of marijuana and a 

24 specific intent to distribute it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the same elements

1 would go to the misdemeanor. Really, the issue for me 

2 is it could be one or both. And when do we tell the 

3 immigration judge that he can, should, or should not --

4  MR. SHAH: I think there are --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- choose between the 

6 two? 

7  MR. SHAH: I think there are -- I think 

8 there are two ways, Your Honor, that -- two different 

9 lines of reasoning that show that the government's 

approach to the categorical part of the inquiry is -- is 

11 the right approach and not Petitioner's approach. The 

12 first is --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: However you do it, the 

14 misdemeanor still has the same three elements.

 MR. SHAH: Well, here's -- here's how --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we choose 

17 between it being a misdemeanor or a felony? 

18  MR. SHAH: Right. I think here -- here are 

19 the two ways you get there. First is by looking at how 

this Court has consistently formulated the categorical 

21 inquiry. Starting with Taylor, pre-Apprendi case, 

22 compare the elements of the predicate offense to the 

23 those of the generic offense. 

24  Fast forward past Apprendi through all of 

the more recent cases, Lopez and not -- still the same

1 inquiry, focusing on the elements of the predicate and
 

2 the elements of the generic.
 

3  If that is not enough for you,
 

4 Justice Sotomayor, if there is still some uncertainty as
 

to when you have mitigating factors, like in this case, 

6 and the question is, well, does the predicate conviction 

7 have to affirmatively negate those narrow mitigating 

8 criteria, then this Court can look, if it wants to go to 

9 first principles, look at this Court's decision in 

Nijhawan. 

11  There, it had a different aggravating 

12 felony, certain fraud and deceit offenses which resulted 

13 in a $10,000 loss to the victim. What the Court said, 

14 look, fraud and deceit, those are clearly elements, we 

are going to apply the categorical approach to -- to 

16 figure out whether those elements are satisfied. But 

17 the $10,000 loss factor, we're not sure. We're not sure 

18 whether the predicate offense has to affirmatively 

19 establish it or not.

 And so what the Court did is it did a survey 

21 of the 50 States. It looked at the 50 States. And it 

22 turns out that, in a vast majority of those States, the 

23 predicate conviction will never establish that $10,000 

24 loss factor. And so you're going to have a vastly 

underinclusive aggravated felony.

1  And that's something that Congress -- that 

2 Congress could not have intended. The Court said 

3 Congress would not have intended its aggravated felony 

4 provision to apply in such a limited and haphazard 

manner. 

6  I submit that's exactly what you have here 

7 on pages 26 to 30 of our brief. And Petitioner does not 

8 take issue with a single one of the statutes that we 

9 cite. And we go through all 50 of them. We show that, 

in a clear majority of the States, the predicate 

11 conviction will not establish that there is remuneration 

12 or more than a small amount. 

13  Congress cannot --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, I think the 

problem with your main argument is that it leads you to 

16 a result that you don't want to accept because your main 

17 argument is all we've done in our past cases -- and I 

18 can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done 

19 is compare the elements.

 But if all we do is compare the elements, 

21 then we don't get to your discretionary scheme in which 

22 we also admit evidence of -- of the case-specific nature 

23 of the offense. 

24  I mean, so your arguments all go towards a 

very purist solution. And then you say, oh, no, that's

1 a crazy solution.  It's a crazy solution because we 

2 would wind up saying that misdemeanants, like this 

3 person, like people who are actually convicted under 

4 (b)(4) who are clearly misdemeanants, would wind up as 

aggravated felons and -- and must be deported. 

6  MR. SHAH: Well, well, first, Your Honor, I 

7 am glad that we have an agreement on the first part of 

8 the categorical inquiry because I think that is the main 

9 part of the inquiry that this -- that would establish --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't think we really have 

11 an agreement --

12  MR. SHAH: Okay. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because it seems to me 

14 that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to 

elements. But if we were just to look to elements in 

16 the way you're arguing for, we wouldn't get the result 

17 that you're arguing for. 

18  MR. SHAH: Again, Your Honor, I think you 

19 have to look at this particular aggravated felony, which 

I think is structured similar to other aggravated 

21 felonies in the INA. 

22  If you look at the aggravated felony in the 

23 INA that's on page -- top of page 34 of our brief, and 

24 that -- that is the one about document fraud crimes, it 

says the alien -- then, if the alien then shows that

25

Official 

1 that document fraud crime was perpetrated in order to 

2 help a family member, then no more aggravated felony. 

3  How does the alien make that showing? He 

4 comes into immigration court -- after it's already been 

established that you have the predicate document fraud 

6 felony, he comes into immigration court. He has to 

7 bring forth evidence on his own that shows that it 

8 satisfied this familial exception to that document fraud 

9 aggravated felony. I think the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the whole 

11 point -- the whole point is that there is no similar 

12 provision in the statute at issue in this case, right? 

13  MR. SHAH: I think the point is that there 

14 is a similar provision. In the -- the INA here 

incorporates the CSA to define the aggravated felony. 

16 The CSA says it's a felony if you have possession plus 

17 intent to distribute, unless the defendant shows -- and 

18 this is how it has been interpreted by every court of 

19 appeals that has interpreted the CSA -- unless the 

defendant shows it was only a small amount for no 

21 remuneration. 

22  That is an identical formulation to some of 

23 the other aggravated felonies in the provision. And how 

24 those other aggravated felony provisions have been 

interpreted is to allow the alien to come into

1 immigration court to show the exception. 

2  We are not aware of a single court decision 

3 that has ever interpreted any similar provision in any 

4 of the other aggravated felony provision to require the 

predicate conviction to affirmatively negate it.
 

6  And that's exactly what Petitioner's main
 

7 submission is, that this predicate conviction has to
 

8 affirmatively negate the possibility of a narrow
 

9 mitigating exception. That is --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't think that that is 

11 quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute, 

12 what it most looks like is that Congress is simply 

13 classifying two different kinds of conduct. 

14  Congress has the -- the social sharing 

conduct, and that's in one section. And the everything 

16 else, the more dangerous conduct, is in another section. 

17  And so it's not something where it's like, 

18 oh, you're trying to get them to negate a specific -- a 

19 point. Congress has created two separate sections, 

two -- and one is a felony, and one is a misdemeanor. 

21 And that's the -- the real way to understand this 

22 statute. 

23  And then the categorical approach suggests, 

24 well, in that case, we accept the underinclusion, rather 

than the overinclusion.

Official 

1  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I disagree with 

2 that characterization of that statute. Every court of 

3 appeals that has considered this statute has rejected 

4 the argument that we have two separate offenses and that 

the -- that the government, in order to get to the 

6 higher offense, the -- the default felony provision, 

7 that the government would have to treat as elements 

8 the -- the mitigating criteria of remuneration and small 

9 amount. Every court of appeals has rejected that.

 If this statute were drawn as you suggest, 

11 and it were elements of a crime, that is, you had two 

12 separate offenses, one is possession with intent to 

13 distribute a small amount for no remuneration, or it 

14 could just say possession with intent to distribute 

marijuana, if that was one distinct offense that was a 

16 misdemeanor, and then Congress created a second offense 

17 that says, in cases where there is more than a small 

18 amount, in which there is remuneration, then you get a 

19 five-year maximum instead of a one-year maximum, that is 

effectively making, as an element, the government to 

21 disprove both the possibility of no remuneration and 

22 more than a small amount. 

23  If that was the statutory scheme that were 

24 at issue, I would agree with you, Petitioner would 

prevail under the categorical approach. That's not

1 the -- that's not the statutory scheme here. 

2  They do not disagree with that. They --

3 they agree that every court of appeals that has 

4 interpreted this has interpreted it as one offense and 

that those mitigating criteria are just that, they are 

6 mitigating exceptions and not offense elements. 

7  I think the other point I would make, Your 

8 Honor, is that --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't understand, 

Mr. Shah. That seems just a question of labeling to me. 

11 I mean, why should we -- why should we accept that 

12 labeling, rather than, look, what Congress did here was 

13 to say that certain kinds of offenses are felonies 

14 deserving of grave punishment, and other kinds of 

offenses are misdemeanors deserving of less than a year 

16 in prison, and -- and we see those -- those categories 

17 of conduct differently. 

18  And if you are saying that if Congress 

19 had -- had said two separate offenses, then the 

categorical approach means that Mr. Goldstein's client 

21 wins, I guess I just don't get what in this statute 

22 suggests something different from that. 

23  MR. SHAH: Two things, Your Honor. One is I 

24 don't think it's a matter of labeling because Congress 

knows that these labels actually have big consequences.

6 where there is a small quantity, it may, in fact, be
 

7 difficult to disprove --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I thought that
 

when Congress enacted this provision, there was not the 

11 distinction between elements and sentencing factors that 

12 we now have, that the statute was enacted, in other 

13 words, before Apprendi. 

14  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, this statute was 

enacted before Apprendi, but Apprendi doesn't change the 

16 interpretation of this statute. This statute -- in the 

17 relevant criteria. 

18  This statute was interpreted -- interpreted 

19 both the same before and after Apprendi, with respect to 

the default provision, because the default provision 

21 doesn't require any factors or elements at all to get to 

22 the felony provision. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be, but it 

24 certainly goes to your argument that Congress had in 

mind some distinction between elements and sentencing

1 factors. 

2  MR. SHAH: Well, I think what Congress had 

3 in mind is that those mitigating criteria would not be 

4 treated as elements.

 And, Justice Kagan, to get back to your 

6 question, how do we know? Well, we can look at what --

7 the inquiry that the Court did in Nijhawan. It would 

8 not be -- it would not be consistent with Congressional 

9 intent to assume that Congress intended that this 

aggravated felony provision would not have any effect in 

11 the clear majority of States that do not make either 

12 remuneration or more than a small quantity an element of 

13 the offense. 

14  That is what Nijhawan was about. It was 

trying to figure out, did Congress intend this 

16 particular piece of the aggravated felony description to 

17 be subject to the categorical approach or not? That is, 

18 did it require the predicate conviction to establish or 

19 negate it? And the right way to look at that is to look 

at the State of the State laws. 

21  And here, we know that, in a clear majority 

22 of States, they do not require remuneration, they do not 

23 require more than a small amount. You will never get an 

24 aggravated felony conviction out of a majority of 

States. Congress could not have intended that result.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think that's --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You just say we're going 

7 to -- we're going to order you removed, unless you bring 

8 in evidence that this was a minor amount, period. 

9  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I -- I think that 

that -- I think that's an open question. That's one 

11 that has not come up yet. I think 

12 Congress specifically --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, don't you think 

14 it's -- it's, under the law and under administrative 

practice, that it's an option available to you? 

16  MR. SHAH: It may -- it may be -- be an 

17 option open to the Attorney General to do that. The 

18 Attorney General would have to issue an order to that 

19 ground. I imagine it would be challenged and we'd have 

to litigate it. But what we do know is that Congress 

21 didn't want those sort of discretionary determinations 

22 made. Congress knew that all of these areas --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, under the --

1 wouldn't permit the immigration judge to look at the 

2 plea allocution to determine the amount? 

3  MR. SHAH: I think the modified categorical 

4 approach would allow -- would allow --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that in -- in many of 

6 these cases that we're talking about, it is possible 

7 that the plea allocution itself would set out the 

8 amounts that the alien sold or show that he sold 

9 something --

MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, I think --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and that would take 

12 care of this issue of how many people are escaping 

13 automatic removal? 

14  MR. SHAH: I think if the -- the plea 

agreement or plea colloquy set forth the amount and it 

16 was more than a small amount, I think the modified --

17 our position would be that the modified categorical 

18 approach would allow you to reach that. 

19  Petitioner's and his amici's argument are 

essentially that the plea agreements aren't going to say 

21 that in a large majority of these cases, for the simple 

22 reason that a -- that a vast majority of the States 

23 don't make more than a small quantity an element of the 

24 crime, and so it's going to be irrelevant. But that

are other consequences that matter. For example, a 

16 person who's not -- a person is not only removable and 

17 not only deprived of cancellation relief. There --

18 those who are aggravated felons are just essentially 

19 deprived of all forms of discretionary relief, except 

for Convention Against Torture relief and withholding of 

21 removal. 

22  It also has implications beyond the 

23 immigration context. At the same time that Congress 

24 enacted this aggravated felony provision, it made it a 

sentencing enhancement provision in -- in criminal

1 prosecutions for illegal reentry. And so in any illegal 

2 reentry prosecution, if the defendant is also -- has a 

3 prior conviction for marijuana distribution, they would 

4 be subject to a significant sentencing enhancement under 

both the guidelines and Section 1326, the Illegal 

6 Reentry Statute. 

7  If Petitioner's rule were to prevail in a 

8 significant number of those cases, in any State in which 

9 it did not have those relevant elements, that sentencing 

enhancement would no longer have operative effect. 

11  So, Your Honor, it's not simply the case, as 

12 Petitioner would like to say, that the only thing here 

13 is -- is a difference between removability and 

14 cancellation of removal relief that the Attorney General 

can fix on his own. There are other ancillary 

16 consequences. And I think the criminal -- the 

17 consequence of the criminal prosecution is a significant 

18 one. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that -- does 

the Castro-Rodriguez proceeding take care of those 

21 additional consequences? 

22  MR. SHAH: If -- if I may respond, Your 

23 Honor? 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. Oh, yes.

 MR. SHAH: Thank you.

1  I don't -- I think what -- we haven't had 

2 any criminal cases where the -- where an alien has come 

3 in and tried to make the argument. I imagine, if 

4 Petitioner prevails, it will be made in every single one 

of those 1326 reentry prosecutions. 

6  I think, if the Court were to accept the 

7 Government's submission, both on the threshold 

8 categorical inquiry and on the tail-end fact-specific 

9 inquiry, I think a defendant would probably be able to 

have the opportunity to try to make that showing in the 

11 Federal sentencing proceeding as well. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

17  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I told 

18 you I was going to acknowledge the strengths of the 

19 other side's case. And I want to just recognize that 

you can conceivably read the statute their way. But the 

21 question is, if you actually adopt their statutory 

22 construction argument and you say we're going to look at 

23 the elements and it's an aggravated felony, we're 

24 comparing two different ways of reading it.

 And they admit that their way of reading the

Official 

1 statute comes up with an answer that Congress couldn't 

2 possibly have intended by treating all these 

3 misdemeanants as aggravated felons. 

4  Now, their solution is to add a whole 

'nother proceeding that isn't in the statute. Another 

6 solution is just to recognize their reading is wrong. 

7 If it produces this ridiculous result that Congress 

8 couldn't have intended, and our reading is perfectly 

9 sensible and not only do you have the solution of the 

removal proceedings, but also Justice Kennedy's 

11 suggestion of the Attorney General's ability to issue an 

12 order, Justice Sotomayor's solution of being able to 

13 look at the plea allocution, questions that aren't 

14 presented here, but lots of ways of addressing any 

adverse consequences of our rule. 

16  What in statutory construction allows us 

17 just to add this procedure that --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: But it's the word 

19 "punishable," I think.

 MR. SHAH: Well, "punishable" is a good 

21 word --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: So you're thinking, under 

23 Georgia law, this is punishable as a felony only if it 

24 wasn't a small amount used for personal use, you see, 

and therefore, they go into the hearing. 

62

1  It's not punishable as an 841 felony, unless 

2 those two things are absent, and therefore, they have 

3 the hearing to find out. And the word "punishable" 

4 doesn't appear in the statutes, the other ones that 

we've construed. That's what I thought they were doing. 

6  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. But I don't think 

7 that's actually what they're doing because Mr. Shah did 

8 not deny Justice Kagan's questions about, yeah, it would 

9 produce this ridiculous result, and so we're going to 

add this other proceeding. 

11  When they say -- what they do with 

12 punishable is they say look at only the elements of the 

13 Federal offense. And that's how they say that any 

14 Georgia conviction, even though, Justice Ginsburg, lots 

of these convictions will just be equivalents to Federal 

16 misdemeanors because they are the equivalent of --

17 because they involve possession with intent to 

18 distribute, those are the only elements of the offense, 

19 then they're all punishable as felonies, even if they 

would be a misdemeanor. 

21  So I don't think punishable helps them. And 

22 they don't seem to argue on the basis of punishable. So 

23 my base point to you is that why, in choosing between 

24 these two readings, we have strengths, they have 

strengths. Their argument starts from the proposition 

63

1 that theirs produces a result that Congress couldn't 

2 have intended. 

3  And, Mr. Chief Justice, they did start out 

4 with the hardcore position. I can give you the example. 

It's our case. Remember, even though this is 1.3 grams, 

6 even though he was not convicted of selling, they 

7 ordered him mandatorily deportable without an inquiry 

8 into the underlying facts. They recognize that can't be 

9 right. And so they are trying to tack something on to 

the statute that doesn't appear in the statute. 

11  The last point that I want to address is 

12 actually a very small one. And that's about 

13 Justice Thomas' dissent in the Lopez case on whether you 

14 should look to the State definition of whether this is a 

felony or instead, the Federal one, because the 

16 government cites it in a footnote in their brief. 

17  And we would only say that the government is 

18 not relying on the Lopez dissent. It invokes Lopez 

19 repeatedly in the Federal courts. And so this is a 

situation in which the Court's decision in Lopez should 

21 take hold as a matter of statutory -- stare decisis, and 

22 what matters here is the Federal treatment of it. 

23  When you don't know if the Georgia 

24 conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under Federal 

law, you don't know which one it is, what the

1 categorical rule says is that the State conviction 

2 doesn't necessarily establish it's a Federal offense, 

3 the Federal felony here, and therefore, you don't treat 

4 it that way.

 The -- the arguments that my friend ended 

6 with -- ended with about, hey, this is going to be 

7 applied in Federal sentencing and lots of other 

8 contexts, makes it worse, not better. How in the world 

9 are we going to have these others Castro-Rodriguez 

proceedings, these other intermediate proceedings about 

11 determining the facts of the offense in Federal 

12 sentencing? It gets vastly more complicated. 

13  Our rule addresses the core concern of 

14 Congress. It gets the right people deported. Their 

rule, because it's overinclusive, there will be 

16 noncitizens who can't prove their offense was a 

17 misdemeanor, and they shouldn't be removed. 

18  Thank you. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

counsel. 

21  The case is submitted.
