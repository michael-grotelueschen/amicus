 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in 

Spector against the Norwegian Cruise Line.

 Mr. Goldstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 The petitioners in this case are American 

citizens who took cruises to and from this country on 

tickets bought here that call for the application of U.S. 

law. They were subject to discrimination by respondent, a 

U.S.-based company on the land, in the ports, and in the 

waters of the United States.

 The question presented is whether the Americans 

With Disabilities Act applies or instead whether 

respondent's conduct is lawful because the case is 

controlled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruise 

lines to discriminate against persons with disabilities. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire 

of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU 

area, have applied their own disability laws to some of 

the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice O'Connor, our research

does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU. I 

can, however, provide you some information, and that is 

that -- two points I think. 

The first is they subscribe -- the members of 

the EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS 

just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary 

authority within its ports and internal waters. And I 

have a couple of case citations for you on this issue. In 

the ECJ, the Diva Navigation case, 1992, ECR I-6019, and 

the Mateo Peralta case, 1994, ECR I-3453.

 It has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen 

in Australia. Australia has a disability law. It applies 

that law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is 

that the port state law applies rather than the flag state 

law. And the citation for that is the Union Shipping 

case, 2002, NSWCA 124 CA 40379/01. I don't know what 

those numbers mean.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you. 

And would you also address at some point how the 

treaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the 

resolution here? For example, it has, as I understand it, 

requirements that there be watertight doors and those 

doors have to be set above the level of the floor so you 

couldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over 

it. Now, do you anticipate that there would have to be

structural changes if you were to prevail that would 

conflict with the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, and you have put your finger 

on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts. We 

know that for a couple of reasons.

 The first is that there has been a detailed 

rulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities 

charged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent 

quite some time. They have produced this single-spaced, 

half-inch thick document that is dedicated to making --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are they in effect yet?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They are not, but in terms of 

whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would 

conflict, you would look to this document and they took as 

their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such 

conflicts. What they did -- let me take your example 

specifically and then put -- place it within the statutory 

framework. 

Within the ADA and a question of the combings, 

what they said is, that's right. In certain cases SOLAS 

requires that the coamings be a certain height. If the 

coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be 

worried about water coming in below, that is not an 

accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it 

at all. Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp

down, unless that's structurally infeasible. So they --

what they did is they -- and this is the broader point. 

they applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the 

structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's 

readily achievable. And what the regulatory authorities 

determined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at 

all, that change need not be made. 

Now, you -- Justice O'Connor, you also focused 

on the fact that there are some of our claims that 

implicate the structure of the ship. They are, however, a 

distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this 

because I don't think the other side has any good argument 

at all, under international law or anything else, that 

would explain why they can charge a person with a 

disability double. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me just a little 

bit about that, how it works? Suppose that you prevail in 

this case -- and it does seem to me that the -- the 

charging the double doesn't involve modification of the 

ship, obviously. How does it work if you have, oh, say, 

an English passenger who buys an English ticket and is 

charged double -- I don't know if that's the English law, 

but let's assume -- then he comes on a cruise ship and he 

goes to New York and Miami and -- and New Orleans? Can he 

-- does he -- could he then sue, if -- if we rule for you

in this case? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I would think on the question of 

the charging double, the answer to that question would be 

no because it would present a traditional, not unique to 

the ADA, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in 

England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is 

going to be subject to English common -- in that case, the 

English disability law. There is an English disability 

law. It doesn't discuss cruise ships. It's -- but it's 

broadly written. 

But with respect to the structure of the ship, I 

think that English passenger with a disability -- say that 

you come across to the United States and you want to get 

off in New York. I think that Congress clearly intended 

that that person would be able to come off a -- off the 

dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the 

wheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're 

staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your 

accessible -- your accessible rest room, have grab bars. 

We are -- and -- and let me not pass too quickly 

by the fact that even when we talk about some structural 

changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about 

things that have nothing to do with -- Justice O'Connor, 

you focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life 

at Sea. Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has

nothing to do with that. Whether there is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, may -- may I 

take it from your answer that it doesn't make any 

difference in your view, your answer to the question about 

the -- the ship leaving from a port in England and going 

many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a 

voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast 

majority of the passengers are from the United States, the 

port of departure is in the United States, the port of 

return is in the United States. You don't seem to 

distinguish those cases because you say in the New York 

port, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S.-centered 

cruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else. 

Is that correct? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think your formulation is 

exactly right, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't matter to us 

where the cruise is centered. 

We do, however, and this Court's precedents do, 

however, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that I'm 

not aware exists. Take, for example, a situation in which 

a cruise comes from England to the United States. It 

doesn't pick up any passengers here. They just visit. 

They stop in 15 other countries. They stop here. The 

same passengers get up on the ship and leave. This 

Court's precedents involving maritime choice of law leave

room for the conclusion that says, look, we just don't 

think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we go back to what is 

the more usual situation --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are, in effect, 

saying that the U.S. rules the world. Even if the home 

port, the place where this vessel is usually berthed, says 

we -- we don't require our ships to take care of the 

handicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the 

other ports say, what the U.S. law is is going to govern 

because practically if you're going to design the ship to 

meet the U.S. requirements, you're not going to rip those 

out when the ship goes elsewhere. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, we disagree 

with the characterization that the U.S. rules the world, 

of course. We're talking about the fact that Congress 

exercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in 

its ports and internal waters, just as in -- take the 

Cunard example. In the Cunard case, there were countries 

-- and I understand it didn't involve the structure of the 

ship, but the principle is the same. There were countries 

that required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels, 

and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we could -- we could

require ships that are docked in the United States to pay 

their crews according to United States Jones Act 

requirements or United States minimum wage laws and so 

forth. We don't do that. We could do it, but we don't 

because it conflicts with -- with the law of the flag and 

-- and that's the usual -- it's not a matter of our power 

to do it. We could do it, of course, but it's just not 

something we ordinarily do.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, I actually 

disagree with your characterization and would like to 

point you to a couple of precedents. The Benz and 

McCulloch cases, which are very important to the 

respondents, were very important to the Fifth Circuit, 

embody the principle that you just described, to some 

extent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in 

our waters, we will not apply the NLRA to the labor 

contract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel. 

But when Americans are involved, we do apply the NLRA, and 

that's the Ariadne precedent that the -- and -- and in 

fact, Ariadne is the most on-point case because it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was that the ship or was 

it longshoremen?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It was longshoremen working on 

the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Longshoremen. Longshoremen

based -- based on shore. Right? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Based on shore, but so are the 

passengers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But it is a different situation, 

but I think it's more analogous. Not only were the -- the 

protests in Ariadne directed at the safety conditions on 

the foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the 

passengers. If I could --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's the scope of 

what you're talking about here? I mean, are -- it says 

cruise ships. So I had assumed those are those big ships 

that carry people mostly around the Mediterranean from 

Florida. But based on what you're saying, now I think 

you're talking about something more. Are you talking, for 

example, about a merchant vessel that comes from, say, 

Saudi Arabia and has a few passengers? What's the --

what's the scope of the definition?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- well, that -- the 

definition -- we would have to return to the ADA. If a 

merchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a 

specified form of public transportation or a public 

accommodation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because? It -- what it does is 

it carries oil, but a certain number of people like to be

on a ship with oil, I guess. And so every -- every month 

they take 12 people and they put them in a cabin somewhere 

and they love it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's cheaper. It's cheaper 

too. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm not aware of -- of --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I -- but all right. 

Now, I'm -- I'm being facetious. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But I am aware of -- of people 

who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily 

merchant ship. Now that -- that I think is a common 

thing.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If -- let me --

JUSTICE BREYER: Are you talking -- because I 

think that makes a difference for the reason that once you 

talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign-

flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the 

United States where the costs would be very high probably 

to change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be 

tiny. All right. So I -- I want to know what you're 

talking about. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Let me first say -- and 

just to -- to lock the point down in that cost is

accounted for in the definition of what is readily 

achievable. 

But let's go to the definition of specified public 

transportation because this will tell us what's going to 

be covered by the ADA. And just for the transcript, the 

citation is -- this is section 12181(110). It's -- it's 

very short, but it's at the middle of page 12 of the blue 

brief. Specified public transportation means 

transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance other 

than by aircraft, which has its own statute, that provides 

the general public with general or special service on a 

regular and continuing basis. That too would be covered. 

And only the public places on the ship would be covered by 

it.

 Can I just return briefly to my Ariadne point? 

Because I just wanted -- that's a case where the -- the 

NLRA was applied. And let me just read to you what the 

protest was that the NLRA was applied to because it fits 

perfectly with this case. And again, for the transcript, 

this is in the lower court opinion at 215 So.2d 53. This 

was the handbill. Warning. Is your cruise ship a 

floating death trap? Can a substandard foreign-flagged 

cruise ship turn your holiday into a Holocaust? They were 

very illiterate. If thousands of unsuspecting Americans 

continue to place their lives in jeopardy every day on

cruises aboard foreign-flagged floating fire traps. And 

that -- that was a foreign-flagged ship. They we're 

concerned about the passengers. 

Justice Scalia, you also gave the example of the 

Jones Act, but remember that the Rhoditis case and the 

Uravic case, which involved injuries in the United States, 

then the Jones Act did apply. And that was -- and 

Rhoditis was a case in which someone was on the ship and a 

chain broke and they were injured as a result of it, and 

U.S. law applied.

 This is a situation in which millions of people 

in the United States are spending billions of dollars on 

cruises, and it seems --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I -- if I understand 

you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise 

ships. It's limited to ships that come into -- passenger 

ships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen 

Elizabeth, all the rest of them. Wouldn't it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, but I -- I take it that the 

-- you know --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the fact that it's based 

in Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not 

relevant to the legal issue. Is it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it is in the sense that it 

makes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have

been aware of when it enacted the ADA in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, they would 

have been aware of those that are also less American in 

their patronage and so forth.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's true. In the very rare 

case, which I am not aware of, in which a cruise ship 

comes to the United States, doesn't pick up passengers, 

then it's possible that the -- that the ADA would not 

apply. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but we're not necessarily 

thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner 

that goes from Liverpool to Miami or something. That 

would be covered. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It would in -- in U.S. 

territory. That's right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But there's no way they can 

change the ship structurally when it's in New York and not 

have it changed structurally when it's in Europe. So the 

mystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of 

ships that I would not say fit the ordinary word cruise. 

What they are are ships that go between Asia and San 

Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York and Europe, or maybe 

through the Suez Canal. They're only here a little bit of 

the time. Their passengers are mostly not American. 

Now, is that something I should worry about? If

that were your case, I would be very worried. If that's 

just a little bit of -- of added significance, then I want 

to know what to do about it.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me tell you what I know, and 

that is that the other side has not identified any 

problems of this -- this type. My research has not 

revealed some situation where we have a lot of these 

ships. I did carefully study the -- the itineraries of 

the major cruise lines, and 95 percent-plus of all of 

their trips go out from the United States and come back to 

the United States. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you told me -- and I want 

to make sure this is your answer -- that it doesn't 

matter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as 

part of this overall journey, you -- you answered that 

question and I thought that was your candid answer, that 

it doesn't matter that these -- these particular cruise 

ships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are 

centered, even have their principal place of business in 

the United States. You're not concentrating on that 

category. You are saying that the ADA applies so long as 

the ship puts in at -- at a U.S. port, picks up 

passengers. It applies not only while it's in the port,

world on what -- your argument you made. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, here I think 

is the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may 

have an extraterritorial consequence, just like our 

maritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe 

enforce the ADA. The fact that the structural changes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can enforce the --

the discrimination provisions, but the structural 

provisions don't have to be enforced. Once the step is 

changed, they're not going to change it when they get 3 

miles out.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. But Justice --

Justice Ginsburg's point -- I take it to be a more 

particular one. It's true that our law will have 

consequences abroad, but it is not the case that the U.S. 

rules the world. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it rules the world unless 

the world does not want to use the United States ports as 

ports of call.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice -- Justice Souter, I --

I simply disagree, and that is, when you talk about the 

U.S. ruling the world, in a -- in the context, say, of 

ARAMCO, we talked about the enforceability of U.S. law 

abroad. When the United States has tort standards or 

vehicle manufacturing standards and the like, all of those

have consequences abroad for how devices are made and 

brought into the country. But that doesn't mean that --

what's going on is the plenary authority of the United 

States to enforce its laws in its ports and in its 

internal waters. That very rule always will have 

extraterritorial consequences. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not questioning the 

authority. We're questioning whether Congress intended 

that to be the case. We have a rule that -- that requires 

a clear statement when it has effects of this sort.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, we disagree, and 

let me just take you to your cases. I did that, I think, 

in the Jones Act and the NLRA context. But let's just 

state the rule, and that is, from the Wildenhus's Case and 

that's at page 12. Foreign law governs matters of 

discipline and all things done on board which affected 

only the vessel and those belonging to her and did not 

involve the peace or dignity of the country or the 

tranquility of the port. And what we're talking --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Goldstein, there's 

another aspect that troubles me. Your view, as I 

understand, only applies while the ship is in American 

waters so that if, for example, you complain about the 

training for a safety drill, if they conducted those after 

they'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be -- there

would be no violation of the -- the statue. Would there?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is -- that is a difficult 

question. We have not -- we have not pleaded such a 

claim. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, I'm trying to 

understand. You don't know what your position is --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with respect to what would 

otherwise be violations of the statute that occur on the 

high seas. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do believe it would be 

covered because the accommodation was purchased here, 

although we haven't raised the claim in this Court.

 If I could reserve the remainder --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I think we should --

the cruise ships are entitled to know whether they may 

freely discriminate against people in the casinos and so 

forth when they're on the high seas. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: We --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't know the answer to 

that.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, our position is 

that because of the definition of commerce in the ADA, 

when you purchase a public accommodation in the United 

States, that is an agreement to provide a public

JUSTICE STEVENS: So your view is not limited to 

what happens in the territorial waters. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is right, although we have 

-- we would win the case on the internal waters and the 

territorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this Court 

a claim relating to the high seas. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, may I ask before 

you begin whether the United States agrees that the 

statute would apply to the activities of these ships when 

they're on the high seas?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SALMONS: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 We do not think that title III of the ADA was 

intended to apply extraterritorially. That said, we think 

there is a question that would need to be resolved as to 

whether applying the ADA to a public accommodation that 

was entered into in the United States, that began in the 

United States, a necessary term of which we believe would 

be nondiscrimination, would in fact be an extraterritorial 

application of U.S. law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when the ship is out on 

the high seas?

 MR. SALMONS: That's correct, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's a hard 

question --

MR. SALMONS: No. We think the better view --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether that's an 

extraterritorial application of U.S. law?

 MR. SALMONS: No. We think the better view, in 

fact, Justice Scalia, is that that would not be an 

extraterritorial application of U.S. law. But if the 

Court were to disagree, then we would say title III does 

not apply at that time. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what 

extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean 

that, that a ship that is not in the United States is 

bound by United States law. What -- why isn't that 

extraterritorial application?

 MR. SALMONS: The reason, Justice Scalia, would 

be because the accommodation that was offered, that was 

entered into, and that began in the United States -- and 

-- and I would point out -- I think this is important to 

keep in mind --

statutory provisions would be an implied term. Isn't that 

it?

 MR. SALMONS: Yes. Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It does not apply of its own 

force. It applies because two parties in the United 

States contracted that it would apply. Is that it?

 MR. SALMONS: That's correct. Now -- now, I --

I would just add that I think it -- you could characterize 

a public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, for 

example. If that's entered into in the United States and 

-- and that begins in the United States, that a necessary 

term of that is nondiscrimination, and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then if you --

MR. SALMONS: -- if you have an ADA claim that 

governs that even if the discrimination occurred abroad, 

that would only relate to those things tied into the 

accommodation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you're on a round trip 

ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend 

on where you bought the ticket.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, again, we -- we think that 

if accommodation begins here in the United States, that --

that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination. Now,

whether you characterize that as a contract claim or as a 

substantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there's 

much of a difference. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Justice Stevens' 

question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool. Is the ADA 

-- an -- an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to come 

to the United States. 

MR. SALMONS: To come to the United States. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the ADA an applied term of 

that contract?

 MR. SALMONS: I would -- I would assume not, 

although the question then would be whether or not it's a 

public accommodation that's been offered in the United 

States. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't -- don't all --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even in U.S. waters? That 

wouldn't make sense. An American buys a ticket in -- in 

Liverpool. He's disabled. He goes to New York, Miami, 

New Orleans, and he's discriminated at -- at each step. 

No -- no coverage just because of where he bought the 

ticket?

 MR. SALMONS: No, no, Justice Kennedy, that's 

not our position. Let me -- let me try and be clear. We 

think that any vessel that comes into the internal waters 

and ports of the United States and offers a public

accommodation or a specified public transportation service

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that means --

MR. SALMONS: If -- if you had a situation --

I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, go ahead. 

MR. SALMONS: If you had a situation where you 

had a ship that -- let's say, that began in -- in Great 

Britain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here 

in the United States, I think that the better view would 

be, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's 

in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter, 

with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a 

public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA because 

it's not an accommodation that's offered --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you --

MR. SALMONS: -- or available to United States 

residents. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Mr. 

Goldstein that nothing turns on -- one might characterize 

this kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer was 

as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick 

up, they unload passengers, they take them back again on 

the ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port,

letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies? 

Do you agree with that interpretation?

 MR. SALMONS: As I understand what Your Honor 

just said, I think that I would. Let me just clarify, 

though. We think the relevant question is whether that 

ship would -- has offered a public accommodation or a 

specified public transportation service --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is my --

MR. SALMONS: -- in the United States, and if 

the answer is yes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let -- let me ask you the 

same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the 

Cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have 

liquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go 

to Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have 

liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they 

enter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor 

aboard.

 Here what you're saying is what goes in the --

for the New York port goes for every other place where 

this ship puts in.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, again, I -- not as a matter 

of -- not as a matter of extraterritorial application of 

U.S. law, but that is our position with regard to a public 

accommodation that begins in the United States. I -- I

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it doesn't begin in 

the United States in that it -- it starts in, say, The 

Bahamas, and stops at --

MR. SALMONS: I should probably should not have 

said begin, Your Honor. What I mean is if it -- if the 

public accommodation is provided for in the United States, 

that would be covered by the terms of the ADA, we think 

the ADA applies. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying exactly what 

everybody is worried about. I take it there is no way 

really for a ship to -- they either have the right door or 

they don't have the right door. And we're interested in 

the set of cases in which they're going to have to change 

their doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're 

talking about ships that pick up people and sail in 

Florida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the -- now, 

I've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those. 

We are talking about ships like I'm the last human being 

alive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay? 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: 50 years ago. And -- and we're 

talking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant 

ships that also say to the public, come as a passenger. 

Now, I would like to -- not what you're arguing.

You're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to 

know -- say something to relieve my concern about that 

set, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying 

to rule the world in respect to those ships that only come 

here occasionally or it isn't a big part of their 

business, but they want to come to pick up American 

passengers. 

MR. SALMONS: Sure. Sure. And what I would say 

with regard to that is that you're right that our broad 

view is that the ADA applies if that -- if they're 

offering public accommodation here in the United States.

 But if you reject that, I think there are 

several ways you could approach that. One would be to 

apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are -- that 

are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you 

know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient 

contacts here and whether or not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that this 

is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll 

reject your position?

 MR. SALMONS: No, no. He asked me to say 

something that -- that would -- would help his concerns. 

What I'm trying to say --

JUSTICE BREYER: One thing might be true, what 

you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of

those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're 

not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of 

those ships that there are are already subject to tougher 

-- tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say 

either of those. 

MR. SALMONS: No. No --

JUSTICE BREYER: Since you don't you say either 

of those, I think neither may be true. 

MR. SALMONS: Well, I don't know the specific 

number. I would think that there are not many that the --

that this -- what you're concerned with primarily here are 

cruise ships that are in the business of providing public 

accommodations. 

But I would add as well -- and I think this is 

very important that the Court keep in mind -- that the 

clear statement rule, as it's -- as it's posited by 

respondent here, would not just apply to the ADA. It 

would apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title 

II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its prohibition of 

racial discrimination, and I would find that that would be 

a remarkable construction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what -- what kind 

of laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew 

to be treated differently are -- are quite different from 

law -- laws that -- that require a passenger to be treated

a certain way in the United States. 

MR. SALMONS: Justice Scalia, you're correct, 

and that's precisely why they have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And laws -- laws that require 

structural alteration of a ship are quite different from 

laws that say while you're in United States waters, you 

won't discriminate on the basis of race.

 MR. SALMONS: If -- two -- two responses, if I 

may, Your Honor. And that is, if you -- if that is the 

conclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this 

case because there are an awful number of claims that are 

precisely those kinds of claims that the Fifth Circuit 

would not allow.

 Secondly, I think you're wrong with regard to 

the scope of the clear statement requirement. There is no 

requirement that you have to have a clear statement to 

apply a U.S. law to a foreign vessel. There is only a 

requirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct 

at issue would relate only to the internal matters of that 

vessel. And here you're dealing with public 

accommodation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If we haven't expressed it yet, 

we ought to express it then. 

MR. SALMONS: Well, I disagree, Your Honor. And 

what I would point you to is -- is that the long -- every

time this Court has spoken with regard to the clear 

statement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships, 

it has referred to the internal order doctrine. And that 

is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go 

back for centuries. The -- the treaty that was at issue 

in the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the -- if 

the conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to 

passengers or other members of the port state or otherwise 

affected the interests of the port state, that the port 

state law would apply. And that is the general rule. 

The international regime that governs this area 

by its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it 

available to port states and to flag states to add 

additional requirements. That would mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salmons, one of the 

alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear 

statement, but as a -- a response to the issue that was 

being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that 

it was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of 

the -- of the commerce power. And The -- The Bahamas 

respond to that by saying you could have said exactly --

or argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is 

your response to that?

 MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I would disagree with 

that on -- on a couple of respects. The first is that the

definition of commerce here is broader than it was and 

specifically refers to travel between the United States 

and foreign countries. The only other statute we're aware 

of that says that is title II of the Civil Rights Act of 

1964.

 In addition --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, may I just ask you a -- a 

factual question? I didn't go back to the text to check 

this. Does the text of this statute say in these words 

basically we are exercising the fullest possible extent of 

the commerce power?

 MR. SALMONS: Absolutely, Justice Souter. What 

-- what the text of the statute says --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And it's not in McCulloch.

 MR. SALMONS: That's correct. What the text of 

this statute says is that -- in fact, this is the 

definition of commerce that relates only to title III of 

ADA. And it says precisely that it includes travel 

between foreign countries and the United States and that 

Congress was intending to -- to reach the full sweep of 

its -- its constitutional authority.

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and 

may it please the Court:

 This case is about congressional intent not 

congressional power. Congress undoubtedly has the 

power --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could you address the last 

point?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. It was not the fullest 

extent of the commerce power. That statute was at issue 

in this Court's case concerning the Lanham Act where the 

Court said that a violation of the Lanham Act that 

occurred in Mexico but had an effect in the United States 

was intended to be covered by Congress because that 

commerce clause, Justice Souter, did state to the fullest 

extent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of the 

Constitution. 

This statute does not say that. This statute 

talks about commerce in and between States and 

territories, and it is much closer to the statute language 

that this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case where --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it -- it doesn't have the 

fullest extent language then. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it compare to title

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there are slight 

differences in the language, but I don't think that's 

dispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 

which this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court 

-- the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that 

language was not enough to express the intent. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would be the same for 

title II, which is the public accommodations part of the 

Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are 

saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the 

ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public 

accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would 

be inapplicable.

 MR. FREDERICK: It's all a question of 

congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no 

indication of an intent that Congress needed to address 

any problem that arose with respect to that form of 

discrimination. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your -- but your answer 

is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in 

at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its 

passengers on the basis of race. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, there would be no U.S. 

congressional statute that would address that, Justice 

Ginsburg. There would be a violation of the Bahamian

constitution which prohibits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the U.S. law 

and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in 

places of public accommodation.

 MR. FREDERICK: As I said, I'm not aware that 

there has ever been an instance of that in the cruise 

industry. Congress has not addressed that. We're talking 

about foreign ships here.

 And I want to get back to the structural 

features of the ship because the ADA fundamentally --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but this is a good 

question, and what is your position? That the ship could 

engage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the 

selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations 

while in U.S. ports and within the 3 --

MR. FREDERICK: Justice O'Connor, our position 

is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so 

there is no congressional statute that is on point. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then your answer, I take it, is 

yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because 

Congress has not told it not to. Is that it?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. No. Our position is that 

it can't discriminate because a different law proscribes 

that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So far as United States law is

concerned, it could. 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the same answer for 1981?

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, as I said, 

Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach of 

U.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that 

position ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, 

The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's put it this way. 

So my understanding of your answer is that we could write 

an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other 

questions open? I don't see how we can do that.

 MR. FREDERICK: What you say, Justice Kennedy, 

is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say 

when it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel. 

Congress didn't do that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if I'm writing the opinion 

and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that 

I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in 

the negative.

 MR. FREDERICK: You do, Justice Kennedy. And 

just as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VII 

doesn't apply to the foreign -- work in a foreign land by 

an American company of an American --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But these --

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't 

extended criminal laws of the United States to the full 

reach of U.S. power. It is only proscribed 15 offenses 

that will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, this is --

this is what concerns me about your answer. I know that 

Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter 

what kind of operation this is, but the operation that 

we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what 

percentage of its passengers are from the USA? 

MR. FREDERICK: Approximately two-thirds to 

three-quarters in any given year. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does it normally start 

the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?

 MR. FREDERICK: The majority of them do. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how much of its 

advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers? 

MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, there -- all 

of those questions are going to be answered as a 

predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the 

U.S. market. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this is the anomaly. 

You're asking us to buy an interpretation. An enterprise 

is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business 

and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is

our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to 

customers, passengers, and employment.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the reason, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on 

vessels that go to other ports. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you -- why don't you 

try to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the 

applicability or not may depend upon whether you're 

dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're 

dealing with an American who happens to be injured on 

board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the 

anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least 

in some of its applications requires structural changes or 

not? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply, 

but would not compel you to say that title II doesn't 

apply.

 MR. FREDERICK: We are talking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not willing to take such 

a limited position. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, I think 

the Court could certainly carve out in its clear --

articulation of the clear statement principle some of 

these lines. It becomes very --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the ADA itself makes an 

exception for things that aren't readily achievable. I

mean, you could certainly lean on that because a 

structural change probably isn't readily achievable.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice O'Connor, Congress, when 

it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of 

cost. It didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws 

of other nations or --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there -- I mean, 

you're giving me the answer I thought the other side 

would give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: You say that two-thirds of 

these people, the customers, are American. So we're 

dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a 

business like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional 

cases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem 

because of structural changes we'll have to make. What 

changes? That is to say, I would have thought I could 

have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe 

also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and 

therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr. 

Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your 

clients will have to make any significant structural 

change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's the response to

that? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, that's completely false. 

In -- in the year 2000, the United States Government 

issued a report that contained an extensive appendix, 

which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious 

detail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and 

SOLAS. 

Now, I can give you some specifics, if you would 

-- that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires 

under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that 

there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the 

ship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities 

be placed near evacuation points. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why can't you just 

fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably 

achievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what 

you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a 

disabled person double the price --

MR. FREDERICK: As a matter of fact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because they're a nuisance. 

And that's your position.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kennedy, as a matter of 

fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination 

here. We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming 

the -- the allegations are true, but they are

categorically false. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't matter what 

you want to do as a matter of good will. The question is 

what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up 

to us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti-

discrimination law.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, what the other 

side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in 

which a district judge becomes the special master of the 

cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that 

would require some modification to the ship --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That happens to every employer 

under -- in the United States under the reasonably 

achievable standard.

 MR. FREDERICK: And that's why, Justice Kennedy, 

it's a question of congressional intent. The very same 

Congress debated extensively about whether to impose 

design requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution 

Act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international 

system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that 

double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil 

tankers. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, that brings up 

a question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent 

was this whole problem of the application of this statute

to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative 

history of these statutes?

 MR. FREDERICK: Zero. There is not one word 

about vessel --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If -- if that's so 

and if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could 

get out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries 

to do what it really would have thought Congress would 

have intended in the circumstances. And if that's so, why 

wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business 

that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?

 MR. FREDERICK: Because it was encroaching on an 

area of foreign sovereignty. Foreign ships are governed 

by foreign laws. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Does -- does Britain -- or does 

Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid 

you to charge this double price? 

MR. FREDERICK: I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Does European law -- I'd be 

surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know? 

MR. FREDERICK: I -- I don't know the answer to 

European law on charging of an additional price, but I 

would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures, 

do go to the structure of the vessel. And we're talking 

here fundamentally in the ADA about structural changes

that they want to impose that go -- when ships travel, 

they can't dismantle those structural changes when they 

leave U.S. waters. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- may I ask this question 

to you? What about a -- an American-flagged ship? Does 

the statute apply or not?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved 

that question. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view?

 MR. FREDERICK: Our view is that there are 

arguments that can be made that it does not because 

Congress didn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view? Not what 

arguments can be made. What is your view? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think --

(Laughter.) 

MR. FREDERICK: No. I think our view is that it 

doesn't. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It does not apply.

 MR. FREDERICK: It does not apply because 

Congress didn't express the intent. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So really, we're not concerned 

with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're 

concerned with the fact it's a ship.

 MR. FREDERICK: The -- there's a difference and

-- and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carry 

passengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to 

the question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have 

distinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law 

directly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a 

different law. The fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we need -- do we need a 

clear statement for United States ships? I thought your 

case rested on a clear statement requirement. Is there 

any clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?

 MR. FREDERICK: No, no, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So why -- why isn't there a 

clear difference between the two?

 MR. FREDERICK: Because there aren't any words 

in the statute that go to ships. The best they can do is 

a catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any other 

means of conveyance. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's pretty good, isn't 

it? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, it's not --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you don't require a clear 

statement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.

fact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the 

world and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch 

at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so 

clearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity 

with respect to American ships.

 MR. FREDERICK: With respect to foreign ships, 

there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement 

rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is 

governed by the law of the flag state where it is 

registered. That's been the rule for 200 years. 

And the other side's position --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is that limited, 

though, just to things that affect the internal order of 

the ship? Is that the context in which we've articulated 

that rule?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it's been articulated in 

several different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne 

case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case 

where the Court said that a patented device on the ship, 

which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an 

American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law. 

And the Court said, because we can't conceive that 

Congress would have imagined this general language to 

encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship.

say about that case, but that is the case that is directly 

on point because that case says that when you are dealing 

with American laws that are generally written, you would 

not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless 

Congress said so specifically. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but in that case, there 

was -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship 

of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing 

object and the ship in the United States. So it at least 

made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed 

to external relationships arguably involving -- or 

implicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite 

situation here. You've got contracts made in the United 

States with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that 

in your patent case. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Souter, you have a 

foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a 

foreign country under foreign engineering standards --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: With its principal place of 

business in the United States. 

MR. FREDERICK: For a time before that ship 

moves into another market.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But its significant external --

its significant commercial relationships are in the United

States with people in the United States performed 

partially in the United States. 

MR. FREDERICK: In just the same way that 

McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course 

of business that is regular between Honduras and the 

United States is not going to be sufficient to apply --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The crew members were 

Honduran in that case.

 MR. FREDERICK: They were. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- if you just look at 

it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this 

operation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it. 

The passengers are from the USA. The company is centered 

in Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience 

that it flies which can legitimately govern the 

relationship with its crew. But to say that it governs 

the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very 

strange.

 And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're 

going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and 

under U.S. law to boot. 

MR. FREDERICK: But a choice-of-law clause, 

Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law 

in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be 

incorporated. I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause

that -- that simply takes in every domestic statute. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just -- it's just one other 

indicia that one looks at this operation and says this 

belongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would 

come down there. 

MR. FREDERICK: And -- and you would have --

under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products 

Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of 

other statutes of general application that are now going 

to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a 

lot of business in the United States. 

The problem here, as a matter of congressional 

intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this, 

and because Congress --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we -- we do -- we do 

have the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal 

operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is 

concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may 

well be governed by the law of the flag.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the internal operations of 

the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is 

designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the 

cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how --

everything about the ship's design --

not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be 

fought out under the reasonably achievable --

MR. FREDERICK: It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy, 

the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport 

with the language of -- of the statute. Congress didn't 

think in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act, 

it said, if there's a conflict with international law, 

work it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations 

and work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like 

that in this statute, which is a further indication that 

if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability 

protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so 

willingly. 

And the Government has had 13 years to come up 

with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best 

they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in 

this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft 

guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the 

regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an 

application to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress 

wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this 

Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic 

legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has 

not expressed the intent to do that.

a cargo boat?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. I don't perceive a 

limiting principle to the other side's position. In fact, 

there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or 

two stops in the United States a year, and under their 

view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well. 

If -- if Congress wants to enact these limits, 

it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex 

area and ships are different from land-based 

accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate 

people within 30 minutes. And so when we train people, we 

have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it -- on the other 

-- on the other side of the coin, apart from the 

structural problem -- and I understand the arguments on 

both sides there. With respect to things like safety 

drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it 

seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll 

just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no 

conflict with the statute when we're out there.

 MR. FREDERICK: As a matter of fact, Justice

Stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a 

different way. We have special access and assistance 

squads that go to persons with physical challenges to get 

them off the vessel in an event of a -- a need for 

evacuation. That's a different procedure than most 

passengers, but it's -- it is one that is in place. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Frederick.

 Mr. Garre.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE BAHAMAS,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may 

it please the Court:

 Applying title III of the Americans With 

Disabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would invite 

precisely the sort of international discord, conflict, and 

confusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when it 

writes American laws. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Mr. 

Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act 

of 1964? I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit 

discrimination.

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, first let me make 

clear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its 

cruise vessels are governed by that prohibition.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the 

application of U.S. law.

 MR. GARRE: We think that that question can be 

resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested, 

which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes 

to the internal affairs of the ship -- and there -- we 

would suggest that there is more central to the internal 

affairs of the ship than its construction and design. 

Under international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law 

of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has 

ratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and 

that's an important principle for this Court to keep in 

mind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different 

international treaties than the United States. So simply 

trying to draw some conflict resolution device that would 

deal with treaties that the United States has entered 

into, international nations have not will not address that 

problem. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So before you go on to that, 

I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil 

Rights Act of '64. There's -- you say, well, that's 

easier to comply with. But that's not the principle under 

which you're operating. 

MR. GARRE: No. With respect, Justice Ginsburg, 

our principle is that when it comes to the matters that

under international law have been traditionally governed 

by the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we 

presume that unless Congress clearly indicates an 

affirmative intention to address those matters, it did not 

intend to. When Congress wrote the ADA, not a word of the 

statute indicates that it considered the international 

repercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged 

vessels. Not a word --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What about the -- what about 

the full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle 

on that. You -- you say the full sweep argument is no 

good because the same thing could have been made in 

McCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's the full sweep 

argument? I don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Full sweep of the commerce 

power. 

MR. GARRE: Justice Souter, first of all, it's 

-- it -- the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says 

sweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's 

reprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief. 

And second of all, the definition of Congress, 

which doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost 

identical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch, 

which is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that

definition, the United States argued in the McCulloch 

case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to 

foreign-flagged vessels. 

It's important to understand the -- the 

potential international conflicts that extending the ADA 

to foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more 

than 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws 

for the disabled. Three nations have -- have adopted laws 

for domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If 

a country like the United States extended its laws to 

foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations 

may well follow suit. 

And if you take a simple hypothetical example, 

the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New 

York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has 

adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain 

different structural and design requirements than the 

draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated. 

There are different requirements for door widths. There 

are different requirements for sloping. There's different 

requirements for the watertight compartments. There are 

different requirements about whether vessels have to be --

have accessible cabins all throughout the ship. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say different, you 

mean you cannot comply with both.

 MR. GARRE: Well --

or are those just minimums and -- and the United States

 MR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, I think in some you 

could and in others you couldn't. And -- and that's an 

important -- important point. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And incidentally just for the 

-- are -- this ship has -- these are regulations that help 

the disabled?

 MR. GARRE: Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. And 

-- and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which 

regulation is going to be more accommodating to the 

disabled and which is not. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Could they work that out? That 

is, if two-thirds of our universe really is American-

based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking 

about conflicts in -- real conflicts that -- that affect, 

say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas 

like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities 

get together and they try to write memoranda that -- that 

work this out in a reasonable way. Could -- could the 

same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?

 MR. GARRE: We don't think so, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. GARRE: We would take the same approach that 

this Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which 

is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak 

havoc for the question whether a significant regulation 

like the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign 

vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they 

have to undertake the extraordinary changes --

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer would be yes, you 

do. You do have to, and then if there's some other 

authority that wants to get involved in this, the two 

authorities would work it out.

 MR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, the way that those 

issues are worked out in the international shipping 

context is through the International Maritime 

Organization. This organization has been responsible for 

crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping 

codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of 

accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly. 

We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those 

guidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines, 

but they could well become binding guidelines. And when 

an organization like the IMO addresses this question, it 

resolves --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's perfect because then the 

Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding

international rule, anything that conflicts with that will 

be viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have 

to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with 

American law, according to them. 

MR. GARRE: Well, we don't think the readily 

achievable language in the first case in any way 

contemplates conflicts with international law. This Court 

has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country 

that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with 

international obligations or international laws, including 

customary international law, as you wrote for the Court 

last term in -- in the Empagran case. We presume that 

American legislatures give respect to the interests of 

sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't 

assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign 

interests of other nations. And that's what extending the 

ADA to foreign-flagged ships would do. 

The Bahamian Government has a solemn 

responsibility under international law and under its own 

law to govern the construction and design of all flags of 

all ships that fly -- fly its flags. Article 10 of the 

Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag 

states have responsibility for the construction and design 

of ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions 

specifies that flag states have responsibility over

administrative, technical, and labor matters, including 

construction and design matters. These are precisely the 

sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has 

been responsible for. And in the Brown v. Duchesne case, 

this Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the 

application of patent laws to the construction and design 

of a foreign-flagged vessels.

 There are going to be conflicts within --

between international law and the requirements of the ADA, 

but first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's 

been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we 

don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply. 

And in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to 

have to be reviewing the case law in the United States 

courts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design 

specification-by-design specification as to what standards 

apply. That's only going to create additional 

international discord and confusion. 

Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we 

think is telling. They urge this Court in their reply 

brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to 

foreign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow 

suit and you have a crazy made -- maze of different 

regulations applying to construction and design, then at 

that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it

to clean up the mess. 

With respect, we think they have it backwards. 

The purpose of the IMO and the international framework 

that exists for governing regulation of shipping is to 

establish a uniform set of rules in the first instance. 

The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue 

in this case, accessibility for the disabled. They are 

available to address that in a multilateral fashion.

 And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no 

indication that it weighed any of the international 

repercussions of the action that petitioners urges the 

case -- petitioners urge the Court to take in this case. 

And we would urge this Court to return this matter to 

Congress. Congress is in the position to weigh the risk 

of international confusion, to weigh the potential for 

international discord and to address those matters as it 

sees -- sees fit. 

If there are no further questions.

where this Court built in comity considerations, relying

ships, it said, look, even if the text of the Sherman Act 

or the FTAIA could literally reach it, in these cases that 

we don't think Congress could have conceived of, we're not 

going to apply the statute. 

But here, we have a situation in which this 

company has 95 percent of its cruises going in and out 

from the United States. Millions of people, and billions 

of dollars in commerce are affected by this statute and 

Americans that Congress had to have in mind.
