 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver.

 Ms. Spillars.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA K. SPILLARS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SPILLARS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 While this Court has laid out a framework 

for reviewing prosecutors' closing arguments, the 

fairness standard established in Donnelly and Darden is 

by its nature a very general standard. Under this 

Court's interpretation of AEDPA, the State court should 

therefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes. 

Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit afforded no deference 

to the Missouri Supreme Court's decision. Instead, its 

improperly substituted its own evaluation for the 

comments, looking at each of them in isolation and 

without considering the totality of the proceedings.

 That decision was wrong not only because the 

court of appeals failed to properly afford deference to 

the State court, but because when viewed within the 

entire proceedings the prosecutor's closing arguments 

did not deprive the Respondent of a fair trial.

Applying AEDPA correctly, the Missouri 

Supreme Court decision was well within reason given, 

one, the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness 

and the fact that this Court has never applied that 

standard to a penalty phase closing argument; and, two, 

because, considering the record in the entire 

proceedings of this case, the Respondent was not 

deprived of fundamental fairness.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we didn't --

haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument, 

but we've certainly applied the general standard to the 

penalty phase.

 MS. SPILLARS: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And it's certainly is not our argument that it would not 

apply to the penalty phase. However, there simply may 

be other considerations, because the fundamental 

fairness standard essentially answers the question, did 

the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they 

base it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one sort of 

preliminary question. Supposing the prosecutor 

misstated the law in his closing argument. Would that 

be reviewable in this Court under AEDPA?

 MS. SPILLARS: I think it certainly could 

be. In Brown versus Payton there was certainly a

concern about the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think his argument 

here contained any misstatements of the law?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't.

 MS. SPILLARS: To help answer the question, 

though, in that context, Donnelly and Darden set down 

some general considerations that, while not exclusive, 

help provide the post and beams of the fundamental 

fairness standard. So even assuming that all of the 

statements were improper, those considerations when 

applied to this case show that the trial was not 

rendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument. 

First, none of the comments misstated the evidence nor 

did they misstate the law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just on your 

assumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you 

want us to assume that three or four times at least he 

violated a constitutional standard?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to know what 

arguendo assumption you are making.

 MS. SPILLARS: The assumption is that under 

the first tier in Donnelly and Darden that the 

statements were improper in the sense that within the

context of the multi-factor kind of considerations, 

whether or not they were improper, because obviously --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, they'd be improper 

because they -- they were based on an emotional appeal 

that's improper?

 MS. SPILLARS: It could be improper in the 

sense that it was a misstatement of evidence. I don't 

know that impropriety would include necessarily 

emotional appeal. I mean, the Constitution does not 

require a trial devoid of emotion. However, impropriety 

under Donnelly and Darden was the first tier of the 

multi-tier kind of Fundamental fairness test. So even 

assuming that that first tier, that the statements were 

improper, they still did not rise to the level of 

fundamental unfairness.

 Secondly, none of the individual comments 

implicated the defendant's rights under the Fifth or 

Sixth Amendment, nor were they of the very specific kind 

of comments that this Court has found to violate the 

Eighth Amendment under Caldwell.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think the 

argument based on the General Patton analogy told the 

jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor. I would 

disagree.

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the relevance of 

that argument otherwise?

 MS. SPILLARS: I would not -- it was not 

particularly relevant. It was probably an inartful 

attempt to imply or tell the jury that it was a 

difficult decision that they had ahead of them, one that 

they might --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think if he said in 

so many words, you have a duty to return the death 

penalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?

 MS. SPILLARS: Yes, a duty to return the 

death penalty, which certainly is a misstatement of the 

law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you don't think this 

could be so interpreted? You don't think you could 

interpret that, that passage, that way?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That passage was in the 

context of other statements in which I think it's fair 

to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the 

role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the 

duty to kill.

 MS. SPILLARS: I think a reasonable 

interpretation of those statements could be that the 

duty was to make the decision whether or not to impose

the death penalty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Why is it improper 

for, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts 

of this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack 

of mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the 

only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of 

the jury is the death penalty? That's an improper 

argument? Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty 

to come back with the death penalty? Why can't the 

prosecution argue that?

 MS. SPILLARS: It's certainly not improper 

to make statements based on inferences from the 

evidence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you think the 

Patton argument has anything to do with the evidence? I 

mean, the Patton argument -- correct me if I'm wrong, 

but I thought the argument that referred to General 

Patton was an argument that, number one, talked about 

his addressing the troops before battle. And he was 

telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes 

their duty to kill. And he said: Go out there and do 

your duty, which I assume any reasonable listener would 

say, go out there and kill.

 If a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that 

story and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the

argument is not an argument based on evidence, but an 

argument based upon the situation, the situation of the 

jurors vis a vis a capital defendant.

 And I would suppose that the reasonable 

inference from the argument is that they have a duty to 

go out there to kill, to impose the death penalty. That 

does not sound to me like an argument based upon the 

evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this 

case.

 Now, am I wrong?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor. It certainly 

was not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a 

discussion of the facts in the case. However, based on 

the totality of the entire proceedings, it's clear that 

that statement did not render the entire trial unfair 

because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your 

concession. Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this 

jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with 

a death verdict. Surely, although he didn't explicitly 

mention the evidence, the underlying premise of his 

argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad, 

you have to do your duty. Nobody likes to kill, but 

just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's 

their duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that

the evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty 

that the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring 

the death verdict. I don't see anything wrong with 

that.

 MS. SPILLARS: And Your Honor, to the extent 

that I would certainly agree that those arguments based 

on the strength of the case were not necessarily --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose your concession 

about the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion 

in Viereck, isn't it?

 MS. SPILLARS: Well, in the sense that 

Viereck was not directly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which did involve the very 

word "duty."

 MS. SPILLARS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Chief justice Stone's 

opinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that 

they have a duty and condemned that. That's probably 

why you made the concession, I think.

 MS. SPILLARS: I think the concession is 

important to get beyond the statements in isolation, 

because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not just in 

isolation. Didn't this prosecutor constantly say this 

case is not about Weaver, this case is larger than

Weaver. I think several times in the closing the jurors 

were told: Think big, think the large picture, don't 

think about this individual.

 MS. SPILLARS: Yes. However, the jury was 

also told that it was their discretion to spare his life 

at appendix 275.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is -- I agree with you, 

I agree with you that we should look at the whole 

picture. When I look at the whole picture -- I've 

actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared. 

And what he did, he went through this and looked at a 

case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor. And 

the prosecutor was told in that case just what he 

shouldn't do. And now if we look what he did in this 

case and look what he did in that case and look at the 

law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks 

like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to 

do.

 You're not supposed to give an argument that 

vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is 

what you should do. So in Newlon he says: I'm talking 

to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top 

law enforcement officer. And here he says: I'm the top 

law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we 

have the death penalty and not. Worse than Newlon, I

would say.

 Then what you're not supposed to do is 

you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers. 

I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell 

them you're like a soldier doing duty. At least that's 

what all these prosecutors -- a case called Byron versus 

the United States. So in Newlon what he says is: I 

want to impress on you, this is a war and it's 

justifiable to kill in war. Here he says: As in the 

movie "Patton" and in the movie George Patton is talking 

to his troops because they're going out in battle like 

the soldiers. And then he says: And when you're a 

soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a 

pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's 

face; you'll know what to do; and last July this 

defendant's face was a pile of goo.

 Okay, there we are. I mean, that sounds 

pretty emotional. It sounds like a soldier does his 

duty and you're doing it.

 And then another thing you're not supposed 

to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their 

duty to the community. And this is just filled with 

instances where you hardly even know that there's a 

person called Weaver because he says: What you have to 

do here is send a message to the drug lords, send a

message --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who said he was not 

supposed to do these things?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a brief --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, counsel. 

Maybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?

 MS. SPILLARS: In Newlon, Your Honor, it was 

a due process case which the same prosecutor tried, and 

it was an Eighth Circuit case. And in that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And is that the law here?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not? Why did they 

file -- is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the 

former prosecutors giving the propositions that I just 

stated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one? 

Are they wrong, those prosecutors?

 MS. SPILLARS: To the extent that Newlon 

sets out those arguments, no, that's not incorrect. 

Those arguments were made in Newlon. However, for two 

reasons Newlon is distinguishable. In this case there 

were curative instructions given to the jury. In Newlon 

there were no objections made. So in this case, when 

the prosecutor made the statement, for example, that, 

I'm the top law enforcement officer, there was an 

objection and there was a curative instruction. So it

was not --

JUSTICE BREYER: Was there with the Patton 

and the goo?

 MS. SPILLARS: There was not an objection --

there was an objection to the Patton, but it was 

overruled.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Was there a curative 

instruction?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, there was not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm looking 

at the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton, 

and I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty. 

It says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes 

you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk 

death because it's right. His point is that at some 

point, at some times, you have to impose death because 

it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier.

 Now, where is the reference to you have this 

duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?

 MS. SPILLARS: There is none, Your Honor. 

And a reasonable interpretation of that comment is that 

he was imparting to the jury the duty to make the 

decision, not necessarily to impose the death penalty.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In Viereck the words were: 

"This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war." And the

prosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the 

duties of soldiers and he said: Do your duty. Do you 

think that's a lot different than this case?

 MS. SPILLARS: Well, I would distinguish 

Viereck on two grounds. One, it was not directly a due 

process case as this case is raised, because it was 

raised under this Court's supervisory powers. Secondly, 

in this case there was -- out of the eight separate 

comments that the Eighth Circuit found improper, only 

three of them were actually objected to, two of which 

were sustained and curative instructions were given.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just -- that's a 

bit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is 

distinguishable because there were no objections at all 

and that was the reason for the court saying this goes 

too far to the prosecutor. But now you say when there 

are objections --

MS. SPILLARS: In Newlon the jury was never 

told to disregard the statements. In our case the jury 

was told to disregard the statements.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Certain statements. 

There are were many objections made here that were 

overruled.

 MS. SPILLARS: Correct. There were 12 

objections made total. Interestingly, though, the

defense attorney did not raise objections to the 

majority of the comments that the Eighth Circuit found 

improper. Now, while that's not dispositive, I think 

that the defense attorney is certainly in the best 

position to judge whether or not a comment prejudices 

his client.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To that extent the two 

cases were the same because in Newlon there were no 

objections either.

 MS. SPILLARS: No objections at all. There 

were no objections at all. In our case there were 12 

objections, so clearly the defense attorney was on the 

mark and was listening for prejudicial comments from the 

prosecutor. Of the eight comments that the Eighth 

Circuit found objectionable in this case, only three of 

them were objected to.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think --

MR. SPILLARS: So assuming that the defense 

attorney was -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were two cases 

cited as involving the same prosecutor? Was it Shurn 

also?

 MS. SPILLARS: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that there was a 

significant overlap in the three charges in the three

cases. The prosecutor had been told in two of them, you 

went too far. In this one, just in terms of what the 

prosecutor said in the closing argument, is this less 

offensive or would you say they're all on a par?

 MS. SPILLARS: I would actually -- if you 

compare the three arguments side by side, the 

prosecutor's statements were tempered in this case. The 

decision -- when he tried this case, it was 

approximately five weeks after the district court in 

Newlon had come down with the decision.

 And there are statements that he made in 

Newlon and Shurn that were not in this case. For 

example, in Newlon he said this is the worst case ever 

and in Shurn he said the same thing. He did he not say 

that in this case. So I think from -- if you do a side 

by side comparison, his statements were actually 

tempered.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us -- as 

you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents 

of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court 

standard, a very general standard that we can get from 

Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there.

 I take it that the counsel for the 

Respondent is going to say: Well, this is a Federal 

standard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply

the specificity and the application that it's given to 

this, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its 

cases in reversing.

 Do you agree with that?

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume that's what 

they're going to tell us.

 MS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor, I would not 

agree.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why.

 MS. SPILLARS: Clearly, it's not established 

law by this Court, and this Court has not specifically 

outlined the kind of post and beam that would result in 

a reversal in a penalty phase Closing argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It says that in the text, 

doesn't it, "clearly established by the Supreme Court"? 

Is that not in the text of the statute?

 MS. SPILLARS: Correct, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So those things that are 

improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the 

guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those 

things, in a sentencing phase with capital -- with --

you know, capital sentencing?

JUSTICE BREYER: There are a number of cases 

in this Court that say what a prosecutor can't say, 

guilt phase. All of them happen to be guilt phase, I 

guess. You can't, you know, vouch. You can't use too 

much emotion. You have to focus on what the defendant 

did, not on what somebody else did. I mean, there are a 

number of things.

 Now, do those -- is it fair or not fair to 

say that those precedents apply in the capital 

sentencing phase, too?

 MS. SPILLARS: I think it is fair to say 

that. But it is also fair to say that there may be 

other considerations that apply in the penalty phase 

that don't necessarily apply in the guilt phase.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question about your position: We are trying to find 

cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this 

Court. Do you include in that group of cases, cases 

such as Berger against the United States, and Viereck 

against the United States, which were direct review of 

Federal cases in which they say there was a denial of 

the fair trial, but they're not setting aside State 

cases?

 Would it be proper for the Court of Appeals 

to rely on those cases?

MS. SPILLARS: No. And this is why.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though those cases 

say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.

 MS. SPILLARS: No. Because of the very 

specific nature of the supervisory powers in those 

cases, I don't believe that in the larger context, the 

final standards, that we can say that those directly 

apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If those direct 

Federal cases were interpreting the constitutional 

provisions directly, they would count as established 

law?

 MS. SPILLARS: Certainly, yes, Your Honor.

 There was also no mechanism in this case for 

the jury to apply any of the improper remarks to their 

deliberations because they were properly instructed. 

Instructions which we presume that they followed. In 

this case, the court read the instructions to the jury 

before closing arguments, and a copy was also given to 

the jury to deliberate with.

 Four of those instructions, numbers 21, 28, 

26, and 27, told the jury in various forms that it was 

their duty, and theirs alone, to render a verdict. The 

jury was also told in instructions 23, 24, and 26 that 

it was -- that their decision must be within the

confines of the evidence.

 And thirdly, within the specific process 

laid out for finding ways -- mitigating and aggravating 

circumstances. And finally, the last instruction that 

the jury heard before closing arguments was that closing 

arguments were not evidence.

 It is counterintuitive to assume that the 

jury disregarded those instructions as a whole and 

instead improperly relied on the prosecutor's closing 

argument when they declined to find the one aggravating 

circumstance that the prosecutor spoke most about.

 At appendix 285 is the part of the closing 

argument where the prosecutor discussed the aggravating 

circumstances. He argued to the jury that all four 

applied, but spent most time speaking about number one, 

which was that he had killed for money.

 However, the jury did not find aggravator 

number 1. So the very aggravator that the prosecutor 

argued most about to the jury, they did not find.

 It's more reasonable to conclude that the 

jury made its decision based on the strength of the 

evidence and the strong evidence in support of the death 

penalty.

 Having rejected the misidentification 

defense, the jury necessarily found that the respondent

was the passenger who had returned to the woods to shoot 

the victim several more times.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to my 

question? Because there's a legal question here about 

what law we can look to under AEDPA. And actually, of 

course, it is a question of whether AEDPA applies, I 

suppose. Because actually, wasn't this habeas petition 

filed two days before AEDPA was -- there's a footnote in 

the red brief that says -- raises that question.

 MS. SPILLARS: There was a habeas petition 

filed prior to AEDPA, but it was dismissed and he did 

not appeal from that. This was filed after AEDPA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a slip on the 

District Court's part, wasn't it? I mean, that original 

petition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert 

petition to this Court should not have been dismissed, 

it should have been held, in which case the petition 

would have been timely and would not have been trumped 

by an AEDPA variant.

 MS. SPILLARS: However, Your Honor, he did 

not appeal from that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, didn't he seek a 

COA?

 MS. SPILLARS: Yes, he did. However, he did 

not appeal --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a pro se prisoner. 

He gets his -- all the claims are exhausted, it's 

dismissed. And he seeks a COA on that point.

 MS. SPILLARS: However, the parties have --

the respondent has not asserted that argument, that 

AEDPA does not apply in this case. And for good reason, 

because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly didn't say it in 

the brief in opposition. And we might not well have 

taken the case had that point been raised in the BIL.

 MS. SPILLARS: That's correct, Your Honor.

 Finally, given the overwhelming evidence --

it supported a finding that the respondent had carried 

out an execution style murder for the purpose of 

silencing a witness. I'll preserve --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

before you sit down? In the Viereck opinion, Chief 

Justice Stone reversed in that case. And one of the 

reasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly 

irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the 

purpose and effect of which could only have been to 

arouse passion and prejudice. That's part of our 

Federal law. Is that law applicable in this case, do 

you think?

 MS. SPILLARS: Not directly, Your Honor.

Honor. But in the context of fundamental fairness, as 

to whether or not that case applies, I would argue that 

it does not directly apply.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have a much more 

limited point, as I understand it. Your more limited 

point is simply that this is not clearly established law 

pronounced by the Supreme Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In this area of 

constitutional violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the question, I 

suppose, is whether that is a constitutional rule. It 

is established by the Supreme Court of the United 

States, an opinion written by Chief Justice Stone a good 

many years ago. But you're argument is it is not 

applicable to State prosecutors, as I understand it.

applicable to State prosecutors. However, in the

context of fundamental fairness, does it establish a 

clear -- a rule in the sense of those kinds of 

statements will render a trial fundamentally --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would it be applicable 

to State prosecutors if it is not a rule. I don't 

understand that. Is it applicable to a State prosecutor 

or not? If a state prosecutor asked you for your 

advice, is this opinion applicable. And you tell him 

yes or no.

 MS. SPILLARS: Certainly, it is something 

that State prosecutors should follow in the sense of 

what they should say and what they should not say.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they must follow 

because it's the law, right?

 MS. SPILLARS: Under the -- it is not the 

law in the sense of fundamental fairness. It is 

certainly an indication of what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, where did Chief 

Justice Stone get it from?

 MS. SPILLARS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where did Chief Justice 

Stone get it from? Just because of our supervisory 

power? I mean, if it's just Federal supervisory power, 

then I think you could tell the counsel, he doesn't have 

to follow it, it's due process.

supervisory power and the States do have to follow it. 

I don't know that there's any way to straddle that.

those cases, it is a supervisory power case. And so to 

that extent, it's not applicable to this particular 

case.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. BLUME: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court:

 As the former prosecutor's brief makes 

clear, George "Buzz" Westfall's penalty phase closing 

argument in Mr. Weaver's case contained a number of 

improper and mutually reinforcing statements which 

exploited the authority of his office, analogized the 

jury's duties to that of soldiers in war time, injected 

extraneous matters into the proceedings, and appealed to 

the jurors' passions and prejudice.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think they 

overstated the significance of Viereck. Isn't Viereck 

-- does Viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule 

that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never 

mention the word soldier? Isn't that a much more 

limited -- much more limited holding?

 This was a prosecution during World War II 

of individuals for failing to register as agents of Nazi 

Germany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase --

and it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt 

phase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who 

are fighting the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula are 

doing their duty for the country, you have a duty to 

return a guilty verdict against these individuals.

 Now, isn't that very different from saying 

that in a capital -- at the capital phase of the trial, 

you have a duty to consider something that's very 

unpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that 

what soldiers have to do in war time is different? 

Isn't that very different?

 MR. BLUME: I think the historical context 

is different, but this was set up in this case by 

informing the jurors that we were involved in a war, in 

a war on drugs in society. And then he uses the same 

story, analogizing jurors' responsibilities to that of

soldiers in a war. I think it is also important to put 

that comment in the context in which it occurred. Not 

only in the broader context and the repeated -- the 

prosecutor repeatedly leveraging the power of his office 

behind this, but this came right on the heels of him 

saying, I'm the top law enforcement officer in this 

county. I decide in which cases we seek the death 

penalty.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was objected to 

and the objection was sustained, correct?

 MR. BLUME: It was objected to, and the 

objection was sustained. That doesn't mean that 

comment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And a curative instruction 

given.

 MR. BLUME: I agree with that. But that 

doesn't mean it's irrelevant for the due process 

totality of circumstances analysis. And then he 

proceeds from there directly in to the Patton analogy, 

and I think if you read that analogy in context, he is 

telling them you're soldiers in a war, you have a duty 

to kill, I'm like Patton, I'm telling you it's your duty 

to kill, go kill.

 If you read that logically --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which in that case,

AEDPA says we look to clearly established law by our 

U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Which is the clearest 

U.S. Supreme Court decision that was violated here?

 MR. BLUME: The decision that was violated 

was the rule of Darden, Donnelly, and Romano, which is 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, pick which one 

do you think is the most directly applicable.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I think Darden established 

the rule. This Court applied it to the penalty phase in 

Romano, and thus the Darden rule that if a prosecutor's 

comments, the totality --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not Romano. 

Romano was an introduction of evidence case, right?

 MR. BLUME: Yes, but logically, if you have 

established a rule for closing arguments, you 

established it, you then say it is applicable to the 

penalty phase for the admission of evidence, it would be 

completely illogical to say it didn't govern penalty 

phase closing arguments.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is simply 

the level of generality at which the guiding principles 

were articulated, which helps when you're applying it, 

but in determining -- it is the point Judge Bowman in 

dissent that when you don't have a case that's close,

that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to 

the Court, because it's not a clearly established 

precedent of the Supreme Court.

 Yes, there are the Jenner cases that 

establish the general principles, but the question is 

how clearly those were contravened before you can say it 

violated clearly established law.

 MR. BLUME: That is what this Court's 

decisions say, Chief Justice Roberts. I think I want to 

make clear that we have two different positions on that. 

The first is that any State court decision finding this 

argument in its totality based on what happened and 

based on the weight of the evidence in this case that 

said that didn't render the proceedings fundamentally 

unfair would be an unreasonable application of Darden 

and Donnelly.

 But in addition to that, the Missouri 

Supreme Court in this case said the decision was 

unreasonable because it failed to consider significant 

portions of Mr. Weaver's challenge to this argument. It 

did the analysis under a State law abuse of discretion 

standard, and it refused to consider or failed to 

consider several components of his claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, how do 

you it failed to consider? I mean, is there an

obligation to respond to every single point that's made?

 MR. BLUME: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did they refuse to accept 

argument on those points?

 MR. BLUME: No. But they -- on the first 

point, did they refuse to -- did they fail to consider a 

number of the challenges like the Patton analogy, that's 

clear. He raised that in his brief. He said this was 

something I'm complaining about. They did not consider 

it. He raised the point about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If they did consider it, 

you mean they did not respond to that argument in their 

opinion.

 MR. BLUME: They did not refer to it in 

their opinion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know for sure 

that they didn't consider it. I mean, it may be 

argument to them. How could they not have considered 

it? They must have not considered it important, but 

that's a different --

MR. BLUME: He also raised the point about 

this is bigger than William Weaver. And that was 

improper. And when the State court cited what he said, 

they chose to ellipses that out, and didn't even put in

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that improper? 

Is it improper at the penalty phase for a prosecutor to 

refer to the concept of deterrence, which by definition 

is bigger than the individual whose sentence is being 

considered?

 MR. BLUME: I don't think this can properly 

be considered a deterrence argument. When you say over 

and over, this is far more important than William 

Weaver, this goes way beyond William Weaver, this is 

bigger than William Weaver, this doesn't just pertain to 

William Weaver, then you add that in with the number of 

comments about you need to give this person the death 

penalty --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could a prosecutor 

say, one of the factors you must take into account when 

you begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the 

death penalty? Deterrence is one of the reasons we have 

the death penalty.

 MR. BLUME: Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: To teach us. Can he say 

that?

 MR. BLUME: I think he could say that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then now we have the 

principle that you can talk about deterrence. Now it is 

just the way in which he talked about deterrence?

MR. BLUME: No, my point is I don't believe 

this is really a deterrence argument. Deterrence is not 

a substitute for moral culpability.  We allow the 

deterrent function of the death penalty as a 

justification for it, but you couldn't give the death 

penalty to somebody who didn't deserve it under the 

State's scheme, in order to further deterrence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As I recall, he didn't just 

say it is bigger than Weaver. He went on to discuss, 

you know, the drug gangs. And he says, they're not 

going to be affected by the threat of going to prison. 

They will be affected by the threat of dying.

 It seemed to me he tied it very, very 

closely into deterrence. And if you say that deterrence 

is okay for him to refer to, I don't know how there's 

anything left to your argument about his saying it's 

bigger than Weaver.

 MR. BLUME: I think the import of this 

argument is you should give the person the death penalty 

even if you're not sure he deserves it in order to 

further the deterrent function of the death penalty.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're -- you're 

saying look, he can make a general statement that we 

have a death penalty in part for its deterrent function, 

but he cannot make the argument that you ought to apply

the death penalty in this case solely for deterrent 

reasons, i.e., reasons unanchored in the culpability of 

this particular defendant.

 MR. BLUME: That's correct. Not because, 

what this statement did. Especially --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where? Where? Where? 

Where? Where does it say that? Where does it say never 

mind the facts? Let's, let's give this guy the death 

penalty as a Napoleon said, "Por encourage les autres." 

You know, he said it didn't matter which, whether the 

general was guilty of, of cowardice or not; it would 

help to encourage the others to execute him. Where is 

there anything like that argument here? I don't see it.

 MR. BLUME: I think that us the logical 

inference from the six or seven times he says -- in 

variety of -- he says this is bigger than William 

Weaver. The one thing you've got to understand is this 

is far more important than William Weaver; this is, goes 

way beyond William Weaver; this does not pertain just to 

William Weaver. He says that on six or eight occasions. 

And I think you could interpret that -- the logical 

interpretation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you let a person who is 

as guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not 

just William Weaver, you're affecting the whole war on

drugs, you're affecting the -- what's wrong with that?

 I -- I fail to see any indication here that 

he's telling the jury never mind the facts. Never mind 

how -- you know -- how horrible you think the crime was. 

Never mind all of the instructions that the judge gives 

you about aggravating factors and mitigating factors. 

Forget all of that. Kill William Weaver because it's 

bigger than him.

 I -- I just don't -- I just don't see the 

argument.

 MR. BLUME: Of course, he does actually say 

kill him now at another point in there. But I think if 

you take those comments, you also look at those in the 

context of where he goes on and on about the 

consequences; you need to send a message to the drug 

dealers, that's a huge theme --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you think, go on 

and on -- suppose he'd mentioned deterrence six times?

 MR. BLUME: I think as long as it is a 

blanket sort of statement, that one purpose of the death 

penalty is deterrence, that would probably be consistent 

with this Court's decisions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 MR. BLUME: That's not what is happening 

here, Justice Kennedy, especially when it is tied in to

that, to send a message and then he also goes on to talk 

about the consequences. If you don't sentence this 

person to death, then the animals will reign in the 

jungle and we can't have that in a civilized society and 

there's no point in having jurors, the dope peddlers 

prevail. You put all that together, he is telling these 

people as the prosecutor in this county. If you don't 

give this person the death penalty there will be all 

these adverse social consequences.

 And you wrap all this up; there is no 

conscientious prosecute who could possibly believe that 

these statements were proper. No.

 This argument is an outlier; it is beyond 

the bounds; it contains essentially improper comments in 

virtually every category that this Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Judge -- Judge 

Bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor? He 

dissented; he thought these were not unreasonable on the 

basis of on clearly established law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Judge Bowman 

said were it not for AEDPA this case might come out --

in his view this case might have come out differently.

 MR. BLUME: Judge Bowman --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The standard is 

unreasonable in light of clearly established law.

MR. BLUME: Judge Bowman did say that. But 

I believe the essence of his dissent was that, I think 

that he made the mistake which the Petitioners made in 

the cert petition, and he thought that there was no 

clearly established Federal law. A point which is 

essentially conceded at this point in the proceedings.

 I wanted to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well no, he 

specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours 

and that there these other generally applicable 

decisions and he thought the state courts had broad -- a 

broader range when there was no decision on all fours.

 MR. BLUME: Well, if I'm -- I'm sorry --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm reading at the 

bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.

 MR. BLUME: Well, if I'm wrong about that, 

I'm wrong. But even -- I don't think it is also under 

Justice O'Connor's opinion in williams versus Taylor, 

you don't have to, this doesn't works at the level of 

saying well, any one judge is unreasonable. The point 

is, it's an objective standard, not is this judge, you 

know, somehow out of touch here?

 And I think -- so -- I wanted to make one 

point before I forge about it, to correct one thing that 

Petitioner said. Mr. Weaver filed this prior to the

act. It was dismissed. He did request counsel and a 

COA. He did appeal this in the Eighth Circuit in his 

first appeal.

 He appealed the improper dismissal of his 

petition. The district court initially granted the writ 

on Batson grounds. He appealed the fact that it should 

be -- his case should not be subject to the act --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have this only in a 

footnote in your reply brief. It wasn't raised in the 

BIO.

 MR. BLUME: It was not raised in the BIO. I 

did not represent Mr. Weaver at that time. But I 

thought it was my obligation as an officer of the court 

to raise this at the earliest possible opportunity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you, where -- one 

of the passages that I thought went a little far where 

is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to 

into your head; this is far more important than William 

Weaver. This case goes far beyond William Weaver. This 

touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the 

world. That's the message you have to send. It just 

doesn't pertain to William Weaver. It pertains to all 

of us, the community. The message -- there are street, 

et cetera.

 Okay. Now. That struck me, as you argue

this is rather extreme. Its seems to be removing the 

attention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you 

have a duty to send this man for other reasons. Now --

to execute him.

 But where do I find in the U.S. reports the 

case or statement that then says this is the kind of 

argument the prosecutor cannot make?

 MR. BLUME: Okay. Let me -- I want to back 

up, and I want to take on the premise of the question. 

Which may be a mistake, but I think in determining, the 

first part of the Donnelly/Darden standard is you look 

at what the prosecutor argued and whether it was 

improper.

 I don't believe you have to have a United 

States Supreme Court case directly on point for 

everything the prosecutor said on that. There are 

decisions from this Court on a number of things he said. 

There are also other touchstones, for example, the 

standards on criminal justice which regulate what 

prosecutors can say.

 Then the way I understand this clearly 

established Federal law to work, is you take what the 

prosecutor said, you examine that in light of what 

happened, what defense counsel did, what the trial judge 

did, and the weight of the overall evidence.

And if you believe that the prosecutor's 

arguments rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair, 

then there's a violation of the due process clause. I 

don't think I have -- you have to show that there's some 

Supreme Court case directly on point going to each 

particular comment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You were talking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even the Supreme 

Court cases going to the other points, they didn't --

did any of them involve a separate penalty phase? They 

were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital 

case, weren't they?

 MR. BLUME: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that, so that when the 

prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging 

the jury to find a person guilty. He was not just 

urging them what penalty is better or worse. He was 

saying for these reasons you should find the individual 

guilty.

 That's quite different it seems to me from 

the situation in which guilt has already been 

established. The trial's done. This person is guilty, 

and the only thing they're arguing about is what the 

penalty ought to be. I'm not sure that you can 

analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other

in determining what kind of argument is proper. Because 

in the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor 

says this is not just about this defendant, it's about 

the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the 

person guilty. I mean -- and that's crazy. You don't 

find the person guilty in order to stop drug 

trafficking.

 But you do impose a heavier penalty in order 

to do that. So I just don't, don't see the analogy from 

the Supreme Court cases you have.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I think that, I don't see 

any reason why a principle which this Court has 

repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed 

to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office 

behind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the 

penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase 

of a capital trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's different. Look --

it could -- could -- would defense counsel be able to 

argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an 

ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, "ladies 

and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large 

family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch. 

You shouldn't find him guilt. Is there no mercy in your 

heart?"

Would he be allowed to argue that? Of 

course not. Can he argue it in a guilt phase? Of 

course he can. And it seems to me in determining what 

arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided 

by what arguments the defense can make.

 The defense can surely come in and say 

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called 

upon to kill somebody. Do you realize what a -- what a 

difficult, overwhelming thing that is?

 And then you say the prosecution can't come 

in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do 

your duty, you have to kill. This is the law here. If 

you find the facts this way, that's your duty.

 I -- I -- I think you're, you're taking hard 

cases very much out of context by applying cases that 

relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure 

that we've set up in capital cases which is called the 

guilt -- uh, the penalty phase.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I disagree with that, and 

to this extent. Can a lawyer in a capital case argue at 

the sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not 

sentence this person to death because they've had a hard 

life? Yes. Of course you can. And why can you do 

that? Because according to this Court's cases, that 

goes directly to the individual's moral culpability and

whether they deserve the death penalty.

 The problem with many of the arguments which 

were made in this case is they are fundamentally 

inconsistent with the individual's moral blameworthiness 

and they can the jury to impose the death penalty in 

order to stop larger issues, to stop crime, to protect 

society.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To -- to send a 

message?

 MR. BLUME: To send a message. And if you 

don't send a message, chaos will prevail and the animals 

will reign in the jungle.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What the defense 

lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote 

for life, you are sending a message. He said if you 

vote for life, you are still doing your duty.

 MR. BLUME: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How was that 

message -- a different message, I guess, but he can 

say send a message, but the prosecutor can't?

 MR. BLUME: No. I think the important -- by 

the time defense counsel said that, the prosecutor in 

his opening statement had already made the send a 

message statement about five times. She was trying in 

that one limited instance to tackle that and say well,

okay, if you give him life that's a message, too.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if the prosecution had 

not opened the door, that would have been improper? You 

overrule -- the judge said counsel, you can't argue 

about sending a message for life?

 MR. BLUME: I think that would have been 

completely within the trial court's discretion.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you think the trial 

court could tell the defense counsel that the defense 

counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen 

there is nothing more precious than life and that's what 

we're asking you to decide here and we want you to 

assert the values of this community that we value life?

 You can't say that?

 MR. BLUME: Maybe. But I think that what 

she -- but what she's saying here, though, is directly 

responsive. And that is also a factor which this Court 

has noted in its decisions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that you said 

explicitly, the prosecutor -- which he didn't say -- but 

you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an 

implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug 

dealers around, and he's one of them. And this 

sentencing phase isn't about just -- just isn't about 

William Weaver. It is about sending a message to the

others.

 And if you execute him, even if you think he 

shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should 

be, but, you see, others will think that this is a 

message. So do it just to give a message. Even if you 

think he never did it. No matter what you think of him, 

you think he's the best person in the world. Still 

execute him just to send a message.

 Now would that violate the Constitution?

 MR. BLUME: Of course.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Of course. What case 

in the Supreme Court would you look to to show it did?

 MR. BLUME: I think it would -- there you 

would easily just look to this Court's Eighth Amendment 

decisions which say --

JUSTICE BREYER: You don't find any one 

where anybody ever had an argument like that.

 MR. BLUME: Right. It wouldn't be an -- but 

it would be inconsistent with the fundamental 

principles --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Ah. So you are saying 

we should look not just to -- if we try to look for 

exact, identical arguments maybe we'll get into that 

problem? Of having to uphold things we all know -- or 

is that right? Or what?

MR. BLUME: Well, I think, you know, at some 

point, right, you can say well, you don't have a case on 

point because no one has said anything so outrageous. 

If a prosecutor went up and said look, ladies and 

gentlemen, the judge is going to tell you about 

aggravating and mitigating circumstances; forget all 

that baloney, go in there, you know, put all that out of 

your brain, and give him death. I don't think there 

would be any question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The question has been 

switched here, Counsel. The question before us is not 

whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty 

of Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these 

particular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have 

said it.

 That's not the question before us. The 

question before us is whether it violates fundamental 

unfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it 

invalidates the whole prosecution and -- and sentence.

 That's quite a different question. I can 

acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't 

do it. But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically 

to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence 

shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that 

the, that the verdict has to be set aside.

MR. BLUME: Well, let me tackle that 

head-on. There were a number of improper comments made 

in this case. Most, many of them -- a number of them 

were objected to and the objection was overruled. Some 

of them were not objected to. The only instructions 

they got were two curative instructions on two points 

and a general evidence, not arguments, instruction.

 So nothing was really done in the context to 

ameliorate the presence of these comments. And despite 

what the Petitioner says, this was not a strong case for 

death. The evidence of guilt was circumstantial and 

hotly contested. Even the prosecutor in his penalty 

phase acknowledged, look, he might be innocent, but kill 

him anyway. The State presented no additional evidence 

in aggravation of punishment. Mr. Weaver had no prior 

record other than a misdemeanor conviction.

 There was substantial mitigating evidence 

presented regarding his character, his good deeds, and 

other things he had done in the community and his 

adaptability to confinement.

 This was not a strong case for death.

 So you take these comments, which were --

they're trying to contrast -- this argument is worse 

than Newlon in most respects. It was made five weeks 

after he was told that this argument rendered another

trial fundamentally unfair.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your recital was not 

a complete picture of the case.  This was an 

assassination of a witness in a Federal drug 

prosecution, with how many shots to the head?

 MR. BLUME: I believe there were six.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Six. And the jury 

determined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that 

this was the guy who did it. So you do have to look at 

the penalty phase in the context of those facts.

 MR. BLUME: I agree. But to say that -- and 

they found -- and I'm not suggesting that that's not 

part of the totality of the proceedings.

 But there's one significant point there that 

also I think needs to be taken into account. He was a 

witness, but he was also a drug dealer and involved in 

the drug trade and was a straw purchaser for these Shurn 

families. And in many instances --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, serve him right? I 

mean, is that --

MR. BLUME: I'm not suggesting it serves him 

right. I'm suggesting that whether juries impose death 

often depends in part as well on the moral 

blameworthiness or how they perceived the victim. This 

was not like witness, an innocent witness. This was

somebody who was involved in that. And that normally 

makes it more difficult for the prosecution to obtain a 

death sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you -- what 

should a prosecutor's closing -- penalty phase argument 

look like? What are the sorts of things that he should 

be talking about?

 MR. BLUME: I think in general they stick to 

the evidence. They can argue that the nature and 

severity of the crime itself warrants the ultimate 

punishment and focus on -- the focus of the penalty 

phase is supposed to be on the individual's moral 

culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty 

based on what they did. This argument, most of this 

argument I believe, as Justice Breyer suggested, it went 

on for pages and there was no mention really in any 

substance of William Weaver and what he had done.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think moral 

culpability is the only factor that can be mentioned? I 

thought you said earlier it was okay for the prosecutor 

to refer to deterrence.

 MR. BLUME: I don't think it's the only 

factor, but I was responding to the question of what 

should a prosecutor do and in fact what most 

prosecutors do in most cases.

JUSTICE ALITO: Can a prosecutor say that 

killing a witness is something that needs to be deterred 

and therefore it's important, it's appropriate to impose 

the death penalty here in order to send a message of 

deterrence? Is that improper?

 MR. BLUME: I think something probably like 

that would be. But this -- again, this went way beyond 

that.

 The other thing that you have to look at 

here is that then he goes on to say, and if you don't 

give him death chaos will reign, society will fall 

apart, there's no point in having a death penalty, and 

the animals will reign in the jungle and you can't that 

have that in a civilized society.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of moral 

culpability that you take moral instruction from thieves 

murderers on the street, as opposed to those higher 

standards for which society seeks to aspire? Is that 

moral culpability?

 MR. BLUME: I'm sorry. I'm not sure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it moral culpability 

for you to take as an example for your behavior the 

criminal population?

you take your values, your instructions, your behavior 

from criminals, as opposed to people who uphold the law 

in society? Is that part of moral culpability?

 MR. BLUME: It might be part of the picture 

of what this person is like.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, isn't it 

relevant what's happening on the streets, etcetera?

 MR. BLUME: I don't think it's proper to say 

if you don't give this person death then all these other 

things which are bad for society are going to happen.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the 

defense argument was not focused on Weaver either. The 

defense counsel said it was a vote for life, fight for 

it. Always fight for life, always, always. The 

argument by the defense wasn't -- and it's hard for me 

to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't 

extend beyond the particular individuals.

 MR. BLUME: But there's beyond and there's 

way beyond and there's beyond the pale. And I think if 

you look at all these things that were said in this case 

-- I have read hundreds of these arguments -- no 

conscientious prosecutor could have thought that this 

was appropriate.

 MR. BLUME: You could answer it that, look 

at what this person did. You look at his crime. We 

have the death penalty in this State. In some cases 

it's appropriate. It's appropriate in this case. It's 

not appropriate to say: I'm the prosecutor, I decide in

ruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether 

AEDPA applies or does not apply? As I understand it, it 

either does or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether 

it was argued. But was it discussed in any of the lower 

court decisions?

 MR. BLUME: You're talking about on the 

basis that he filed before the act?

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I mean in this 

proceeding.

 MR. BLUME: It was argued in his initial 

habeas. It was appealed to the Eighth Circuit, because 

the Eighth Circuit initially granted the writ on Batson 

grounds. So he appealed it at that point and the Eighth 

Circuit said, basically with very little analysis, 

determined that AEDPA applied because he had to refile 

after the act and AEDPA applied to petitions filed after 

the act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And was that this habeas? 

Then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?

 MR. BLUME: It was the same habeas 

proceeding. It was a continuation of the same. It was 

then remanded back to the district court. The district 

court granted the writ on this ground and then it went 

up on appeal. I don't think he would have been under 

any obligation to appeal it again, having sort of gotten 

a ruling on that in the same habeas proceeding.

had Lawrence in front it, it would have ruled 

differently? Or should it have ruled differently, in

dismissing his petition and should not be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under Lawrence the Eighth 

Circuit would have been wrong?

 MR. BLUME: Yes.

the other way, then it also -- then it would be right. 

In other words, whether AEDPA applies really is a 

function of our decision in Lawrence?

 MR. BLUME: Yes. Lawrence made clear what I 

think should have probably been clear beforehand, that 

you didn't have to seek cert to this Court in order to 

exhaust a petition, but that was the basis of the 

district court's ruling.

 Thank you.

it is not clearly established that deterrence arguments 

in closing arguments are improper, and for good reason, 

particularly because of the strength of this -- the 

evidence in this case and the fact that the Respondent 

had killed a Federal witness execution-style. To that 

extent, as I understand the Respondent's argument, the 

deterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has 

prefaced his deterrence argument, if he says certain 

words to mitigate the deterrence argument. However, 

trials don't operate in terms of specific words that 

must be pre-spoken before an argument can be valid.

 Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's 

question previously, I would advise that prosecutors 

should not use some arguments, not necessarily the 

deterrence argument, but not that in every instance they 

must not use those arguments. This Court's supervisory 

role in those kinds of cases allows this Court to turn 

should's into must's for Federal prosecutors, but that 

is not the case here.

 Second -- thirdly, the Viereck case is in a 

historical context which we don't have here, and the 

Missouri Supreme Court did consider the penalty phase 

arguments. At page 237 of the appendix the court 

specifically said: "We have reviewed the penalty phase 

arguments."

And then at page 235, the Missouri Supreme 

Court distinguishes Newlon and says that they do not 

rise to the level of the statements made in Newlon. So 

to that extent the Missouri State court was not an 

unreasonable application of this Court's precedents and 

deference should afforded to that State court decision. 

For that reason we would ask that this case be reversed.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 [Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
