 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-1454, Camreta v. Greene, 

and 09-1478, Alford v. Greene.

 General Kroger.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Pearson v. Callahan, this Court gave the 

lower Federal courts discretionary power to decide 

substantive questions of constitutional law in qualified 

immunity cases in order to further the development of 

constitutional precedent. If it is valuable for the 

lower courts to decide these cases, then it is essential 

that this Court be able to review those decisions in 

order to ensure that they are accurate. For this 

reason, the case is justiciable and should be reviewed 

on the merits.

 Turning to the merits of this case, the 

Court of Appeals held -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not so fast.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, there are two

issues here, and I hope we do get to th substance. Can 

you tell me Camreta's current occupation? Does the 

record establish that? Does the record tell us what 

Camreta is doing now? Is -­

MR. KROGER: The record does not, Your 

Honor, because the mootness issue was raised relatively 

late in the proceedings, but I'm aware of what his 

current occupation is.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is?

 MR. KROGER: He is a child protective 

services worker with the Oregon Department of Human 

Services.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What I was about to ask is 

this: I can agree with you that -- that where there is 

a -- a determination on the merits, it should be 

reviewable, but could still disagree that it's 

reviewable where the requirements for Article III are 

not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable 

controversy between the parties.

 What -- what is the interest of the -- of 

the parties who were victorious here?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the interest of Mr. 

Camreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job. Under 

the Ninth Circuit's decision, he is forced to either 

forgo a regular and recurring duty of his job, which is

to interview potential child victims in school, or to 

face liability for doing so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would he face 

liability? Because he didn't have the opportunity to 

challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision; 

therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him. A 

party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative 

holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're 

not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an 

opportunity to raise it on appeal. So why would Camreta 

be precluded? Why would he face punitive damages as 

you're suggesting?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit 

opinion does apply to Mr. Camreta. The court 

specifically advised Mr. Camreta and others in his 

position that they are on notice that in-school 

interviews of students that require a seizure require a 

warrant, and, thus, the Ninth Circuit decision does have 

precedential effect and impacts Mr. Camreta.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it takes -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes two to tango, and 

a case or controversy requires somebody on the other 

side who cares a fig about the outcome. And here, S.G.,

moved to another State and -- making it virtually 

certain that she'll never confront this situation again. 

She doesn't care what the result of this thing is. 

Besides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so 

now? It's impossible that she will be confronted with 

the same situation.

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I disagree that 

S.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of 

this case. In footnote 20 of the Respondent's brief on 

page 33, the Respondent notes that they have filed a 

motion in the United States district court to bring 

their Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County, a 

potential party that has no qualified immunity as a 

defense. And, obviously, the legal viability of that -­

that claim against Deschutes County will depend very 

much on the ruling on the merits of this Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a Monell claim, 

and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling, 

I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for 

reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 

The district court ruled that it was premature until 

these proceedings were concluded.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why isn't the 

answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?

Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not 

going to be confronted with this situation again and who 

has put herself out of the running for damages because 

she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified 

immunity ruling. So she has no stake in any monetary 

relief from this claim. She has no continuing -- the -­

what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will 

never happen again now that she's past 18.

 So she hasn't -- if she came to court today 

with her case as an 18-year-old, she would have no case 

or controversy. It just seems like the whole case has 

evaporated. She has no claim. She did have a claim 

for -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that. 

So, what -- what genuine controversy is before us?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the controversy 

remains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the 

Respondent is seeking to pursue in the United States 

district court and that gives the Respondent here a 

direct financial stake in the viability of their Fourth 

Amendment argument, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Isn't 

that -- isn't that the -- the county's claim? How 

Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't 

belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling 

him how to do his job. And so why don't we go back to

Justice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell 

situation the proper case? Because there, it's the 

party interested in how its officers will do their job 

at its directive. It has the case and controversy at 

issue, not S.G.

 Right now, she's never going to be 

investigated again. She's in another State. I 

understand that she doesn't even ever want to return to 

Oregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from 

her perspective. So, again, why isn't this the 

interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the 

officer?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, in Arizonans v. 

Arizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that 

case had an interest in how she was able to conduct her 

job. The Court decided that the case was -- was moot 

because she had resigned from her position with the 

State. But there was no objection to -- to her standing 

because she was a public employee that wanted to perform 

her job in a particular way because she was required to 

under State law, and here -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: She was the plaintiff. 

In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff 

still had a viable claim, right?

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KAGAN: General Kroger, I don't 

think that the question here is really a standing 

question; it's really whether there is a controversy 

between this particular plaintiff and this particular 

defendant such that a judgment in this case would 

actually affect the legal relationship between the two, 

between the particular plaintiff and the particular 

defendant.

 So how would it do that? How would a legal 

judgment in this case affect the legal relationship 

between this plaintiff and this defendant?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr. 

Camreta remains a party below, and it's possible that 

the Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may 

impact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being 

made against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in 

controversy below.

 Moreover, this case, even if one strips out 

the ongoing motion that's been made in the district 

court, resembles in all material respects Erie v. 

Pap's A.M., where the Court found that there was 

standing to bring the case and it was not moot. And so, 

there does seem to be an active case or controversy that 

is equivalent to that that was present in Erie v. 

Pap's A.M.

JUSTICE SCALIA: How does it affect the 

Fourteenth Amendment? There's a Fourteenth Amendment 

claim pending below?

 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's the substance of 

that?

 MR. KROGER: It is a claim of Mrs. Greene to 

interference with familial rights as a result of certain 

actions by Mr. Camreta and other defendants.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that didn't have to 

do with the school search -- the school seizure?

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and this case 

presents the question about was this unreasonable? That 

-- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's 

claim, and it has to do with putting the girls in 

custody, right?

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 

So the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we were to 

hold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think 

the appropriate disposition of the case would be?

to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you don't really 

want that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified 

immunity. What would be -- what would we be vacating? 

They haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant 

issue.

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 

What -- what I think the appropriate remedy for the 

Court would be would be to effectively -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Vacate the opinion.

 MR. KROGER: -- vacate the opinion or 

decision on the Fourth Amendment claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would make you happy, 

won't it? Won't that make you happy?

 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the --

I think the only difficulty with that as a -- as a 

outcome of the case is it undercuts the logic of the 

Pearson decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't just do 

that. Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable 

position when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth 

Circuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait 

until there's another case when they can impose the view 

that they've already spelled out? I know as a technical 

matter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you

JUSTICE SCALIA: There are different panels 

on the Ninth Circuit, aren't there?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're supposed to

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But an opinion that is 

vacated is not circuit precedent, is it?

 MR. KROGER: It is not, Your Honor.

protected. He would presumably still be entitled to 

qualified immunity because a vacated alternative holding 

certainly could not really establish something, I would 

assume. But municipalities, if they continue to

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened in -­

what -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth 

Circuit decision? Before it said that the caseworkers 

could have this kind of interview with the -- the child 

where there was a suspicion of abuse. Was there any 

change in practice in Oregon in response to the Ninth 

Circuit's decision?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, that is not in the 

record, but I would happy -- be happy to respond. The 

State of Oregon provided legal advice advising child 

protective services workers to attempt to avoid anything 

that would be a seizure in a school and, in cases where 

there would pose no risk of danger to the children, to 

seek consent of -- of a parent before conducting an 

interview. Nevertheless, that legal advice puts a 

significant burden on the child protective services 

workers to -- to do their utmost to protect Oregon's 

children.

the investigation focused on the student rather than a 

third party? Would in those cases a warrant have to be 

obtained?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I think in -- in 

those cases, because parental consent is a viable 

alternative where the allegation is a child is being 

abused by another child -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, not another 

child. It could be anything. We think the child is, 

you know, selling drugs, obviously not a 7-year-old, but 

someone else in the school is involved in legal 

activity, him- or herself.

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe the -­

the child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there 

are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse 

without speaking to the only witness that's typically 

available in the case, and that is the child.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think 

it would be a different rule if we're talking about some 

other criminal activity? The father's selling drugs, 

and you think the child might have some evidence or at 

least be willing to talk about that. Do you need 

anything other than reasonableness in that case?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, it would be the 

same reasonableness standard that would apply, but I

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- we're getting

relevant category here?

 MR. KROGER: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that the child 

was -- was seized?

 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, we concede 

that the child was seized.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what happens if 

the teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the 

playground: Go back in the classroom. You can't -- you 

sit there by yourself. You can't be part of recess.

 Is that a seizure?

 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, I -- I disagree 

that that would be a seizure, because -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What made this a seizure? 

The fact that it wasn't a teacher?

 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the reason we 

conceded the issue of seizure is we are here on -- on 

summary judgment, and we took the facts as alleged, 

which involved transporting the student inside the 

school.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A number of the questions this morning have 

focused on the question whether a live case or 

controversy remains because Respondent has chosen not to 

challenge the Ninth Circuit's qualified immunity ruling 

and so purportedly has no continuing stake in the 

resolution of this controversy. We think that that's 

not correct for the reasons General Kroger has given, 

but it's also not an irreducible minimum of this Court's 

jurisdiction to correct the mistake that the Ninth 

Circuit made in this case. I think, too -­

did she -- let's go back one step. Does she have any 

viable claim now? This is not capable of repetition, 

evasive of review?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, two responses, Justice 

Ginsburg. First, as General Kroger mentioned, she has a 

continuing interest in how this Court resolves this 

controversy because of her attempt to bring the same 

Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County. But 

setting that aside, this Court hasn't universally 

required that as a prerequisite to exercising its 

jurisdiction. I think there are two examples that help 

to illustrate the point.

 The first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M. 

case, in which this Court decided to review a State 

court injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no 

longer had what we would think of as an Article III 

stake in the case by the time the case reached this 

Court.

 The plaintiff in that case had left the nude 

dancing business and had affirmatively stated they had 

no intention to return. The Court, nevertheless, 

reached the merits of the State court decision that was 

on review because to do otherwise would be to saddle the 

City of Erie with an ongoing injury. In the -­

 MS. KRUGER: There was indeed a dissent in 

that case. But I would note that there was also -­

 MS. KRUGER: -- a dissent from the denial of 

cert in Bunting v. Mellen, in which very much the same 

situation was presented. The cadets who brought the 

challenge to the VMI supper prayer that was at issue in 

that case had graduated from VMI by the time this case 

reached this Court. And I think, as you quite properly 

noted in your dissent from denial of review in that 

case, for this Court to essentially insulate those types 

of constitutional rulings from review would be to 

undermine the very purposes for which this Court -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, how does this -­

this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ 

from a wide variety of other situations in which we 

might not be able to get to the underlying 

constitutional ruling?

 For example, in any case where there's a 

constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling, 

or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards 

about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a 

finding that there's no prejudice. In all of those

kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might 

be insulated from our review. How would you say that 

the qualified immunity situation is different and how 

would you be able to cabin this rule?

 MS. KRUGER: The reason we think the 

qualified immunity situation is different, it presents a 

set of exceptional circumstances that weren't an 

exception to the usual prudential rule, is because the 

qualified immunity situation is one in which this Court 

has encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of 

constitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the 

legal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of 

establishing the law so that the -- that qualified 

immunity doesn't remain perpetually available to 

officials even though they are engaging in conduct -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, presumably, in every 

case -­

MS. KRUGER: -- that has been found 

unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. Presumably, in 

every case in which a court does these paired rulings, 

if you will -- it doesn't just say that the error was 

harmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a 

purpose to clarify the law. How is this different, once 

again?

MS. KRUGER: I think that in this situation 

what we have is not just a preview of how the court of 

appeals would decide the case subsequently in a case in 

which it was actually necessary to reach a certain 

judgment. What we have is a decision that changes the 

legal landscape going forward. It establishes the law 

such that qualified immunity will not be available in 

the next case. And it means that people like Petitioner 

Camreta and other child protective services workers who 

are doing their best to protect children from abuse are 

now on notice that if they attempt to detain temporarily 

a child in school for the purposes of trying to confirm 

or dispel a reasonable suspicion of child abuse without 

a warrant supported by probable cause, that they will 

invite lawsuits that would put them on the line for 

personal monetary damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wouldn't be the 

case if the opinion were vacated -­

MS. KRUGER: That's true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- under Munsingwear?

 MS. KRUGER: That's true, Justice Scalia,

ruling.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a 

partial vacatur, right? The Court's done that before, 

hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under 

Munsingwear?

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. But I would note that a vacatur rule would 

come with certain costs that I think this Court should 

keep in mind as it decides what the appropriate 

disposition of this case is.

 The reason that Respondent has so vigorously 

objected to that disposition is because it is 

inconsistent in some ways with the very reason for 

permitting courts of appeals to undertake this kind of 

constitutional determination in the first place. It 

undermines the -- the development of the constitutional 

law if this Court simply wipes the -- the slate clean 

but doesn't exercise its own authority to clarify the 

law by correcting what the Ninth Circuit has done. And 

I think, as the Chief Justice has quite correctly 

pointed out, it also does nothing to dispel the cloud of 

uncertainty that hangs over individuals within the 

territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.

(Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's vacated, it 

indicates that there's no established law on that 

question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do 

what he considered appropriate under the circumstances, 

and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on 

him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might 

have before.

 MS. KRUGER: I think that's correct, Mr. 

Chief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not 

object to that disposition in this case. We would just 

observe that that disposition is one that does not sit 

particularly comfortably with the reasoning of Pearson 

and the line of cases that comes before it, that 

recognizes that the reason why we encourage courts of 

appeals to undertake these determinations in the first 

place is to promote the development of constitutional 

law and to ensure that the law doesn't remain not 

clearly established in perpetuity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would 

affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child 

protective officers. The lawyer would explain: Now, 

legally this is not binding; it just never happened.

Constitution, and it would seem to me that any 

conscientious law enforcement officer would -- would 

take that seriously into account.

 MS. KRUGER: I think that's absolutely 

right, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? What's the test? 

Isn't the test clearly established law?

 MS. KRUGER: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would this be clearly 

established law under any -- any conceivable 

interpretation of that?

 MS. KRUGER: I think it's -- it's true that 

if this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's 

constitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are 

similarly situated wouldn't face the very significant 

concrete prospective effect of this decision, which is 

to strip them of qualified immunity in future cases. 

They would be able to argue, as you're suggesting, that 

the law is not clearly established. At the same time -­

MS. KRUGER: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg. 

The Ninth Circuit in this case held that the temporary 

detention of a child in school to confirm or dispel 

suspicions that that child is being abused is 

unconstitutional unless the questioning officials have a 

warrant, probable cause, or parental consent. We think 

each of those requirements is unjustified as a matter of 

Fourth Amendment law and imposes a serious burden on the 

conduct of the -- of the government at the initial 

stages of a child abuse investigation. As -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would -- I'm 

interrupting you only for a quick reason. What's the 

test? Is it a question of whether the seizure is 

reasonable or not?

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice 

Sotomayor. The question is reasonableness.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So -- so 

that would be your proposed test. If we were to say you 

don't need any of those three things right now, where 

would that leave us or leave the courts below on 

determining whether what happened here was reasonable or 

not? Meaning, what if a child is called in and says, I 

don't want to talk to you without my mom; and they 

continue to speak to the child? Is that reasonable?

the -- the interview is conducted, as opposed to whether 

it's -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we develop the 

law, or how do we help develop the law in this case if 

we answer your question but leave unanswered with no 

parameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts; 

no one's going to review that question -- of what is 

reasonable in this context?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, the question that the 

Ninth Circuit answered in this case was a question that 

concerns the justification for the interview at its 

inception. The Ninth Circuit said a warrant, probable 

cause, or parental consent is required from the very 

outset. That would be true whether an interview lasted 

2 hours or 10 minutes, whether the child was responsive, 

whether the child wasn't.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- you see, that's 

the problem with taking up a case with no case in 

controversy, because what do we do? We don't remand for 

them to reach the second question, which is really the 

one that law enforcement needs some help on.

whether we vacate the -- the order or not? Your 

position is your client has no continuing interest in 

the case.

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- our client has no 

legally binding, legally cognizable interest in the 

case. She has an interest in protecting her moral 

victory, as do -- and in the issue, as do the many amici 

who filed briefs on her behalf.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She's asserting the 

interests of other children who would be in the 

situation that she was once in, but no longer; but we 

have said the plaintiff herself must have a live 

controversy, and there was no class action here.

Justice Ginsburg. She does not have an interest, and 

the case is moot.

Circuit, it will arise again, and this Court will have

of appeals said specifically our caseworkers and police

protractive custodial setting with -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading in 

the holding of the court of appeals? Because I was 

under the impression that they did say there's only 

three ways: One is you get a warrant; another is you 

get parental consent; and a third is exigent 

circumstances. I thought that was the -- the ruling of 

law by the Ninth Circuit.

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That was -- that was the 

ruling as it applied to S.G. herself, Justice Ginsburg. 

This was not a class action lawsuit, and the court was 

deciding what happened to one 9-year-old child on 

February 24th, 2003.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's see where 

they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single 

plaintiff; it's not a class action. But they're making 

a rule of law. What does the Fourth Amendment require?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Okay. On page 1022, Your

always permissible under the Fourth Amendment without 

probable cause and a warrant or the equivalent of a 

warrant." And the court -- and the court said: No, not 

always and not in this case.

 And if this Court does reach the merits 

of -- of this case, we would ask this Court to uphold a 

rule that -- stating that a protracted custodial 

interview of a child by police and child welfare 

investigators is presumptively unconstitutional unless 

they have a warrant or court order or parental consent 

or exigent circumstances.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is there in the Ninth 

Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a 

warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation 

was relevant to their decision? I mean, at least the 

child protective services need to decide whether they 

need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no 

matter how long it's going to last.

 Where does it say that the length is 

relevant to the -- to the issue that they decided?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the -­

the length of the questioning has been historically 

important to this Court's jurisprudence. It

ask this Court to adopt, that is, seizure and for a 

custodial interrogation is presumptively unreasonable

who are of suitable age and discretion to knowingly make 

a decision whether or not to talk to an armed police 

officer and a caseworker without their parents having to 

make it for them. But -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you -- I

Answering Justice Scalia's question: Child walks into 

the room -- is taken out of their classroom, walks into 

the room. The officer says: We've heard that your 

mommy and daddy are doing some things to your private 

parts; is that true? And the child says -- 9-year-old 

child says: I wish somebody had asked me before. I'm 

so afraid of my daddy. He does these horrible things to 

me.

 Are you seriously suggesting that if the 

police stay there for an hour debriefing that child as 

to the circumstances of that situation, that that's a 

seizure? It seems to me that what you -­

MS. KUBITSCHEK: A seizure, yes, but that 

would have exigent circumstances, and that would get it 

out of the warrant requirement.

room and just asking the question? When does -- that's

what you seem to have said to Justice Scalia, which is 

that the mere removal from the classroom is the -- the 

defining feature of seizure. So it can't be that.

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't know if 

there's exigent circumstances until they ask the 

question.

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You got a stipulation 

that there was a seizure, so -­

seizure.

argument that was not at issue in this case. Given that 

there was seizure -­

it reasonable?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you, in the -- many 

of the questions have gone to leads, but this is 

initially a social worker's investigation. And you 

said, when stating what the Ninth Circuit's rule was, 

that police are in combination with the caseworker.

comes to the school and asks to talk to this child is 

the caseworker from the department of health?

police entanglement, as this Court ruled in Ferguson v. 

The City of Charleston. In this particular case, the -­

elicited from the child is that she has been abused by

Court recognized also that possibility in Ferguson v. 

The City of Charleston, that the -- the nurses at the 

hospital would call child protective services, but 

the -- the -- you have to look at it from the beginning, 

and in this case, the case began when -- on 

February 10th, when the police got involved.

 The police did not report the matter to the 

child protective investigator until 10 days later, and 

then they went out together. Subsequently, the child 

protective investigator testified before a grand jury as 

part of the ongoing law enforcement investigation and, 

in fact, when he was questioned at his deposition,

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what is your answer to 

Justice Ginsburg's question, suppose it was just 

Mr. Camreta or suppose it was the school nurse, would 

the answer be the same?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: No, it would not be the 

same if it was the school nurse or Mr. Camreta. And 

the -- the reason is that the school nurse is part of 

the school administration, and the school has an 

obligation and the authority under T.L.O. act and in 

Earls to make rules and carry out procedures that will 

protect the children of the school and promote learning,

something else that is going to very much harm that 

child, why is that any different?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, because 

child welfare investigations are also harmful to 

children. And when -- when a child is asked, 

interrogated about whether or not her father touches her 

inappropriately, that's not a neutral action. Whether 

or not she has been abused that causes trauma to the

reasonable?

And it's hard to swallow that if a police 

officer asks a child are you being abused and the child 

says, yes, I need help, it is nearly impossible to think 

that that seizure is unreasonable. You're -- you're -­

you're -- it may well be that 2 hours for a protesting 

child would be, but isn't that all subject to a question 

of reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor,

reasonableness of the seizure. I was asking you about 

whether there has been a seizure. Step one, has there 

been a seizure? And you're saying that in a lot of 

these situations there simply hasn't been a seizure.

 Now, once there is a seizure, then we can 

inquire to whether it's unreasonable or not. But -- but 

those are two distinct questions, and -- and we've been 

discussing the mere existence of a seizure. Now, true 

in this case it was already conceded, but you're asking 

us to adopt a rule for future cases, and we can't adopt

Amendment question, because in this particular case it 

was conceded that there was a seizure so early in the -­

in the case that the normal development of facts which, 

as Justice Scalia, you have pointed out, whether or not 

there is a seizure is certainly dependent on the 

individual facts of the encounter between the individual 

child and the individual police officer.

constitutional issue and then rules that the defendant

but really going all the way back to Siegert v. Gilley,

reach the constitutional issue -- in Siegert this Court 

said that they can. In County of Sacramento v. Lewis,

tell the officials who investigate child abuse that in 

the name of protecting children, they do not have free 

rein to do anything and everything that they think is 

appropriate, because what they do harms children, 

including the very children they claim to be trying to 

protect.

 As Justice Breyer said, even raising those 

questions would -- would be beneficial to children who 

are forced to undergo child abuse investigations, 75 

percent of whom have not been abused at all, and who 

find the experience psychologically traumatic.

abuse, or would you set it at some lower level?

 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, in fact, Your Honor, 

the -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking 

court approval, and their -- they differ in whether they 

require probable cause or reasonable suspicion or 

something like reasonable cause; and so while we put in 

our brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been 

based upon probable cause, given the law enforcement 

component, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy 

sheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a 

child welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker 

were going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some 

kind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of 

the States differ between reasonable suspicion and 

probable cause, I would suggest that the better course 

would be to let this play itself out between those two 

legal standards.

your office had advised the county not to seize 

children. Does that mean they're not talking to

have to talk to children in a way which runs no risk of 

being found of seizing the children within the meaning 

of the Ninth Circuit decision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so then walking along 

the hall in the school, right?

 MR. KROGER: I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just come up alongside: 

"By the way, I wanted to ask you whether your mother --"

 (Laughter.)

 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, and you can 

see the problem which the Ninth Circuit decision causes 

practically on the child welfare system in the State of 

Oregon. The -- Mr. Camreta and other child protective 

services workers under the Ninth Circuit decision face 

an enormous burden. In most of these cases it is 

impossible to establish probable cause to get a warrant

without first speaking to the child because the child is 

usually the only witness that is available to the 

government; and so to require, as the Ninth Circuit has 

here, that we obtain a warrant prior to even speaking to 

a child victim places -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the standard? 

mean, I just assume you're not suggesting that this 

procedure could be used with every child in every school 

without some ground for suspicion, correct?

 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, we believe that 

reasonable suspicion is the -- is the proper basis 

before making a seizure of a child to conduct one of 

these inquiries.

 Significant here in Griffin and subsequent 

cases like Lidster, the Court has recognized that the 

relationship between the State and the person being 

searched or seized is significant to the reasonableness 

analysis, and here it is not an adversarial 

relationship. The child and the State share a 

significant interest in making sure that that child is 

safe; and were the government to continue to be put in a 

position of not being able to speak to a child until 

probable cause has developed in some other way, children 

will continue to be placed at risk.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, I take it that

that problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we 

find there's no jurisdiction. If we Munsingwear this 

case, the decision is wiped off the case, you return to 

status quo ante, and you tell all your people that they 

can do what they would have done beforehand; is that 

right?

 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 

That would be a -- a significant step forward for Mr. 

Camreta and others similarly placed. The -- the 

challenge is that those kind of claims then would be 

perpetually subject to -- to qualified immunity because 

the law would not be clarified. And that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you -- are you -­

and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex 

ante. At any moment that an agency speaks to a child, 

they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct? 

And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't, 

right?

 MR. KROGER: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And law enforcement is 

never going to know where that line of reasonableness or 

unreasonableness is, is that correct?

 MR. KROGER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's in -- that's in 

the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?

MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. That's part 

of the reason we agreed that a seizure was committed 

here, so that law enforcement are not placed in a 

difficult position every time they speak to a child, of 

trying to make their own determination as to whether -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they do it anyway, 

meaning even if we say that they can seize the child, 

you would still have to not do a seizure that was 

unreasonable. You wouldn't -- in scope. They can't 

speak to the child endlessly, can they?

 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, that's correct. 

The government officials will have to conduct that -­

that seizure in a reasonable manner for a reasonable 

duration. That's different, I think, though, Your 

Honor, than the threshold question of if they start to 

talk to a child, of trying to judge in the middle of an 

interview, have we gone too far, has a seizure occurred.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not quite sure why 

you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was 

your strategic choice.

 MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, the question 

is whether vacating the decision will have an impact on 

the litigation below, and it will. The Respondent is 

seeking to preserve the Ninth Circuit decision precisely 

to aid the Fourth Amendment claim that the Respondent is

making against Deschutes County, and thus, this is 

somewhat analogous to the situation in the Pacific Bell 

case, where you have a Petitioner and Respondent seeking 

different remedies from this Court in light of the 

impact that it will have on subsequent litigation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Ms. Kubitschek said it was 

based on different events. Is that right or not?

JUSTICE ALITO: The Fourth Amendment claim 

against the county is based on -- on this interview?
