(10:12 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Rapanos v. United States and 

Carabell v. the United States Army Corps of Engineers. 

Mr. Hopper. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034 

MR. HOPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court: 

This is a case of agency overreaching. In 

this case, the Corps and EPA pushed the very limits of 

congressional authority, contrary to the plain text of 

the act and without any clear indication Congress 

intended that result. They claim 404(a) jurisdiction 

over the entire tributary system, from the smallest 

trickle to the largest watershed, swapping in --

sweeping in remote, non-navigable wetlands 20 miles 

from the traditional navigable water. 

This limitless claim of jurisdiction shifts 

the Federal/State balance and raises significant 

constitutional questions. We believe this boundless 

interpretation is inconsistent with this Court's 

reading of the act in Solid Waste Agency. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It goes somewhat beyond the

smallest trickle? Doesn't it? Doesn't it also include 

ditches that currently don't have any trickle if they 

obtain a trickle during a rainstorm? 

MR. HOPPER: Yes, Your Honor. They actually 

argued that it -- it makes no difference whether there 

-- what the substantiality is or the directness of the 

connection is. It's irrelevant to the jurisdictional 

determination. 

And as I said, they -- the -- the agencies 

assert jurisdiction over even the entire watershed. 

For example, the Mississippi watershed, the largest in 

the Nation, covers 1 million square acre -- 1 million 

square miles and reaches from the Rockies to the 

Appalachians and drains 41 percent of the 48 lower 

States. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So where would you --

where would -- where would you put the line? 

MR. HOPPER: I'd put the line where Congress 

put the line, Your Honor. Congress declared in 404(a) 

that it would prohibit the discharge of fill and 

dredged material into the navigable waters. So the --

these agencies can permit or prohibit any discharge, no 

matter where it occurs, so long as it reaches a 

navigable water. That would be the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then -- but you were

-- you are including at least wetlands that abut --

MR. HOPPER: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- navigable water. 

MR. HOPPER: Yes. Traditional navigable 

waters plus abutting wetlands inseparably bound up. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about major 

tributaries? 

MR. HOPPER: Congress cannot regulate all 

tributaries. It could regulate some tributaries --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which ones? 

MR. HOPPER: -- but would have to do so on a 

case-by-case basis. The regulation of all tributaries 

raises significant constitutional questions and 

contrary to the regulation of -- of wetlands that are 

inseparably bound up. And there's no clear indication 

that Congress intended to regulate any tributaries, let 

alone the entire tributary system. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is your position no 

tributaries or some tributaries? 

MR. HOPPER: The -- the act, by its terms, 

does not recognize the -- the regulation of any 

tributary. It does --

JUSTICE ALITO: Does it make sense to say 

that any wetlands that it abuts a traditionally 

navigable water is covered, but a tributary that leads

right into a traditionally navigable water is not 

necessarily covered? 

MR. HOPPER: I think -- I think it's fair to 

say that under this Court's determination in Solid 

Waste Agency that the only wetlands that are covered 

are those that are abutting and inseparably bound up. 

It makes sense to do so because by regulating those 

types of wetlands, the Government is essentially 

declaring them the equivalent of the navigable 

waterway. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but they're doing it 

for a functional reason. The functional reason is that 

if you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's 

going to get into the navigable water. Exactly the 

same argument can be made as you go further and further 

up the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you 

concede, as I think you have to, that there can be a 

regulation that goes beyond literally navigable water 

at the point at which the -- the pollutant is added, 

then you have to follow the same logic right up through 

the watershed to -- to any point at which a pollutant, 

once added, will eventually get into the navigable 

water. 

MR. HOPPER: The reason that logic does not 

apply, Your Honor, is because the regulation of -- of

tributaries raises significant constitutional questions 

that are not implicated by the regulation of a wetland 

inseparably --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to 

accept the fact that -- that Congress cannot 

effectively regulate the navigable -- the -- the 

condition of the navigable water itself because if all 

the -- the -- let's -- let's assume there's a class of 

-- of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck 

the -- the navigable waters of the United States. All 

they have to do is get far enough upstream and they can 

dump anything they want to. It will eventually get 

into the navigable water, and Congress can't do 

anything about it on your theory. 

MR. HOPPER: That's incorrect, Your Honor. 

We acknowledge that under the -- the act, the 

Government can regulate any discharge that actually 

reaches the navigable water. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're -- you're going to 

-- you -- you then want to draw a distinction between 

the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a -- a 

conventional synthetic poison. 

MR. HOPPER: No. Either -- in either case, 

if -- if the -- if the discharge of dredged material 

actually enters into a navigable water, regardless of

where it's discharged, it would be covered. Same for a 

conventional toxin. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean on -- on -- in 

every -- in every case then, I mean, Congress would 

have to -- I'm sorry -- a scientist would have to 

analyze the molecules and -- and trace them up, and so 

long as they could -- could trace it to a specific 

discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they 

couldn't? I mean, that -- you know, you know what I'm 

getting at. That obviously would -- would totally 

thwart the regulation. 

MR. HOPPER: I don't -- I don't believe it 

would, Your Honor. The -- the -- certainly Congress 

did not think so in section --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't you simply assume 

that anything that is discharged into a tributary 

ultimately goes where the tributary goes? Wouldn't it 

be enough to prove the discharge? 

MR. HOPPER: Well, it certainly wasn't true 

in this case, Your Honor. The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't think it would 

be enough for the -- for the Government to prove the 

discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the 

act has been violated. 

MR. HOPPER: No, Your Honor, I do not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You really think it has to

MR. HOPPER: Absolutely. That's -- that's 

what the terms of the act require. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do 

you define a tributary? 

MR. HOPPER: Well, the -- that's one of the 

problems here, Your Honor, is that -- is that the 

agency has -- has established a moving target for --

for tributaries. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what's your 

definition? 

MR. HOPPER: Well, the -- the definitions 

we're working with here, to which we object, is that --

is that it includes anything in the hydrological 

connection. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what you 

object to, and I know that you think your client isn't 

covered. But I don't know what test you would have us 

adopt for what constitutes a tributary. 

MR. HOPPER: Well, we're suggesting that --

that this Court need not define tributary because under 

the act all tributaries are excluded. The only -- the 

only prohibited act --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but we

still don't know what you're excluding. I mean, the 

Missouri is a tributary of the Mississippi, but I 

assume it's still covered. 

MR. HOPPER: Those -- anything that is not of 

a -- anything does not constitute the channel, the 

traditional navigable water, and anything not abutting 

as a -- as a inseparably bound up wetland would 

constitute a tributary. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it seems to me 

that what works in your favor is -- is it SWANCC? I 

don't -- I'm not quite sure how to pronounce the case. 

MR. HOPPER: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Migratory Bird Rule 

case where we said there had to be a significant nexus. 

But I think what the Court is asking you is -- is how 

to define significant nexus. We're -- if you want us 

just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the 

Corps of Engineers should use its expertise to come up 

with a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for 

us to write. 

MR. HOPPER: Well, this Court did not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that 

that's what you're asking us to do here. 

MR. HOPPER: This Court did not suggest in --

in SWANCC that a significant nexus constitutes the

jurisdictional standard for all -- for all waters. 

That standard only applies to wetlands that are 

adjacent to traditional navigable waters. 

The jurisdictional standard is determined by 

the terms of the act. In -- in SWANCC, this Court 

determined that the act was clear and should be read as 

written to avoid the constitutional questions raised by 

a broad interpretation of the act. As written --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: From everything -- from 

everything you said, it sounds like you're -- you're 

taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a 

wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a 

stream that goes right into it? What sense does that 

distinction make? 

MR. HOPPER: It makes perfect sense, Your 

Honor, because the regulation of those tributaries and 

streams, all of them in the entire tributary system, 

raise significant constitutional questions that are not 

implicated by regulating wetlands that are inseparably 

bound up with traditional navigable water. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: More than that, Mr. Hopper. 

I thought and I had expected you to -- to respond to 

Justice Souter's question this way, his question about 

how come putting poison in -- in the wetlands is bad, 

but it's okay to put it in the tributary. But they --

as I understand it, the reason we held wetlands were 

included within the waters of the United States was not 

-- not that, that you could poison the waters by 

poisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's 

very hard to tell where the navigable water ends and 

the wetland begins. And -- and we said, you know, 

we're not going to parse that. If it's -- if it's 

adjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going 

to say it's part of a navigable water. 

MR. HOPPER: That's right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was our 

basis. 

MR. HOPPER: That's exactly right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, that basis 

doesn't apply to tributaries, does it? You -- you can 

always tell where the tributary ends. It ends at the 

point where it goes into the main river. 

MR. HOPPER: I think that's correct, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You think that's correct 

about what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased 

the question as before discharging fill material into 

wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and 

their tributaries. That's what the Court thought it 

was deciding in Riverside Bayview.

 MR. HOPPER: The Court did frame the question 

that way, Your Honor. However, the Court's commentary 

about tributaries was not germane to its -- to its 

holding. Tributaries was not a question before the 

Court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: At any rate, they could 

not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia 

suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the 

tributaries rolled right into the navigable body. 

MR. HOPPER: Well, as I said, the -- the 

Court's commentary in Riverside Bayview is not good law 

because the -- the Court was not addressing the -- a 

tributary's question in that case, and it was not faced 

with a Commerce Clause challenge as it is in this case. 

And at that time, the agency did not interpret 

tributaries to include every hydrological reach of the 

-- of the tributary system. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't the 

reference to tributary make it relatively plain that 

what the Court was getting at was the impossibility of 

drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and 

tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the 

other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect 

the purity of the ultimate navigable water? And isn't 

the inclusion of the reference to tributaries an

indication that it said if we want to attain the 

objective, which is clearly constitutional, then we 

have got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of 

-- of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order 

to reach that objective? Isn't that the reasoning that 

is apparent from what Justice Ginsburg just -- just 

read to you? 

MR. HOPPER: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

The -- the problem that -- that the agencies have in 

this case, which was underscored in Solid Waste Agency, 

is that the Government cannot show any clear indication 

that Congress intended to regulate the entire tributary 

system. In Solid Waste Agency, this Court did 

recognize that because of congressional acquiescence, 

Congress intended to regulate wetlands adjacent to 

navigable waters, but as to other waters, this Court 

could come to no conclusion because the Congress had 

never defined other waters. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- except for the 

-- it seems to me except for -- for your -- your 

argument is -- is fine except for one problem. And 

that is, if we -- if we assume that Congress was being 

as -- as cautious as you suggest, then Congress' 

caution, in effect, was -- was allowing an end run 

around the regulation for the reasons we went into a

moment ago. All you've got to do is -- is dump the 

pollutant further -- far enough upstream in the 

watershed and you get away scot-free. And it's very 

difficult to believe that Congress could have intended 

that. 

MR. HOPPER: I don't think it's difficult to 

believe that at all, Your Honor. We simply look at --

at the goals and objectives that Congress itself 

adopted in furtherance of this mission to protect the 

waters. If we look at 1251(a), Congress declares that 

its purpose is to protect the integrity of the Nation's 

waters. It used that term, Nation's waters. And then 

in -- in 1251(a)(1), it says it will accomplish this by 

eliminating the discharge of pollutants into the 

navigable waters, showing that it knows how to 

distinguish between all waters and navigable waters. 

And then in 1251(b), Congress says we will respect and 

defer to the States' primary responsibility to address 

local water pollution and to manage local land and 

water use. So the way that Congress intended to 

address this issue was to defer to the States to 

regulate pollutants upstream while Congress -- or while 

the Federal Government regulates downstream. That's a 

perfectly rational approach to this national problem.

but your answer earlier to Justice Souter's earlier 

question was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere 

and they make their way to the navigable water, you're 

covered. Right? 

MR. HOPPER: Are covered if they make it --

their way all the way there. If they don't, then the 

States have that responsibility. And every State in 

the Nation has antipollution regulation. 

If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. STOEPKER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1384 

MR. STOEPKER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 

After years of review by the State of 

Michigan and the Respondent, the record is very clear. 

Petitioners' wetland is hydrologically isolated from 

any navigable water of the United States. 

Further, the State of Michigan, exercising 

the power specifically and traditionally reserved to 

it, undertook responsibility to regulate the waters at 

issue and pollution and, in doing so, issued Petitioner 

a wetland permit.

 It is clear from the record in this case that 

there is no hydrological connection between the 

Petitioners' wetland and navigable waters of the United 

States. Referring to the appendix filed, the joint 

appendix filed in this case, specifically beginning 

with the EPA letters dating back to 1994, as this 

property has been under years of review, do not 

reference any such connection. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did we talk about a 

hydrological connection in Riverside Bayview? 

MR. STOEPKER: The -- the connection there 

was -- in essence, yes, Your Honor, based upon the 

inseparable, bound-up nature of those wetlands which 

were immediately adjacent to the navigable water. 

There was nothing that separated those wetlands from 

that specific body of water. They were immediately 

adjacent and intersected with that body of water. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure what you mean 

by a hydrological connection. Do you mean a constant 

-- a constant body of water between the two, or do you 

mean simply a -- a drain that at some times might carry 

off rainwater from -- from this land? And -- would 

that -- would that suffice to be a hydrological 

connection?

Honor, there was no connection at all. In this case, 

there was no connection identified. It was speculated 

that there might be a potential --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Water never ran off of this 

-- of this land. 

MR. STOEPKER: No. If you look -- that is 

correct. If you look at the circuit court opinion, it 

-- and even the district court opinion and the findings 

made, there is no finding that any water has ever left 

the Petitioners' wetland into the ditch. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do they have to make 

this on a plot-by-plot basis, or can they make a 

categorical judgment that even in cases in which, you 

know, there's a berm, as there is here, when the water 

is high, it spills over? And if the categorical 

judgment is sound, do you have an exception because 

they haven't proven it with respect to your particular 

lot? 

MR. STOEPKER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. In --

in this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where do you get that 

exception? 

MR. STOEPKER: In the Respondents' brief on 

page 18, they acknowledge that the traditional test has 

been hydrological connection, that that's what they

have looked towards. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- and the -- but I 

mean, what I'm getting at is the traditional test is 

the basis for a categorical judgment. Your land falls 

within the general category. Your argument is I should 

not be subject to it, to the statute, because of the 

general category. I should be subject to it only if 

they prove specifically that the water spills over in 

rainy periods in my particular lot. In other words, 

you're saying there's got to be a specific connection 

as opposed to a categorical judgment. And my question 

is what under the act supports that view. 

MR. STOEPKER: Under the act, it talks about 

the issue of discharge. That is the -- that is the 

matter that is being regulated by the statute, an 

actual discharge into the navigable body of water. If 

you have an hydrologically isolated body of water, you 

cannot physically have a discharge into the navigable 

stream. It is an impossibility. And therefore, the 

act does not allow the speculation that the Court is 

referring to here. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so your -- maybe what 

you're saying is we have shown or the record shows that 

this doesn't fit within the category because it never 

spills over or whatever. Is that your argument?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stoepker, your 

friend, Mr. Hopper, would certainly not agree with you 

that -- that a -- a hydrological connection is the, 

quote, traditional test. What -- what is your 

definition of tradition? 

MR. STOEPKER: Our definition --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How long has this test been 

established? 

MR. STOEPKER: If you look at Respondents' 

brief in their arguments to this Court, they first 

state, page 18, that in fact traditionally they've 

looked at hydrological connection. Second, they --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Traditionally. 

MR. STOEPKER: Traditionally.

undertook a interrelationship analysis of the wetland 

to the tributary or body of water and that they then 

defer that to the permit review. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. So you're -- you're 

not conceding that -- that hydrologic -- hydrological 

connection is adequate. You're just -- is sufficient. 

You're just saying it's necessary. 

MR. STOEPKER: We're -- that is correct, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to the 

question earlier? What is a hydrological connection? 

Is it enough if the water seeps through the ground and 

underground is connected with the navigable water, or 

does there have to be a ditch or -- or a culvert that 

you can see the water flowing through? 

MR. STOEPKER: Yes, Your Honor. The --

case, again, there was no surface water connection, and 

due to the nature of the clay soils, it was found that 

there was no groundwater connection --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was it also clear 

that after the improvement, there would be no drainage? 

MR. STOEPKER: After the improvement, there 

could be drainage. Ironically the Respondent in this 

case actually recommends that the barriers between this 

site and the ditch be removed. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one 

clarifying question? Was it found that there was no 

connection, or was it not found that there was a 

connection? 

MR. STOEPKER: It was found that there was 

not a connection. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It was. I didn't read it 

that way. 

MR. STOEPKER: If you -- referring the Court 

to the Respondents' report dated May 5th of 2000, it 

specifically states --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where are you reading from? 

MR. STOEPKER: This is from appendix page 81 

and 83. This is a report that starts with the term 

jurisdictional at the top.

wetland is not adjacent to navigable water. It then 

notes the wetland is not adjacent to headwater. And 

then it makes a comment. It says, to a tributary to 

navigable water, and it says, no. 

The sole basis for jurisdiction in that 

report is the Migratory Bird Rule. The Respondent took 

out to the property who they believed to be the most 

credible expert they had on migratory birds and then 

state that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. I want to be 

sure I follow you. You say that somewhere on page 82 

there is a finding that there was no hydrological 

connection?

not.

JUSTICE SOUTER: And again, where --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What page are you on? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where are you? 

MR. STOEPKER: I'm going to refer you to the 

specific pages. 

They first referenced clay soils on page 93. 

These are the same clay soils that the State 

administrative law judge, after much hearing on the 

record, found were impermeable to prevent groundwater 

and surface water discharge. 

Then at page 97 of the appendix, the 

Respondent finds that due to site conditions -- I will 

quote -- this wetland has been obstructed from 

receiving runoff from surrounding area and from 

circulation by flooding into the drain. End of quote. 

Then referring to page 99 of the same 

appendix, I quote. The parcel is not currently a part 

of the S-O Drain watershed, being the Sutherland-Oemig

watershed. 

Then referring to page 100 where they comment 

on navigation, they state, no impact on navigation. 

And then finally at page 106 of the appendix, 

the features on this site -- and again I quote --

presently isolate the wetland from the S-O Drain and 

receiving waters. 

So it receives none and it gives none. They 

used the term in their report isolated. There is no 

finding anywhere to the contrary in any reports issued, 

or thereafter at the public hearing that was conducted 

by the Respondent, that there is any connection. In 

fact, the Sixth Circuit noted there was no connection. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what was the reason 

they gave for rejecting the permit? 

MR. STOEPKER: The -- the sole reason claimed 

for jurisdiction at the agency hearing was adjacency to 

this non-navigable, unnamed ditch, which was dug by the 

county for a sewer system. That's the sole reason. 

The same argument appeared at the district court level, 

adjacency to the unnamed, unnavigable ditch. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I'm still not clear as 

to what the findings were, if there were findings, as

to what the condition would be after the improvement. 

Would there be an increased likelihood of drainage into 

the ditch after the improvement? 

MR. STOEPKER: The -- it -- it could occur in 

two different ways. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if that were so, 

would that be sufficient for jurisdiction? 

MR. STOEPKER: They -- that -- that was not 

their finding because in this case they actually 

recommended, whether or not anything occurred on the 

property, that the berms or barriers be removed. They 

actually recommend there be an interaction between the 

wetland and the ditch. That's the irony of this. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, well -- suppose the 

interaction were automatic. Would that suffice to make 

this a wetlands after the improvement? 

MR. STOEPKER: It -- it is our position in 

this case no because the ditch next to the site has not 

been regulated under the rules adopted by the 

Respondent and -- nor under the statute adopted by 

Congress. The ditch is -- has been historically 

designated as a point source or a source point, as has 

been the drain under the statute. 

In 1975, after the district court ruled that 

the Respondent's rules were too narrow from a

jurisdictional standpoint, the Respondent then expanded 

its rules in 1975. In the preamble to those rules, it 

specifically stated that ditches -- ditches of this 

nature, drainage ditches, were specifically exempted as 

waters of the United States. That is in the preamble. 

We then go to 19 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what -- what 

is the test that you would have us adopt for a 

significant nexus? 

MR. STOEPKER: Our -- our test for 

significant nexus would start with the -- the basis 

that there must be an established, existing 

hydrological connection between the wetland and the 

body of water adjacent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By that, you mean 

either a ditch or underground seepage? 

MR. STOEPKER: Yes.

connection works.

We're saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't 

have to define what -- everything that's necessary. 

All you have to define is one indispensable element. 

And all you're arguing is that a hydrological 

connection is an indispensable element, whatever 

additional elements --

MR. STOEPKER: That is correct.

agree with your friend, Mr. Hopper.

if there's no hydrological connection today, but there 

would be after you -- after you built your project? 

MR. STOEPKER: At that point, then maybe the 

Respondent could determine there would be some form of 

regulation if, in fact, the discharge was into a ditch 

that was, in fact, regulated. And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it -- would it be a 

sufficient reason to deny a permit based on the 

judgment that after the project is completed, there 

will be a -- a hydrological connection? 

MR. STOEPKER: The test is from the outset, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. It seems to me you 

could answer that yes or no. 

MR. STOEPKER: Yes. No. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps you don't want to

MR. STOEPKER: The -- the resulting impact --

I would say no. The resulting impact has not been 

determined for jurisdiction.

foolish to say that we're concerned about pollution, 

but only if you -- only if you catch it in advance?

arise when you did what you're seeking a permit to do, 

why shouldn't you be denied the permit? 

MR. STOEPKER: The application for the permit 

does not automatically equate to a request to 

discharge. The fill of a wetland does not 

automatically discharge into the ditch. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but my hypothesis is 

that we know it would happen, or they -- they would 

find it would happen after the project is completed. 

And it seems to me that -- that that's what you should 

focus on rather than what's -- you know, rather than 

what happens before. 

MR. STOEPKER: This Court's test in SWANCC is 

based upon the before, and also based upon Riverside, 

it examined the before condition and the impact on that 

navigable water. And what is to be prevented is the 

discharge into that navigable water. And that is the 

initial test that is conducted. 

If the Court examines the Respondent's actual 

test data, what they examined here was the 

jurisdictional determination from the beginning. Is 

there a connection? Is it isolated? Is it not 

isolated? They didn't look at the after-effect. They 

looked at the after-effect in relationship to issuing 

or not issuing the permit.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What we're talking about 

here is -- is at -- at most, whether this is a water of 

the United States. The condition for requiring permits 

is that it -- it be a water of the United States. 

Isn't that right? 

MR. STOEPKER: That is correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it either is or it 

isn't, not -- not that it will be. It either is or it 

isn't. If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it 

isn't, you don't need a permit. 

MR. STOEPKER: That is correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And Justice Stevens' 

question I think in -- in that framework is -- is this. 

If it will result in discharge after the project, is 

it a water of the United States now? 

MR. STOEPKER: Under the Court's definition 

in SWANCC and Riverside, the answer again is no. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then Congress has 

passed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after 

the horse is stolen. I mean, that -- maybe that's what 

it did, but that's -- that would be a very odd thing 

for it to do, wouldn't it? 

MR. STOEPKER: It did not do so, Your Honor, 

because specifically under section 1251(b), it reserved 

to the States the primary responsibility of regulating

pollution within its waters. The primary 

responsibility. That primary responsibility is not 

designated to the Respondent in this case. A shift 

would -- in -- in that framework would shift the 

primary responsibility to the Respondent and take that 

primary responsibility away from the State. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it would do so 

in -- in cases of -- I guess, of the -- the sorts of --

of new proposed actions that require the -- the Corps 

to get into it in the first place. But I also assume 

that it would leave lots of -- of water pollution 

regulation to the States. I don't see that it would 

displace the States. 

MR. STOEPKER: In this case, it actually --

the decision of the Respondent did displace the State. 

The State, after years of examination and 

determination of impact, made a decision to issue a 

wetland permit to this project and, in doing so, found 

specifically that the issuance of the permit would be 

better, effective method of dealing with pollution than 

not issuing the permit. That was the specific finding 

made by the administrative law judge in that appendix, 

and those findings are the first part of the appendix 

in this case, detailed findings after a 2-week 

administrative trial where witnesses were cross-

examined and examined. 

In this case, the Respondent has ignored 

those State powers given to its traditional waters and 

has said, we're going to ignore, number one, your claim 

of jurisdiction, and number two, we're going to ignore 

your finding of no impact and completely disregard 

that. 

So, in fact, the framework in this case did 

shift. The State did what it was supposed to do under 

1251(b) and the -- the Respondent in this case usurped 

that responsibility and those traditional powers 

granted to it traditionally and both by this statute, 

and then determined that what the State of Michigan did 

had no relevance. It was unwarranted. So the 

framework in this case did specifically change. 

And in doing so, we get back to those same 

factual findings they've made. We are here only today 

because they found that it is adjacent to a ditch which 

they have said is not a waters of the United States. 

So in this case, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the only reason it's a 

water of the United States is that there are some 

puddles on this land. Right? And if there were no 

puddles, it -- it wouldn't be a water of the United 

States. It would just be land of the United States.

 MR. STOEPKER: That's correct, because 

there's some puddles on the land occasionally. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it -- it becomes waters 

of the United States because there are puddles on it, 

and you assert because those puddles have some 

hydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water 

of the United States, those puddles have some 

hydrological connections with the navigable waters. 

MR. STOEPKER: To -- to be waters of the 

United States, they would have to have a hydrological 

connection as a minimum test to be a part of the waters 

of the United States. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the -- the 

statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill 

material, which is what is going on here, into the 

navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites. 

I'm sorry. The -- the permits that -- that are 

required here --

MR. STOEPKER: That is correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- permit discharge into 

waters, not -- not into lands that aren't waters. 

MR. STOEPKER: No. The -- that is correct. 

The permit permits the discharge into a navigable water 

of the United States. That is the object of the 

permit.

 Again, the rules that the Respondent has 

adopted since 1975 have specifically excluded the 

Nundane ditch, as well as the drain next to that ditch, 

as being defined as waters of the United States. So 

therefore, even if they could show a connection, which 

is a question that has been raised, would in fact the 

wetland be regulated, by the -- by the Respondents' own 

definitions and by the statutory definition which 

excludes a ditch and a drain under section 1262(12) and 

(14), neither the ditch or the Sutherland-Oemig drain 

by definition is a water of the United States. It is a 

point source and therefore not a water. So even if 

they could --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask one question 

about your -- your not -- no hydrological connection? 

If this berm were next to a wetland that would 

otherwise be adjacent to a river, the situation that 

was presented in Riverside Bayview, is it the berm that 

prevents there being a hydrological connection? 

MR. STOEPKER: In this case, there are two 

things. The first, the berm segregates the surface 

water connection between the two, and then second, the 

nature of the soils being clay, which are not permeable 

soils, create the additional segregation between that 

and the body of water.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it could -- there could 

be a situation where the wetlands would be right next 

to the river, but there's a berm in between, and that 

would break the hydrological connection? 

MR. STOEPKER: It would break the 

hydrological connection. However, this Court has ruled 

in the Riverside case that those wetlands which are 

adjacent to navigable waters -- it did not reach the 

issue whether they were not adjacent to non-navigable 

waters. They only addressed the -- this Court only 

addressed the issue of relationship to navigable 

waters. In that case, this Court specifically found 

that wetlands adjacent to navigable waters were 

regulated. 

The Court specifically reserved the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it -- do you 

think it mean adjacent with a berm in between? I -- I 

thought the reason they -- they reached that conclusion 

was you can't tell where the navigable water ends and 

where the wetland begins. I -- I thought they assumed 

a connection between the two. 

MR. STOEPKER: In reading the opinion -- Your 

Honor, my time is up. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may respond 

briefly.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In United States against Riverside Bayview 

Homes, this Court unanimously upheld the Corps' 

jurisdiction over wetlands that were not themselves 

navigable, but were adjacent to waters otherwise within 

the Corps' jurisdiction. 

The principal difference between the Rapanos 

wetlands and the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview 

are that the Rapanos wetlands are adjacent to a non-

navigable tributary, while the wetlands at issue in 

Riverside Bayview were adjacent to a navigable creek. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you define 

tributary? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The tributary -- you 

say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary. 

That's a -- a culvert, a ditch. Right? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, not in all these cases, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Rapanos' 

case. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: No, not -- not -- that's 

actually not true. There are three specific wetlands 

that are at issue in the Rapanos case. One of those, 

the Pine River site, as its name suggests, is adjacent 

to the Pine River, which is a body of water that has 

water flowing through it all year-round. It's a river. 

I don't think anybody would look at that and say 

that's not a tributary of the downstream navigable 

rivers. And I think that's why, in fairness --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

about the other -- the other sites? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: The -- the other sites are --

are adjacent to man-made ditches that also drain in. 

If I just -- can I just say, though, I think 

the fact that the Pine River site is so obviously a 

tributary under -- under any definition is one of the 

reasons, along with the theory that you heard advanced 

by Petitioners, that this case --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument 

assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites 

are also tributaries. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I just want to make the point that this case, because 

of the theory Petitioners have advanced, has not really 

unearthed or focused on the definition of a tributary, 

but let me get to it because the Corps has defined the 

definition of a tributary. And the definition of a 

tributary is basically any channelized body of water 

that takes water in a flow down to the traditional 

navigable water --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even when it's not a body of 

water. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Even --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A storm drain, even -- even 

when it's not filled with water, is a tributary. 

Right? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, absolutely. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: The Corps has not drawn a 

distinction between man-made channels or ditches and 

natural channels or ditches. And, of course, it would 

be very absurd for the Corps to do that since the Erie 

Canal is a ditch.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suggest it's very absurd 

to call that waters of the United States. It's a 

drainage ditch dug -- you know, dug by the municipality 

or -- you know, or a gutter in a street. To call that 

waters of the United States seems to me extravagant. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, let me say two things, 

Justice Scalia. First of all, this case has not been 

litigated under the theory that the key difference is 

whether it's man-made or natural, and that defines 

somehow the scope of a tributary. And I think there's 

a good reason for that, which is the second point, 

which is as the Corps experts -- from the experts of the 

Corps will tell you, the process of making the natural 

rivers navigable has all been about the process of 

channelizing them and creating man-made, artificial 

channels in them to the point where the difference 

between that which is a man-made channel and that which 

is a natural channel is both difficult to discern and 

utterly beside the point for purposes of this 

regulatory scheme. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what percentage of 

the -- of the territory of the United States do you 

believe is -- is subjected to permits from the Corps of 

Engineers on your theory whenever you want to move 

dirt, whenever you want to deposit sand? What -- what

percentage of the total land mass of the United States, 

if you define tributary as broadly as you define it to 

include? Every storm drain? I mean, it's the whole 

country, isn't it? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All the water goes down to 

the sea and there's some kind of a drain or -- or a bed 

that takes the water down there. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the precise 

answer to your question being none of the land mass --

none of the land itself would be regulated. But in 

terms of -- you want to talk about the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're calling empty ditches 

-- not unless you call empty ditches land, which I do. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the -- the Corps doesn't. 

They treat those as water bodies. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: And that's not the gravamen of 

the complaint here. 

But just to be responsive to your question, I 

think it's important to understand that the Corps and 

the EPA's view of wetlands would cover about 80 percent 

of the wetlands in the country. And that shows that 

the impact of this Court's decision in SWANCC was real 

and substantial because about 20 percent of the

Nation's wetlands are isolated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you -- that's 

just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands. 

But under your theory, the Corps of Engineers would 

have jurisdiction over any land that is part of that 

tributary system as well. If any of that land has a 

deposit of -- of some materials that could leach into 

or -- or drain into the -- the tributary system, which 

is to say any gutter, in theory, the -- the Federal 

Government can regulate it all. No? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's right, 

Justice Scalia. The Corps has regulated this 

channelized tributary system. It has done it without 

regard to whether those channels are seasonally dry in 

some areas, and I think that's a rational judgment. 

It's not been the gravamen of this case, though. And 

what's important is while the Corps and the Federal 

Government regulate that channelized system of 

tributaries, non-point source pollution is still 

something that's in the primary providence of the 

States. And so it's not true that the Corps is 

asserting an authority to regulate land as such. 

But to also get it on the table, if the 

Federal Government wanted to -- if Congress changed its 

mind and said that, say, the banks of the navigable

rivers or their tributaries are within the scope of 

this program, as it did in 1899 in section 13 of the 

Rivers and Harbors Act, we'd be here defending that as 

a valid exercise of Congress' authority not just under 

the Commerce Clause, but under the navigation power of 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But in 1899, it just said 

navigable rivers, not -- not every -- every tributary 

defined to include even storm drains. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: No. With respect, Justice 

Scalia, in 1899 in section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors 

Act, the so-called Refuse Act, Congress regulated the 

navigable waters and their tributaries. Now, in 

fairness, the focus there was this idea that they only 

regulated the tributaries if they could show that it 

flowed into the navigable waters themselves, but they 

asserted right in the text of the statute in 1899 the 

authority to regulate the tributaries and the banks. 

And that shows what I think is a very 

important difference between this case and SWANCC. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your theory is 

there is regulatory authority because there's an 

interaction between the wetlands or the lands in 

question and the navigable waters. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, that's not

precisely accurate. The way it would describe it is 

this. 

As to the first question you have to ask, 

which is are the tributaries covered, we think an 

important component of describing the reach of the 

tributary system is whether there's a hydrological 

connection. On the second -- and that's subsection (5) 

of the regulatory definition that brings within the 

scope of waters of the United States tributaries. 

Then you get to the second question which 

actually implicates another subsection of the 

definition, subsection (7), which is the adjacent 

wetlands. And as to the adjacent wetlands, as the 

Carabell case illustrates, the definition does not turn 

on hydrological connection for purposes of asserting 

the Corps' jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but wasn't --

wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands 

because of -- of the likelihood of an interaction? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think they -- they were 

included for the likelihood of an interaction both 

hydrologically and otherwise. 

I would say two important things, though. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- well, please 

finish.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: The two points I would make is, 

first of all, I think the Corps' regulations, which for 

30 years have ignored the premise -- the -- the 

presence of a berm, are rational because in the vast, 

vast majority of cases, that berm is not going to 

prevent a hydrological connection, so to speak. And so 

a test that focuses, first and foremost, on physical 

proximity is a very rational jurisdictional test. 

The second thing I would say, though, is it's 

simply not true that even in the rare case where a berm 

or a dike prevents all hydrological connection, that an 

adjacent wetland will not perform an important function 

for the adjacent water body. And the most obvious one 

is the flood control possibility of the wetland. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, as you 

mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a 

-- what struck me anyway as a very interesting 

provision in there. It covers wetlands adjacent to 

waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands. 

Now, everything that you've said today and in your 

brief would lead me to think you would contend that 

wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be 

covered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them 

out. And I want to know why do you think the 

regulation leaves those wetlands out.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I -- I think, Mr. Chief 

Justice, my own view is the reason that that caveat is 

in subsection (7) is actually a vestige of the pre-

SWANCC scope of the regulation. And specifically, if 

you look at subsection (3) of the definition which is 

the isolated waters provision that was at issue, I 

think, through the Migratory Bird Rule in SWANCC, that 

includes wetlands in the available isolated waters. 

And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To me it -- it 

suggests that even the Corps recognized that at some 

point you've got to say stop because logically any drop 

of water anywhere is going to have some sort of 

connection through drainage. And they're -- they're 

stopping there, and I wonder if we ought to take that 

same instinct that -- that you see in subsection (7) 

and apply it to your definition of tributary and say, 

at some point, the definition of tributary has to have 

an end. Otherwise, you're going to go and reach too 

far, beyond what Congress reasonably intended. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, several thoughts on that, 

Mr. Chief Justice. I think the problem with that 

approach is that the reason why it makes sense to 

regulate that very first tributary that flows into the 

Mississippi is the reason that it makes sense to

regulate the entire tributary system. All of that 

water is going to flow down into the navigable waters, 

and if there's going to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's true of 

the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is 

adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says 

we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent 

to another wetland. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief 

Justice, the way that I would read that and the way I 

understand the Corps reads that is that was really just 

trying to exclude a wetland adjacent to a wetland that 

was a water of the United States only because of the 

application of subsection (3). 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your assumption --

GENERAL CLEMENT: And I think that's -- that's 

supported by the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but this -- this is 

preliminary to my question. In SWANCC, we said there 

has to be a significant nexus. It seems to me that you 

have to show that there's some significant relation 

between the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to 

regulate and the navigable water. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree with that, Justice 

Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and that's just, 

it seemed to me, so far been missing from the 

discussion. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I -- I guess there 

is two ways to look at this. You can start with the 

significant nexus test and see if it's met. I guess 

the way that the Corps would naturally proceed is to 

start with their definitions, and they would say 

section -- subsection (5) covers tributaries. And you 

can ask the question, is there a significant nexus 

between the tributaries and the navigable waters in 

which they flow into? And I think the answer to that 

is yes. 

And then there's the secondary question, as 

to subsection (7) of the regulatory definition. Is 

there a significant nexus between wetlands that are 

adjacent to waters otherwise within the Corps' 

jurisdiction, be they the traditional navigable waters 

or their tributaries? And I think Riverside Bayview 

answered that question and said, yes, there is a 

significant nexus between adjacent wetlands and any 

otherwise regulable water body to which they are 

adjacent. 

So that's the way we would ultimately satisfy 

what this Court required, which is a significant nexus.

 I wouldn't have understood this Court's 

decision to transplant the significant nexus test and 

say, that's what the Corps should administer, because 

whatever ambiguity there is in waters of the United 

States, I think significant nexus is precisely the kind 

of test you'd want the Corps --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what about the 

Chief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that -- as I 

said, I think what -- what the definition meant to get 

at was to exclude wetlands adjacent to isolated 

wetlands under subsection (3). 

I think if you ask the question more broadly, 

what about wetlands next to wetlands, I guess it 

depends on what you mean by that because the one thing 

we know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not a 

requirement that the parcel and its wetlands be 

immediately adjacent. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we didn't 

come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands. 

The Corps of Engineers has it in their regulations. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what do they mean 

by it?

waters that would otherwise not be in the statute which 

are isolated wetlands under subsection (3). It's the 

only application it has in -- in the regulatory 

structure, as they understand it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is an 

example of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC 

test? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Under insignificant nexus? 

Well, I think it's the waters at issue in SWANCC, and I 

think it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's no nexus 

there. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're isolated. 

There's no nexus. The -- the notion in SWANCC of a 

significant nexus suggests that there are some bodies 

of water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but 

it's not going to be significant enough. We didn't 

just say any nexus. It said significant nexus. So 

what are you leaving out to give meaning to the test 

that we articulated in SWANCC? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I'm leaving out everything that 

this Court excluded in SWANCC, and I wouldn't have 

thought that the -- that the Court necessarily 

suggested there was going to be some subset that had a

further insignificant nexus because it wasn't -- the 

argument of the Government in those cases was obviously 

-- we didn't just concede that those bodies of water 

were utterly isolated. We said they did have important 

ecological connections with the water. And I think the 

way I read SWANCC is that we can't make that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a 

wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological 

connection to a tributary of navigable waters through 

one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of 

the United States? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is that if the tributary flows in. I would 

start with the tributary, and I'd say, now, there's 

clearly a significant nexus between the tributary and 

the navigable waters to which it flows. I would then 

look at the wetland, and I would say for purposes of 

the regulation of adjacent wetlands --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One drop. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: For purposes of the adjacent 

wetlands, it doesn't look to hydrological connection 

per se. The way I would resolve that is I would 

resolve it with reference to footnote 9 in this Court's 

opinion in Riverside Bayview, and I would say, all 

right, one drop? Fair enough. It's in the regulatory

jurisdiction because it's adjacent and that's what the 

Corps looks to. And I think that's a rational 

judgment. But if there's one drop, grant the permit. 

That solves the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Adjacent to what? Adjacent 

to a tributary. Right? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Adjacent to a tributary, 

absolutely. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but here's -- here's 

the fly in the ointment. You -- you interpret 

tributary to include storm drains and ditches that only 

carry off rainwater. I mean, it makes an immense 

difference to the scope of jurisdiction of the Corps of 

Engineers. I mean, when you talk about adjacent to a 

tributary, I think, you know, maybe adjacent to the 

Missouri River or something like that. No. You're 

talking about adjacent to a storm drain. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think 

if you had in mind a tributary, you'd probably have in 

mind the Pine River which is at issue in one of these 

sites. And I think that's why that's not the way 

Petitioners have presented this case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only because I don't know 

how a storm drain is a water of the United States. 

That's all. I mean, all of these terms that you're

throwing around somehow have to come within a 

reasonable usage of the term, waters of the United 

States, and I do not see how a storm drain under 

anybody's concept is a water of the United States. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia, 

some things that you might classify as a storm drain 

are actually very deep channels that have a continuous 

flow of water that were --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I was referring to a 

real storm drain. 

(Laughter.) 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: But therein is the problem, 

which is some things that are part of the storm water 

drainage system of a city are actually things that were 

previous navigable natural waters. I mean, so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And some aren't. But -- but 

you would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the 

Corps of Engineers. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: We would, Justice Scalia, but I 

guess if we can start with the proposition that 

tributaries are covered and then some things that the 

Corps thinks are tributaries you disagree with, that

would be fine. But that would be a different case. 

That hasn't been the theory that this case has been 

presented. 

As I understand, these drains here are 

actually, you know, substantial channels that do have 

water in them. I have no doubt that the Pine River 

meets the test that it sounds like you would have for a 

tributary, and the difficulty I'm having is I'd be 

happy to defend what the Corps did if this Court, in 

the -- in the litigation of this case, had focused the 

court's and the Corps' attention on that issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right that a 

tributary is not a defined term in the regulations? 

Right? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right. It's an 

undefined term. The Corps has interpreted it in the 

2000 preamble. The best place to find the Corps' 

teaching on this is 65 Fed.Reg. 12,823-4. And they go 

through -- it was part of a comment and they deal with 

comments about their treatment of ditches and the like 

and many of these issues. 

And I guess what I would say is I think that 

for purposes of this case, I mean, you heard the 

Petitioners' argument. They have obviously, based on 

the legal position they've advanced, not focused this

Court or any other court's attention on subdividing 

which tributaries count because their view is nothing 

counts. Even the first tributary doesn't count. And I 

think in this case what I would urge you to do, if --

if you have some concern with, you know, the extent of 

the definition of tributaries, is to not make that a 

basis for invalidating this -- the judgment of the 

Sixth Circuit here. And that's an issue that could be 

developed in other cases if -- if the parties want to 

really focus the attention on that. 

I think I would be comfortable defending the 

Corps' judgment, even in those more finely focused 

challenges, because I get back to the point, which is 

that the same logic that has you regulate that first 

tributary also suggests that you want to regulate 

anything that's a channel that brings large quantities 

of water into the navigable waterways. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- but that 

doesn't follow. I mean, it is not a principle of law 

that so long as the object is -- is lawful and within 

the power of the United States, all means to which even 

that object are lawful. That is simply not true. 

There are various means of stopping that pollution, and 

it may well be that one of the means, which intrudes 

too deeply into the State's power to regulate land

within their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one. 

That -- that's not an extraordinary proposition. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I absolutely agree with you, 

Justice Scalia, and that's why I'm not up here asking 

for Federal regulation over non-point source pollution, 

although that obviously contributes to the -- to the 

problem. 

What I'm up here asking for is a recognition 

that the tributary system is something that Congress 

can validly regulate and did regulate in its broader 

definition of waters of the United States in the Clean 

Water Act. And I think that's something -- the 

authority to regulate tributaries is something Congress 

regulated starting in 1899 and, importantly, this Court 

expressly upheld in 1941 in Oklahoma against Atkinson. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how non-point 

source pollution is -- is any more remote from what the 

Federal Government should be able to do to achieve its 

ends than is a point source pollution that -- that 

consists of -- of dumping sand on land that has some 

puddles on it. I -- that seems to me just as remote. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think one important 

thing to focus on, Justice Scalia, is this case is not 

just about the Corps' 404 program because the 404 

program by its terms does not permit anything. As --

as the permit word suggests, it's a -- it's a process 

of granting permission. The relevant provision here is 

section 301 of the statute which prohibits a discharge 

into the navigable waters without a permit. And so 

whatever this Court decides for purposes of the 404 

jurisdiction, it's necessarily deciding for purposes of 

the 402 jurisdiction of the EPA. 

And so what you'd be suggesting is that if 

some tributaries aren't covered, then it's perfectly 

okay to dump toxins in those tributaries even though 

you know that because they are a channelized system 

that directly connects with the navigable water --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 

really fair. The Petitioners, as I understand it, both 

concede the discharges that make their way into the 

navigable waters would be covered. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but there's only two ways to do that. One way 

of doing that and the one that I hear them advocating 

would be this impossible sort of process of trying to 

fingerprint or DNA test oil spills in a tributary to 

figure out, yes, that's the guy that got it to the 

navigable waters. And the one thing we know is that 

there were some efforts to try to regulate pollution 

that way before 1972 and they were a dismal failure.

 The only other way to do it, as suggested by 

one or two amici, is to treat the last -- treat the 

tributary as if it were a point source. But I'd sure 

hate to be the guy who owns the -- the land next to 

that tributary that's dumping into the Mississippi 

who's going to be responsible for the pollution of 

everybody upstream. And what Congress recognized in 

1972 is that they had to regulate beyond traditional 

navigable waters. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Congress in 1972 

also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement 

of policy to reserve to the States the power and the 

responsibility to plan land use and water resources. 

And under your definition, I -- I just see that we're 

giving no scope at all to that clear statement of a 

congressional policy. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Kennedy, 

the States still have plenary control over the non-

point source pollution. They still have an important 

cooperative role in -- in the overall program, as 

you'll hear more about in the second case today. And I 

would actually ask you to focus on one particular 

provision that deals with the relationship between the 

Federal Government and the States under 404 in 

particular, and that's section 404, subsection (g) of

the statute. And that was added to the statute in 

1977. 

Unless Congress is going to be construed to 

have given the States a virtual empty set, that 

provision makes crystal clear that the waters of the 

United States, for purposes of the Clean Water Act, 

extend beyond traditional navigable waters and their 

adjacent wetlands. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Though not necessarily as 

far as storm drains. It would be enough to -- to say 

navigable -- you know, non-navigable tributaries that 

are real -- real tributaries. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I 

concede that. But then you get to the question of 

defining real tributaries, and that's neither been teed 

up in this litigation, nor is it something that I 

think, at the end of the day, you'd want to differ from 

the Corps' judgment, which although you find it 

striking that some things that are ditches are actually 

included in the system, that is a product of the way 

that the tributary systems have worked, the way that 

certain cities have taken over a natural stream and 

channelized it and make it look like a ditch, but it's 

part of the system that carries water down from the 

headwaters. And again, maybe that's an issue that we

can try to divine the limits to in a subsequent case. 

But I think what's important, as -- as your 

very comments suggest, is that trying to give meaning 

to that textual indication that Congress had clearly 

wanted to capture something beyond traditional 

navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a very vague 

indication. I mean, I -- I agree with you that your 

argument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it -- it 

perhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to 

stretch to the -- to the limit of Federal jurisdiction, 

you need a clear statement. I certainly wouldn't 

consider 404(g) -- if -- if the act did not previously 

include the kind of authority you're arguing for, I 

would not -- I would not consider 404(g) a clear 

statement of that -- of that new -- new authority. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think even you would 

concede it's a clear statement that something else must 

be covered. Otherwise, other than is completely 

meaningless in the statute. And so -- and -- and I --

I grant you that it might not be a clear statement as 

to the nth tributary, and maybe that's a case on which 

we can litigate in the future. 

But I think what I would say is, for those of 

your colleagues that want to look at the legislative

history, it provides some additional context for 404(g) 

and makes it very clear that Congress, as this Court 

found in both Riverside Bayview and in SWANCC, was 

specifically focused on the coverage of adjacent 

wetlands. And it's very clear that they understood 

that whatever scope of jurisdiction was given to the 

Corps, that it would bring along with it the adjacent 

wetlands. And so there was this long debate. 

As I say, the legislative history I think 

makes quite clear that they were meant to include 

the non-navigable tributaries and a substantial amount 

of the non-navigable tributaries. And so, I mean, I 

would invite others to look at that. 

I also think that, to get back to a point I 

made earlier, one thing that's exceedingly clear from 

that legislative history is nobody in 1977, including 

those that were advocating restricting the scope of the 

404(g) program, wanted to restrict the EPA's 

jurisdiction under 402. And so in the legislation that 

they proposed that eventually found form in 404(g), 

they expressly decoupled the 404 permitting process and 

its jurisdiction from the 402 process. 

Petitioners' argument, by contrast, 

necessarily restricts the scope of both of those 

programs because they are joined in the hip through

301. And so if they're right that they can dredge and 

fill in these wetlands, then it is equally true that 

they can dump toxic materials into those wetlands. 

If I --

JUSTICE BREYER: Could you just say a word 

about the -- the ditch -- sorry -- the word about the 

wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man-

made object like a ditch? Are there many such 

instances? It sounds to me like a scientific question. 

Are there many such instances where there is no 

transfer of water? And in those instances, is the 

presence of water in the wetland anything more than a 

coincidence? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as it seeks to serve 

a purpose of the statute to regulate this. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say, Justice 

Breyer -- I -- I think I can answer the whole question 

-- is in the vast majority of cases, as I understand 

it, a berm will not have the effect of actually 

preventing all hydrological connection. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And where do I look to 

verify that scientific matter? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think a number of the amicus 

briefs have addressed that. I wish I could point to

you a specific one. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I can't find any 

quantitative assessment. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, again, I didn't mean to 

suggest a percentage. I just think that -- that -- let 

me put it to you this way, and this is the argument we 

obviously make in the brief. The best reason to think 

that a man-made -- that a man-made berm or a natural 

berm is unlikely to prevent all hydrological flow is 

even those man-made structures that have as their 

express design to prevent water flow, like dikes and 

levees and dams, have seepage and leakage from them. 

So --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. 

Now suppose we take a set, which you think 

exists as not the null set, of instances where there is 

no such transfer, which your opponents say is this 

case. Now what's the justification for regulating 

those? If it's simply flood control because water 

flows over the top and sits there, I guess you could 

say the same thing is true of any low depression, and 

therefore, the presence of water would be just a 

coincidence. Now, what's your -- the fact that they're 

wet doesn't have anything to do with it. It's the fact 

that they're next to a place that floods that has to do

with it. 

Now, what's wrong with what I just said? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: What's wrong with what you 

just said is that wetlands have unique characteristics 

that are different just from low-lying areas. And I think 

this Court started to recognize that in the Riverside 

Bayview case. And the image I would leave you with is 

the image that wetlands actually act something like a 

sponge, and because of that characteristic, they play 

two important roles in helping to regulate the flow of 

the adjacent water body. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I understand that. 

Now, what specifically, since I think this is 

scientific, do I look at to verify what you just said, 

namely that a wet depression, even if there's no 

interchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a 

dry depression wouldn't have? That's a scientific 

statement. Where do I verify it? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: And, again, I mean, I would 

direct you to the amicus briefs that discuss in length 

the benefits of wetlands, but I understand you won't 

find those --

JUSTICE BREYER: I read them, and I -- I just 

perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just 

can't find the verification directly there.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And -- and I sense that you 

found them lacking in that sense. I guess what I would 

say is there's certainly anecdotal evidence in those 

amicus briefs that I think is quite striking. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what am I supposed to 

do with the case? I read them quickly. I don't 

necessarily pick up everything. I'll read them again. 

But if I don't find empirical verification for that 

statement, what am I supposed to do with this case? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, not surprisingly, I would 

suggest that you defer to the agency in its exercise of 

expertise. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. And where did the 

agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course 

of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a 

wetland acts as a sponge? It's very plausible to me. 

It's just that there may be a need to drop a citation 

somewhere. 

(Laughter.) 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, you -- and you could 

cite to the proceedings in this very case in the joint 

appendix because although they didn't use the sponge 

word, there was a specific finding in this case that 

these wetlands played an important role in flood 

control and pollution control for the adjacent streams.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you wanted a 

cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection 

(7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no 

interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to 

other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the 

United States. If they act in the way that you've been 

postulating, presumably they'd want to cover those 

adjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover 

the wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they 

don't. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think 

that follows because if you read subsection (7), as I 

do, as only excluding those wetlands that are adjacent 

to other isolated wetlands, then regulating those 

wetlands --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't -- it 

doesn't say that. It says other than waters that are 

themselves wetlands. It excludes all wetlands that are 

adjacent to wetlands that are adjacent to waters of the 

United States. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and as I said, I think 

you have to read that in the context not just of the 

rest of the regulations but of this Court's decision in 

Riverside Bayview. The one thing we know from 

Riverside Bayview is that it's not enough to simply say

that your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the 

navigable waterway because in that case, as the Court 

remarked, it -- the parcel ended before it got to the 

adjacent navigable body of water and there was another 

wetland. There was a continuation of the same wetland. 

Now, I don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent 

wetlands. I might as a common locution. There might 

be some different way of referring to that. But we 

know that the one wetland was covered because that was 

the holding of this Court in Riverside Bayview. 

So I don't think I would give undue weight to 

that reading of it especially when, if you read it as I 

do, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent 

to an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have 

the same role to play in flood control in terms of 

monitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to 

an otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue 

here. And so I think that that regulatory decision 

that the Corps has made is one that's perfectly 

defensible and makes sense. 

And I think that -- again, I think one other 

point that I want to note that's kind of specific to 

this case is part of the reason why it makes sense to 

regulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable 

water body, even if there is a berm present, is

illustrated by this case because, as was alluded to, 

the specific development plan at issue here -- and this 

is clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160 -- would 

sever the berm and create the hydrological link between 

a smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable 

wetland -- waterway system. And so, I mean, it doesn't 

make a lot of sense, as Justice Stevens suggested, to 

have a regulatory regime where you have a regulable 

wetland after but not before a construction project 

that has the effect of vastly reducing the size of the 

wetland. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that the 

authority of -- I don't -- I don't even think the Corps 

has ever suggested this. The authority of the Corps 

extends not only to all that you've -- we've been 

talking about and that you've asserted, but also to 

lands that, if altered, could have some hydrological 

connection. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: No, that's not it, Justice 

Scalia. What I'm saying is what the Corps has always 

done for 30 years is said they are going to regulate a 

physically proximate, adjacent wetland without regard 

to whether or not there's a berm there. I'm just 

making the subsidiary point that that makes sense 

because the very construction project that might be at

issue might have the effect of changing the degree of 

the hydrological connection. 

I want to be very clear, though. The 

hydrological connection has never been the sine qua non 

of the assertion of regulation authority over the 

adjacent wetlands. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what is the basis 

for their doing it? If there is currently no 

hydrological connection, there is a berm, there is no 

-- there is no connection to the navigable waters of 

the United -- what could possibly be the basis for 

their asserting jurisdiction? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: The short answer is flood 

control. If there is that berm that -- that allows the 

sponge to soak up water, either rainwater or waters 

from adjacent parcels, although I think in this case, 

it would largely be rainwater, that -- the fact that 

there's a berm actually helps in the flood control. 

When you sever it, it changes the dynamic quite a bit 

because then it's somewhat less helpful for flood 

control --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- but actually is earlier in 

term -- plays a better role --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A statute could do that. A

statute could do that. But this statute requires that 

it be a water of the United States. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and when -- when 

there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a 

berm, even from the storm drain which goes to 

tributaries, I can't conceive of -- of how you could 

consider that that's -- you know, at least where it 

leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a 

tributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you 

could call it a water of the United States. But where 

there's a berm that prevents any water from going even 

into the storm drain which then goes into a tributary, 

how can you possibly consider that a water of the 

United States? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the way I would 

do it is you start with the tributary. And if you'll 

concede for purposes of the illustration or the 

argument that that's a water of the United States, then 

what the Corps does as a jurisdictional regulation is 

treat the adjacent wetland as a water of the United 

States as well. That makes sense for two principal 

reasons. 

One, in the overwhelming majority of cases, 

there is going to be a hydrological connection.

Actually tracing out exactly what it is and how it 

works is very difficult and not the kind of thing you'd 

want to get into at the jurisdictional stage, and 

that's why the Court said that was fine in footnote 9 

of Riverside Bayview. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the argument I 

was addressing. I'm addressing the argument that in 

changing the land, you may cause it to --

GENERAL CLEMENT: And that's not an independent 

basis for jurisdiction. It's simply an illustration of 

why disregarding the berm makes sense. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm happy to hear that. 

That's all I was trying to establish. You -- you don't 

assert that that's an independent basis. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: It is not an independent basis. 

It is part of the reason why, though, in the context 

of wetlands in particular, a focus on physical 

proximity and adjacency makes sense and a fixation on 

hydrological connection does not make sense. 

Part of the reason you can look at the record 

here and find differing information about the extent of 

the hydrological connection is that is not a term that 

is relevant for the regulatory scheme. And the same 

thing was equally true in Riverside Bayview itself. In 

fact, in Riverside Bayview, the district court made a

finding that the wetland there was hydrologically 

isolated from the adjacent streams. Now, as the 

Solicitor General pointed out in the petition at 

footnote 7 in Riverside Bayview, we think the best 

understanding of what was meant there was that there 

was no overtopping and that there was some drainage. 

But that just illustrates the point that hydrological 

connection is not a statutory term. It's not a 

regulatory term. It's a very loose term and it's not a 

term the Corps has ever used in regulating adjacent 

wetlands. 

It's important to stress that the regulation 

for adjacent wetlands that is at issue here, subsection 

(7), is exactly the same regulation that was at issue 

in Riverside Bayview. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, 

the Court, when it framed the question presented, 

framed it in terms of whether or not the Corps could 

rationally regulate wetlands that were adjacent to 

navigable waters and their tributaries. And when they 

got to the holding, this Court approved the regulation 

and approved the fact that it asserted jurisdiction 

over wetlands adjacent to otherwise regulable waters. 

So if the tributaries are otherwise regulable because 

they are waters of the United States, it follows 

directly from Riverside Bayview that the adjacent

wetlands are covered as well. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you put a lot 

of weight on the tributary question in your approach by 

giving up the hydrological connection. Your response 

is you don't need a hydrological connection because 

it's right next to a tributary. But for those of us 

who are having a little trouble with the concept of 

tributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and -- and I'm -- I wish 

that weren't the case, Mr. Chief Justice. 

What I would say, though, is that this case 

has just not framed up the question of tributaries, and 

that's because -- I mean, to put it more favorably to 

my client, the other side has never taken issue with 

the fact that their wetlands are adjacent to 

tributaries. And I think that's -- that's obvious for 

a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, if you look 

at the property in Carabell, it's just a mile from Lake 

St. Clair. It's right next to a substantial drainage 

ditch which connects to a navigable water, Auvase 

Creek, and then into Lake St. Clair. In fact, it's 

kind of ironic, but the property in Riverside Bayview 

was also a mile away from Lake St. Clair. So it's very 

similar.

Rapanos, one is right next to the Pine River. One of 

the others -- the whole point of the dredge and fill 

operation was to drain the wetland through the adjacent 

tributary systems so the water would go away. And in 

the third one, there also isn't an issue about whether 

or not those are tributaries. In a different case, 

that might be an appropriate focus for inquiry. 

The last thing, I would say a couple of 

points before I sit down. I do think, first, that 

section 404(g) of the statute is very important because 

it is the clearest textual indication that Congress 

intended to regulate something beyond traditional 

navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands. And 

as this Court itself remarked in SWANCC, the single 

most likely candidate are the non-navigable 

tributaries. 

The second point to emphasize is that the 

scope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is the same as the 

EPA's 402 jurisdiction. They are joined at the hip 

through the basic prohibition under section 301. So a 

conclusion that somehow certain tributaries are excised 

from the tributary system for purposes of 404 is 

likewise excising those tributaries and creating a 

situation where you can have a -- a free dump zone at 

some point above the -- above what somebody might put

as the limits of the navigable waterway system or the 

tributary system. And I think that is something that 

even the proponents of narrowing the Corps' 

jurisdiction in 1977 could not countenance. 

The last point I would make is that there are 

going to be real-world consequences to contracting the 

jurisdiction of the Corps and the EPA to pre-1972 or, 

really, pre-1899 levels, especially for the downstream 

States. I think it's a bit much to ask a legislator in 

Wisconsin or in Minnesota to stop local development in 

order to protect the water quality and flood control 

propensities of the Mississippi River in Mississippi. 

That's why it was manifest in 1972 that there was a 

need for a Federal solution to this problem. That 

Federal solution includes as two of its most important 

components first getting at water pollution at its 

source, at the point source, and secondly, covering the 

tributary system without which the navigable waters 

will continue to be polluted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hopper, I hope you're 

going to tell us what you make of section 404(g). 

MR. HOPPER: I'd be happy to. In -- in Solid 

Waste Agency, this Court looked at 404(g) and 

determined that it had -- it was not enlightening as to 

the meaning of navigable waters under 404(a) because 

Congress did not define other waters in any way. And 

this Court likewise concluded that 404(g) was simply 

not before it and would not draw any conclusion from 

it. So I submit that it is really irrelevant. 

I note -- I want to draw this Court's 

attention to our footnote 1 in our reply where we point 

out that -- that in every formal rulemaking, the Corps 

and the EPA have excluded drainage ditches from the 

definition of tributary. It is here and now that these 

agencies are redefining the term tributary to include 

anything in the hydrological chain. The Sixth Circuit 

decision says that any hydrological connection suffices 

as a significant nexus to bring in wetlands under 

Federal jurisdiction. 

Of course, in -- in page 31 of the 

opposition, the Government argues that neither the 

directness -- excuse me -- nor the substantiality of a 

tributary's connection to traditional navigable waters 

is relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry. It's simply

not true that the Government is only identifying 

channelized conduits as tributaries. Anywhere water 

flows is a tributary in their book. 

Let me also address something that this Court 

did in SWANCC. It was not the lack of a hydrological 

connection in that case that informed this Court's 

decision to exclude those isolated ponds from Federal 

jurisdiction. It was the fact that those -- that the 

regulation of those isolated ponds did not meet the 

terms of the act and there was no clear indication 

Congress intended to regulate isolated ponds. I submit 

that's this case. In this case, there is no clear 

indication that Congress intended to regulate wetlands 

20 miles from the nearest navigable water. 

The --

them was much closer.

to the distance between --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Pine River? 

Are you -- that's not 20 miles away, is it? 

MR. HOPPER: We don't know how far that is 

because the record is silent as to the distance between 

those water bodies.

Solicitor General represented to us that it was very 

close. Are you disputing that as a matter of fact? 

MR. HOPPER: I don't know what he means by 

very close. The -- the Solicitor General would agree 

with me that -- that there's nothing in the record to 

indicate what those distances are. 

And it's irrelevant in -- in our opinion 

whether it's -- whether it's a mile or 20 miles or 50 

miles or 100 miles, and that's the point. There does 

-- under the -- under the Federal regulations a true, 

significant nexus is not required, just any 

hydrological connection. This is a presumption on 

congressional authority. 

This expansive interpretation destroys any 

distinction between what is national and what is local 

under -- as -- as has already been pointed out. Under 

the Federal regulations, you can't dig a ditch in this 

country without Federal approval. You can't fill it 

in. You can't clean it out without Federal approval. 

This reads the term navigable right out of the statute. 

We -- we ask this Court not to allow these 

agencies --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, when we're 

talking about the scope of -- of Federal power, we're 

not merely concerned with dumping refuse in the creek,

but also deliberate attempts to poison the water 

system. 

MR. HOPPER: Congress -- Congress considered 

all this when it made its policy decision to defer to 

the States to address this. The States have the 

ability and the will to -- to protect their own waters 

from pollutants of any kind. And as I indicated 

earlier, all the States have antipollution regulations. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. The fact that the 

States have the power and the interest does not 

necessarily mean that the Federal Government does not 

also have the power. 

MR. HOPPER: My time is --

would defer to the States instead of exercising any 

further power beyond its channels authority.
