 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first 

in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California. Mr. Gold.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

The procedure for imposing aggravated sentences 

under California's Determinate Sentencing Law implicates 

the bright line rule this Court set forth in Blakely and 

Apprendi. Any fact other than the fact of a prior 

conviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond 

the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury 

beyond a reasonable doubt. 

The primary point of contention in this case is 

what constitutes the statutory maximum under California's 

Determinate Sentencing Law. Petitioner believes that 

it's the middle term, whereas respondent maintains that 

it's the upper term. 

In fact, this case really boils down to just one 

question. Can a judge in California legally impose an 

upper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected 

in the jury's verdict or the defendant's admissions. The 

answer to this question is no. California's Determinate

Sentencing Law specifies three possible prison terms for 

each -- for each felony conviction, a lower term, a 

middle term, and an upper term, although it mandates that 

judges shall impose the middle term unless there are 

factors of aggravation or mitigation. California case 

law confirms that judges must impose the middle term 

where there are no aggravating factors, and even the 

state appears to concede the point.

 Because the middle term is the greatest 

punishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts 

reflected in the jury's verdict, it, and not the upper 

term, constitutes the statutory maximum for --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gold, I know you take that 

position on the facts of this case, but is it not true 

that there could be cases in which the verdict of the 

jury would establish certain facts that would justify 

going beyond the middle term? For example, the Black 

case itself, as the justice who dissented in this case 

thought the sentence was permissible in that case.

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, Justice Stevens, to the 

extent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used 

as an aggravating factor, but is not an element of the 

crime or found by the jury as an enhancement, that could 

be used to impose an upper term sentence. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would it always, then, be

surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and 

subsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus 

fact? Because otherwise -- I mean, what I'm getting at 

is, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating 

an element of the offense, and as I understand it, under 

California law, the element of the offense couldn't 

satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the 

higher range.

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, typically 

under California law, in the information, they allege the 

crime, and on occasion, some of the elements. But 

typically not all of the elements.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If in this case, the indictment 

had charged -- had claimed that the defendant was the 

father of the victim, would that have satisfied at least 

the fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a 

position of trust?

 MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, the fact that the 

information would have alleged that does not mean that 

the jury would have found that fact, because just because 

-- what is alleged in the indictment or in the 

information --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That depends on the instructions.

 MR. GOLD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the instructions said, you

know, you've got to find all of the things that are set 

out in the information, and the jury returned a verdict, 

then we would have found -- and that would satisfy the 

requirement of an additional fact on an element.

 MR. GOLD: I believe so, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be an erroneous 

instruction, I assume.

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You either have to have an 

erroneous instruction or a special verdict.

 MR. GOLD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Only in the sense that it would 

require the state to prove more than it had to prove for 

the elements of the crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Souter, and I agree that 

it would be no different than submitting aggravating 

factors as a separate allegation to the jury as a 

separate instruction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the thing that 

concerns me about your case is that California's system 

looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker. We 

haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving 

review of reasonableness for upward departure. But at 

least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case,

the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any 

reason for departing from what the guidelines might 

suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I 

think in most circuits, that would be reversed. 

Same here. If a California judge imposes the 

upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to 

be reversed. But if a federal judge gives a statement of 

his reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an 

offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most 

circuit law, that's going to be upheld. 

Here, if the California judge does that, that's 

going to be still struck down under your view. You 

talked about Blakely and Apprendi. But how does this 

system look to you under Booker?

 MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, this system really is 

-- this is just like -- this case is just like Blakely. 

What the California Supreme Court in People against Black 

found, they used references to reasonableness as a label 

and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of 

Blakely and Apprendi.

 Instead they tried to fit the Determinate 

Sentencing Law within the Federal system this Court found 

constitutional in Booker. But the California Supreme 

Court seriously misread Booker. In Booker, in the 

remedial portion of that decision, this Court found the

Federal system to be constitutional by rendering the 

guidelines -- the mandatory guidelines to be advisory. 

Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under California, they're 

advisory anyway. I mean, even if the judge makes the 

necessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he 

doesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose 

the lower one.

 MR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, no. He has to 

impose the middle term. He can't deviate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is if he makes a 

finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16 

years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher 

term, he can go back to the middle term.

 MR. GOLD: No, no, you are absolutely right. He 

has discretion not to do that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But does it say that the only 

basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is 

that the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't 

find.

 MR. GOLD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It does say that? As I read the 

California opinion, they can go up above the lower, the 

middle term for any reason, but it has to be reasonable.

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, what this -- what the

California Supreme Court did, in this --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe that's hard to justify in 

terms of California's statute, but we take the California 

Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law 

of California. So what is the answer to my question as 

you read Black?

 MR. GOLD: The answer to your question is that 

Black has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory 

nature of California's Determinate Sentencing Law, and it 

has always operated in a mandatory way.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think -- let me give 

you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your answer would be that 

how could it possibly be reasonable except for the 

consideration of some additional fact? What makes it 

reasonable other than facts? Atmosphere? I mean --

JUSTICE BREYER: If that is your answer, my 

example will be -- I'll give you a specific example. 

One example is the question of consecutive versus 

concurrent sentences, which may have very little to do 

with facts. 

A second example might be that a judge in a 

particular community says there's been an unbelievable 

rash of breaking and entering. I see how the writers of 

this guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought

that breaking and entering was X, occurred with X 

frequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of 

crime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to 

increase the sentence as a deterrent. 

Now, suppose that's what he writes. And is there 

anything in California law, as you understand Black, that 

makes that unlawful?

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. GOLD: I believe that the statements in Black 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which statements make that 

unlawful?

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, in Black, the California 

Supreme Court repeatedly stated that the way the system 

works in California is that it is a mandatory system. So 

as an example, at 35 Cal.4th 1254, the court stated, "the 

court cannot impose the upper term unless there is at 

least one aggravating factor." At 1260, the court said, 

"in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found, 

the judge cannot impose the upper term." 

There are a number of statements throughout the 

Black opinion that indicate the system has never changed 

from a mandatory one to an advisory one, so that 

reasonableness is not the issue. Whether the system is

mandatory or advisory --

JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, when they say 

mandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean 

to exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just 

mentioned.

 MR. GOLD: Well, a judge can consider those 

aggravating factors.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, could he? Could the judge 

consider the fact that I just mentioned, that there's 

been an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in 

the vicinity?

 MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?

 MR. GOLD: Well, under California's law, they have 

-- in addition to factors relating to the crime and 

factors relating to the defendant, the judge can consider 

unenumerated factors.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Unenumerated factors. So mine 

would be an unenumerated factor.

 MR. GOLD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If he can consider 

unenumerated factors -- now, I purposely picked mine 

because I take it it is an example of a factor that 

Apprendi would not require a jury to find. 

It is a factor about the community. It is not a

factor about this defendant. It is not a factor about 

the manner in which this defendant committed the crime. 

It is not a fact of that kind.

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, I'm not sure whether that 

sort of factor would be upheld as a --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if it were reasonable, it 

would be upheld, or not?

 MR. GOLD: If it was found to be a decision that 

was reasonably related to the crime -- I'm sorry, to the 

decision being made by the judge, then yes, it would be 

upheld as a valid aggravating factor. But I believe that 

it would still need to be then, if it would be considered 

a valid aggravating factor, then it would need to be 

tried by the jury.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I clarify one thing? You 

mean that a rash of crimes committed by people other than 

the defendant could be an aggravating factor?

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, under California law, I'm 

not saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason. 

I'm just --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But there's nothing in 

California law suggesting that that would be upheld, is 

there?

 MR. GOLD: No, Justice Stevens, there is not.

it, your basic answer to Justice Breyer is, it may well 

be that the situation in the community may justify a 

judge in going to the -- to the high end of the range 

that is possible, but that is not a factor that 

determines what range is possible. And the fact that 

determines what range is possible is an aggravating fact, 

and in that respect, it is different from the Federal 

system. Is that --

MR. GOLD: That's absolutely right, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand it. If he 

does -- tell me again, would you? I thought your 

response was going to be what Justice -- who suggested 

it? 

(Laughter).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody on that side suggested 

it. That to talk about the fact that there's a lot of 

crime in the community as an aggravating factor doesn't 

make any sense. Aggravating factor means something that 

makes the crime that this person committed worse, not the 

need for punishment greater, but makes the crime worse. 

Now, if that is not your answer, what is the answer that 

you gathered, from the left of me?

 MR. GOLD: Well, with all due respect to Justice 

Breyer, I believe that that probably would not be an

aggravating factor that would be upheld under California 

law. I was just trying to make the distinction between 

whether an aggravating factor, no matter what it is, 

whether it is considered reasonable, whether that's 

enough to get the judge to go beyond the statutory 

maximum. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought your position was that 

aggravation must be reasonable. What the court in Black 

indicates is that it is not going to consider anything 

reasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless 

there's a finding of fact to support it. Is that the 

position you take?

 MR. GOLD: The position as far as what Black is 

saying?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. GOLD: Yes. I think Black -- what Black is 

saying is that an aggravating factor needs to be 

reasonable, but I was trying to make the distinction --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think that there's the 

further indication that it is not going to be deemed 

reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact, 

as indicated in order to support one of the specific 

guideline aggravators.

 MR. GOLD: Certainly if the aggravating factor is 

not supported by the evidence, then it won't be

considered reasonable and the imposition of a upper term 

won't be considered reasonable. But --

JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand the 

distinction between the California system and a system of 

advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review. 

Let's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range 

after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred 

years. And let's say you have two judges who have these 

cases. And one sentences the defendant to zero, 

probation. The other one sentences the defendant to a 

hundred years. 

Without saying a word of explanation for either 

sentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation 

going to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen 

zero or why you have chosen 100? And if the trial judge 

provides an explanation, isn't the trial judge 

necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the 

judge believes to be true about the offense and the 

offender?

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, if you're describing the 

Federal system or just a hypothetical system, my 

understanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge 

can impose whatever sentence he wants. And whether or 

not in a particular system, that will be reviewed for 

reasonableness is a separate question as to what he --

JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it reviewed for 

reasonableness -- isn't the reasonableness review 

necessarily going to require what is, in essence, 

fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the 

reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by 

an appellate court?

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. But what -- in 

Booker, what made the Federal system constitutional was 

not the engraftment of the reasonableness review. It was 

rendering the mandatory guidelines advisory. And that's 

the aspect of California's Supreme Court Black decision 

that they've misread the Booker decision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that, why is that so? 

Why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the 

guideline -- what the guideline would indicate? And if a 

Federal court would say, if I sentence within the 

guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many 

courts have held. Not this Court yet. That would be 

presumptively valid. 

And if I go outside, I have to give a reason that 

will survive appellate review. Well, why isn't the 

middle sentence identical in function to the Federal 

sentencing guidelines advice?

 MR. GOLD: Justice Ginsburg, I think that it's the 

mandatory nature in California of the middle term. The

judge cannot exceed the middle term unless he finds at 

least one aggravating factor. And my understanding in 

the Federal system is that the judge can exceed the --

can exceed these guideline ranges and that they're just 

advisory.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To say that a sentence within the 

guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a 

sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable. So 

under the Federal system, it is perfectly possible --

unless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a 

sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to 

be affirmed, because although the guideline range is 

reasonable, there are other systems that would be 

reasonable, right?

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Your -- Justice Scalia. And I 

think that to the extent that we are going to say that 

any sentence outside this guideline range is going to be 

unreasonable and necessarily require reversal is going to 

be no different than the mandatory guideline system this 

Court struck down in Booker itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only part of the 

California system that creates a problem is this -- the 

one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall 

impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.

 MR. GOLD: That's absolutely right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if we rule in your 

favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in 

California will be that judges can now depart without 

making a particular finding, they can increase the 

sentence even though they do not find an aggravator 

within the limits of the California system.

 MR. GOLD: But Mr. Chief Justice, it is not clear 

that that would be the result in California. The 

legislature could very well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't the decision in 

Black suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the 

result? The California Supreme Court?

 MR. GOLD: I'm not sure that they think that that 

would be the result. They certainly did not make an 

attempt to reform or rewrite the statute so that it was 

now an advisory system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that -- it 

looked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black. 

I mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion, 

the day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and 

the California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a 

lot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly 

valid. 

In other words, saying that judges can depart 

within this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart

within this whole range, and we're going to review their 

determinations for reasonableness. They don't have to 

impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher 

sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness. That 

would be perfectly all right.

 MR. GOLD: Well, and that may very well be the 

case, but that's not what the California Supreme Court 

did in Black. They made no attempt. What they did was 

described the Determinate Sentencing Law as it has always 

operated. And at no time did they purport to change the 

law in California, including the mandatory nature of the 

Determinate Sentencing Law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what they said was 

judges can impose a sentence in either of the three --

any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it 

for reasonableness. And if they don't make findings, it 

is going to be unreasonable, right?

 MR. GOLD: Yes, but once again, the reasonableness 

aspect is not what makes the system constitutional. It 

is the mandatory versus advisory aspect. And again, 

that's what made the Federal system constitutional based 

on this Court's Booker decision. It wasn't this 

engraftment of reason -- reviewing these sentences for 

reasonableness.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, to be quite -- to expose my

thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260 

and 1261. Is that what -- the first part of that is --

it says what you said. I have no doubt. It says just 

what you said. 

But then you get over to the part, the discussion 

of Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they 

seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what 

Booker says. Now, if they are adopting what Booker says, 

that means, and that's why I used my example, that I 

guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable, 

to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so, 

isn't right for my circumstance. And therefore, I don't 

adopt it. And that would be reviewed for reasonableness, 

his decision not to follow it. 

And similarly, we have cases, for example, where 

they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get 

it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so 

he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in 

order -- and then makes them concurrent. Or you could 

have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy, 

and the jury found the conspiracy. It is a 

characterization of a conspiracy, it is very 

sophisticated. 

And I thought, well, maybe all three of those are 

reasons for going up in California. And I read those

pages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is I'm not sure.

 MR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, I have no doubt that 

the California Supreme Court was trying to fit the 

Determinate Sentencing Law within the constitutionality 

of this Court's Booker system. But as far as 1261, I'm 

looking -- every single time they talk about Booker or 

reasonableness, they also make sure to give the -- to 

make sure that they make clear that the way the 

sentence -- the system works is that there's still this 

requirement of finding an aggravating factor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: An aggravating factor means 

aggravating fact.

 MR. GOLD: Aggravating fact, uh -- yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you think would be 

necessary, what would be the least change California 

would have to make to bring its system into compliance 

with our decisions?

 MR. GOLD: Justice Ginsburg, the court could --

the court or the legislature could change section 1170(b) 

to read something like: "A judge may impose" instead of 

"shall impose" the middle term. And that would be valid 

to the extent that what they mean by "may" is they can 

now impose the middle term based just on the facts found 

by the jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or they could say the middle term

will always be reasonable. Couldn't they say that?

 MR. GOLD: They could, and in effect, they do say 

that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Even though there is the 

possibility that something above the middle term would 

also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete 

fact beyond the indictment to justify it. Right?

 MR. GOLD: Yes. There are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The protection that 

criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be 

sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes 

particular findings, will then be no longer applicable.

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. I -- and I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's true unless the 

California legislature does what most states have done in 

response to Booker, which is not that route at all. They 

did maintain their determinate sentencing, but they just 

required the jury finding. That's what I think seven out 

of nine states have done.

 MR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Stevens. And that was the 

point I was going to make, that that is a very likely 

outcome, given what the majority of other states have 

done. And that, Mr. Chief Justice, would be a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that now the defendant 

will have the protection of his jury determining his

guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his 

guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to 

re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm, 

all the bad things that will increase his sentence and 

might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the 

first place.

 MR. GOLD: Not necessarily, Your Honor. Because 

for those type of prejudicial factors, California is 

well-positioned to handle those, because they do so 

anyway in bifurcated proceedings. There are often 

enhancement allegations that relate to recidivism or even 

gang allegations, anything that's prejudicial are handled 

at a separate proceeding after trial.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And are there a half a 

dozen jury trials in each -- for each of those various 

aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the 

jury?

 MR. GOLD: No, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say 

is that basically California does that anyway now. Most 

of the factors that relate to the defendant have to do 

with recidivism. And those are the same kind of factors 

that are alleged in the information, and are tried in a 

bifurcated proceeding to the jury, or are waived and then 

the trial court will consider them.

in fact -- what's your estimate, guess, as to how many 

criminal jury-tried cases in California, what percent 

have two juries? Have more than one jury?

 MR. GOLD: They don't have more than one jury. 

They are tried to the same jury, but they are tried after 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: In what percentage would you say 

they have bifurcated or several jury trials? I mean, 

more than just one.

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, I would say that there are 

lots of cases where they're tried to a court. The 

defendant will waive them if they're based on recidivism.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but how many, how many 

times do they -- let me call it impaneling the jury 

twice, or two juries, or it could be the same one.

 MR. GOLD: The same --

MR. LAURENCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The central lesson from Booker, from the real 

portion of Booker, is that not every constraint that's 

placed on a trial court's discretion in selecting a term 

within a range that requires fact-finding invokes the 

Sixth Amendment requirement of a jury trial. 

A reasonableness constraint that requires the 

court to consider all the circumstances of the defendant 

and select a reasonable sentence in relation to those 

facts and those factors does not invoke the Sixth 

Amendment jury trial right. California has consistently 

construed its system as placing nothing more than a 

reasonableness constraint on the trial court's discretion 

in selecting among the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not so at all. California 

says if you go over the middle range, it is unreasonable, 

period, unless you prove or you find one of the 

aggravating factors. That's a constraint. You cannot go 

above the middle range.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, but that's the 

same constraint that this Court found not above the 

Constitution in Booker.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, that's not what we found in 

Booker. We found in Booker, or at least the way the

lower Federal courts have been interpreting Booker, if 

you use the guideline range, and you're within the 

guideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you 

don't have to worry about it. 

But we haven't held, and I don't believe most of 

the Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the 

guideline range, it is automatically unreasonable. And 

that is the case with the California system, if you go 

beyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable 

unless you -- unless you find one of the aggravating 

facts.

 MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, I'd have to 

respectfully disagree with that because we're not talking 

about a middle range. What we are talking about is an 

end point. If I can use the Booker example, where you 

have a term of 10 years to life, the court can certainly 

make a selection within a reasonable range. At some 

point, as the court increases its sentence beyond a 

certain point, it will become unreasonable. 

We don't need to identify specifically what that 

point is, the guideline range or something close to it. 

But when you get to the end point, if there's no 

justification offered whatsoever for a life term --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the difference is, in the 

Federal system, the judge can go above and it can be

reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury. 

But in California, to go beyond the middle range 

up to the upper range, it must be a fact not found by the 

jury.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that not correct?

 MR. LAURENCE: That's only correct because 

California has a discrete three-term sentence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. But whatever the 

reason, it is correct.

 MR. LAURENCE: It is correct, Your Honor, but the 

central point of both Booker and California is that that 

upper term is being reversed not because it's 

unauthorized, but because it's unreasonable.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: On one hand, in one case, the 

unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by 

the jury. But in the Federal system, it does not require 

that finding by a jury.

 MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, if a Federal judge 

wished to impose a life term, there would have to be 

something to justify it, or it would be reversed on 

appeal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It wouldn't necessarily be a 

fact. It could be a fact. What it says in here is that 

if the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the

crime, or the offender. And in a case in which no such 

aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose 

the upper term. 

Now, I grant you there's some language that I --

it seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say 

something a little different. But that language, if you 

just take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a 

fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to 

go above the middle range, you can't, under the law. 

Now, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I 

find it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely 

and other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is 

what the majority says. So that seems to me almost like 

it, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.

 MR. LAURENCE: I would say you are wrong, Your 

Honor, simply because California has construed its 

sentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a 

reasonableness --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if -- as I understand it, 

it has construed it by saying that if you go above the 

middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond 

what has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as 

a matter of law. And that unreasonableness as a matter 

of law feature is what distinguishes it from the Federal 

system post Booker.

MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I would disagree, 

because the upper term, the statutory maximum in Booker 

would also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no 

justification offered by the trial court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the justification under the 

Federal system could be, you know, this is what the 

sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence 

for this crime. I disagree with that. Now, there are 

other authorities who think that that's a little too, you 

know, below what it ought to be. He can simply disagree 

with the sentencing guidelines. 

Or he could point out what Justice Breyer 

suggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for 

some jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a 

special problem with regard to this kind of a crime. He 

can do that and doesn't have to find any special fact. 

He cannot do that in California.

 MR. LAURENCE: I have two responses to that, Your 

Honor. First of all, with regard to what the ruling in 

Booker was, the court's discretion has to be exercised in 

relation to the policy considerations set out in 3553(a), 

which are the same policy considerations that the court 

must look at, very similar in California, that there are 

-- the court doesn't have unbridled discretion, select 

any term based on whim, based on whatever it feels would

be -- whatever he decides to do on Tuesday. 

The court has to do it with regard to the policy 

considerations that are inherent in what the guidelines 

decisions were, and what the legislature established 

should be appropriate sentencing considerations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not necessarily 

mean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in 

order to do it. We come back to Justice Scalia's hypo a 

moment ago. He can go, you know, in theory, under 

Booker, he can go above the guideline range consistent 

with policy positions that may not be precise, without 

necessarily making discrete findings of fact. 

I mean, you'd have to judge it in each individual 

case, but the possibility is there. And under the 

California system, the possibility is not there.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, the systems 

converge at the end point. And that is, under the 

Federal system, going to that right end point would be 

unreasonable in every circumstance if there's no 

justification offered, other than he committed the 

offense. 

In California, because we have three discrete 

terms rather than a spectrum, you have the same effect 

when you get to the end point. It would be 

unjustified -- it would be an unreasonable sentence if

there's no justification offered. But the fact that 

California has three points rather than a range shouldn't 

be constitutionally determinative.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they can't be a fact -- in 

California, it can't be a fact found by the jury, as 

Justice Stevens pointed out. That's a significant 

difference.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, it can't be an element. And 

that -- obviously, there could be a circumstance where 

some special findings were made, in which case that might 

be beyond the elements. But it can't be an element 

simply because you shouldn't be double counting what's 

already established. 

The range is set by the elements of the offense, 

that all three terms are available from the jury verdict 

based on those elements. If you are going to make a 

selection within that range, it would have to be more 

than simply the defendant committed the offense. And 

that's the same with the Federal guidelines. Simply 

saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't the same in the Federal 

guidelines. Under the Federal guidelines, the judge 

could say, you know, I think this offense is more serious 

than what the sentencing commission thought, and these 

are my reasons for it. There was a dissent, you know --

the sentencing commission's determinations are 

reasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable 

disposition. 

And it is open to a Federal district judge to say, 

well, that's what they thought, and I took it into 

account, and I seriously considered it, and I think they 

are wrong on this, I think this is more serious. And 

that could be a perfectly reasonable determination. That 

couldn't be done in California.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, it could, Your Honor. And I 

would refer you to Rule 4.410 in our appendix, page 2 and 

3, that the general policy considerations that over --

that overlay our sentencing guidelines or our sentencing 

system, include deterrence for this defendant and 

deterring others from committing the same crime, that you 

can just look to the -- what is happening in this 

particular neighborhood, as the examples brought out.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying to us that under 

the California system, if a California judge went through 

exactly the thought process that Justice Scalia just 

outlined and put that down on paper, without finding any 

discrete fact beyond the elements the jury found, that he 

could go to the third tier? I really think deterrence 

requires the third tier, not the middle tier? Can a 

California judge do that?

MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, deterrence is a 

basis for going to the third tier.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's critical, and that's 

what I didn't understand about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not true. You 

certainly didn't argue that way in your papers up to now. 

I thought that there has to be a finding of some 

aggravating factor, not simply, I think deterrence is 

more than what the statute says, or deterrence requires 

more than what the statute says. Is that really your 

position, that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more 

than the middle range, for that reason alone, he can say 

I ignore the middle range?

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, that's part of the rules of 

court under 4.410. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where --

MR. LAURENCE: That would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's appendix page 3 in the 

brief.

 MR. LAURENCE: Page 2 and 3.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that that's the way 

the Black court interpreted it. The Black court talked 

about a requirement that the upper-term sentence be 

imposed only if an aggravating factor exists.

considered an aggravating factor, to use deterrence for 

this particular case --

JUSTICE BREYER: What do I do here? Because the 

sentence I read to you seems to say the opposite. But 

then, two sentences on, they list, the Federal judge is 

not bound by the guidelines, he must consult the 

guidelines. And after they say, an aggravating 

California -- it says the discretion available -- the --

in California law, that may include any fact that the 

judge reasonably determines to be relevant. The 

Determinate Sentencing Law, about an upper term, is 

comparable to Booker's requirement that a Federal judge's 

sentencing decision not be unreasonable. 

Well, I assumed until this minute that the first 

statement trumped the second. But now when I see the 

court rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given 

that to be read as permitting them, particularly with the 

second statement, you could read the second statement as 

saying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind 

of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in 

this community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment 

that I'm giving a higher one. To be honest, I don't know 

what Black means.

about is set out?

 MR. LAURENCE: It's in our appendix, page -- the 

appendix to our brief, I'm sorry, the appendix to our 

brief, page 2 and 3.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say in your brief, which 

doesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying 

here, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example, 

by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing 

scheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or 

alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury 

beyond a reasonable doubt. 

There's no indication there that the judge could 

just say, I think more deterrence is necessary and 

therefore, I'm going to exceed the base range. That's 

just totally incompatible with that.

 MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, that's to exceed the 

base range, to go beyond the three terms. If you want to 

impose an enhancement for gun use, or for an enhancement 

such as in Apprendi, not for selecting a term within the 

base range.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But even for 

selecting a term within the base range, I'm going to read 

now from Rule 4.20. Part (b) says, "circumstances in 

aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a 

preponderance of the evidence."

That's not the way we refer to judges' reasoning 

about policy. That's the way we refer to proof of fact. 

And I don't see how under subsection (b) your answer to 

me can be correct.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think the rules 

of court are viewed as a whole with 4.408, which talks 

about anything in addition to -- that the rules of -- the 

examples set out are not exclusive and not determinant, 

that anything can be a consideration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they have to be an 

aggravating factor.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the need for 

more deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an 

aggravating factor.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the 

example that was given was in relation to the community 

that was experiencing some uptick in crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not an aggravating factor. 

It's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it 

doesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime 

committed by other individuals. It's not an aggravating 

factor.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, the importance of 

our position, the central thrust of our position is that

the reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed 

under 1170(b) has been interpreted as a reasonableness 

constraint. It doesn't matter if factors are required --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it can be a reasonableness 

constraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that 

requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness. 

The two are not exclusive.

 MR. LAURENCE: That's true, Your Honor. That's 

true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the rule seems to conflate --

seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete 

fact. And it seems to me that we've got to consider the 

rule in responding to the ambiguity that Justice Breyer 

referred to a moment ago. The ambiguity has got to be 

read in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems 

to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the 

evidence. That means a fact finding.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, let me explain it this way, 

Your Honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective 

whether or not there is a factor required in order to say 

that something is -- that the end point is reasonable, or 

if you are taking deterrence into account, that that's 

not -- it's not necessary for our argument because our 

position is that even if a factor is required --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So do you think under subsection

(b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the 

policy of deterrence requires something heavier, you 

think that statement by the judge would satisfy the 

requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be 

established by a preponderance of the evidence?

 MR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor. I don't.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then it seems to me 

that you cannot hold your position consistently with the 

state rule of court.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I would refer 

back to Black at 1255, which is the important part.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is Black repealing the rule of 

court? I mean, Black -- if we refer back to Black, we 

get the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has raised. In 

order to solve the ambiguity, we look to the court rule.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Under the court rule, you admit 

that a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely 

held, could not satisfy the requirement to prove 

aggravation by a preponderance. Isn't that the end of 

the issue? I mean, if California wants to amend its 

rules or its statute, that's California's business. But 

we can't do it.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, no, Your Honor, but 

California has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a

fact-finding to move from the middle term to the upper 

term. It's simply saying that when the court selects 

between the three, the decision must be reasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't you give a 

different answer to my question? Why didn't you say, if 

it is reasonable for the court to conclude that 

deterrence really requires something tougher than the 

middle term, that's enough? Why didn't you say that is 

enough and (b) wouldn't preclude it?

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that my 

answer would have to be that in relation to the 

hypothetical given, I was answering it because -- with 

regards to the circumstances of the community that the 

defendant committed the crime in. If we take that away 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Let's -- the judge, the 

judge is on the bench. He says, there's too much crime 

in our community, look at these statistics, I believe 

that deterrence requires something heavier than the 

middle tier. Nothing unusual about this particular 

crime. I'm making a policy decision about what the law 

should require in general. Would that satisfy part (b) 

of 4.420?

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, I believe it would.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That would satisfy the

requirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a 

preponderance of the evidence?

 MR. LAURENCE: Uh-huh. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That was not what I understood 

California law to be or your position to be until this 

moment.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I have not been 

suggesting that that single factor is what makes 

California's law constitutional. What makes California's 

law constitutional is the fact that the constraint 

imposed on the court's discretion in selecting terms is a 

reasonableness requirement, just like Booker.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Reasonably -- that does not 

answer the problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the California Supreme 

Court and the California legislature would be astounded 

to think that this is what they have wrought. They 

obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the 

judge would apply the middle range, not using his own 

perception as to whether more punishment is justified or 

not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime 

that make this person more guilty, and that's what you 

usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact 

that you believe the crime should bear -- in general, 

should bear, a higher penalty. I think they would be

astounded to find that this is what they have created.

 MR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, let me take a step back 

then and say that, even with the requirement that there 

be some factor, putting aside deterrence as a 

possibility, California's system as structured, which 

only requires a reasonableness constraint, does not 

violate the Constitution. And the reason being because 

all it's saying is that if you're going to the absolute 

maximum, the farthest point on the spectrum available, if 

there's no justification offered, it will be reversed as 

unreasonable, not as unavailable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the whole problem with 

your case.

 MR. LAURENCE: Certainly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That there's -- and 

incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are 

general objectives of sentencing.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is a term of art that's 

different from circumstances.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's only the circumstances 

that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence. 

The general objectives can still be considered.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what we are involved with in 

this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and 

sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that 

aggravate, and these do require findings.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If those findings aren't there, 

it's not reasonable.

 MR. LAURENCE: That is correct, Your Honor. Let's 

just take it a step back and say that what we're talking 

about is -- even if there are circumstances that are 

required, even if there are some justifications that the 

court must find aggravating factors, still the only 

constraint is reasonableness. 

And let me quote from what Black said about 

1170(b), how it's been construed, not from the facial 

language, but how it's been construed. And what Black 

says is on page 1255 that: "Although subdivision (b) is 

worded in mandatory language, the requirement that an 

aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the 

decision to impose the upper term be reasonable."

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what we have -- now, this has 

clarified it, but I don't know what to do. I think if I 

read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the 

California court, which is a good court, conscientious, 

managing a huge system of criminal law in the state,

probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely 

and they see that those guidelines in California as 

previously understood were violated. 

And they're thinking, how do we maintain this 

system as constitutional. And therefore, they write 

1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it, 

and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it 

constitutional. 

Now, that would be an understandable judicial 

reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at 

which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say, 

because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the 

fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have 

been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on 

grounds other than factual grounds related to the 

circumstances of the crime or offender. But I also have 

no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the 

California system. All right, so now what do I do?

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the 

one thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is 

the fact that California didn't explicitly say in Black, 

we are now officially Bookerizing our system. And the 

reason for that is because California had already 

implicitly construed the system as making all three terms 

legally available based on the jury verdict alone, and

had simply used a reasonableness requirement. 

And that goes back to Hernandez, back in 1988, 

when California essentially anticipated Apprendi, and 

distinguished between making enhancements available based 

on the jury verdict on the elements alone, versus the 

three, the three components of the triad scheme.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it is the same old record 

we've been playing. But the reasonableness requirement 

has to be explained further. And when you explain it 

further, you find that there must be findings by a 

preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating 

or mitigating circumstances that are set out. That's 

different from the objectives of sentencing.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the objectives of sentencing 

are not what's involved in this case.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. And I -- whether 

or not the objectives of sentencing are involved is not 

the critical point of the constitutionality of this 

system. 

As far as California is concerned, what is 

important is that, first of all, the fact that the 

preponderance of the evidence requirement is essentially 

the same as what's involved in making discretionary 

findings within a range in the Federal system. And we're

talking about the findings within a range.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you want us to hold that, 

you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion 

that says what California's sentencing judges may do 

under California law, as you've described it to us, is 

that they -- they may exceed the middle range whenever 

they think that that is a better result, whenever they 

think that that's reasonable?

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think California would be 

happy with that?

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes. Reasonableness is the 

touchstone of the constraint imposed upon the trial 

courts in selecting among the three terms, and that would 

be a perfectly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, including reasonable 

disagreement with the level of severity that the 

legislature has provided in the middle term. I mean, 

other legislatures may have provided higher severity and 

the judge says, I simply disagree with the California 

legislature. And it's a reasonable disagreement, because 

some other legislature might have done what I do.

 MR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't reasonable? Why isn't 

it reasonable?

JUSTICE SCALIA: He ties it to that. He says, I 

just disagree with the California legislature as to 

whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from 

committing this kind of a crime. And look -- and he 

cites another state which provides a much higher sentence 

for the same crime. Can that possibly be unreasonable?

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. I believe that 

under the California --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then you don't mean 

reasonableness. You mean something else.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask you this question? 

Excluding capital cases, in your view -- anecdotally, if 

it has to be that -- what percentage of cases that go to 

juries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated 

proceedings for sentencing purposes? 10 percent?

 MR. LAURENCE: I would say probably a rough guess 

would be around 10 percent. That's -- we're dealing with 

JUSTICE STEVENS: On that question, may I ask --

on that subject, may I ask you this question: Have you 

read the brief filed by the National Association -- the 

amicus brief by the National Association of Defense

consequences in other states and in California?

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And which I find, to be honest 

to you, rather persuasive on the fact it's not such a big 

deal as we thought it might be. And I'd like you to have 

an opportunity to tell me whether there's something in 

that brief that is not accurate.

 MR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, it would 

certainly be a big deal to California. But more 

importantly, if this Court were to say that a 

reasonableness constraint reinvokes the Sixth Amendment, 

you would be basically throwing into doubt the way Booker 

has reformed the Federal system as well, because --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They say, if I remember it 

correctly, that if the impact in a four day trial would 

normally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about 

the burden on the system. And of course, 90 some percent 

of your cases are pleaded out by guilty, so it's not the 

major thing that we originally thought it might be. Do 

you think, just across the board, are they fairly 

accurate in their description of what happens in other 

states as far as you're advised?

 MR. LAURENCE: As far as the other states go, yes, 

Your Honor. And I believe the impact on California would 

be a requirement of a secondary trial after the main

trial. But it would also impose a burden of trying to 

identify whatever aggravating circumstances or whatever 

relevant considerations have to take place in this 

particular case, which can be a multitude of things. In 

California law, essentially anything can -- anything can 

justify an upper term sentence. It's only when there's 

absolutely nothing, not a scintilla of justification, 

that an upper term becomes unreasonable and therefore 

reversed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many cases would have 

to be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case?

 MR. LAURENCE: It's my understanding that under --

currently in California about 20 percent of the prison 

population has an upper term. So I don't know how many 

cases there are on a year-by-year basis, or since Blakely 

or since Apprendi, but probably in the thousands, 

possibly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. You had 200,000 

incarcerated when I last looked.

 MR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. 

And the -- once again, the important aspect, 

what's -- the key aspect is whether or not a term is 

legally available, and whether or not there's a 

constraint that's imposed that takes away that legal 

availability as a threshold matter, rather than a

reasonableness review requirement. 

California has consistently construed 1170(b) as 

imposing a reasonableness requirement. This Court in 

Booker said that a reasonableness requirement does not 

limit the availability of those upper terms.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any case in which 

a California trial judge has gone beyond the middle range 

not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but 

rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that 

the punishment should be greater, something along the 

lines of what Justice Breyer suggested?

 MR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor, I'm not aware of 

it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not either, and I would be 

astounded if any trial judge would read these statutes 

and court rules that way.

 MR. LAURENCE: Once again, Your Honor, that is not 

the critical component of why this system is 

constitutional. And that's not what we are advancing in 

our briefs. It's not the position that I'm arguing here, 

that that is what would save California's system. 

What saves California's system is that the only 

constraint imposed is a reasonableness constraint, and 

that reasonableness constraint, 1170(b), has been 

interpreted over time as simply imposing the abuse of

discretion standard on the court, and that has been 

applied to all three terms. The middle term is also 

reviewed for an abuse of discretion, as is the lower 

term. 

And what is important to note is, even though the 

middle term -- the only reason the middle term has been 

given the label "presumptive" is because the court 

doesn't have to expressly articulate its reasons for 

selecting it. But it still has to do a balancing to make 

a determination as to what's reasonable, including the 

middle term.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Laurence. 

Mr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want 

to respond to three items. The first is, Mr. Chief 

Justice, you were asking about what would be the effect 

in California on those that have already been sentenced. 

The only information I have was what was contained 

in Black, that only 13 to 17 percent of cases are 

sentenced in the upper range. But what the Court should 

also consider is that most -- in most cases, the 

difference between the middle term and upper term is 

really only a year. In this case, it is four years,

which is somewhat unusual. 

So in those cases, a lot of the people will have 

already served their prison sentences by the time that 

they would be able to benefit from any result in this 

case. 

I also wanted to echo what Justice Kennedy, I 

believe, was saying. California Rules of Court, Rule 

4.410 is just general objectives of sentencing. These 

are not aggravating factors. You can't take into account 

achieving uniformity of sentencing, securing restitution 

for the victims, these aren't aggravating factors that 

the judge considers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Rule 4.410(b) says 

that the sentencing judge should be guided by the 

criteria in these rules.

 MR. GOLD: In sentencing, but I don't believe as 

far as finding them as aggravating factors, these are not 

facts that judges in California use to impose upper-term 

sentences.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but a reading of the rule 

indicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out, 

that the judge could take into account these policy 

objectives.

 MR. GOLD: Your Honor, all I can tell you is that 

I've never seen a judge take these into account as an

aggravating factor. And I would be surprised, under the 

case law, if these have been ever upheld as valid 

aggravating factors.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it is true that it 

doesn't seem to be involved in this case. In this case, 

we're under 4.420.

 MR. GOLD: Certainly, yes. Certainly, not in this 

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have to conclude that 

the California Supreme Court has misread California law 

to agree with you, don't we?

 MR. GOLD: No, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, I see 1170(b). 

And I understand your argument, but when I read the 

California Supreme Court opinion in Black, it says, well, 

this is what it means. It doesn't seem to be what it 

means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?

 MR. GOLD: They do get to interpret how their 

statutes operate, Your Honor, but I believe that they are 

consistent in saying that this is a mandatory system. 

In every one of their quotes, they talk about either a 

judge must impose the middle term unless there are 

aggravating factors, or they talk about the 

requirement -- I was going to mention Justice Breyer's 

quote from Black.

And even in that one, they say because an 

aggravating factor under California law may include any 

factor that the judge reasonably deems to be relevant, 

and then say the Determinate Sentencing Law's requirement 

that an upper-term sentence be imposed only if an 

aggravating factor exists. They always talk about the 

requirement that this aggravating factor must exist.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it is comparable to Booker. 

And then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly 

describe Booker?

 MR. GOLD: Yes. And we have no doubt that they 

are trying to fit the Determinate Sentence Law within 

Booker, but Booker is about making -- the magic word, as 

it were, is advisory versus mandatory, not 

reasonableness. 

So yes, the California system is reasonable. And 

that's what the California Supreme Court is talking about 

JUSTICE ALITO: Under any guideline system, 

whether it's mandatory or advisory, once -- if you have a 

mandatory system or an advisory system with appellate 

review, once the appellate review function has been 

performed, will it not be the case that trial judges will 

not have unfettered discretion, will have very limited 

discretion in choosing, making these sentencing policy

That the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you 

know, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how 

severe they think an individual crime is, that there's 

supposed to be some kind of uniformity.

 MR. GOLD: Well, Justice Alito, there is 

discretion in our system. But it is the discretion to 

impose an upper-term after finding aggravating factors. 

And I think that in an indeterminate system, as you were 

discussing earlier, I think that that -- I'm not sure. 

It depends what the system is, as far as what the 

reasonableness constraints are.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gold. The 

case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitle matter was submitted.)
