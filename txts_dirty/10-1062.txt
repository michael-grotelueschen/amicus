3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. The 

Environmental Protection Agency. 

6  Mr. Schiff. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  Mike and Chantell Sackett are here today 

12 because 4 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency 

13 issued against them a compliance order charging them 

14 with violations of the Clean Water Act, requiring that 

they restore their property to its alleged 

16 predisturbance wetlands condition, and imposing upon 

17 them the threat of tens of thousands of dollars per day 

18 in civil fines if they did not immediately comply with 

19 the order.

 But in these 4 years, the Sacketts have 

21 never been offered a meaningful opportunity for judicial 

22 review of the compliance order, an opportunity that they 

23 are guaranteed under the Due Process Clause and the 

24 Administrative Procedure Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, there would have 

3

1 been a daily fine with or without the compliance order, 

2 wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of 

3 the -- the Act? 

4  MR. SCHIFF: Justice Scalia, the fine would 

only have been attributable to the statute itself. But 

6 with the compliance order in effect, essentially, the 

7 Sacketts are now subject to double liability. They can 

8 be held liable for the statute as well as for actions 

9 inconsistent with the compliance order.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Schiff, your 

11 understanding is that each day your clients are subject 

12 to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute, 

13 and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance 

14 order. Is that the way you understand the penalties 

scheme to work? 

16  MR. SCHIFF: Yes -- yes, Justice Kagan. It 

17 is -- it is in fact, I might add, how the EPA 

18 understands the penalty provisions. In its brief at 

19 pages 30 and 31, they essentially concede that the 

existence of the compliance order does subject the 

21 Sacketts to liability for both violations of the statute 

22 as well as violations of the compliance order. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the court of appeals 

24 did say that there would be no independent liability 

under the -- for violation of the compliance order. 

4

1 That is, unless there was a violation of the statute,
 

2 there would be no penalty for violation of the
 

3 compliance order.
 

4  MR. SCHIFF: That is correct, Justice
 

Ginsburg. The court held that as a predicate for any 

6 liability for a compliance order violation, there must 

7 be first a finding of a statutory violation. But that 

8 doesn't change the fact -- even according to the Ninth 

9 Circuit, doesn't change the fact that one can still be 

held liable for both, that there is a distinct civil 

11 liability that is traceable only to the compliance 

12 order. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what kind of 

14 review are you seeking? I mean, one thing you could say 

is you dispute that this property is subject to the Act. 

16 That might be a question that's reviewable. Do you seek 

17 more than that? Do you seek review at this stage of 

18 anything more than whether the property is subject to 

19 the Act?

 MR. SCHIFF: No, Your Honor, we seek review 

21 of that jurisdictional question as it is incorporated 

22 into the compliance order. The compliance order is the 

23 agency action for which we believe the Sacketts have a 

24 right of review under the Administrative Procedure Act. 

And our challenge under the APA to the compliance order 

5

1 is precisely that there is no jurisdiction and,
 

2 therefore, there has been no statutory violation.
 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, what
 

4 would be the scope of your holding? How would -- how
 

would -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on 

6 this part of your case, what would the rule be? 

7  I mean, health inspectors go into 

8 restaurants all the time and say: Unless you fix this, 

9 I'm going to give you a citation. Fire inspectors, the 

same thing. And I'm -- I'm wondering how your general 

11 theory or your general principle that you want us to 

12 adopt would fit with that rather routine type of 

13 enforcement? 

14  MR. SCHIFF: Well, Justice Kennedy, we do 

not believe that what we are articulating extends as far 

16 as -- as creating a right under the APA for review 

17 because a health inspector has come onto your property. 

18 All we're arguing is that the compliance order is a 

19 final agency action; it has stopped the Sacketts home 

building; it has imposed upon them significant civil 

21 liability; and, therefore, they should have a right 

22 under the APA --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, this is under -- this 

24 is under the APA.

 MR. SCHIFF: Correct.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is the APA prong of 

2 your argument. 

3  MR. SCHIFF: Correct, Justice Kennedy. And 

4 -- and we should emphasize that we believe that the 

Sacketts' due process rights can be satisfied by 

6 allowing their APA cause of action to go forward. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me there --

8 there's another distinction, a more significant one, 

9 between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or 

restaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you 

11 disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more 

12 substantial liability than -- than you would have been 

13 subjected to had they not issued the order. 

14  It isn't the order that -- that produces 

any -- any new fine, is it? 

16  MR. SCHIFF: That is exactly correct, 

17 Justice Scalia. That's -- that's the principal 

18 distinction between the compliance order in this case 

19 and many of the agency actions that the EPA has set 

forth in its brief. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the sanction 

22 imposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10? If 

23 you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any 

24 time to enforce this, and you'll be subject to the 

statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional 

7

25

Official 

1 sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or 

2 the compliance order, is $10 a day. 

3  MR. SCHIFF: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

4 believe that would change the Court's finality analysis 

under Bennett. The -- the fact that the fine is only 

6 $10 as opposed to 37,000 doesn't --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it might go to 

8 adequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the 

9 judicial review that would come when the EPA brings the 

enforcement action. I understood your argument to be 

11 that there was a significant extortion impact from the 

12 fact that these were such significant fines -- double, 

13 as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years. But 

14 if it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out 

of your sails, doesn't it? 

16  MR. SCHIFF: Well, to begin with, 

17 Mr. Chief Justice, in addition to the independent 

18 liability that the compliance order imposes, there are 

19 other legal effects. Even if the compliance order had 

no independent liability, there are other legal effects 

21 that even EPA has conceded to. For example, the 

22 existence of the compliance order makes it materially, 

23 substantially more difficult for the Sacketts to apply 

24 for an after-the-fact permit. A higher --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: To apply for a --

Official 

1  MR. SCHIFF: For an after-the-fact permit. 

2 The -- once an compliance order is issued, an 

3 after-the-fact permit is -- can only be applied for 

4 under the "clearly appropriate" standard in the Corps's 

regulations. 

6  But -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, in response 

7 to the question, yes, of course, the amount of the fine 

8 certainly factors into meaningfulness of review. It 

9 factors into coerciveness. But even if there were no 

fines, there is -- attributable to the compliance order, 

11 there is still the fact that the Sacketts cannot 

12 independently initiate, cannot trigger, review of the 

13 compliance order. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you care? 

I mean, you have the fines, don't you? So, why don't 

16 you just argue that? Why do we have to wrestle with the 

17 more difficult situation where there are no fines? It's 

18 conceded that there are fines, isn't it? 

19  MR. SCHIFF: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you know, sufficient 

21 unto the day the evil thereof. We don't have to 

22 consider more difficult cases. 

23  But, as I understand it, you can get review 

24 by applying for an after-the-fact permit from the Corps, 

and the only -- the only expense you would incur in

1 order to get that would be to fill in, as the order
 

2 requires you to do, which is something like, what,
 

3 $27,500 or so?
 

4  MR. SCHIFF: Well, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that such a hard -- a 

6 hard hit? That's a lot less than, you know, 37.5 a day. 

7  MR. SCHIFF: Well, the difficulty, 

8 Justice Scalia, is that the Sacketts cannot obtain 

9 judicial review of the compliance order within the 

context of the permitting process. The compliance order 

11 is the order that has caused the deprivation, that has 

12 imposed upon the Sacketts this double liability. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but their challenge 

14 to the compliance order is simply that they don't have 

wetlands. It's the jurisdiction of the EPA. And surely 

16 that can be raised in the -- before the Corps of 

17 Engineers, no? 

18  MR. SCHIFF: That issue might be raised, 

19 Your Honor, but the Sacketts could never get review of 

that issue within the context of the compliance order, 

21 which is, of course, the -- the agency action that has 

22 caused their harm. Moreover, there's frankly no 

23 guarantee that the Sacketts could even get into court 

24 through the permitting process, because the Corps might 

very well say, well, you know, we don't believe that

1 there are wetlands on the property; and so, we're not 

2 going to issue you a permit. And, therefore, there is 

3 nothing for the Sacketts to then litigate over in 

4 Federal court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How long does it take to 

6 get one of those after-the-fact permits? 

7  MR. SCHIFF: There -- there is a study, Your 

8 Honor. In terms of averages, I think it's about a year. 

9 But there's nothing in our record that would show 

necessarily that the Sacketts are eligible for a 

11 nationwide permit. But more importantly is the fact 

12 that the permitting process doesn't provide review of 

13 the burden of the deprivation that the Sacketts are 

14 enduring right now.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the -- I don't 

16 understand what exactly you might get from the Army 

17 Corps of Engineers. Obviously, they might give you a 

18 permit, and I take it that cuts off liability; you can 

19 do what you're hoping to do. They might say you don't 

get a permit because these are wetlands. Can they do 

21 something in the middle, which is: It's kind of hard 

22 for us to tell; you're on your own? 

23  MR. SCHIFF: Very much so. In addition to 

24 saying we're not going to issue a permit because we 

don't believe there are wetlands on the property, they 

11

25

Official 

1 could also say, under the regulations that even EPA 

2 cites in its brief, that we're not even going to 

3 entertain your after-the-fact permit application while 

4 the compliance order is still outstanding, meaning that 

you will likely have to comply, be fully deprived, with 

6 everything the compliance order says, allow EPA onto 

7 your property, requiring significant expensive 

8 restoration of your property to its alleged wetlands 

9 state, before you even have the privilege of applying 

for a permit. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that what -- is that 

12 what's critical, Mr. Schiff? If that were not true, if 

13 you could go in, even with the compliance order on your 

14 property, and get an adjudication of whether you had 

wetlands in the context of an after-the-fact permit 

16 proceeding, would that be sufficient? 

17  MR. SCHIFF: No, it would not, Justice 

18 Kagan, because, again, the fact is that the -- the 

19 compliance order is -- well, the permitting process is 

an entirely separate agency action. It's -- it's an 

21 agency action that the Army Corps goes through. The 

22 Sacketts could get no review of the -- of the compliance 

23 order. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why does that matter? 

You're getting review of the question that you care 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 about, which is the question whether you have wetlands 

2 on your property. And if they said you don't have 

3 wetlands on your property, here's a permit, your 

4 problems are finished.

 MR. SCHIFF: Justice Kagan, the difficulty 

6 is that that judicial decision would have no impact and 

7 would not remedy the deprivation that the Sacketts are 

8 currently enduring. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they issue permits when 

there are no wetlands? I thought it was a permit 

11 allowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise 

12 would -- would not be allowed? 

13  MR. SCHIFF: That's -- that's correct, 

14 Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if they decide that 

16 there's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what 

17 do they do? They do nothing? Is that it? 

18  MR. SCHIFF: That's my understanding. The 

19 Corps would simply say there's nothing to permit because 

there are no wetlands to fill. But the difficult --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then the compliance 

22 order would automatically be vacated? I mean, doesn't 

23 the compliance order presume that they are wetlands? 

24 Hasn't the agency already made that determination?

 MR. SCHIFF: The difficulty, 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Justice Kennedy, is that we're talking about two 

2 agencies. And this -- this is really the -- why -- one 

3 additional reason why the permitting process is -- is an 

4 inapt solution to the Sacketts' problem. The Sacketts 

have been injured by EPA, by the compliance order. And 

6 now --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: That seems very strange for 

8 that -- for a party to apply for a permit on -- on the 

9 ground that they don't need a permit at all. If you 

apply for a permit, is the Army Corps of Engineers going 

11 to decide whether you -- whether it's wetlands? Isn't 

12 it presupposed if you're applying for a permit that you 

13 -- you need one because there's -- they are wetlands? 

14  MR. SCHIFF: That's -- that's exactly right, 

Justice Alito. The -- that underscores how bizarre it 

16 is to force the Sacketts to go through a process. 

17 They've been injured by the EPA, by a compliance order, 

18 and they're told they must initiate an entirely separate 

19 administrative action with an entirely different agency 

in order to get indirect, tangential, possible review of 

21 the compliance order that has turned their world upside 

22 down for the last 4 years. 

23  The -- that is why the permitting process 

24 cannot provide meaningful judicial review to the 

Sacketts. That's why the Administrative Procedure Act 

14

1 is the ready-made answer. And, frankly, there's no 

2 indication that Congress intended anything other than 

3 the Administrative Procedure Act to provide an adequate 

4 administrative review for the -- for the adjudication of 

compliance orders. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would the standard 

7 be that -- before -- you have APA review. So, it's just 

8 that -- that the EPA acted reasonably in determining 

9 that you have wetlands?

 MR. SCHIFF: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it would 

11 be your typical arbitrary and capricious standard of 

12 review, substantial evidence based upon the record that 

13 was before the EPA when it made its finding of statutory 

14 violation, which is the statutory predicate for the 

issuance of the compliance order. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, wait. Surely, 

17 you wouldn't go in and -- and try to fight arbitrary or 

18 capricious. It's arbitrary or capricious or otherwise 

19 in violation of the law. Wouldn't you go in and say 

that this is in violation of the law? 

21  MR. SCHIFF: No, exactly, Justice Scalia. I 

22 mean, I don't mean to limit ourselves to just that one 

23 standard of review. But it would be a --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that one 

standard of review would do you very much good, to tell

1 you the truth. They've thought about this. Maybe they 

2 got it wrong, but to say it's arbitrary or capricious, 

3 you're going to lose. 

4  MR. SCHIFF: Well, I certainly hope not, 

Justice Scalia. But -- but the difficulty is we don't 

6 even know at this point what sort of record the EPA has. 

7 In fact, the law as it stands now is that EPA doesn't 

8 even need probable cause to issue a compliance order. 

9 And --

JUSTICE ALITO: Given -- given the rather 

11 vague nature of the test that's been adopted for 

12 determining whether something is part of the waters of 

13 the United States, wouldn't you have a very difficult 

14 time showing that a determination that it was, was 

arbitrary and capricious? 

16  MR. SCHIFF: There's no question, 

17 Justice Alito, that there -- there -- yes, it would be a 

18 difficult time. But that -- just because the Sacketts 

19 might have an uphill battle I don't believe is any 

reason to say that they should have no opportunity. I 

21 mean, as it stands now, they've been told you cannot 

22 build your home, you must convert your property into 

23 wetlands, and you are being charged $37,500 per day if 

24 you don't immediately comply. And yet, you get no day 

in court?

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Schiff, is the way 

2 you see this operating that you bring an action 

3 contesting on the basis of the arbitrary and capricious 

4 clause or -- or otherwise not in accordance with law? 

If -- if then the court rules against you but you 

6 continue to fail to comply, does the EPA then have to 

7 bring a separate enforcement action? 

8  MR. SCHIFF: Yes. The only way EPA can 

9 actually take money away from the Sacketts is by filing 

a civil action, but that would be true whether or not 

11 the Sacketts bring an APA cause of action. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- would 

13 collateral estoppel apply to you because of the judicial 

14 determination on the compliance order in the subsequent 

enforcement action? In other words, you lose. You seek 

16 APA review, and the court says, you know, we think it's 

17 a wetland. And then the EPA brings an enforcement 

18 action. They have to establish it's a wetland. Don't 

19 they just attach a copy of the decision?

 MR. SCHIFF: Well, not necessarily, 

21 Mr. Chief Justice, because, for one, the standard of 

22 review would be different. It would be -- under the 

23 APA, it would be the traditional deference afforded to 

24 agency action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not -- I guess 

17

Official 

1 I'm back to Justice Scalia's question. This -- it 

2 struck me as a purely legal, jurisdictional issue: Are 

3 these wetlands or not? And I don't know why you would 

4 give deference to the agency's determination on a legal 

jurisdictional issue like that. 

6  MR. SCHIFF: No, you're correct, 

7 Mr. Chief Justice. I mean more in terms of the 

8 substantial evidence standard that usually supports 

9 agency action under the APA. But -- but certainly here 

the Sacketts also contend, regardless of questions of --

11 of Rapanos and connection to navigable waters, the 

12 Sacketts contend that there are no wetlands at all on 

13 this property, and that ultimately is -- is, of course, 

14 a factual question that would be informed by what's in 

the record. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: But to go back to the Chief 

17 Justice's --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they're wrong about 

19 that, if there is a finding in the APA process that 

these are wetlands, is that the end of it? Or within 

21 that, the context of that review, can you say, well, 

22 they are wetlands, but only to a minor extent, and these 

23 conditions were onerous and -- and far more than 

24 necessary to protect the wetlands? Can you argue that 

in the APA review? Or is it just up or down: Wetlands,

2  MR. SCHIFF: No. I mean -- Justice Kennedy, 

3 we would argue that, even if there are wetlands on the 

4 property, which we do not believe there are, that --

that the compliance order would still be invalidated if 

6 there were not a significant nexus between the -- the 

7 alleged wetlands on the property and some navigable 

8 water in the vicinity. But -- but --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who would review that 

and where? Going back to Justice Kagan's question of --

11 let's assume you went through an APA process, and they 

12 found it was wetlands and that the compliance terms 

13 were -- had a substantial nexus. What happens when you 

14 go into an enforcement action?

 MR. SCHIFF: Well, at that point, then both 

16 sides get to create a new record, consistent with what 

17 the Ninth Circuit held. That --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, the Chief Justice's 

19 suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not 

agree with? 

21  MR. SCHIFF: No. In addition to the fact 

22 that the standards of review would be different, 

23 preponderance of the evidence in a civil action as 

24 opposed to substantial evidence in the APA, it would 

also be the fact that -- that, even as the Ninth Circuit

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, does anything get

7  MR. SCHIFF: I'm sorry, Justice --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does anything get 

9 estoppel? Assuming it's not a legal question, would the 

factual findings that there's a substantial nexus 

11 between the remedy ordered and the violation -- would 

12 that get estoppel? 

13  MR. SCHIFF: It -- it would be difficult to 

14 imagine a case of estoppel, because, again, in the APA 

context, it's just based upon the record at the time the 

16 compliance order is issued. And so, the records are 

17 always going to be different, because the civil action 

18 will build upon that administrative record. And then, 

19 secondly, in terms of the differing standards of review, 

I suppose one could find a -- a purely factual question 

21 perhaps that -- where the standards of review wouldn't 

22 matter, or a purely legal question, but --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: This wouldn't be a problem 

24 if -- if this procedure were not employed, if there were 

not this -- this prior compliance order that issues

1 before actual suit by the -- by EPA to hold you liable 

2 for violating the Act. Then you'd just have one -- one 

3 suit, and the -- the issue would be clear as to what 

4 burden the agency has to sustain. But it's -- it's 

really the dual nature of this process that creates the 

6 difficulty, isn't it? 

7  MR. SCHIFF: Yes, Justice Scalia, to some 

8 extent it is, of course, the process that -- that 

9 Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's in the statute. 

11 The agency didn't make that up, right? The statute 

12 provides for compliance orders, and it calls them 

13 "compliance orders," doesn't it? 

14  MR. SCHIFF: It -- it does indeed. And so, 

even if the Sacketts on remand don't get their ideal 

16 mode of judicial review, something is frankly better 

17 than nothing. They have been told for 4 years they 

18 cannot build their home. They have been threatened with 

19 ruinous civil penalties. And, to date, they have had no 

opportunity for their day in court. 

21  The -- the Sacketts cannot trigger an 

22 enforcement action. I mean, perhaps if Congress had 

23 written the statute differently to allow for some sort 

24 of judicial review that the Sacketts could -- could 

initiate for a compliance order, that might -- that

1 might answer, Justice Scalia, your concerns. But that 

2 is not the statute we have. We have a statute where 

3 Congress has said EPA can issue a compliance order, and 

4 we have in combination with that the presumption in 

favor of judicial review of final agency action; we have 

6 the avoidance canon; all that point to allowing for the 

7 Sacketts to get their day in court and at the same time 

8 to satisfy and to vindicate Congress's intent. 

9  Congress wanted EPA to be able to issue 

these -- these compliance orders. Congress gave 

11 significant statutory penalties for violating these 

12 compliance orders. But at the same time, there has to 

13 be balance. One cannot tell landowners --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you know, you're 

-- you're not going to be out of the woods. Even if you 

16 get this APA review, okay, some of the factual questions 

17 that go to whether these are wetlands or not are going 

18 to be decided giving substantial deference to the 

19 agency's determination of the facts, right?

 MR. SCHIFF: No, that is correct, 

21 Justice Scalia. And that --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: And so, even if you lose on 

23 that, you might still think you can win when the EPA 

24 finally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a 

penalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without --

may win the other. You'll have to roll the dice. 

6  MR. SCHIFF: Well, respectfully, 

7 Justice Scalia, it's more than rolling the dice. It's 

8 subjecting the -- the Sacketts to an interminable 

9 Damoclean sword, if -- if the only way they can get 

review is simply waiting, well, when will EPA let the 

11 sword drop and bring a civil action to enforce this 

12 compliance order that who knows how old it is? 

13  With EPA's theory of continuing violation, 

14 the statute of limitations never even runs. And so, you 

have the Sacketts who are forever subject to this cloud 

16 over themselves, cloud over their title. They can't get 

17 anyone to come onto their property to build their home. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there no limitation on 

19 the compliance order? It just -- it can be there 

forever until the EPA decides to bring an enforcement 

21 action? 

22  MR. SCHIFF: As -- Justice Ginsburg, as EPA 

23 interprets the -- the statute of limitations for 

24 collecting civil penalties, so long as the "discharge," 

quote, unquote, remains in place, it's considered a

2 limitations never even begins to run. And so, Sacketts 

3 might -- might build their home and, 10 years down the 

4 road, be surprised that here comes EPA with its civil 

action. 

6  Oh, now the Sacketts get judicial review but 

7 at a significant cost. They can't even enjoy the home 

8 that they might build because there is always this cloud 

9 hanging over them, a cloud that can be dispelled if they 

can simply have an opportunity, which, Justice Scalia, 

11 may not be the best opportunity, but something is better 

12 than nothing, an APA cause of action to review the EPA's 

13 assertion of its authority over their property. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I asked you earlier, in 

this APA review, would there be any further question 

16 after the determination is it wetlands, is it not? And 

17 you had said no, that's -- that would be it. But you 

18 answered another question that would suggest it may be 

19 wetlands, but it shouldn't -- there should be -- you 

should be allowed to build your home anyway. 

21  MR. SCHIFF: Allow me to clarify, Justice 

22 Ginsburg. In this APA cause of action, the Sacketts 

23 challenge the -- the jurisdictional predicate, and that 

24 is really a two-part determination. One is, are there 

wetlands on the property? And, two, are those wetlands

cause of action on remand would look like. We would say 

6 let's look at the -- at the record that EPA has 

7 assembled at the time it issued the compliance order, 

8 and does that record support the finding of statutory 

9 violation?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're conceding that 

11 the compliance order, assuming there is a violation, is 

12 all right? You're not challenging any of the terms of 

13 the compliance order other than the finding of a

 MR. SCHIFF: That -- that is correct, 

16 Justice Sotomayor. Yes, that is correct. That is all 

17 that we are challenging.

22  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

please the Court:

15

20

25

Official 

1  I'd like to begin with the question of 

2 double penalties because I think it helps to clarify 

3 exactly what the compliance order does and does not do 

4 in terms of altering the legal regime to which the 

Sacketts are subject. 

6  The compliance order is intended to specify 

7 the violation that EPA believes to have occurred and the 

8 measures that EPA believes are necessary in order to 

9 achieve prospective compliance. And the statute does 

provide separately for penalties for violating the 

11 statute and penalties for violating the compliance 

12 order. 

13  And, as an exercise of our duty of candor to 

14 the Court, we acknowledged in our brief that the 

Government reads the statute to allow the legal 

16 possibility of double penalties; that is, up to 37,500 

17 per day for violating the statute, up to 37,500 per day 

18 for violating the compliance order. I think that's 

19 really a theoretical rather than a practical --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why? You say "practical." 

21 The order itself says that. It says you don't do it, 

22 you're going to get penalized up to 32.5, which is now 

23 37. 

24  MR. STEWART: Well, that language in the 

order would have been accurate even if the statute 

26
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 didn't authorize penalties for violating the -- the 

2 order itself. That is, even if the statute authorized 

3 penalties only for violating the Act, it would have been 

4 accurate for EPA to say we believe this is what is 

necessary to achieve compliance, and if you don't do it, 

6 you will potentially be subject to these civil 

7 penalties; namely, civil penalties for violating the 

8 statute. 

9  But the reason I say that it's -- the double 

penalties as a theoretical possible -- let me say that 

11 again. If there were no provision for penalties for 

12 violating the compliance order, only penalties for 

13 violating the statute, EPA could accurately have said we 

14 believe that the following steps are necessary in order 

to achieve prospective compliance with the Act, and if 

16 you don't do these things, you will be subject to the 

17 following penalties because you will then be in 

18 violation of the Act and you will be subject to the 

19 penalties --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Stewart --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't follow -- I 

22 didn't follow that. What is your response to the 

23 assertion that you're subject to double penalties? 

24  MR. STEWART: It is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One, for violating

1 the Act; two, for violating the compliance order. 

2  MR. STEWART: The first is it is a legal 

3 possibility. We're not aware of any case in which a 

4 district court has ever imposed penalties of greater 

than the 37,000 --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you don't 

7 doubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the 

8 authority to do that? 

9  MR. STEWART: They have the authority to do 

that. I guess the other thing I would say is the 

11 possibility that penalties would be increased doesn't 

12 distinguish this scheme from the sort of regime that 

13 Justice Kennedy referred to or the sorts of regimes that 

14 we've discussed in our brief. That is, it's very common 

for law enforcement agencies of all sorts to give 

16 warnings to regulated parties: We think you're 

17 violating the statute.

1 seek anything more than the penalty for the underlying 

2 violation? It will not seek an additional penalty for 

3 violation of the compliance order? 

4  MR. STEWART: We have not adopted a policy 

to that effect.
 

6  And I guess what I -- I do want to
 

7 clarify --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: So, it's more than
 

9 theoretical, then. I don't really understand what
 

you're saying. You're saying that we may ask for more, 

11 but it's unlikely courts will actually provide for more. 

12  MR. STEWART: I guess the two -- I don't 

13 know that we have ever asked for more than the 37,500 

14 per day. Now, I think it is often the case what -- that 

what district courts will do is, within the 37,500 

16 statutory maximum, they will say we are imposing a 

17 greater penalty for the period after the compliance 

18 order was issued because it shows greater culpability to 

19 continue with the violation after you've been warned.

 But that's not a feature of the compliance 

21 order that distinguishes it from all manner of other 

22 agency warnings. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your order could have 

24 read, it could have read -- "Notice is hereby given that 

violation of or failure to comply with the foregoing

1 Order" -- cap "O" -- "may subject Respondents to, one, 

2 civil penalties" of up to 32.5 -- now 37.5 per day. 

3 That's how it reads. It could have read: Violation of 

4 or failure to comply with the Environmental Protection 

Act may subject Respondents to civil penalties. 

6  It's quite specific that it is violation of 

7 -- failure to comply with the foregoing order, which 

8 includes not letting -- filling in immediately and so 

9 forth. It says what it says. It's the violation of the 

order that -- that the additional penalties are attached 

11 to. 

12  MR. STEWART: And, again, we don't dispute 

13 that violating the order could as a realistic matter 

14 cause the penalties to be greater within the statutory 

maximum. But, as I was saying, in many situations, 

16 agencies give warnings to regulated parties: If you 

17 keep doing this, you may be subject to penalties. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It could -- it could as a 

19 theoretical matter double the penalties.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're just saying, as a 

22 practical matter, it doesn't often do that. 

23  MR. STEWART: As a practical matter, we are 

24 not aware of any case in which the penalties imposed 

have been greater than the per-day statutory maximum for

4  MR. STEWART: It -- in terms -- I think,
 

first of all, we would say that until we floated the 

6 theoretical possibility in our opening brief, the 

7 Sacketts seemed to be entirely unaware of it. That is, 

8 all of the Sacketts' calculations as to the penalties to 

9 which they would be exposed if they continued to engage 

in their present conduct were premised on the idea that 

11 37,500 was the statutory maximum. But the main point I 

12 want to --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart, I --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were getting a good 

night's sleep? But they are getting a good night's 

16 sleep before they read your brief? 

17  (Laughter.) 

18  MR. STEWART: I don't think -- I guess 

19 that's really my point, that the one thing the Sacketts 

have never argued is, if it were just the 37,500 per day 

21 for violating the statute, we would be willing to build 

22 our house and take our chances, but once you double 

23 that, we're not willing to take the risk any longer, 

24 that the --

1 their argument today, either. 

2  MR. STEWART: Right. 

3  The one point before I move on that I do 

4 want to make clear is, in a wide variety of contexts, 

agencies will issue warnings to regulated parties that 

6 they are believed to be in violation of a statute. And 

7 it is common under schemes where the amount of the 

8 sanction is up to the judge's discretion that penalties 

9 will -- may be greater for conduct that occurs after the 

person has been warned --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, but those 

12 situations are slightly different because the Act 

13 doesn't specify any specific remedies that apply to any 

14 specific property. It just says you violate the Act by 

filling in wetlands. It doesn't say that you violate 

16 the Act by not removing the fill and not planting trees 

17 and not doing this or doing that. What it says is you 

18 violate the Act if you don't comply with the compliance 

19 order that tells you to do those things. So, it's a 

very theoretically different violation that's going on. 

21  One is in the affirmative act prohibited by 

22 the statute; that's the violation of the statute. And 

23 the other is the violation of the remedial steps that 

24 the compliance order is the only thing that has set 

forth.

1  MR. STEWART: I don't think that's correct, 

2 Your Honor. First, as to of the requirement in earlier 

3 versions of the compliance order that herbaceous plants 

4 be planted, et cetera, those were removed from the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those are not in the 

6 statute. They're permitted by the statute, but they're 

7 not set forth as requirements under the statute. 

8  MR. STEWART: EPA's view of the statute is 

9 that -- without regard to the issuance of a compliance 

order, once fill material is deposited in waters of the 

11 United States, EPA's view of the penalty provisions 

12 would be that the violation continues for as long as the 

13 fill remains in the wetlands. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That has nothing to do 

with the fact that the Act doesn't specifically tell you 

16 to remove it. 

17  MR. STEWART: The Act doesn't 

18 specifically -- and the Act doesn't specifically tell 

19 the person to remove it, but that's our interpretation 

of the statute. And it's either right or wrong. That 

21 is, if we're wrong about that, if the only days on which 

22 penalties can be assessed for violating the statute 

23 itself are days on which fill was actually discharged,

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you
 

4 referred a couple of times to the EPA's view of the
 

statute. I take it that's your view as well? 

6  MR. STEWART: That's our view as well. I'm 

7 just saying that hasn't been definitively resolved by 

8 this Court. But the position that we've taken, again, 

9 with respect to the statute itself is that in computing 

the daily penalties and asking how many days of 

11 violation were there, the district court should take 

12 into account not just the days on which fill was 

13 actually deposited but the days on which fill remained 

14 in the wetlands.

 And Petitioners have specifically expressed 

16 agreement this morning with that view of the statute. I 

17 think the view of the Petitioners' amici is to the same 

18 effect, because in many of the amicus briefs there are 

19 calculations of the very large penalties to which people 

could be subject if they didn't adhere to compliance 

21 orders, and they're all premised on the idea that every 

22 day fill remains in the wetlands --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about those provisions 

24 of the original order? I must say I was not edified by 

the fact that, when litigation was threatened or

what the EPA would -- would demand? 

6  MR. STEWART: I don't know about well 

7 beyond. I think the -- every version of the compliance 

8 order said to the Sacketts if you think that there are 

9 things here -- in here that are wrong or compliance 

measures that you regard as infeasible, you're welcome 

11 to tell us. And I think --

you've received something called a compliance order,

17 for every day of violation. 

18  MR. STEWART: I think the portion of the 

19 order dealing with the planting of plants, which is the 

primary one that was eliminated in the final iteration 

21 of the order, is really removed from what the Sacketts 

22 have been complaining about. That is, the Sacketts --

resolved, there would be no further impediment --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what you

9 take out all the fill; I'm going to plant herbaceous 

trees or whatever it is; and I'll worry about whether to 

11 -- that way, I'll just do what the government tells me I 

12 should do.

14 that point were in an unattractive position. But I 

think in determining whether it's an unfair position or 

16 how the statutory scheme is supposed to operate, we 

17 ought to look not just at the opportunities that were 

18 available to them at that moment but the opportunities 

19 that they had forgone already.

build your house. Remove the fill, put in all kinds of 

6 plants, and now you have to let us on your premises 

7 whenever we want to. You have to turn over to us all 

8 sorts of documents, and for every day that you don't do

11 court to challenge our determination that this is a

13  MR. STEWART: Well, the first thing I would 

14 say is, as a matter of standard EPA practice, the 

compliance order would not be the first communication 

16 from the agency that would alert the landowner to the 

17 belief that there was a violation. The record in this 

18 case does not make clear whether that agency practice 

19 was followed in this case, but EPA's typical practice is 

to alert landowners through prior communications that a 

21 violation is existing --

6 there's no impediment to an after-the-fact permit. That 

7 is, at that point, the landowner could ask for a permit 

8 and --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, what 

the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says, 

11 because you didn't apply for a permit, you're in trouble 

12 because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we 

13 were going to take away your constitutional rights or 

14 not; so, we can do it.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the first two things I 

16 would -- the first thing I would say is it's not simply 

17 a hypothetical means of challenging CWA coverage to seek 

18 a permit. That is, in both SWANCC, Solid Waste Agency 

19 of Northern Cook County, and Carabell, which was one of 

the two companion cases that this Court adjudicated in 

21 Rapanos, that was the way that the suit got into Federal 

22 court. 

23  The landowners applied for permits, they 

24 were denied, they sought judicial review of the permit 

denials and argued, inter alia, that there was no need 

39

1 for a permit because the relevant tracts were not waters 

2 of the United States. 

3  The second thing I would say is it's often 

4 the case that judicial review is contingent upon 

complying with some sort of deadline or some sort of 

6 prerequisite, and once a person has missed the deadline, 

7 that person may as a practical matter be in the same 

8 position as if judicial review had not been made 

9 available at all.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the Corps of 

12 Engineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis 

13 for refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a 

14 permit; you don't need a permit.

 MR. STEWART: It would issue a letter either 

16 to the effect that there was no wetland or that it was a 

17 wetland that was not covered by --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that binding on --

19  MR. STEWART: Yes, we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Environmental 

21 Protection Agency? 

22  MR. STEWART: Yes, we would --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: How can they bring an 

24 action? I'd like some clarification here. The Corps's 

regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit.

1 I mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day 

2 after getting this order, you'd run up against the reg, 

3 which says we won't give you any after the fact -- we 

4 won't even consider this matter, until any required 

initial corrective measures are made. 

6  And then, just to be safe, they say that no 

7 permit application will be accepted unless the Corps 

8 determines that concurrent processing of an 

9 after-the-fact permit application is clearly 

appropriate. "Clearly." 

11  So, I looked at those two things and said, 

12 of course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers; 

13 they're not going to accept it unless you have a very 

14 unusual case. So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong 

about that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit 

16 applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted. Maybe 

17 there are a lot. 

18  MR. STEWART: It's not precluded, but I 

19 would agree with you: It's very unlikely that without 

complying with the order --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. I agree. 

22 Then, if we agree, then look, for 75 years the courts 

23 have interpreted statutes with an eye towards permitting 

24 judicial review, not the opposite.

 MR. STEWART: But --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: And yet -- so, here you're 

2 saying this statute that says nothing about it precludes 

3 review, and then the second thing you say is that this 

4 isn't final. So, I read the order. It looks like about 

as final a thing as I've ever seen. So, tell me why I'm 

6 wrong on those two points. 

7  MR. STEWART: Well, we're not arguing that 

8 the statute precludes all judicial review. That is, the 

9 question whether the Clean Water Act applied to this 

tract could have been teed up for a court in either of 

11 two ways. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If it doesn't --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you are arguing --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: -- you're on the final 

part. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: You are arguing that the 

17 presumption of reviewability does not apply. 

18  MR. STEWART: To this particular order. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: And that seems a very 

strange position. Why would the presumption of 

21 reviewability not apply? 

22  MR. STEWART: I think first because the 

23 order doesn't express the final -- the agency's final 

24 view both in the sense that it invites the Sacketts to 

provide further comment --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they asked -- they 

2 asked for a hearing. Didn't they ask EPA for a hearing 

3 on whether their lands fell within the statute? They 

4 did ask for a hearing, and the EPA said no.

 MR. STEWART: EPA said no to a formal 

6 hearing, but I think that would be characteristic agency 

7 practice; that is, when the agency is exercising what is 

8 essentially its prosecutorial function, that is, warning 

9 regulated parties we may do -- we may sue you if you 

don't do the following things. It would be quite common 

11 for enforcement personnel to entertain informal 

12 overtures from the regulated party or his legal 

13 representative, but I think it would be extraordinary, 

14 for instance, for a U.S. Attorney's Office to grant a 

formal hearing to a potential criminal defendant in 

16 order to discuss the -- in order to resolve the question 

17 criminal charges should be brought. But --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's -- there's one 

19 thing I do want you to tell us is -- EPA has three 

choices. It can go to a compliance order; it can issue 

21 an administrative -- trigger an administrative penalty 

22 when -- where there would be APA review; or it can bring 

23 an enforcement action. How does the agency decide which 

24 of those three routes it's going to take in a given 

case? 

43
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  MR. STEWART: I think the -- the agency's 

2 normal practice would be to issue an administrative 

3 compliance order before initiating judicial proceedings. 

4 That is, the statute doesn't require it, but the EPA 

ordinarily would not commence a lawsuit without first 

6 giving the regulated party one final opportunity to come 

7 into compliance. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about this 

9 administrative order that -- the administrative order 

internally within EPA subject to judicial review? When 

11 does it use that as opposed to a compliance order? 

12  MR. STEWART: It could use that. It would 

13 typically use that for violations that it perceived to 

14 be less serious. The statutory cap on penalties is much 

lower than the cap in the judicial enforcement actions. 

16 I think it would probably be the case that it would 

17 issue an administrative compliance order in those 

18 situations as well. 

19  Now, one of the things that the 

administrative -- the cover letter to the administrative 

21 compliance order does say is, even if you comply, you 

22 are still not immune from the possibility of enforcement 

23 proceedings with respect to past violations. And I 

24 think that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can the EPA issue a

1 warning instead of using this -- this order procedure? 

2 Compliance order procedure? 

3  MR. STEWART: Oh, absolutely. I mean, there 

4 is no express statutory authorization for that, but I 

think most agencies regard it as within their ordinary 

6 authority to enforce the statute to send less formal 

7 communication. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: And doesn't most of --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, they could just -- just 

dispense with this compliance order and tell the 

11 Sacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe 

12 you're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject 

13 to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for 

14 that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our 

judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you 

16 know, pine trees on the lot. It could do that? 

17  MR. STEWART: They could use the letter for 

18 that mechanism. And --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: And there would be no 

review of that. 

21  MR. STEWART: We would certainly argue there 

22 would be no review of that. And if the Court said that 

23 there was review of the administrative compliance order 

24 based on features that were distinct to the order, 

namely, the fact that it is couched as an order, the

1 fact that penalties can be imposed for violation of the 

2 order itself, an opinion along those lines wouldn't 

3 suggest that. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything you've 

got by -- I mean, I'm -- you've got me now into the 

6 area; we're applying the APA; and the question is Abbott 

7 Labs and is it final? Well, here there doesn't seem 

8 anything more for the agency to do, and here the -- the 

9 person whom the order is directed against is being hurt 

a lot. 

11  So, the only thing I -- left in my mind here 

12 is the order itself does say come in and talk to us 

13 about this. Which may suggest it isn't final. So, do 

14 you have any information on that point? That is, have 

you looked up or has the EPA told you that really when 

16 we issue these things, in fact people come in and we 

17 modify them X percent of the time? 

18  MR. STEWART: We don't have statistics on 

19 that. Now --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any impression 

21 that you could tell us? 

22  MR. STEWART: I -- I would have the 

23 impression that it's -- in a nontrivial number of cases, 

24 the landowner does approach EPA. Now, it's--

4 order of 3 percent of wetlands-related compliance orders 

under the Clean Water Act ultimately culminate in
 

6 lawsuits for enforcement.
 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Stewart, you --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you --

9  MR. STEWART: That would -- that would
 

encompass both the cases in which the landowners came in 

11 and talked to EPA and those in which they just complied. 

12 I'm sorry. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, you suggested 

14 that -- that some communication occurs before this 

compliance order. And my guess would be that most of 

16 the back and forth between the agency and the person 

17 does happen before the compliance order rather than 

18 after. 

19  And the notion that the person can come in 

after the compliance order and say you were wrong --

21 well, they can, but they can do that with respect to any 

22 administrative action. So, am I wrong about that? That 

23 really the back and forth here takes place before the 

24 compliance order issues rather than after?

1 as a matter of typical agency practice that there would 

2 be an invitation well before the compliance order was 

3 issued to come in and give your side of the story. And 

4 you're probably right that, if we got to the point where 

a compliance order was issued, then the likelihood that 

6 further communications would sway the agency 

7 substantially might be reduced. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart --

9  MR. STEWART: So, I would think your point 

there --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Finish your 

12 answer, and then --

13  MR. STEWART: So, yes, I would agree with 

14 that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You were cut-off. You 

16 were saying if we were troubled by the additional 

17 penalties, and you were going to suggest something. If 

18 we were troubled by that aspect of the order alone, and 

19 you haven't dealt with the permit issue after the fact, 

what would be your approach to the case then? 

21  MR. STEWART: Well, I guess the two things, 

22 one of which may be more troubling rather than less 

23 troubling, is to say that if you're troubled by this, 

24 then there are a lot of other things that might be 

troubling as well because it's often the case that

1 warnings are issued to regulated parties, and it's often 

2 the case that if the regulated party continues with the 

3 conduct after receiving the warning, the penalties may 

4 be enhanced.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This is not a warning. I 

6 mean, really all you have to do is look at it. I was 

7 quite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't 

8 say a warning. It said this is an order. It looks 

9 extremely formal. I even overstated in your favor the 

question of negotiating because it doesn't say 

11 negotiating about changing the order; it says 

12 negotiating about amending the order. And -- so, this 

13 is not just a warning, is it? 

14  MR. STEWART: It is not -- it is phrased as 

an order, but the only thing that EPA is authorized to 

16 do under section 1319(a)(3) is to order people to do 

17 what they were already legally complied -- required to 

18 do; that is, order them to comply with their legal 

19 obligations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you usually obtain a 

21 declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and 

22 you think that there is no basis for it, and you 

23 can't -- you're not -- you're not compelled to just 

24 stand there and wait for the prosecutor to -- to drop 

the hammer? Can't you normally bring a declaratory

1 judgment action saying there's no basis for prosecution? 

2  MR. STEWART: There is no -- the Court has 

3 held that there is no constitutional bar to that and 

4 that a declaratory judgment remedy can be made available 

in that circumstance. But, again, I think it would 

6 cause a huge upheaval in the practices of many agencies 

7 to say that declaratory relief is --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but the --

9  MR. STEWART: -- typically available when 

the agency issues an informal warning. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in -- maybe with an 

12 informal warning, but when you have something as formal 

13 as this which shows that the agency does intend to 

14 prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a 

declaratory judgment action? 

16  MR. STEWART: Again, I don't think that 

17 there would be any value to agencies or to regulated 

18 parties to encourage the agencies to hedge their bets or 

19 to say less than what they really mean. That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: More of a -- that's what 

21 I'm trying to get you to talk about just for one minute. 

22 I mean, you're talking about a huge upheaval. My honest 

23 impression is that it is the Government here that is 

24 fighting 75 years of practice --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, a warning 

isn't reviewable. But this seems to meet the test where 

6 that fails. Now, please correct me if I'm wrong about 

7 the agency practice. I can't find support for you --

8  MR. STEWART: The Court in Abbott Labs 

9 emphasized that that was an industry-wide regulation 

having the force of law and that the basis for 

11 challenging it was a purely legal ground. And one of 

12 the reasons that we think judicial review of the 

13 administrative compliance order within this scheme would 

14 make no sense, would be out of keeping with the rest of 

the statutory regime, is that it wouldn't solve the 

16 problem. 

17  As the discussion in the first part of the 

18 argument made clear, Petitioners share our view that the 

19 administrative compliance order would be subject to 

review if it's reviewable under a deferential standard. 

21 And if the Court held that the order was not arbitrary 

22 and capricious, that still wouldn't eliminate the 

23 possibility that if we pursued an enforcement action --

Stewart --

1  MR. STEWART: -- the Petitioners could argue 

2 that they weren't actually in violation. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how would it work? 

4 You say it's a lesser standard under the APA. But the 

question is, is this wetlands or is it not?
 

6  MR. STEWART: It's more than just is it
 

7 wetlands. It's are these wetlands that have the
 

8 requisite connection to traditional navigable waters?
 

9 And that can turn in part on factual and scientific
 

judgments, and those are --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far -- as far as 

12 the EPA is concerned, they're finished with that 

13 question. This is not something that, well, we might 

14 look at it again tomorrow based on new evidence. The 

determination that these are qualifying wetlands -- that 

16 has been made. 

17  MR. STEWART: I think they have reached that 

18 conclusion for now. I don't think it would be accurate 

19 to say that we have done all the research we would want 

to do if we were going to be required to prove up our 

21 case in court. And that's really the second half of 

22 the -- the problem, that if Petitioners' claim were 

23 reviewable and a court held EPA didn't do sufficient 

24 investigation based on the record before it at the time, 

there was no sound basis --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: That makes the EPA's conduct 

2 here even more outrageous: We -- we think now that this 

3 is wetlands that are -- that qualify; so, we're going to 

4 hit you with this compliance order, but, you know, when 

we look into it more thoroughly in the future, we might 

6 change our mind. 

7  MR. STEWART: I would assume that any 

8 prosecutor, any enforcement person, would want to be 

9 better prepared when a case actually went to trial than 

when he was communicating to the potential defendant 

11 that there's a real likelihood that we would sue you. 

12 But the other --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're required to 

14 make a finding that there's a violation. You're not 

suggesting that the government is going to act 

16 willy-nilly and it's not going to act on sufficient 

17 evidence in -- in sending a letter that says we find you 

18 are violating the Act. 

19  MR. STEWART: Obviously, we would feel that 

we had sufficient evidence for doing that. But the 

21 second part of the point that I was going to make is, 

22 even if a court found that we didn't have sufficient 

23 evidence before us at the time the administrative 

24 compliance order was issued and that the order was 

therefore arbitrary and capricious, that wouldn't

you've looked at it. You hope you have a sufficient 

6 basis. And because of the administrative compliance 

7 order, you're really never going to be put to the test 

8 because most landowners aren't going to say, I'm going 

9 to risk the $37,000 a day. All EPA has to do is make 

whatever finding it wants and realize that in 99 percent 

11 of the cases, it's never going to be put to the test. 

12  MR. STEWART: I -- I guess the only point I 

13 would make is, if Petitioners had wanted a judicial 

14 resolution of the coverage question without subjecting 

themselves to potential penalties, they could have filed 

16 a permit application before discharging. They could 

17 have gotten review there. All we're saying is they 

18 can't discharge fill, wait to see whether EPA notices,

notices and objects.

1  MR. SCHIFF: Mr. Chief Justice, unless the 

2 Court has any additional questions --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: I do, actually, because I 

4 see their point better than I did. This, I think, is 

what they're worried about: They're worried that when 

6 you get judicial review of this kind of order, the court 

7 doesn't refer on factfinding that isn't made on a 

8 record. The substantial evidence test applies to 

9 factfinding made on a record, or 556/557. And so, 

they'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each 

11 of these cases subjecting it to judicial factfinding. 

12  And they think that the purpose of this, the 

13 purpose of this procedure given to them by statute was 

14 to call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there 

might be thousands of these things, and they can't 

16 prepare all that formal thing. Now, I -- I see that as 

17 a -- as a -- now I understand their concern. I'm not 

18 saying they're right. I understand their concern. 

19  So, if you want to comment, is there some 

way to accommodate their concern that also accommodates 

21 judicial review? Or are we just in a kind of -- they're 

22 in a Hobson's choice, in a sense. 

23  MR. SCHIFF: Well, Justice Breyer, the 

24 difficulty is essentially of EPA's own creation. I 

don't understand why -- why EPA would want the power to

1 issue compliance orders that, as the Court has 

2 recognized, are -- are tremendously coercive. And not 

3 have --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: They want the power because 

they have thousands of these things. They investigate 

6 it, and they find the facts. They think it's 

7 sufficient, but judicial factfinding is carried out 

8 before a judge who doesn't have their experience, et 

9 cetera, and, therefore, there is a risk of incorrect 

decisionmaking, at least too -- under the statute, it 

11 would be too pro-homeowner rather too pro-environment. 

12 That's why it's more of a dilemma than I thought. 

13  MR. SCHIFF: I think, Justice Breyer, the --

14 the fear of it being too pro-homeowner is in fact 

protected by the fact of the APA standard of review. 

16 We're not talking about -- about the agency being forced 

17 to sort of --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but maybe the agency 

19 is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a 

record. When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no 

21 reason to give it deference. 

22  MR. SCHIFF: You're correct, Justice Scalia. 

23 If there is no record, certainly there's by necessity no 

24 substantial evidence, and in that case, the compliance

to change. I see a number of possibilities. I can see 

6 their dilemma. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: But they'll just issue 

8 warnings, is what they'll do. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases in the 

courts of appeals or the district courts where 

11 landowners, having received these notices or compliance 

12 orders, have said that there's a taking of the property, 

13 inverse condemnation? 

14  MR. SCHIFF: I'm not aware of that, Your 

Honor, but -- Justice Kennedy, but, as this Court I 

16 believe held in Riverside Bayview, a takings claim under 

17 the Clean Water Act is not considered ripe until a 

18 permit application has been -- has been attempted. 

19  Now, if a compliance order is issued, then 

the permit application might be off the table. And, in 

21 fact, one could see that a compliance order might 

22 potentially have a total taking effect in this case. 

23  But certainly, at this point, we are willing 

24 to let EPA have the power. Yes, let EPA administer the 

Act and issue compliance orders, but let's also give

you could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is 

6 you should have gotten a before-the-fact permit. And 

7 putting aside the weirdness which Justice Alito points 

8 out of making you go get a permit for something you 

9 don't think you need a permit for -- putting that aside, 

couldn't you have gotten the legal determination that 

11 you wanted through that process? 

12  MR. SCHIFF: We -- Justice Kagan, we don't 

13 deny that by applying for a permit and having the Corps 

14 make a decision on the permit that that's one way to get 

into court. But the difficulty for the Sacketts and 

16 for, you know, the thousands of folks in this country 

17 who are recipients of compliance orders is that that's 

18 small or no solace once EPA has already acted, you know, 

19 once EPA has made the finding of violation and then 

threatens these ruinous penalties on -- on landowners. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think what EPA is 

22 saying is, as long as you knew that your lands were 

23 potentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the 

24 get-go and -- and sought a determination that they were 

not wetlands through the permit process.

1  MR. SCHIFF: That's correct, Justice Kagan. 

2 But, frankly, the way EPA and the Corps interpret the 

3 scope of their jurisdiction, that would make essentially 

4 every landowner in this country potentially on notice 

requiring them to apply for a permit or some other 

6 manner, and the agency will then probably have even a 

7 worse situation; it will be flooded by permits. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

9 counsel.

 The case is submitted. 

11  (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

12 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
