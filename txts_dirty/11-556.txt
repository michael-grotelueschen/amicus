3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case 11-556, Vance v. Ball State 

University. 

6  Mr. Ortiz. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. ORTIZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  This case concerns who counts and who does 

12 not count as a supervisor under Title VII. The parties 

13 and the United States agree that the Seventh Circuit 

14 rule violates the holding of Faragher, the reasoning of 

Faragher and this Court's other central Title VII 

16 precedents, including Burlington Northern and Staub, and 

17 the common-sense meaning of the word "supervisor." 

18  The parties even agree as to the general 

19 legal standard, although they style it a little bit 

different -- differently, that those harassers whose 

21 employer-conferred authority over their victims enables 

22 or materially augments the harassment should count as 

23 supervisors. 

24  This is not a standard, Your Honor, that 

imposes automatic liability on employers. Victims must

1 still prove actionable harassment, and employers can 

2 still take advantage of the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative 

3 defense. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say you have a 

work room. There are five people who work there. And 

6 the employer has a rule that the senior employee gets to 

7 pick the music that's going to play all day long. And 

8 the senior employee says to one of the other 

9 employees -- you know, if you don't date me -- I know 

you don't like country music; if you don't date me, it's 

11 going to be country music all day long. 

12  Now, that affects the daily activities of 

13 that other employee. I would have thought, under your 

14 theory, that means that that senior employee is a 

supervisor. 

16  MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor, because in that 

17 circumstance the adverse action would not amount to --

18 would not be severe. Or, perhaps it would be 

19 pervasive --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that could 

21 be -- that could be far more severe than, for example --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Hard rock instead of --

23  (Laughter.) 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It could be far more 

severe than simply saying, all right -- you know, you're

2 cutting the celery rather than -- you know, baking the 

3 bread, or whatever. 

4  MR. ORTIZ: Well, no, Your Honor, this is 

the -- the severity is an objective standard; it's not a 

6 subjective. So in this case, someone's intense 

7 dislike -- maybe it's debilitating, subjective --

8 dislike of rock music, some forms of country music --

9 might impair the performance of some in the workplace; 

but, from an objective reasonable employee's standpoint, 

11 I don't believe that that would be the case. Not all --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean, 

13 there are places where the environment -- you know, an 

14 assembly line or something like that -- where the task 

may not be that different, but how you -- the 

16 environment in which you have to perform them may be far 

17 more significant than whether or not you're attaching 

18 the door handles or the front fenders. 

19  MR. ORTIZ: Oh, for sure, Your Honor, but 

that has to be judged on a case-by-case basis. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, exactly. And 

22 I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh 

23 Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through 

24 those case-by-case basis. I think we can have a 

reasonable debate about whether the music you have to

Official 

1 listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant 

2 enough interference with the daily activities to qualify 

3 under your test. 

4  But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear --

it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes 

6 clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to 

7 the allegation. 

8  MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, the Respondent 

9 actually exaggerates the determinativeness of the 

Seventh Circuit rule, and the indeterminativeness --

11 both indeterminativeness and unpredictability of the 

12 Second Circuit rule. 

13  The Seventh Circuit itself has recognized --

14 the judges in the Seventh Circuit itself have recognized 

that the rule does not really well fit the realities of 

16 the workplace. It also just moves uncertainty from one 

17 category to another. 

18  The category of supervisor may be a little 

19 bit tidier; but, under the Seventh Circuit's approach, 

the category of co-worker is very unpredictable. 

21  The Seventh Circuit itself, in 

22 Doe v. Oberweis Dairy, recognized that once you move 

23 people who can take -- have this kind of power over 

24 their victims but can't actually take tangible employment 

actions against them into the category of co-workers, 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1 all of a sudden you have to apply a sliding scale of 

2 negligence. Not only that, but the jury is the one who 

3 applies it. 

4  So for those categories -- this exact 

category of employee, Your Honor, the employee --

6 employer going forward has very little idea of 

7 whether -- what standard of care is that a particular 

8 jury would apply in that case and whether the jury would 

9 decide it is met or not. 

The Seventh Second -- Seventh Circuit rule, 

11 in the overall, is no more determinative than the Second 

12 Circuit rule. 

13  Also, Respondent points to no cases in the 

14 Second Circuit or the other circuits that have adopted 

this rule where courts have identified problems with its 

16 application. And that --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you explain 

18 what the materially augments rule means? Could you 

19 provide a definition of that? The authority to assign 

daily tasks has to be sufficient to do what? 

21  MR. ORTIZ: It has to be sufficient to 

22 enable the harasser to instill either fear in the victim 

23 that the victim should not turn the harasser in, or that 

24 it may have to do with the harasser's ability to control 

the physical location of the victim. That can augment 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 harassment. 

2  If an harasser can steer a victim to a 

3 location where the harasser has an opportunity to 

4 harass, and, indeed, may have an opportunity to harass 

without other employees or other people in the company 

6 seeing in, that would materially augment --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: There are situations where 

8 the -- the assignment of responsibilities is extremely 

9 unpleasant, and so it's easy to see how the testimony 

would apply in that situation. 

11  But there are also a lot of situations, like 

12 the Chief Justice's example, where it's really very 

13 unclear. I don't know how courts are going to -- how 

14 courts can grapple with that. 

MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, this --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: You said that being 

17 subjected to country music or hard rock or Wagner -- you 

18 know, every single day in the workplace would not be 

19 sufficient. I don't know. Some people might think that 

it was -- that that is. 

21  MR. ORTIZ: Justice Alito, this part of the 

22 standard, particularly the materiality requirement, is 

23 meant to track this Court's standard in Burlington 

24 Northern, where it said that only actions that are 

materially adverse to the employee would count. 

8

1  And this Court identified the materiality 

2 requirement there as actually working to make the 

3 standard more objective, not --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the 

question that you're presenting academic in this case? 

6 Because didn't the district judge say that there had 

7 been no showing that Davis' conduct was sufficiently 

8 severe or pervasive? 

9  It wouldn't matter if the supervisor -- if 

the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive 

11 harassment, and, equally, if the company responded every 

12 time a complaint was lodged. The district court found 

13 both of those things, that it wasn't severe and 

14 pervasive, and that every time she claimed -- complained 

an investigation was made. 

16  MR. ORTIZ: Justice Ginsburg, we actually 

17 tried to bring those things up before the Seventh 

18 Circuit, but the Seventh Circuit found it unnecessary to 

19 reach them because of its holding as to supervisory 

liability. 

21  If this Court were to reverse the Seventh 

22 Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment of the district 

23 court, the case would then be remanded to the Seventh 

24 Circuit, where it could either look at these 

alternative -- these other holdings, or the thing would 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 be -- it could be remanded at that point and sent back 

2 to the district court for another look. 

3  The district court's reasoning, the Seventh 

4 Circuit noted, when it was talking about other incidents 

of harassment was very unusual. What the district court 

6 did was it divided all of the incidents into two 

7 categories. 

8  One category -- one category consisted of 

9 events that by themselves were not overtly racial in 

nature and the other category consisted of those events 

11 that were overtly racial in nature, where a racial 

12 epithet had been hurled at someone, for example, and 

13 said with respect to the first category, the things --

14 the events that on their face did not announce racial 

animosity, that there wasn't any racial nexus, so they 

16 didn't count, and swept all those events out and then 

17 looked at the remaining ones where the connection to 

18 racial animus was overt. And it said, well, these, 

19 there may be some, but they just don't count. 

So the Seventh Circuit itself discredited 

21 the reasoning of the district court in those very 

22 holdings. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Ortiz, suppose I agree 

24 with your standard, but I just can't find on the record 

as it has been presented in this Court any evidence that

Official 

1 Davis actually served as Vance's supervisor. What -- I 

2 mean, what's your best -- so if that's true, I would be 

3 tempted to actually just decide the thing rather than to 

4 remand it. 

So as against that approach, what is your 

6 best evidence that there was a supervisory relationship 

7 under your standard here? 

8  MR. ORTIZ: First, Justice Kagan, it is 

9 important to keep in mind that the record was developed 

under the wrong legal standard. But even considering 

11 that --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is that the case? Is 

13 there evidence that you did not present because the 

14 Seventh Circuit applied a different standard? 

MR. ORTIZ: There was evidence that was 

16 probably not developed below because the Seventh 

17 Circuit's standard was so absolute. But there is 

18 actually evidence in the record, we believe plenty of 

19 evidence, sufficient certainly to overcome summary 

judgment, although perhaps not enough for partial 

21 summary judgment on this question in our favor. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What other than the job 

23 description? The job description says that the catering 

24 specialist has authority to direct or lead the part-time 

employees. But what concrete instances of Davis 

11

Official 

1 exercising supervisory authority over Vance is there in 

2 this record? 

3  MR. ORTIZ: Well, Justice -- there is two 

4 separate questions, Justice Ginsburg. One is instances 

of it; others is whether she has the authority or not. 

6 Because this Court has held in Faragher itself that it 

7 is the authority that makes the difference, not the 

8 actual exercising of it in a particular case. 

9  But let me go through what is in the record 

now, much of it which is in the Joint Appendix but not 

11 all, because we were not aware that we would be opposing 

12 a summary judgment motion before this Court. 

13  First, William Kimes, who is the director of 

14 the university banquet and catering division, the sort of 

head of this 60-some-person department. Two employees 

16 testified that he told them that Davis was a supervisor. 

17 One of them was Vance; that could be found on page 198 

18 of the Joint Appendix. Another is an employee who was 

19 in Vance's position named Dawn Knox, and that statement 

can be found on page 386 of the Joint Appendix. 

21  William Kimes himself testified in his 

22 deposition that Davis, quote: "Directed and led other 

23 employees in the kitchen." That can be found on page 

24 367 of the Joint Appendix. In an internal investigation 

by compliance officers at Ball State --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What I mean is not the 

2 statement, well, she's a supervisor. But comparable to 

3 Faragher, where the lifeguard who didn't have authority 

4 to hire her or fire her said, if you don't date me, you 

are going to be cleaning the toilets. We don't have 

6 anything like that in this record. 

7  MR. ORTIZ: Well, there was no overt threat 

8 like that in the record, but the person who was hurling 

9 racial epithets at her was in a position of authority 

over her, both according to the job description, also 

11 according to her understanding, according --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was also -- that 

13 would be for a very confined period. It would only be 

14 when the -- when Vance was a part-time employee. Once 

she is a full-time employee there isn't that. 

16  MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. There is two 

17 separate provisions in the job description which cover 

18 the whole period of time here. The harassment started 

19 around September 2005, went in through August -- went to 

August 2007 with one incident, March 1st, I believe it 

21 was, 2008. On January 1st, 2007, Ms. Vance received a 

22 promotion from part-time to full-time. 

23  Page 13 on the Joint Appendix has this item 

24 that you pointed to, Justice, which specifically lists 

among the duties and responsibilities of the catering 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

25

Official 

1 specialist leading and directing part-time employees. 

2 However, page 12 of the Joint Appendix lists under 

3 positions supervised by the catering specialist, exactly 

4 Vance's position. So when she moved from full-time --

sorry, from part-time to full-time on -- in January 

6 2007, the supervisory nexus in the job description 

7 merely jumped from page 13 to page 12. But it was 

8 covered for that whole period of time. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: What was the most unpleasant 

thing that Davis could have assigned the Petitioner to 

11 do? Maybe chopping onions all day, every day? 

12  MR. ORTIZ: Certainly within the -- within 

13 the job duties that she traditionally did, the kind of 

14 things she had to work with, what she had to do, things 

like this, working with onions, chopping onions all day 

16 might be punishment. Unfortunately again, though, the 

17 record wasn't developed under an understanding that all 

18 of this would be relevant. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: But that would materially 

augment? Chopping onions all day would be enough? 

21  MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Chopping -- how about 

23 chopping other things, just chopping? You are the 

24 sous-chef, you are going to be chopping all day every 

day. Would that be enough? 

14

1  MR. ORTIZ: Possibly, Your Honor. It 

2 depends, again, on questions which would depend upon how 

3 you had to chop, how heavy the knives were, whether you 

4 would get repetitive injuries. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, did she ever 

6 have that authority, because the record as far as we 

7 have it says that the work assignments, what Vance was 

8 doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most 

9 that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where 

people would be stationed. 

11  MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it is not quite 

12 clear at this point. Vance, in an internal 

13 investigation at Ball State University, Ms. Vance told 

14 the compliance officer who was conducting the 

investigation that Davis delegated jobs to her in the 

16 kitchen. That appears in Document 59-16 on page 2. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, may I interrupt 

18 a moment on --

19  MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- following up on an 

21 issue raised in part by the Chief and by Justice 

22 Ginsburg. Assuming that Davis was a direct supervisor, 

23 would there be an affirmative defense available to the 

24 employer?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be your 


MR. ORTIZ: Yes. 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That this could not be 


6 grounds that someone who directs an employee's 

7 day-to-day activity should be treated like someone who 

8 hasn't actually undertaken the threat because the 

9 situations are different. 

MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. This is --

11 this falls out of the structure of the affirmative 

12 defense as laid out in Ellerth and Faragher. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what this fight 

14 is about? What if we were to say that the EEOC's test 

governed or the Second Circuit test governed, but 

16 because of the nature of the difference between formal 

17 supervisors who take tangible work activities and 

18 informal supervisors who the employer would have less 

19 control over and less knowledge about their activities, 

that we would require an employee to complain. Would 

21 that be a crazy rule, and why? 

22  MR. ORTIZ: That this Court would require 

23 under those circumstances? 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would require, would 

permit the affirmative defense to be raised by an

1 employer. 

2  MR. ORTIZ: It doesn't actually map on well 

3 to the structure of the affirmative defenses laid out in 

4 Ellerth and Faragher. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but there is a 

6 difference between those supervisors who take direct 

7 activity, tangible direct actions, who are in power to 

8 do that, and supervisors who don't have that power, 

9 because supervisors who don't have that power are 

supervised -- their actions are supervised in a way that 

11 non-tangible employment supervisors are not. 

12  MR. ORTIZ: But under the existing 

13 affirmative -- affirmative defense, as I understand it, 

14 Your Honor, an employee who doesn't complain, unless 

they are reasonable in not complaining, in most cases 

16 would make the affirmative defense unavailable to the 

17 employer. Is it the question concerning the difference 

18 between unreasonably failing to complain --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it's whether, 

whether or not this whole fight is over that issue. 

21  MR. ORTIZ: That -- this whole -- the fight 

22 is in -- in part about that issue. That is certainly 

23 not the only --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, because it's also 

about the burden of proof.

4 affirmative defense, does that solve half your problem? 

MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. It makes it 

6 better. 

7  And this Court has recognized the 

8 affirmative defense appropriately allocates the burdens 

9 between the employee and the employer going forward. 

Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit rule, 

11 although unsupported by Respondent, is supported by 

12 several of the Respondents' amici. As I said, they tend 

13 to oversell the determinativeness of the Seventh Circuit 

14 rule. They exaggerate the -- the uncertainty that 

they predict will happen under the --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you tell me what 

17 you see as the major difference between the EEOC and the 

18 Second Circuit rule, and why one is compelled over the 

19 other? 

It's the regulatory agency charged with 

21 oversight of -- of the implementation of the statute. 

22 Why shouldn't we give deference to it on --

why no more? Why just Skidmore? 

6  MR. ORTIZ: Because it's -- it's only 

7 informal guidance, Your Honor. It hasn't gone through 

8 rulemaking, formal adjudication and those processes 

9 which elevate the amount of deference --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's an absolute rule? 

11  MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, it's a little 

12 bit contentious on this Court. No, Your Honor, it's a 

13 little bit contentious on this Court; but, following 

14 Mead Products, for example, it wouldn't be entitled to 

more than Skidmore -- deference. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you answered the 

17 argument it shouldn't get any deference because what --

18 what the EEOC guidance does is it is -- it is 

19 interpreting two decisions of this Court, and this 

Court, not the EEOC, is in the best position to 

21 determine what those two cases mean? 

22  MR. ORTIZ: Well, what it is, Your Honor, is 

23 it represents an interpretation of the word "agent" in 

24 Title VII.

16 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

17  When a person controls a subordinate's daily 

18 work activities and subjects her to harassment, that 

19 person qualifies as a supervisor for purposes of the 

Faragher-Ellerth vicarious liability affirmative defense 

21 framework. 

22  When it controls daily work activities and, 

23 therefore, for example, can compel the cleaning of 

24 toilets for a year, the principle that the agency 

relationship augments the ability to carry out the

1 harassment is implicated in that the victim will lack 

2 the same ability to resist the harassment or to report 

3 it as would be the case if the harassment were conducted 

4 by a coworker that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

6 about the music hypothetical? 

7  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do 

9 you think your test comes out on that? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I think it comes out, most 

11 likely, against concluding that the person is a 

12 supervisor. And the reason is that, under the EEOC 

13 enforcement guidance, that accounts for situations in 

14 which the authority is exercised over a limited field, a 

limited number of tasks or assignments. And this is at 

16 page 92(a) of the petition appendix. 

17  And I think that would qualify under that 

18 provision because it's limited. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- it doesn't 

really have to do with the number of tasks. It isn't an 

21 assignment of tasks. It's something that clearly 

22 affects the daily activities of the employee in a way 

23 that could be used to implement or facilitate 

24 harassment. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: It could, Your Honor. I

1 don't disagree with that, and I don't disagree that 

2 there are going to be cases that raise issues at the 

3 margins. 

4  But one way to think about the spectrum of 

options available to the Court today is to envision that 

6 on one end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a 

7 coworker, and you consider the types of harassment that 

8 that might entail. And on the other end, you have 

9 harassment that's perpetrated by a supervisor with 

authority over tangible employment actions. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and your 

12 tests sort of use that, just as you've posed it, as some 

13 broad continuum in which we're going to have countless 

14 cases trying to figure out whether music falls closer to 

this end or -- you know, what -- the senior employee 

16 controls the thermostat, is that closer to this end or 

17 that end? Or cutting onions? 

18  It seems to me that every single case has 

19 its own peculiar facts, and courts are going to be --

have to figure out where on the continuum it resides. 

21  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well -- well, I guess, Your 

22 Honor, as Your Honor put it to -- to Petitioner's 

23 counsel, the competing approach would be the approach 

24 adopted by the Seventh Circuit; but, that approach has 

some serious flaws.

1  For example, it wouldn't cover the 

2 supervisor's conduct that was at issue in Faragher 

3 itself, where the supervisor threatened that he would 

4 make the harassment victim clean the toilets for a year 

if she didn't succumb to the harassment. And I think 

6 that's a pretty significant cost. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't cleaning the 

8 toilets a limited -- isn't the authority to decide who 

9 cleans the toilets the same as the authority to decide 

what the music is going to be? It's one thing. 

11  I thought -- and your answer on the music 

12 was, well, that probably wouldn't count because it's the 

13 authority to decide just one thing. 

14  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we don't -- I guess, 

we don't know enough about the threat to force her to 

16 clean the toilets for a year to know whether it's only 

17 one thing. But it could be, for example, that if 

18 there -- in the scope of a particular day, you have 

19 three particular options as to what you might do, 

monitor the beach, clean the facilities, including the 

21 toilets, or prepare meals, then it's something that 

22 covers the entire day. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: But your argument is if the 

24 only authority was to decide who cleans the toilets, 

then -- then that would not -- that wouldn't count,

1 because that's just one thing. 

2  MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I think that -- I don't 

3 think we have an answer to that until we know how much 

4 of the day's work is encompassed by cleaning the 

toilets. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Faragher it 

7 was that -- that the lifeguard gave her her daily work 

8 assignments. He controlled what she would do on the 

9 job. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: He -- he controlled every 

11 aspect of her -- of her day's work, and cleaning the 

12 toilets was one aspect of it. So that was a 

13 particularly poignant example that he visited on her as 

14 a way to perpetuate the harassment. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that can't possibly be 

16 what the case means. Suppose that it's -- it's the 

17 assignment of offices, and all of the offices except one 

18 have heating and air conditioning, but one has no 

19 heating and no air conditioning. 

And so -- and that's the only authority that 

21 this person has is to assign desks. That person says, 

22 if you don't do whatever it is that I want you to do, 

23 I'm putting you in the office where there's no heating, 

24 and there's no air conditioning. And you would say that 

doesn't count because it's just one thing. It's not a

3 authority over daily work activities. And I guess 

4 that's what the EEOC guidance authorities --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you --

6  MR. SRINIVASAN: We haven't encountered it 

7 in real cases. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you've looked this 

9 up. And apparently, for about a dozen years, the EEOC 

has had, as -- as an alternative basis for qualifying as 

11 a supervisor, the individual has authority to direct the 

12 employee's daily work activities. 

13  And in addition, we have three circuits that 

14 for some period of years have been following roughly the 

same kind of rule. 

16  Now, has this problem of the country music 

17 or the other problems raised, have they turned out to be 

18 a significant problem in those circuits or for the EEOC? 

19  MR. SRINIVASAN: They haven't, 

Justice Breyer.

4  Do you have any idea how this works on the 

ground when people complain about the exercise of 

6 authority by a coworker who has specific 

7 responsibilities that might be reviewed as supervisory? 

8  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they haven't -- I 

9 guess that's two components to the answer, 

Mr. Chief Justice -- they haven't generated reported or 

11 underreported decisions, as far as we've seen. And this 

12 is not scientific, and it's just based on our 

13 conversations with the EEOC lawyers who are charged with 

14 dealing with right to sue letters and the like. They 

haven't encountered these sorts of situations. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The EEOC lawyers

1  MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. In our 


2 conversations with them about the way in which these 


3 issues arise --


4  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, we can ask the 


other side the same question. They've seen the cases in 

6 the circuits. Have they seen instances in the EEOC or 

7 before the circuits where it's turned out to be a 

8 serious problem, like the country music or any of the 

9 other hypotheticals raised? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: And I don't think it has, 

11 Justice Breyer. 

12  And I think it's important to bear in mind 

13 that the nature of this inquiry is such that there's 

14 going to be cases at the margins that raise difficult 

questions; but, in Ellerth, the Court recognized that. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I ask you how the 

17 Seventh Circuit test works in operation? 

18  We're in a university setting here, so let 

19 me give you a university hypo. There's a professor, and 

the professor has a secretary. And the professor 

21 subjects that secretary to living hell, complete hostile 

22 work environment on the basis of sex, all right? But 

23 the professor has absolutely no authority to fire the 

24 secretary. What would the Seventh Circuit say about 

that situation?

1  MR. SRINIVASAN: That if there's no 


2 authority over -- to -- to direct annual 


3 employment actions, then --


4  JUSTICE KAGAN: No, no, the secretary is 


fired by the head of secretarial services. Professors 

6 don't have the ability to fire secretaries; but, 

7 professors do have the ability to make secretarial lives 

8 living hells. So what does the Seventh Circuit say 

9 about that? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: The professor would not 

11 qualify as a supervisor for purposes of Ellerth-Faragher 

12 framework. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Under the Seventh Circuit 

14 test. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: And so you'd look at it as 

16 a -- you'd look at the professor as a coworker, and 

17 you'd apply the same standards that applied to 

18 harassment conducted by the coworker. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though, of course, it's 

actually more difficult for the secretary to complain 

21 about the professor than it would be for the secretary 

22 to complain about the head of secretarial services. 

23  MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And I think that's a 

24 useful frame of reference that I was trying to 

articulate earlier, which is that we can envision the

1 cases as falling on a spectrum between ability to 

2 complain when the harassment is perpetrated by a 

3 coworker on the one hand, and ability to complain when 

4 harassment is perpetrated by a supervisor with tangible 

employment authority --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: And Mr. Srinivasan, if I can 

7 just continue on about this, because I just don't even 

8 understand the Seventh Circuit test. Would the Seventh 

9 Circuit test also say that -- that that person is not a 

supervisor even if the professor evaluates the secretary 

11 on a yearly basis? 

12  MR. SRINIVASAN: The Seventh Circuit would 

13 say that as far as we can tell. They don't appear to 

14 have a proviso for circumstances in which the harasser 

has a role in determining tangible employment actions, 

16 because that is one thing that the EEOC guidance takes 

17 account of. 

18  It's that -- not just that somebody counts 

19 as a supervisor when they themselves undertake tangible 

employment action, but if they have a substantial role 

21 in making recommendations that in turn trigger tangible 

22 employment actions, the EEOC would take the position 

23 that that qualifies. Now, that's not an issue in this 

24 case, but that's --

1 talked several times about this going along the 

2 spectrum. Where -- where are we supposed to cut off 

3 the -- where's the cutting line in the spectrum? 

4  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think that the --

control over daily work activities is where we would 

6 draw the line. And that's what has come up the most in 

7 the cases. The reported decisions have conflicts on --

8 have a conflict on that issue, and that is where the 

9 EEOC guidance draws the line. 

Now, I think it would be helpful, if the 

11 Court were going to issue an opinion that adopts that 

12 line, to elaborate on -- on that line a little bit in 

13 the following sense: That relaying instructions that 

14 are -- that are disseminated by one person wouldn't 

count for those purposes. That's in the EEOC guidance. 

16 And -- and it's the functions of a job that actually 

17 matter, not the job title. That is also in the EEOC 

18 guidance. 

19  So I think there are some aspects of the 

EEOC guidance that elaborate on that line about control 

21 over daily activities that I think I would commend to 

22 the Court, that it might well --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do -- do we have a

4 don't, that the Seventh Circuit test didn't permit them 

to develop the record sufficiently to clarify all of 

6 these issues. We certainly have snippets or -- or lack 

7 snippets, as the case may be. But is the record 

8 sufficiently developed for the Court to even 

9 pronounce -- make pronouncements of that nature? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I think -- I think the real 

11 question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the parties had 

12 a sufficient opportunity to develop the record. Because 

13 if you take the record in the case as a given, we think 

14 that the record would support the grant of summary 

judgment for Ball State University, because there isn't 

16 a sufficient showing in the record if you take it as a 

17 given that the relevant supervisory -- the relevant 

18 putative supervisory employee, Davis, had control over 

19 day-to-day work activities. 

The question that remains is whether the 

21 record should be allowed to be expanded. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: The conclusion in your brief 

23 is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be 

24 vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, 

and now -- now you are telling us that we should -- we

1 should basically write an opinion on summary judgment. 

2  MR. SRINIVASAN: No. I think if you take 

3 the record as a given, that a grant of summary judgment 

4 in favor of the employer would be in order. But in the 

normal course what this Court does when it announces a 

6 new standard is it remands for the lower courts to deal 

7 with the application of the standard to the facts. And 

8 the conclusion in our brief is just, I think, a 

9 parroting of that normal conclusion.

16  The judgment of the court of appeals should 

17 be affirmed because the record establishes that the only 

18 employees whose status is at issue lacked the 

19 supervisory authority necessary to trigger vicarious 

liability under Title VII. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: We took this case to decide 

22 whether the Faragher and Ellerth -- and Ellerth 

23 supervisory liability rule is limited to those harassers 

24 who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, 

transfer, or discipline their victim. And your answer

1 to that is no; is that right? 

2  MR. GARRE: That's right. We don't think 

3 the Seventh Circuit test is the complete answer to the 

4 question of who may qualify as a supervisor. But we 

think it's clear that the -- the person whose status is 

6 at issue did not qualify and therefore, the judgment 

7 should be affirmed. This Court --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Well, if we --

9 if we agree with that without having any party defending 

the rule that was adopted by three circuits, then 

11 surely -- well, then, why shouldn't we just remand this 

12 case for the lower courts to decide this, this summary 

13 judgment issue, and -- and permit further development of 

14 the record if the record isn't fully developed? 

MR. GARRE: Well, most importantly, Justice 

16 Alito, because the courts need guidance on how to apply 

17 the EEOC and the Second Circuit standard. The best way 

18 to provide that guidance is to do what this Court often 

19 does, which is to apply the facts to the standard. 

In this case, applying the record facts to 

21 the standard that we think applies, the "materially 

22 enables the harassment" standard, it's clear that Ms. 

23 Davis, the person who is at issue, does not qualify as a 

24 supervisor. And the reason why it's clear is the record 

is uncontradicted that either the chef or Mr. Kimes made 

33

1 the daily assignments through the prep sheets. The prep 

2 sheets are what every employee in the kitchen got each 

3 day and they would tell you: Dice vegetables for 60 

4 people; prepare boxed lunches for 20; prepare six 

vegetable trays. 

6  That's -- that was their daily assignments, 

7 and the record is absolutely clear, JA 2 – 277 to 278, JA 

8 424 -- that all the employees got the prep sheets from 

9 the chef or Mr. Kimes. 

It's also absolutely clear that Mr. Kimes 

11 was the one who controlled the schedule in the kitchen. 

12 He is the one that told employees what times of days 

13 that they could work. He controlled the schedule. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: I understand Mr. Ortiz to 

say that there's at least a dispute of fact about 

16 whether Davis could have controlled what Petitioner did 

17 on a daily basis. 

18  MR. GARRE: There is -- there is neither a 

19 material nor genuine dispute on that, Your Honor. It at 

the very --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't her job description 

22 say that she can assign tasks in the kitchen?

24 clause that follows, which is critical, which is "via 

demonstration, coaching, or overseeing to ensure

1 efficiency." That is on page Joint Appendix 13. And 

2 that job description has to be read in light of the 

3 record that makes crystal clear that it was the chef who 

4 did the daily assignments for the prep sheets. 

And there -- and there are examples of the 

6 prep sheets as an exhibit to Ms. Fultz's affidavit, the 

7 affidavits at 424 of the Joint Appendix. The -- the 

8 exhibits are LLL and JJJ --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't take this case

that. So there is nobody here defending the Seventh 

16 Circuit.

18 briefing defending the Seventh Circuit. The Chamber of 

19 Commerce and other amici have defended it. We certainly 

think that it -- that -- that it's a superior --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: They are not talking to us 

22 here, are they? 

23  MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. We think it's a

think that ultimately this Court's precedents compel

1 that the Court reject that. And I think most -- most 

2 squarely we look at the Faragher decision. We look at 

3 lifeguard Silverman in Faragher, who had the authority 

4 to control all aspects of the victim's schedule and 

daily activities in a virtually unchecked manner. 

6  So if the Court is looking for an example 

7 that it wants to point to of someone who could qualify 

8 under the non-Seventh Circuit category, we think that 

9 lifeguard Silverman, from this Court's precedents, would 

be the example that this Court would hold out. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- that question 

12 wasn't presented. It was -- it was just assumed that --

13 that Silverman would qualify as a -- as a supervisor. 

14  MR. GARRE: That -- that's absolutely right, 

Justice Ginsburg. And I think, for some of the reasons 

16 that Justice Kagan brought up in her colloquy with --

17 with Mr. Srinivasan, I think the logic of the Court's 

18 precedents, agency principles adopted, would lead to the 

19 conclusion that someone who does control virtually all 

aspects of one's schedule but yet lacks the authority to 

21 hire, fire, or demote, nevertheless still would be 

22 qualified as someone who --

1 cases that fall outside the rule that look like a harsh 

2 result. Now, here it simply affects the nature. It 

3 doesn't give any immunity for harassment, it just 

4 affects the nature of the showing that might be made. 

You have no difficulty, as representing an 

6 employer, by saying that in every case an allegation of 

7 this sort is made you have to go through a case-by-case 

8 description of the particular responsibilities, whether 

9 it's the thermostat, whether it's the music, whether 

it's the assignment of everything -- that the employee 

11 does, and decide on that basis whether or not you should 

12 compensate the victim, or -- or whether or not you 

13 should go to court? 

14  MR. GARRE: We do have great difficulty, 

Your Honor. First of all, if we are wrong about what 

16 this Court's precedents compel, then this Court should 

17 adopt the Seventh Circuit principle, and we've -- we've 

18 said that in our brief, if we're wrong in our 

19 understanding of the Court's precedents. 

Secondly, we think that the -- the Court can 

21 and should establish meaningful limits on what this 

22 broader category of supervisors would require, and I 

23 think the case law illustrates that. If you look at the 

24 leading circuits who apply the standard --

would have resolved in your favor. 

6  MR. GARRE: Well, I -- I would take issue 

7 with that. We -- we tried to provide guideposts that 

8 would be helpful. But if you look at, for example, the 

9 principle that the EEOC agrees with, which -- which is 

just that limited or marginal occasion authority to lead 

11 or oversee by virtue of a paper title, its grade, or 

12 seniority is not sufficient. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do 

14 with agency? That's what I don't understand. Why --

why do any of these tests have to do with agency? 

16  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I can understand 

18 Congress writing a statute that says -- you know, any --

19 any person given -- given authority by the employer, 

which authority is used to make it more difficult for a 

21 person to complain about racial or sexual harassment, is 

22 bad. But the statute doesn't say that. It says apply 

23 agency principles.

1  MR. GARRE: What this Court said in Faragher 

2 and Ellerth -- and I appreciate that you dissented in 

3 the case, but what this Court said was it adopted 

4 Section 219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, 

the notion that if -- if there was -- if the employee 

6 was aided in the accomplishment of the harassment by 

7 virtue of an agency relation, that that would be the 

8 agency trigger for liability. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Then why not leave it 

there? If that's what the agency is --

11  MR. GARRE: And RMA then --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- then you don't need it 

13 at all. So the music -- the music would -- the 

14 thermostat would qualify. It would all qualify. 

MR. GARRE: I don't think it would, Your 

16 Honor, because we agree, certainly, with the EEOC that 

17 there are material limits to how far that principle 

18 could be stretched. 

19  The Court in Ellerth made clear that there 

were limits to the vicarious liability of employers in 

21 this context. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why? I mean, if 

23 that's your principle, apply the principle. 

24  MR. GARRE: Well, for the very --

1 know, you're going to work in a cold room unless you --

2 you know, comply with my sexual advances, apply the 

3 principle. What's so hard about that? That's a clear 

4 line. 

MR. GARRE: This is the balance I think that 

6 the Court struck in Ellerth, Your Honor, which was -- it 

7 took into account that the statute was passed against 

8 the backdrop of agency principles; but, yet, Congress 

9 also was cognizant that imposing vicarious liability on 

the employer for acts that the Court recognized were not 

11 themselves authorized by the employer, that that was a 

12 punitive aspect of that, and the Court would establish 

13 limits. 

14  And I think our position takes into account 

that there have to be limits in this area, on the extent 

16 of vicarious liability, in order to give effect to 

17 Congress's intent; but, also recognizes, in the 

18 situation like you had with the lifeguard in Faragher, 

19 that that person did have authority that would assist in 

the harassment – date me or clean the toilets, as 

21 the lifeguard in Faragher said. 

22  And so the Court, I think, struck a 

23 reasonable balance. And taking the balance and what 

24 this Court said, we think the proper way to resolve this 

case is to adopt something like the EEOC rule or the

1 Second Circuit rule, but to make clear there are limits. 

2 And the best way to make clear that there are limits is 

3 to make clear that on the record in this case Ms. Davis 

4 did not qualify as a supervisor. 

Now, my friend said they didn't have the 

6 opportunity to develop evidence to the contrary; but, 

7 the fact is, from the outset, they litigated this case 

8 as if the Seventh Circuit standard did not apply. 

9  The reasons that they gave for why Ms. Davis 

was a supervisor, in the lower court, was that, one, 

11 they pointed to the job description, that she had this 

12 other authority to "lead and direct," and they also 

13 pointed to the fact that she didn't clock in. 

14  Those are irrelevant under the Seventh 

Circuit test. So all along, they had in their mind that 

16 they wanted to try to show that Davis was different, and 

17 it did have some marginal authority to lead --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: What guidance would your --

19 what guidance would the kind of opinion that you're 

suggesting we write really provide? The -- the guidance 

21 would be that if someone has no authority to assign 

22 daily work, then that person isn't -- and also has no 

23 authority to hire, fire, promote, et cetera, then that 

24 person isn't a supervisor. 

How much guidance is that?

Official 

1  MR. GARRE: I think it's a lot of guidance, 

2 Justice Alito. I think that the flip side of that is 

3 the Court would make clear that merely having some 

4 occasional or marginal authority to lead or direct by 

virtue of one's better paper title or seniority is not 

6 sufficient to trigger vicarious liability. I think 

7 that's going to resolve the mine-run of the cases in 

8 which this question has come up and been litigated, at 

9 least to the courts of appeals. 

If you look, for example, at the difference 

11 between something like the Mack case out of the Second 

12 Circuit and the Mikels case out of the Fourth Circuit, 

13 in Mikels, we had an example of two police officers, one 

14 had a higher paper rank, corporal versus private, and it 

was alleged that the corporal was a supervisor. And the 

16 court said, no, no, no, he's not a supervisor, all there 

17 is, is some marginal occasional authority. That's not 

18 sufficient. 

19  It was clear that the victim in that case 

wasn't shy about telling the harasser where to go, to 

21 tell him off. And that's the kind of --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should that --

23 why should that matter? I know you said that in your 

24 brief, Mr. Garre, if the -- if the alleged victim talked 

back.

1  But in one of the very first cases that we 

2 had in this line, Harris v. Forklift, there was -- it 

3 was the boss, so there was no question about supervisor, 

4 and he was really making things hard for this employee; 

but, she was very firm, and she talked back to him. 

6  But, still, that's not what we said that 

7 counted. We said, is she being subjected to terms and 

8 conditions of employment that she would not be subjected 

9 to but for her sex. 

MR. GARRE: Right. And we -- we don't think 

11 that that's a dispositive criterion. We recognize the 

12 point that the person gets to establish superior ability 

13 to stand up to despicable treatment. But I think what 

14 our point is, is that it's part of the equation that you 

would look at. 

16  In essence, did the person treat the alleged 

17 harasser like a co-employee, or did the person treat the 

18 alleged harasser like a supervisor? And in this case, 

19 the record is clear that she treated her like a 

co-employee, someone who -- they obviously had 

21 disagreements among them. 

22  And I think that's what we take this piece 

23 of evidence to assist the Court on the question 

24 presented. I think -- but we think what was sufficient 

to resolve the question presented is the clear and

1 unrefuted evidence that the prep sheets, the daily 

2 activities were assigned by the chef or Mr. Kimes, that 

3 Mr. Kimes had the authority to control the schedule. 

4  And if you want to go further than that, the 

record also shows that Mr. Kimes had the authority to 

6 review -- to do annual reviews. Mr. Kimes had the 

7 authority to evaluate. He had all the kind of authority 

8 that one would expect in a supervisor. 

9  And so you would ask the question, what's 

left? Essentially nothing. And whatever is left, we 

11 agree with the EEOC, is not, as a matter of law, 

12 sufficient to trigger vicarious liability. 

13  That doesn't mean she can't present her 

14 claim. It -- it means that it's just simply analyzed 

under the framework for co-workers, in which she bears 

16 the burden of establishing that the employer was 

17 negligent in not responding to it. 

18  And as Judge Wood, for the court of appeals, 

19 and Judge Barker made clear in their detailed opinions, 

this was not a situation where the employer stuck its 

21 head in the sand and ignored incidents of unpleasantries 

22 or, in some cases, despicable racial epithets --

23  JUSTICE ALITO: If you were willing to 

24 concede that this would be a close case under the Second 

Circuit standard or under the EEOC guidance, then there

1 might be an argument in favor of our applying those 

2 tests -- or one of those tests to the facts of the case, 

3 because then that might provide some guidance, even 

4 though we are supposed to be a court of review, not a 

court of first view. 

6  But you're saying this is an extremely weak 

7 case under those standards; and, therefore, what is --

8 what benefit is there in our applying this? Just send 

9 it back and have it done in the normal course by the 

court of appeals or by the district court. 

11  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, we don't think 

12 it's a close case, but my friend does, and his amici do. 

13 And I think the damaging signal that this Court would 

14 send by remanding on this record would be that, whatever 

it might say in its opinion, that would have virtually 

16 no force in terms of establishing a standard that made 

17 clear that this -- whatever else may be true about what 

18 would qualify, something like this does not qualify. 

19  And, again, like this Court did in the 

Global Tech case, when the Court establishes a standard, 

21 oftentimes, it applies the standard to the facts and 

22 appreciates that that's the best way, the most judicial 

23 way of providing guidance on what that standard means. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre, there is one 

BSU internal document that -- a note to the file by a

Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 compliance officer, who apparently investigated one of 

2 the complaints, that says that -- Kimes is recorded as 

3 saying -- he's the avowed supervisor -- that he, quote, 

4 "knows Davis has given direction to Vance, and that he 

just doesn't know what else to do." 

6  Doesn't that defeat summary judgment on its 

7 face? 

8  MR. GARRE: It doesn't, Your Honor, if you 

9 agree with our principle, that the EEOC also agrees 

with, that having some limited or marginal authority to 

11 lead or direct, as a matter of law, is not sufficient. 

12  So that that piece of evidence, giving it its 

13 reasonable inference, would not be sufficient to create 

14 a material issue. It also wouldn't be sufficient 

creating -- looking at the body of the evidence, which 

16 makes crystal clear that the prep sheets are really what 

17 was driving the daily activities in this workplace. And 

18 it was Kimes or the chef that did the prep sheets, not 

19 Ms. Davis at all. 

And it -- and it was also not material in 

21 light of the evidence that Mr. Kimes did the schedule. 

22  Ms. Davis was asked at her deposition on 

23 page 135, quote, "Was there ever" -- "have you ever been 

24 assigned to a less meaningful or fulfilling job 

classification?" And her response was yes, and she

Official 

1 pointed to an example by Mr. Kimes, because it was 

2 Mr. Kimes who had the authority to make those 

3 assignments, not Ms. Davis. 

4  So the mere fact that you've got some 

marginal evidence drawn from snippets, giving it a 

6 reasonable inference that she at times had some ability 

7 to lead or direct, as the job description says, "by 

8 coaching, demonstration or overseeing," is not 

9 sufficient as a matter of law to entitle her to summary 

judgment, nor do we think that this Court should take 

11 the unusual step of remanding so that she can dig into 

12 events six years old through new discovery. 

13  Again --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Garre, could I ask you 

about that? You said before that there is no -- nothing 

16 to suggest that she left anything on the table because 

17 of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard. 

18  So what's the best place in the record for 

19 us to look -- to decide that question as to whether she 

at all didn't present or didn't develop evidence because 

21 of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard? 

22  MR. GARRE: Well, first, I would look at her 

23 summary judgment briefs, Your Honor, and in those briefs 

24 she argued that Davis was a supervisor because, one, 

under the job description she had the authority to lead

1 and direct, the same sorts of things that we are talking 

2 now and would be talking about under the EEOC and Second 

3 Circuit tests. And, two, she points to the fact that 

4 they didn't clock in, again something that is irrelevant 

under the Seventh Circuit test. 

6  So this wasn't a case where the litigant 

7 felt themselves bound by the legal standard and one 

8 could surmise that they would have pursued it 

9 differently. I think I would look at that first. And 

then I would look at her deposition transcript which is 

11 in the Joint Appendix and the three affidavits that she 

12 put in, in this case, which are in the Joint Appendix. 

13  At some point you would expect her to come 

14 along and try to rebut the notion that Mr. Kimes and 

Ms. Fultz assigned the daily activities through the prep 

16 sheets. In fact, it's just the contrary. If anything, 

17 in her own affidavit she seems to accept that the prep 

18 sheets were done by Kimes and the chef. That's at JA 

19 430. You -- you would expect her to contest the notion 

that Mr. Kimes was the one who did the scheduling, who 

21 did her annual reviews, who disciplined her on occasion. 

22 After all, she was claiming that Davis was the 

23 supervisor, and she didn't feel bound by the Seventh 

24 Circuit tests. 

So you would expect to see some indication

1 of how Ms. Davis actually assigned her something to do, 

2 changed her schedule, the like. Instead what you find 

3 is all those sorts of allegations, she made them, but 

4 all those sorts of allegations were directed to Mr. 

Kimes. That was the basis for her retaliation claim, 

6 which isn't before the Court. But there are all the 

7 sorts of things that you might expect one to complain 

8 about against a supervisor in this sort of vein: She 

9 made me cut vegetables instead of doing the baking like 

I like to do; she didn't assign me enough overtime so I 

11 could make more money; she changed my hours. 

12  Those allegations were made. They were directed 

13 at Mr. Kimes and that's perfectly consistent with the 

14 record evidence. There was Kimes and the chef who had 

the authority to do her daily activities, and Kimes had 

16 the authority to do the schedule. 

17  It's not enough for her to come here today, 

18 I don't think, and just speculate that having an 

19 opportunity to go through greater discovery, which in 

essence would amount to a fishing expedition, the Court 

21 should take the unusual step of remanding to give her an 

22 opportunity for discovery. This Court -- although we 

23 acknowledge oftentimes this Court does remand for the 

24 lower courts to undertake that inquiry, it certainly 

doesn't always do so. So Global-Tech is one example;

1 we've cited many more in our briefs. 

2  And here, I think, again, the parties --

3 there is broad agreement on what the standard should be. 

4 Something like the EEOC or Second Circuit test is, we 

think, the best way to frame it. But given the debate 

6 among the parties about what that test means and how it 

7 applies to Davis here, I think it's absolutely critical 

8 for the Court to apply the legal test to the record 

9 facts and hold that Ms. Davis is not a supervisor and to 

affirm the judgment below. 

11  Although it's not before this Court, if one 

12 wants to go to the next step and think about the 

13 affirmative defenses and the like, this isn't a case 

14 where the Court would be putting to rest a valid Title 

VII claim. 

16  But the claim was extensively looked at 

17 below by Judge Barker in the district court, Judge Wood 

18 and her colleagues on the court of appeal, and they 

19 found an environment in which Ball State reacted 

responsibly to the allegations that were made, 

21 investigated them and took prompt action where the 

22 investigation warranted it, particularly with respect to 

23 the most despicable things that were uncovered, racial 

24 epithets that were used by another employee, 

Ms. McVicker, not Ms. Davis.

1  The only allegations against Ms. Davis that 

2 we think are relevant here during the time period that 

3 Ms. Davis was a part-time employee were: One, the 

4 so-called elevator incident where Ms. Davis allegedly 

blocked Ms. Vance as she got out of the elevator, which 

6 isn't race-based at all, we don't think; and two, the 

7 alleged use of words like "Sambo" or 

8 "Buckwheat" to refer --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz said it wasn't 

just part-time. He called my attention to the page 

11 before that says she also -- that Davis also directed --

12  MR. GARRE: Well, we disagree with that, 

13 Your Honor. If you look on page JA 12, the job 

14 description position function, the last sentence says, 

"Requires leadership of up to 20 part-time substitute 

16 and student employees." So we think it's clear. 

17  We said -- this is in our red brief and 

18 there wasn't any response to it in the yellow brief --

19 that any authority, any conceivable supervisory 

authority, could have only existed when Ms. Vance was a 

21 part-time employee. 

22  But we don't think that that's relevant, 

23 Your Honor, because putting -- putting aside whether she 

24 had authority over catering assistants who were part 

time or full time, the record is absolutely clear that

1 Ms. Davis just lacked the authority that would have been 

2 sufficient to trigger vicarious liability. And again we 

3 think the paradigm case where that authority is present 

4 is something like the lifeguard in Silverman where they 

control all aspects of the daily activities, one's 

6 schedule, one's daily work assignments, and down the 

7 line. 

8  Here there is no evidence that any of that 

9 authority that was possessed, and the record makes clear 

beyond doubt that all that authority was possessed by 

11 others, Ms. -- the chef and Mr. Kimes. 

12  And I think, as the amicus brief makes 

13 clear, this is consistent with workplaces across America 

14 today, where jobs are less hierarchical, more 

collaborative, and so where you have got more senior 

16 employees by virtue of their experience or job title, 

17 just a paper title, are in a broad sense team leaders of 

18 the like in the workplace. 

19  That doesn't mean they are supervisors in 

any traditional sense, and it certainly doesn't mean 

21 they are supervisors for purposes of triggering 

22 vicarious liability under Title VII. 

23  So for those reasons, we would urge this 

24 Court to affirm the judgment below, to make clear in 

order to provide the needed guidance to the courts of

11  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

13  MR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Your Honor. 

14  The Seventh Circuit rule is not one that can 

be justified in terms of its superior judicial 

16 manageability, administrability, despite producing a few 

17 odd results. 

18  As Justice Kagan's question revealed, it 

19 produces truly perverse results. Someone who can tell 

you what to do in your job day-to-day, manage you during 

21 the whole job period, what kind of tasks you have to do, 

22 was not necessarily considered a supervisor, while the 

23 person upstairs in human resources that you may never 

24 see or even know would be considered your supervisor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you adopted that

1 rule I suppose you could couple it with an increased 

2 duty of care on the part of the employer to take 

3 necessary steps to prevent forbidden harassment. In 

4 other words, you up the duty of care on the part of the 

employer generally. 

6  MR. ORTIZ: Well, Justice Kennedy, that in 

7 fact is one thing the Seventh Circuit has tried to do, 

8 but it dispels any kind of certainty and predictability 

9 in the rule, because the duty of care of course would be 

determined by a jury only after hearing a particular 

11 case. 

12  Second, my friend tries to get out from 

13 under the clear import of the job description here by 

14 saying directing and leading somehow don't count because 

that is accomplished through oversight. Oversight, 

16 however, is a common synonym for supervision itself. 

17 It's merely a dog chasing its own tail. 

18  Third, it's no surprise that many of the 

19 things that Ms. Vance referred to, the particular 

instance she referred to went back to William Kimes. Of 

21 course, is that related to the retaliation part of her 

22 claim, which is not before this Court. 

23  Also, Your Honor, Faragher in the end is not 

24 a toilet cleaning case. The district court did not 

find -- made no finding on that. The court of appeals 

54

1 didn't mention it. This Court in its Faragher opinion 

2 mentioned only that it was an allegation in the 

3 complaint. 

4  It is not clear -- the allegation of the 

complainant was that he said that, not that Silverman 

6 actually had that authority. And it was clear from the 

7 case that he actually wasn't interested in even dating 

8 Faragher, it was just a way of humiliating her in the 

9 workplace. So just as Faragher's expressed, it was not 

clear that was even something that Silverman had 

11 authority to do. 

12  And finally, if this Court is worried about 

13 sending signals, think about what kind of signal it will 

14 be sending to litigants in the future if it were to 

affirm, simply affirm here. In the future, whenever 

16 anyone is thinking that they may want to challenge a 

17 rule, no matter how well-settled it is in a particular 

18 circuit, they would have an incentive to, through 

19 discovery, to produce information that might be relevant 

to any future twist. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there any? You 

22 said he went through, you weren't preceding on the --

23 your client, originally in district court, not preceding 

24 on the basis of this straight Seventh Circuit test. He
