 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-1107, the Hertz Corporation v. 

Friend.

 Mr. Srinivasan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRINIVASAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The diversity statute deems a corporation a 

citizen of, quote, "the State where it has its principal 

place of business," closed quote. The Ninth Circuit 

erred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of 

California, even though Hertz is headquartered in New 

Jersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations 

outside the State of California, and even though, under 

the court's approach, national corporations could 

regularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct 

operations in that State that are proportional to the 

State's population.

 The better reading of the statute, in our 

view, is that it points to the location of the 

corporation's headquarters, the site from which a 

corporation directs and controls all the company's

operations throughout all of its locations. And that is 

particularly the correct reading when the statutory 

language is considered in light of two considerations.

 First, the strong preference for simplicity 

and ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and 

second, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve 

diversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and 

to deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one 

State, the State where the corporation had its home or 

principal place of business.

 Now, with respect to the ordinary meaning of 

the statutory text, the critical phrase is "principal 

place of business." And dictionary definitions of that 

term define the term "principal place of business" as 

corporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal 

and State laws, which also define the term as "company's 

headquarters" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem 

with every test is that you can find an exception that 

makes the application ridiculous.

 Let's assume that we accept that 

headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability 

to a corporation that has a business in a variety of 

different States.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That's --

your situation is perhaps the most attractive --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because whether 

California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, 

to me the differences are not terribly substantial. I 

can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of 

the world, and how do you choose then? California would 

say, then you -- you go back to headquarters. But I 

don't know why you start there.

 But let's posit the simpler situation. 

Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in 

California. Your test would ignore completely that --

and it depends on how you define "headquarters." If 

they have three corporate executives, that's the entire 

extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who 

started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he 

flies out to California half the time and runs the 

business from there but happens to live in New Jersey. 

Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey, 

correct?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Your Honor. But 

let me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's 

premise, that in the situation of a multistate 

corporation with -- with diverse operations, the

principal place of business would be the headquarters.

 Now, I take your point that there are 

situations in which the test may not seem so 

straightforward, but we think even in the -- the 

hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better 

answer -- at least our first submission would be, the 

better answer is the headquarters would control. And 

that's for a couple of reasons.

 Although, again, the one exception that we 

would have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's 

hypothetical, and let me just bracket that. Now, the 

reason we think, first and foremost --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have not 

articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle 

in which to set that exception. It has to be tied 

somehow to the test and why the test in some situations 

would have applicability and others may not.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And let me -- let 

me --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because I don't know the 

difference between one headquarters and two places to do 

business or three, but I can still see that some 

factoring has to be done when the places of business are 

more limited.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- well, we think

first and foremost that the headquarters' role would 

apply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to 

that to the exception -- fashioning the exception in 

just one second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your case doesn't 

call for that judgment, because you have a multistate 

corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied 

with saying that when a corporation has dispersed 

operations, it doesn't have its business center or its 

headquarters -- doesn't have its business center 

dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you 

take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick 

among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't 

worth the labor to try to do that.

 So you could have a rule that says, 

dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters. 

And that -- you don't have to urge anything further.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely, Justice 

Ginsburg. And we would certainly accept the resolution 

of the case in -- in that light.

 If the Court were to announce a rule that 

says, multistate corporations with diverse operations, 

the principal place of business in that situation is the 

headquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that 

certainly we would prevail under that and that would be

entirely acceptable to us. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would we say 

that? Just because it wins your case and it solves your 

problem? I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you 

abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is 

that "place" doesn't mean "State."

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the whole 

State of California as the principal place of doing 

business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would 

have said, the principal State in which business is 

done.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's correct, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to throw 

away that good argument, do you?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SRINIVASAN: We certainly don't want to 

throw it away. We certainly don't want -- first and 

foremost, we would like to prevail. And I think even 

under the narrow approach --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would never get to 

California's thing about State. If you say multistate, 

you pick the place. The headquarters is the place, it's 

within a State.

MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And -- and that's why 

we would accept that result, Justice Ginsburg. We 

certainly would. Let me just put that out there first 

and foremost.

 Now, with respect to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you done with 

your -- were you done with your answer to Justice 

Sotomayor's hypothetical?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that I, in 

fact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice --

(Laughter.)

 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- with respect.

 The answer is that even in that situation, 

for the reasons that Justice Scalia highlights, we would 

say that the headquarters controls. And let me give two 

-- two principal reasons why.

 The first is that even if the operations are 

in one State and the headquarters are in a different 

State, the headquarters still is where the direction and 

control comes from. And I think the ordinary meaning of 

the phrase "principal place of business" in that 

situation would still direct attention to the 

headquarters.

 And the dictionary definitions that we 

identified in -- in our brief and every Federal and

State law that defines the term "principal place of 

business" defines it at headquarters -- as headquarters, 

without any exception for the hypothetical situation 

that Your Honor posits. But the other --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what constitutes 

headquarters?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many executives have 

to live there? What else has to exist there? And then 

what is the default rule if those things don't exist?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Your Honor, I think 

-- and that -- that is the sort of different set of 

questions which is other ambiguities with respect to the 

definition of a headquarters in certain situations.

 Now, by and large, the headquarters is 

relatively straightforward. It's made in public filings 

which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the 

experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has 

applied the headquarters approach across the board over 

the course of several decades, I think we can see that 

that test has been straightforward and it is simple in 

application, in the main.

 Now, that is not to say that there are not 

issues about the definition of headquarters at the outer 

perimeters. There are. And I think the place I would

look first and foremost is: Where does direction and 

control for the corporation come from? That is the 

situs at which the headquarters would be found.

 And I would look also to what a corporation 

itself identifies as headquarters in public filings. In 

10-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations 

Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in 

annual reports. And of course they are doing those 

reports for other reasons other than establishing 

jurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come 

with an air of objectivity about them. That's where I 

would look.

 Now, I would make this other point, though, 

about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with 

respect to the definition of a headquarters. That --

that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our 

test, because under Respondent's test and under the test 

of every court of appeals, they take into account the 

headquarters.

 Now, we would think that that is 

dispositive. The other courts consider it at least 

highly relevant, albeit not dispositive. But whatever 

ambiguities --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why did the others all go 

through some through total, totality of the factors

test? I mean, obviously, you could pick the 

headquarters. You'd say Congress wanted one place; 

headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most 

circuits have made it more complicated than that. The 

Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it 

simple, as you urge -- headquarters.

 Why are the other circuits resistant to the 

solution that you are proposing.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, first in a situation 

with a multistate corporation with dispersed operations, 

as we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I 

think the courts of appeal are generally in agreement 

that the headquarters would control in that situation.

 Now, with respect to whether you would have 

an across-the-board headquarters rule, Justice Ginsburg, 

I think what happened is, the first court to consider 

this question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case, 

pretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958. And 

that court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the 

ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't 

wrestle with the strong premium on simple and 

administrable jurisdictional rules. And then that 

doctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I think.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- they -- they 

do it in different ways.

MR. SRINIVASAN: They do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some say business 

operations, some say headquarters.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there is a variety 

of different approaches. I think all of them share the 

common feature that they consider, essentially, a 

totality of the circumstances. And all of them, in our 

view, share a common flaw, which is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does -- how do the 

bankruptcy courts do it? I mean, you brought out that 

"principal place of business" was -- was a term that the 

bankruptcy courts had been using before the amendment of 

1332, 1958. But I -- I don't think that the -- that it 

is inevitably headquarters for the bankruptcy courts. I 

mean, there's -- sometimes it is in other places, isn't 

it?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the bankruptcy courts 

-- I think the fairest assessment of the bankruptcy 

courts as of 1958 was that it was a model.

 Now, since then, the Collier's treatise, for 

example, would tell you that the majority and 

predominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the 

bankruptcy context. Pre-1958, I think there was a 

conflict. That's what the treatises said and that's 

what we explain in our brief. But there certainly were

some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even 

in the bankruptcy context.

 But I think one thing I would caution the 

Court about is assuming that just because some courts in 

the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific 

considerations -- and a specific consideration was the 

felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate 

within the purview of the court so that the court could 

administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted 

to import every judicial application down to every 

nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the 

jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress 

thought that simplicity was a real virtue.

 And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in 

Wachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is 

no reason to assume that Congress would have taken one 

word in the venue context and applied the exact same 

meaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context. 

And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me 

-- in favor of simplicity and administrability in 

jurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant 

reason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our 

point of view, should govern in all circumstances. 

Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the case -- this is

purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be 

bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New 

Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are 

dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think, if -- if 

what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would 

the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy 

statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit 

case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit 

case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is 

that the principal place of business would be New 

Jersey.

 And one point I would like to get to in that 

regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the 

principal place of business of a company like Hertz 

would be somewhere other than New Jersey. The Ninth 

Circuit has a view that the principal place of business 

of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz 

conducts 20 percent of its business in California.

 But it is important to bear in mind that 

this statute is a zero-sum game. So that if Hertz is 

deemed to have its principal place of business in 

California, such that it is disabled from getting access 

to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence 

is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity

jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to 

one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it 

would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity 

jurisdiction in every other State.

 So the consequence would be that if Hertz 

were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New 

Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get 

Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the 

theory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a 

California company, because it performs 20 percent of 

its business in California.

 Now that -- the oddity of that, in our view, 

is particularly poignant if one takes into account a 

company like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is universally 

recognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is 

headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart 

also, it's undisputed, does substantially more business 

by any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers 

significant in Texas. It has more employees there; it 

has more stores there; it generates more revenues there, 

by a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent 

over and above any other State.

 But the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a 

Texas corporation based on the amount of business it 

does in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be

disabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in 

Texas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal 

court jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the 

theory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an 

out-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because 

of the level of business that it conducts in Texas.

 And we don't think that is the result that 

Congress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted 

the Principal Place of Business provision. Instead, 

what Congress presumably had in mind is that 

corporations, as a general matter, are identified with 

the location of their headquarters.

 So in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart 

rightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas 

corporation because of the presence in that State of its 

headquarters.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you are 

talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because 

in reading the examples in your brief, what you are 

talking about is: Where is the place where they have 

the most important, significant, influential contact?

 Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as 

the place where business is done; you are suggesting 

that it's the place where the nerve center is. But it 

goes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply

their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it 

important, influential, or significant contact. There 

has to be something more to the test, and it can't be 

just what I declare my headquarters to be. There has to 

be some form of activity in that place.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: There does, Your Honor, and 

we think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make 

is to an individual, because an individual can't declare 

that he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State 

and have it be so for citizenship purposes. There has 

to be something behind that, and so too with 

corporations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's the 

point.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly, and we -- we share 

that view. A corporation couldn't simply declare that 

its headquarters are located in a -- in a location where 

it has a mailbox, for example, and have that be 

dispositive for citizenship purposes. What --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- is there 

something to a rule that says headquarters is 

presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party, 

whoever that is, can rebut it?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think certainly it would 

be a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has.

So I would say that as a starting point, Your Honor. I 

think -- in our view, of course, a principal submission 

is the headquarters controls in all -- in all 

situations, and the cost of having, you know, a 

rebuttable presumption would be: What does it take to 

rebut it? That would be question. And I think--

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point 

that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an 

important, consequential, or substantial. You can rebut 

it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And I think in that 

situation, I guess -- I guess there is two different 

ways that one could look at that. One is to say that 

you could rebut it, but the other is to say that it is 

not the headquarters.

 And I guess that's the way that I would look 

at it, is to say that if the corporation identifies a 

location at which it in fact doesn't direct and control 

the operations of the corporation throughout, it 

wouldn't constitute the headquarters.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but --

MR. SRINIVASAN: So I guess that's where I 

would place the load-bearing weight. It may be 

semantic, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the problem,

which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary 

judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is 

my corporate headquarters. The other side's going to 

have to come forth with evidence that shows something.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And if -- and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that it's always a 

rebuttable presumption.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: There is, Your Honor, and 

if the other side were able to show that the location 

that the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does 

not, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense 

that suppose there is no executives there, or suppose 

that the officials that are there in fact don't direct 

and control the company's operations in other locations. 

Well, then, that -- that would be a real issue.

 But there are checks against that, because 

corporations identify their headquarters in other public 

filings, and in the main, those headquarters are the 

locations in -- from which the chief executives direct 

and control the companies' operations --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually do not know 

whether public filings define what "headquarters" mean. 

Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but 

what I didn't know is whether those public filings 

define the activity necessary to designate a place as

"headquarters."

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they do in 

the following sense, Your Honor. For example, with the 

10-K report for publicly traded companies, I think the 

question that is asked is not the location of the 

headquarters but the location of the principal executive 

offices. And so I think, by definition, in answering 

that question the principal executives would be located 

at that -- at that location. Now, if they weren't, we 

would certainly take Your Honor's point that there could 

be a back-and-forth about that, but that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but didn't 

Congress pick "a principal place of business"? And we 

know that they looked at the bankruptcy courts. There 

are lots of expressions in other statutes. Some say 

"headquarters." Some say -- well, there are a variety 

of things, but Congress picked this particular term, 

"principal place of business."

 And I was thinking, when you gave the 

example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are 

not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home. 

And so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so 

much in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas. Why 

shouldn't there be diversity in Texas?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, in -- in response to

the latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we 

do know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a 

corporation should be disabled from getting diversity 

jurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial 

business, because it had that proposal before it, and it 

rejected it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It rejected it, yes.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It instead chose an 

approach whereby a company is disabled from getting 

diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one, 

jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its 

principal place of business.

 And I think what Congress had in mind is 

that corporations, as a general matter, are identified 

with their headquarters. And that is why Wal-Mart, for 

example, is universally recognized as an Arkansas 

company. It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial 

business in Texas, substantially in excess of other 

States, but Wal-Mart also does substantial business in a 

variety of jurisdictions. But Congress decidedly didn't 

have the rule that says wherever Wal-Mart does a 

substantial business and is a well recognized company, 

it should be disabled from getting to Federal court. It 

limited it to one jurisdiction.

 And we think the best reading of the phrase

"principal place of business" is the situs of the 

headquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect 

to the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there 

were bankruptcy courts that did have a "headquarters" 

approach. And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of 

which I am aware that looked at the meaning of the 

ordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the 

portion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening 

brief in footnote 5. It is the First Circuit's opinion 

in the Burdick case.

 And what the First Circuit said was that a 

corporation's, quote, "principal office," rather than a 

factory, mill or mine, according to ordinary 

understanding and speech, constitutes the principal 

place of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy 

Code."

 And so even before 1958, I think there was 

definitely a sense out there that the term "principal 

place of business" does mean headquarters. And this 

gets to Your Honor's other question which is: If 

Congress really meant "headquarters," why wouldn't they 

have used the term "headquarters" instead of "principal 

place of business"?

 And I think our answer to that, with respect 

to Your Honor, is that "principal place of business" is

an alternative formulation for "headquarters." And so I 

don't think one can glean too much from the fact that 

Congress chose "principal place of business" rather than 

"headquarters" when "principal place of business" in our 

view is a reference to the headquarters.

 And this Court's opinion last term in the 

Oswell Harlow versus United States case is a good 

example of that, because there the statute that was at 

issue used the term "facilitate" rather than the term 

"aid or abet." And one could have readily made the 

argument that because the statute uses the term 

"facilitate" rather than "aid or abet," that normal 

principles that accompany aiding and abetting liability 

shouldn't apply in the statute. But the Court rightly 

in our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was 

based on the notion that the term "facilitate," 

according to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same 

thing as "aid or abet." And once you cross that bridge, 

then you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the 

term "facilitate."

 And here, likewise, the term "principal 

place of business," according to Black's Law Dictionary, 

means "headquarters." That's how Black's Law Dictionary 

defines the term. And so the fact that Congress chose 

one alternate formulation versus another, I don't think

speaks too loudly to the question of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about her argument 

that -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but 

its reservation center is in Oklahoma?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, and -- and, again, I 

would look at the public filings. In the public filings 

in the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies 

its headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey. And the 

reason is that the chief executive officials are all 

located in Park Ridge.

 Now, there is a large administrative 

apparatus in Oklahoma City, and, according to the 

affidavit, its administrative activities are performed 

in Oklahoma City to a lesser extent. And that is at 

paragraph 11 of the affidavit, which is at pages 29a to 

30a of the appendix to the petition.

 But I don't think there is any real dispute 

that Hertz's main headquarters are located in Park Ridge 

rather than Oklahoma City. In point of fact, what you 

have in Oklahoma City -- and -- and this isn't spelled 

out in the -- in the affidavit, but what you have in 

Oklahoma City is essentially the rental call center and 

plus principal back-office duties like information 

technology support. But what you have in Park Ridge is 

all of the company's chief executives. So the decision-

making locus for the company's most important decisions 

is absolutely in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rather than 

Oklahoma City. And there is no dispute on the point 

that is before the Court.

 This Court comes -- this case comes to the 

Court on the assumption that Hertz's headquarters are 

located in Park Ridge. The question for the Court is 

whether that headquarters location should be dispositive 

for purposes of defining a company's principal place of 

business.

 Now, if I could -- if I could turn for one 

moment to the cost in terms of simplicity and 

demonstrability of an alternative formulation if the 

Court were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look 

to the headquarters, we see three potential categories 

of costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed 

approach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has 

established.

 The first is the one that underlies the 

strong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable, 

jurisdictional rules. And that is just the time and 

resources that would be invested at the threshold 

jurisdictional stage in defining whether the case is --

is before the proper court. That in itself is reason 

enough, in our view --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Not all diversity suits 

have major law firms in them and a lot of resources to 

spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex 

tests.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Yes, that's 

our point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a "headquarters" 

test is simple and straightforward in that respect, and 

a "totality of circumstances" approach isn't.  But there 

is also two additional costs that I would point out 

about a "totality of circumstances" approach.

 One is that you can have the very real 

possibility because of the indeterminacy in that 

approach that different courts would reach divergent 

conclusions about the citizenship of the very same 

corporation. And as we point out on page 40 of our 

brief, that has already happened. Two district courts 

in the Ninth Circuit alone in two California courts 

reached divergent conclusions on the citizenship of 

United Airlines. One court concluded that United was an 

Illinois citizen, and another court concluded that 

United was a California citizen. And that is not 

altogether surprising that you would have those sorts of 

divergent conclusions given the open-ended nature of the 

"totality of circumstances" approach.

 The third cost that I would point to is the

possibility that because of the indeterminacy in the 

approach you could have a situation in which a district 

court finds there is jurisdiction, proceeds to have a 

trial on the merits and renders -- renders judgment on 

the merits, and then several years later the court of 

appeals would reverse the judgment because the district 

court had gotten the jurisdictional input wrong at the 

outset. And, again, that also, as with the situation 

with divergent conclusions on the citizenship of the 

same corporation, is not just a problem of theory. It 

has actually happened.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even when the 

direct -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is 

precluded after final -- final judgment after direct --

so that's nothing new. It is the same example you gave.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think -- I guess my 

point is that precisely because subject-matter 

jurisdiction can be raised at any point --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not any point in the 

direct -- up to denial of cert on direct review. After 

that it's precluded, even subject-matter jurisdiction. 

You can't collaterally attack on that basis.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, right. I guess what 

my point is that you could have a situation where a 

trial court has reached a resolution on the merits.

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

would like to reserve the balance of my time.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Thank you. Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 For 50 years every circuit save the -- save 

the Seventh had agreed -- has agreed on one overriding 

principle: That courts must perform a balancing in 

determining the principal place of business of a 

corporation, and that balancing must include a 

determination of where the corporation's people and 

property are.

description of what the Ninth Circuit did here? Did

they perform a balancing, or did they look solely to 

where most of the sales were?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: The -- the Ninth Circuit 

specifically in this case noted that 43 percent more 

employees for Hertz are in California, 75 percent more 

property, 60 percent more revenue, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: More than -- more than 

what, more than any other single State?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say the --

the "principal State of business." It's the "principal 

place of business." Is there a difference between the 

two?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: I think I have two answers 

to that, Your Honor. The first answer is that Congress 

was using a term of art that was imported from the 

Bankruptcy Code.

 In all of the Bankruptcy Code cases prior to 

1958, the 11 USC 11 cases take an aggregation approach 

when they look at it State-by-State, so, if we raise 

principal place of business as a term of art that 

Congress imported into this statute, then we have to 

look at an aggregated State-by-State approach.

 The other answer, I think, is more of a

semantic answer, which is how did Congress define the 

word "place"? Certainly, the English language provides 

that a place can be a building, as Hertz would have, or 

a place could be a State, as we -- my place of birth, 

for example, is New York State.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- why didn't they 

say place of doing business? That's not the terminology 

that they used.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: They didn't, and Congress 

was --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be more 

consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the 

factors the Ninth Circuit starts with.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, Congress chose 

the phrase "principal place of business" because, to 

quote the legislative history, there were many cases on 

the books, and it was an easily understood phrase.

 I think what Congress intended to do was to 

not have us end up here, to take a phrase which was 

known in the case law and to import it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what's very 

clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower 

court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was 

picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't, 

that the Courts below are confused about what they were

doing before the statute.

 So I don't know why importing the belief 

that something was clear into a reality that it's not 

helps us.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, in answer to 

Justice Scalia's question, I believe it was clear, from 

all of the case law, that we were talking about place 

equalling an aggregation of all of the activity in the 

State.

 With regard to your question, we have cited 

in our brief two district court opinions that performed 

a scholarly review of all of the case law at the time 

that Congress passed the 1958 amendments. Particularly 

of import is the Inland Rubber case.

 And what the court found in the Inland 

Rubber case is, while there was two lines of thinking, 

there was the -- what came to be known as the nerve 

center line of thinking and what came to be known as the 

business reality line of thinking.

 The nerve center test could almost all be 

explained by the fact that, in those cases, the 

corporation only had one place of business, there were 

some outliers, but for the most part, the two judges, in 

the Gilardi case and in the Inland Rubber case --

you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority 

of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth, 

they all start with the proposition that, if a place has 

far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should 

start the inquiry and control it more than in a 

situation where there are lesser places of business?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Yes. That's the total 

activities test, Your Honor, and the total activities 

test would put initial weight on the nerve center, but 

if one -- and then, of course, weigh whether or not 

there is a substantial predominance of all of -- of all 

of the other factors somewhere in the country, which, 

frankly, is not a lot different than the Ninth Circuit 

case -- test.

 The Ninth Circuit simply does it in the 

other way. It asks --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a big 

difference.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: It asks the same question, 

whether or not there is a -- a substantial 

predominance -- finds substantial predominance, not just 

predominance, but substantial predominance.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- you know, to me, 

the word "substantial" usually means closer to 50 

percent. I'm having a hard time understanding what the

appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and 

the balance being spread over so many other places.

 What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms 

of the place that generates the most money. That's it. 

That's the place you are at home.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: I think, to understand it, 

one must look at the purpose of diversity. The real 

question is, is diversity to be used as a sword by a 

corporation, such that a corporation can choose its 

place of diversity jurisdiction, or is it a shield to 

protect the corporation, a truly foreign corporation, 

from local bias?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's what --

but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about 

shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision 

that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a 

foreigner, because you are there. The people are going 

to perceive you as a business -- the local business that 

is doing business in that location, and Congress 

rejected that.

 So foreign has to have a meaning that was 

somewhat different. And you don't think the corporate 

headquarters where management is, where the direction 

for the operation of the business is coming from, is the 

place that needs the most protection in this system

because they are the ones making the decisions, and so 

aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local 

bias?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Courts have found that 

corporations are best known where they have most of 

their people and their property. That's because 

employees go out in the community, property is bought 

and sold in the community, so the local people will know 

the corporation more where they have their people and 

property than, necessarily, where they have the 

headquarters.

 Until this case began, I had no idea where 

Hertz headquarters are. There is many corporations in 

the State of California, that I have no idea are 

headquartered in the State of California.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem with your --

your approach -- and California is unique in this 

respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of 

business, and you are comparing to the next State that 

has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida.

 If I were entertaining your approach, I 

would think, well, you would compare California against 

the whole rest of the nation and not pick for a 

dispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed.

 California is going to be the big winner in

this. It's going to be able to keep all those cases in 

its State court because so many multi-State 

corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way 

Hertz does.

 Am I right, that, under your analysis, the 

one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal 

courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home 

in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your 

view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in 

Federal court in New Jersey, right?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: That is correct, Your Honor, 

unless, of course, Hertz were to change its place of 

incorporation to New Jersey.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do you say, 

well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method, 

California versus Florida, instead of California and 

let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the 

whole United States?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: I think the answer, Justice 

Ginsburg, to that question goes back to how the phrase 

"principal place of business" was looked at under the 

Bankruptcy Code, and in the Bankruptcy Code, it was, in 

fact, a State-by-State analysis, rather than a State 

versus country analysis.

mean that all corporations were going to end up being 

California corporations? California -- the Ninth 

Circuit has been doing it this way for 50 years. Every 

other circuit has had -- save the seventh -- has had 

some balancing test for 50 years, and it has not come to 

pass that all corporations are California corporations.

 A matter of fact, if you think of a 

corporation that sells skis, they are likely going to be 

a Colorado corporation, or they are going to be a Utah 

corporation. A -- a corporation that sells mining 

equipment is likely to end up in West Virginia or one of 

the mining States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why, 

somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with 

Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and, 

hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is 

likely to identify with Hertz.

 Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz 

outlets in New Jersey as there are in California. The 

only reason that you come up with California is it's an 

enormous State. It has 10 percent of the population.

 But as far as the citizens of the State 

identifying with that -- with that company and, 

therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that 

company -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey

and California are absolutely the same.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Congress made a decision in 

rejecting the any place where you are doing business 

test, that it would not prevent corporations from 

removing cases in any State where they are doing 

business.

 The question in diversity jurisdiction is 

not whether or not a corporation should be allowed to 

use the Federal forum to decide if that's the best forum 

for it, but the question is a different one. Will there 

be bias in the -- in the State court?

 And because Hertz does so much business in 

California, it's hard to argue that we bias by being in 

the State court in California. Remember, this case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they cannot be 

advised by the State court in New Jersey either. The --

you correctly pointed out that Congress said place of 

business. It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't 

do as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is 

you could be a citizenship of as many States as you 

incorporate in. But if it's got to be one place, so why 

not just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the 

business headquarters, in a particular case you could 

show otherwise.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Congress had two goals,

Justice Ginsburg. The first goal was to prevent gaming 

of the system. The simplest test is also the most 

easily --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be a phony 

headquarters. But nobody is suggesting that -- that the 

headquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham 

set-up.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: But even a -- even a real 

headquarters wouldn't prevent gaming of the system. 

If -- if a corporation truly wanted to stay out of State 

court in a State where it was doing significant 

business, even all of their business under Hertz' test, 

they would only have to actually move their headquarters 

out of that State.

 There is a second reason that Congress 

passed the '58 amendment --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that phenomenon? I 

mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it 

happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its 

headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a 

particular State?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Because the test is only a 

Seventh Circuit test, it wouldn't do any good for a 

corporation --

factors in other -- in other states as well. It's part 

of the totality of the circumstances. You certainly 

increase your odds to move your headquarters.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: It would, but it wouldn't be 

dispositive. We do know that corporations move for all 

sorts of economic reasons. They move for tax reasons, 

they move because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would they move 

simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the 

Federal court in a particular State?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: There is -- as witnessed by 

congressional findings in the Class Action Fairness Act, 

there is a perception that State courts in certain 

States are not good for corporations. Whether that --

that perception is a real perception or whether it's not 

a real perception isn't before us today.

 But if a corporation has all of its people 

and all of its property and is doing all of its business 

in one of those States, the corporation shouldn't be 

allowed to game the system by simply moving its 

headquarters, it's real headquarters out of that State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are not talking 

about all. I mean, that would be -- that's why you make 

it a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption 

which could be rebutted. But you are not talking about

all business. You are talking about California where 

there is a sizeable amount of business, simply because 

it's the size of the State, the population of the State.

 And I would understand your position better 

if you would say, well, we would measure against the 

entirety of the United States. But California is going 

to come out the winner much more often than any other 

State under this test simply because of its size.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, I don't believe that the case law has borne 

that out. Again, I have read no studies that say 

corporations are more often California citizens simply 

because of the population of California -- that doesn't 

mean that the study hasn't exist -- doesn't exist. I 

simply haven't read it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't worry about 

private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you 

know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal 

court, establishing residence in a different State? We 

don't worry about them gaming the system, do we?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: We do, Justice Scalia. 

There is a fact-intensive test for citizenship for 

individuals based on their intent to stay in a place.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But -- but you can 

have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't

know that people do it for foreign reasons because they 

want to get in or out of Federal court. You really 

don't worry about that, it seems to me.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: I do believe it is less 

likely that an individual would either have the 

sophistication or, frankly, the litigation volume to 

make such a decision? But a corporation may, in fact.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know some rich 

individuals that might have the incentive.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: I would like to turn, if I 

may, to the second reason that Congress passed the '58 

amendment and that was because of the notion of 

overcrowding of the Federal docket because too many 

diversity cases -- because there were too many diversity 

cases because most litigation was happening far away 

from the facts.

 Suits involving corporations generally arise 

where they have a lot of contacts with the public, where 

there people are and where their property are. If we 

allow a corporation to move all of its litigation where 

the bulk of its people and property are to Federal 

court, Congress's second goal --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schneider, can I just 

inject this thought? It goes back to Justice Kennedy's 

question. I don't think we are concerned about the

defendants gaming the system. I think one other very 

important concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small 

communities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they 

would much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes 

the judges are better than the local judges, and so 

forth. So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs 

want to get into Federal courts.

 And it seems to me it's important to have a 

rule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what 

is the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into 

Federal court or not. And I see it as a great argument 

in favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: The -- again, for 50 years, 

Justice Stevens, plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers have 

been able to under the various tests figure out where 

corporations are citizens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you must acknowledge 

that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some 

place to get on the internet and say where is their 

principal place and they get a simple answer. If you 

get a question, well, I got to analyze their business 

all over the country to decide, that's a formidable 

obstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: It may or may not be, 

depending upon the corporation. The vast majority of

corporations are local corporations, so we are really 

just talking about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of an interstate 

business who are commonly defendants in a lot of 

lawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question 

is, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation 

of that defendant is.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice 

Stevens. And because most of those entities are public 

corporations, there is a lot of information available in 

FCC filings, et cetera, as to where they are actually 

doing business. You can also simply look out your door 

and figure out whether have I seen a lot of Hertz 

outlets where I am.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is -- under 

the Ninth Circuit test, where is -- what is the 

principal place of business of Starbucks?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Under the Ninth Circuit 

test, the principal place of Starbucks, there is a case 

that says Starbucks is in California. Let me give you,

makes sense, because I have read the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- where is its 

headquarters.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: Headquarters is in Seattle, 

Washington. But over -- that's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the very first 

little shop was there.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: That's my understanding, 

yes. However, over 100 percent more workers from 

Starbucks are in California than Washington.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what 

100 percent means? Are the number of workers in Seattle 

inconsequential? Is there one worker there or are we 

talking about 1,000 in --

MR. SCHNEIDER: I don't know the total 

numbers of the workers.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that important? 

As Justice Scalia said that per capita California is 

going to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have 

a multi-location place of business. So don't you have 

to know the raw numbers?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: I -- I don't know the raw 

numbers from Starbucks, I'm sorry. I just read the 

opinion. And what the opinion tells us is that 

Starbucks has 10 percent of its employees in Washington

and 27 percent in California. Over 300 percent more of 

its gross revenue comes from California than any other 

State, 200 percent more of its retail stores are in 

California than in any other State.

mail order houses? I mean, what's the principal place

 MR. SCHNEIDER: It would -- it would be, 

Your Honor, wherever there is a substantial predominance 

of its people and property. I would assume -- and I 

don't know the facts of Eddie Bauer, but I would assume 

Eddie Bauer has a central location from which it does 

its sales, which it does its factory work, where it is 

shipping things from.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would -- would it 

make a difference if, say -- it may well be the case, 30 

percent of their business is in California?

 MR. SCHNEIDER: No. But by business you 

mean revenue, Your Honor?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. SCHNEIDER: The test we posit, Your

look first to the location of employees, tangible 

properties and production activities, and then second to

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRI SRINIVASAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Your Honor, just one point 

and I will be brief.

 The idea that corporations would switch 

their -- location of their headquarters in order to 

achieve jurisdictional results hasn't been borne out in 

any example in which I'm aware. And there is a 

fundamental reason why.

 When a corporation decides to relocate its

decision about what is the location from which its 

direction and control is going to emanate. That is not 

a gamesmanship decision.  That's a bona fide decision 

about where its headquarters are going to be located and 

where its most important decision -- business decisions 

are going to be made.

 If the Court has no further questions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That means that its 

principal officers and their families have to move.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It does.
