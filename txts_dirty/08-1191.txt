 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next this morning in Case 08-1191, Morrison v. 

National Australia Bank.

 Mr. Dubbs.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DUBBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Given that the issue of subject matter 

jurisdiction appears not to be in dispute, the issues 

before the Court today are:

 First, the scope of section 10(b) of the 

1934 Exchange Act when applied to alleged fraudulent 

conduct with respect to financial information that is to 

be sent to Australia for incorporation into the 

financial statements of the Respondent, National 

Australia Bank.

 And second, the reasonableness of the 

application of the statute under these circumstances and 

the norms of enforcement pursuant to the private cause 

of action or otherwise.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess there's also the 

issue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not

a jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case. 

I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't 

get to the merits.

 MR. DUBBS: Your Honor, it's our view that 

that -- that is a possible outcome, which of course as I 

understand it would leave -- leave the decision below 

standing. We have urged in the supplemental brief that 

it may want to remand for consideration of the change of 

position of the Securities and Exchange Commission with 

respect to the tests that they have -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you are not -- you are 

not pressing that?

 MR. DUBBS: No, we still believe that the 

best way to handle the case is to remand; but we leave 

that for the Court's discretion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't that simply 

be going through the motions? The Second Circuit put 

the wrong label on it, but everything it said could have 

been plugged into: Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6) 

rather than 12(b)(1)?

 MR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, the question 

and the issue is inherently somewhat speculative as to 

what the Second Circuit would do, but we would rely not 

necessarily only on the subject matter jurisdiction 

issues being addressed -- and Your Honor is quite right

that they may say, well, the label's changed, but 

everything else stays the same. What we particularly 

thought might be instructive for this Court is to hear 

what the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's 

financial capital thought of a new fact, and that new 

fact is that for the first time the Securities and 

Exchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of 

administrative deference the Court should defer to our 

test in cases like that.

 Sure, they have submitted amicus briefs in 

the past. They have done lots of things. But this is 

the first time they have said: We as the agency 

responsible for the statute have said this is how courts 

should handle the case. That's what's new and 

different, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed 

along that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on 

the merits here today.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me that 

isn't worth anything, right? I mean, that's -- they 

haven't conducted a rulemaking or anything.

 MR. DUBBS: Well, they haven't conducted -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: They just -- just appeared 

in court.

 MR. DUBBS: Well, they haven't conducted a 

full rulemaking that would be entitled to Chevron

deference.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. DUBBS: But they have done something 

less than that. And whether it's entitled to deference, 

Skidmore deference, or something lesser than that is an 

open point. But so we leave it to the Court's decision 

as to whether it is just -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they don't come 

out on your side anyway, do they?

 MR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, they come out 

on our side except for that last turn they make at the 

end, where they -- they bring in the intervening clause 

at the end of the last act. Other than that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could they come down 

on your side if they say there is no private right of 

action?

 MR. DUBBS: Well, they didn't say there was 

no private right of action. What they said was there 

was no private right of action in this case because of 

their application of the intervening clause test, which 

we submit was error and clear error in light of the 

factors that have to go into the intervening -­

this case. I mean -­

you in this case.

 MR. DUBBS: They -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So what could -- and that 

is going to change the Second Circuit's view of things, 

the fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it 

has been reconfirmed, although on different grounds, 

by -- by the government?

 MR. DUBBS: Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no reason to send 

it back.

 MR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's 

up to the Court. I mean, it's your -- you're basically 

educating -- making an educated guess as to whether the 

Second Circuit would pay attention to the SEC. In the 

past, they have. They may not now.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dubbs, you said 

something that I thought quite revealing in this -- in 

your brief. I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff, 

Australian defendant, shares purchased in Australia. It 

has "Australia" written all over it. And in your reply 

brief you said: "If the Plaintiff is a foreign 

securities purchaser as this one is, Sinochem makes it

clear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of 

an action brought in the U.S."

 And taking that, why not -- of the 

applicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged 

fraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of 

Australia rather than the law of the United States?

 MR. DUBBS: No -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not just a question of 

proper forum, but the proper law?

 MR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. We think that, 

given the scope of section 10(b), American law can and 

should be applied here. And we respectfully disagree 

with the observation that this case has "Australia" 

written all over it. Indeed, from our point of view it 

has "Florida" written all over it because Florida is 

where the numbers were doctored, Florida is where the 

fraudulent conduct in putting the phony assumptions into 

the valuation portfolio were done. Everything 

happened -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If all that were done and 

it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any 

violation.

 MR. DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the communication was 

done in Australia by the Australian bank.

MR. DUBBS: The communication was done 

between Florida and -- and Australia, and the senior 

management of HomeSide in Florida created those numbers 

with the expectation and the knowledge that those would 

go into the financial statement. So that means there is 

substantial conduct in Florida in terms of the fraud. 

They made the misrepresentation pursuant to what "make" 

means, pursuant to the 1934 dictionary.

 They engaged in hard-core fraudulent conduct 

by doctoring the books, by putting the phony assumptions 

into the computer model. Without that there wouldn't 

have been a phony number. In one sense it's a one-issue 

case, or a one-number case, which is the mortgage 

servicing rights number that appears on -- on the 

balance sheet at page 11 -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's -- let's go back to 

the question that I asked you about the appropriate 

forum. You -- you seem to give this very case -- the 

plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser. When the 

plaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the 

presumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less 

force, et cetera. But you have an Australian plaintiff 

suing in the United States based on shares purchased in 

Australia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank.

 So what -- what did you mean when you were

referring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens?

 MR. DUBBS: We meant two things, Your Honor. 

The first thing we meant was that, in addition to the 

other tests that are proposed, putting Sinochem at the 

beginning of the train would sort out some of these 

questions in general. That's in general.

 As to our particular case, we believe we 

would win a forum non conveniens argument, though one 

was never made and that was not explored by any district 

judge. And we would win that because the statute 

specifically provides in section 10(b) that fraud can be 

caused in any number of ways -- three ways, including 

through the mails, through foreign or interstate 

commerce, or over an exchange. And that fraud was 

caused in Florida and the mails were used and it was in 

foreign or interstate commerce.

 And the people who committed the fraud on a 

nuts-and-bolts level are the senior management who are 

defendants from HomeSide bank in Florida, so to that 

extent it is a Florida case. And we also think that any 

district judge in looking at a forum non motion would 

also look at the various interests of National Australia 

Bank in HomeSide in the United States to judge the 

overall fairness of letting the suit proceed against 

them and to counter the issue that this is really all

about Australia.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't your clients 

have an adequate remedy under Australian law in 

Australia, in the Australian court system?

 MR. DUBBS: We might or we might not. But 

that is not determinative.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's assume that -­

that they do not. Let's assume that on the facts of 

this case they could not prevail under Australian law in 

the Australian court system. Then what United States 

interest is there -­

MR. DUBBS: There -­

JUSTICE ALITO: -- that should override 

that?

 MR. DUBBS: There is a strong United States 

interest. It's on two levels. The first strong United 

States -- United States interest deals with the conduct 

at issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by 

HomeSide. This was the sixth largest mortgage service 

provider in the United States.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we had only HomeSide's 

conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation 

of 10(b); is that right?

 MR. DUBBS: We do not agree with that, Your 

Honor. We believe that they made a representation by

creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the 

scope of the statute. What they did is create a 

deceptive device -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But nothing has happened. 

Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and 

they didn't act on it?

 MR. DUBBS: Your -- Your Honor, that goes to 

a different element of the cause of action. That 

doesn't go to the scope of the statute. That goes to 

how the private cause of action is enforced.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, I concede your 

argument that a big component of this fraud was what 

went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the 

public. It needed to be put out there. And that wasn't 

done in Florida by the Florida defendants.

 MR. DUBBS: It was done in Australia and we 

can prove that. And -- the point is we are not -- all 

we are proving through doing that is the effects of the 

fraud in Florida. To use Professor Beale's example, 

where you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that 

poison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the 

first jurisdiction there is a law that says "thou shalt 

not make poison candy;" through the exercise of 

legislative jurisdiction that statute in the first 

jurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have

an interest in that.

 Now, if we are in the poison candy 

jurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison 

candy, if the statute in addition says, "you have to 

show some harm from the poison candy," indeed you might 

as a matter of proof have to show effects from that 

other forum. But that's different than regulating 

conduct in the second forum or anything else in the 

second forum. That is simply looking at the statute or 

the legal prescription against making poison candy. And 

we say section 10(b) is like the poison candy statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Which of your standards -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's -- I would like 

you to follow that up specifically. That is, in my mind 

the difficult issue in this case is not the 

jurisdictional issue under principles of international 

law. It's the question of the scope of the statute. 

And there the things against you are three. One is 

Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know 

your answer to. The second is in Judge Friendly's two 

opinions.

 The first opinion -- the second one, rather, 

Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and 

foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign 

plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,

even if that fraud takes place totally in the United 

States, the statute wouldn't cover it. That's Friendly, 

which started this.

 And the third thing is what he says in 

Leasco. He says: We cannot see any sound reason for 

not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs 

who are Americans. Okay?

 Now, France, Britain and Australia have 

filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very 

sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly 

never considered. And those three reasons, as we know, 

is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, 

how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate 

their own securities markets, right?

 That's all one question: Professor Sachs, 

Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco. But that's 

what I'd like to hear your answer to.

 MR. DUBBS: I will try to keep the subparts 

in mind. Why don't we start from the end and try to 

work backwards. Perhaps one of the most important parts 

of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a 

general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm 

not ducking that. But as a general matter the 

enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust 

laws, has not historically and today they do not believe

runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate 

conflict.

 Now, as to the specific briefs that Your 

Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look 

at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire, 

those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the 

moment because that's the country we are talking about. 

Australia's brief essentially says they have a 

regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not 

have been able to litigate this cause of action in 

Australia, but let's assume that we could.

 They are not saying -- they did not say in 

that brief that there was some fundamental conflict, 

like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they 

say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in 

the application of 403(h) of the Restatement, which 

Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford 

Fire. So there is not the kind of conflict that leads 

necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying 

the statute.

 The reason there's not is that because, one, 

there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide 

by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide 

by that are contradictory. At most, what you have is 

you have a clear rule in the United States that says

thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either 

the Florida through either -- for or in interstate 

commerce, the mails or through an exchange. And on the 

other side of the equation what you have is maybe they 

could have brought suit over here and we have a robust 

regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more 

power to them.

 But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that 

doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy 

was made suddenly has no interest in that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but Australia 

says: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has 

been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's 

been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two. 

And we should be able to decide that and we don't want 

it decided by a foreign court.

 You are talking about a misrepresentation, 

if there was one in this case, made in Australia to 

Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide 

that issue; and here you are dragging the American 

courts into it.

 MR. DUBBS: Well, let me deal with the 

dragging in part in a minute, because that's 

subliminally very important to the case.

 But let me address the direct question. He

Australians may believe that, but the question is was 

there a misrepresentation both in the United States and 

possibly in Australia? If there was in Australia, 

that's for the Australians. That's dealing with the 

effects of eating the poison candy. But we say a 

misrepresentation was made in the United States -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not to these plaintiffs.

 MR. DUBBS: Sir -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to join the 

misrepresentation to the plaintiff.

 MR. DUBBS: We have joined -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: The only misrepresentation 

to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an 

Australian company.

 MR. DUBBS: There are two ways to connect 

the fraud to the plaintiffs. The one is the "in 

connection with" requirement that deals with conduct, 

which we meet, and this Court has construed very broadly 

in Dabit, in Zandford and any other number of cases. 

That's number one.

 Number two, assuming that the scope of the 

statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida, 

we then get to the second question, which is the 

reasonableness of the application of the statute, and 

without a conflict, we would then look at -- to the

interest of the United States and compare them to the 

Australians. And the Australians can say, we can -- you 

know, we can go after eating that poison candy. And we 

say, fine, if you want to, that's great. But that 

doesn't mean we can't go after the act of poisoning the 

candy in Florida.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that isn't the 

issue. The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is: 

We want to determine whether there has been a 

misrepresentation or not.

 MR. DUBBS: They -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want the 

determination of whether there has been a 

misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether 

Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation 

to be determined by an American court.

 MR. DUBBS: And we say more power to you, 

you can decide that question. The question -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not if it's decided here, 

unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the 

United States taking this case is so outrageous that we

too. It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you 

have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in 

applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the

 MR. DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor. And 

the question is should there be deferral in this case. 

And we say if you apply the standards of -- of Hartford 

Fire or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end 

up in deferral. You end up in prosecution of the 

Section 10(b) cause of action in Florida. And you do 

that for a couple of different reasons.

 First, you look at the magnitude of the 

conduct in Florida, the size of this. This is a 

$1.75 billion writedown in a portfolio. You have a 

portfolio of $187 billion worth of mortgages sitting 

down in Jacksonville, Florida. Those are all mortgages 

on American homes, 2 million American homes. So, this 

is not just Australia, Australia, Australia. That's 

what's in the portfolio and that's what's being 

misrepresented. And when they doctor the numbers and 

send them to Australia, it's a misrepresentation of 

that.

 In addition, you have the overarching 

consideration of is it appropriate to sue National 

Australia Bank in the United States at -- at a -- at a 

more abstract level? And the answer to that, we submit, 

is yes. They have invested -- if you care to look, it's 

on the SA-11 and SA-41 of the supplemental appendix,

they have invest -- they have $25 billion worth of

 MR. DUBBS: They are only at issue in the 

following sense, which is that the position on the 

mortgage servicing rights was hedged in New York. When 

the hedge came undone, there were losses in New York on 

the other side of the hedge. That goes to the point of 

were there any affects in the United States, because 

there seems to be some confusion on that. There were 

some effects here from the hedge. There were some 

effects on -- in the ADR market, but we are not -- we 

are not -­

 MR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. He was the 

holder of an ADR. The derivatives come in because they 

are the activity in New York that is the other side of 

the transaction. HomeSide -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you have -- you 

have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who 

bought their shares in Australia; then you have 

Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because 

he wasn't able to show damages.

 MR. DUBBS: That's true. There -- there are 

no Americans left. This is strictly Australians.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what U.S. investor was 

harmed?

 MR. DUBBS: The -- the question is, were 

there effects on the U.S. market? There were U.S. 

investors who were, in all likelihood, harmed but none 

have stepped forward with respect to ADR holders. But 

if the question in the abstract is were there economic 

effects from this transaction in the United States, the 

answer is -- is yes, there were fallout from -- on -- on

was the other side, in effect, the short side of what 

the long position was, which was $187 billion worth of 

mortgages in Florida that what is -- what the portfolio

to finish?

 MR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- I mean, I can see. 

I will give you all that. That isn't what is bothering 

me. I think you are right so far as what you have 

argued. But the part that I think is most difficult is 

why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs' 

article.

 MR. DUBBS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because what Australia is 

actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the 

American system, you know, their -- their common 

criticisms of class actions. We say, first of all, the 

American rule means even if our companies here are 

right, that they are going to have to pay their legal 

fees. We don't like punitive damages. We don't like 

that we have the opt-out. And these are all our 

citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on 

our exchange to that stuff.

 Now, fine, they have a reason on their side. 

Then Professor Sachs says: Read the statute, because 

they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind 

of stuff. Now, that's what I would like you to address

specifically.

 MR. DUBBS: Well, it was -- there are two 

issues. The statute was intended to cover that kind of 

stuff if the antecedent of "stuff" is fraud in Florida. 

Now, that's a separate question from how we deal with 

the private right of action in these circumstances.

 Now, let's back up. The general criticism 

of these cases is that they are gotcha cases. You put 

in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar 

comes and attacks you. I mean, that's the stereotype. 

Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to 

understand why the stereotype is wrong. Because if all 

you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market, 

1 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get 

bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as 

they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the 

Novagold case. We are not aware of any case where if 

all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in. 

You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction.

 And to pick up on the discussion that I was 

having with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in 

addition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals 

with respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you 

can, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more 

of these cases if they are fallacious are going to be

screened out of the system.

 So, the point is that we can all tell our 

Australian friends that there are very rigid safeguards 

in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't 

happen and it has not been proven to happen. It is an 

attractive myth, but it hasn't happened. Those cases go 

out and they go out early.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that it 

happens in advance of considerable discovery. I -- I --

I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to 

forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but 

in -- in these cases one of the things we are really 

talking about is the burden of discovery. That's the 

cost of litigation. You know that.

 MR. DUBBS: I do know that and let me answer 

briefly, because I want to reserve my time for rebuttal. 

I disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice 

Kennedy. These cases are paid attention to by the 

district judges and they go out early. They go out 

early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of 

discovery on that. They go out early -- if Sinochem 

gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that 

if there is a close question. And then you go to the 

12(b)(6).

Litigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no 

discovery, no discovery until after the motion to 

dismiss is decided.

 So it is not true that there is a lot of 

discovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before 

we know the answer to one of the threshold questions, 

which is: Should this case be in our system or not? 

That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily 

basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes.

 Now, my final point with respect to 

Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles 

is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many 

of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges, 

that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the 

statute. And it takes an eraser to the statute and it 

says: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with 

foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails; 

it's limited, contrary to the express words of the 

statute, in a way that the statutory construction we 

don't believe can stand it.

 Now, there are other legitimate ways of 

cabining the private cause of action. But that -- if 

you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not 

one of them.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. CONWAY, III,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. CONWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The judgment of the court of appeals should 

be affirmed for two reasons.

 First, Petitioners have identified nothing 

in the text of section 10(b) that overcomes the 

presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming 

Betsy Rule. The statutes should thus be construed not 

to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers 

on foreign exchanges.

 Second, unlike the rights of action that 

this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality 

cases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied. 

Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist 

even domestically, let alone extraterritorially.

 Given the threat that the section 10(b} 

implied right presents to the sovereign authority of 

other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of 

Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the 

diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court 

should construe the implied right not to extend to

claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of 

foreign issuers on foreign markets.

 The two clear statement rules are, 

obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality 

and the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress. 

Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress 

clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to 

apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters 

that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other 

nations.

 My friends don't identify anything in the 

statute that comets even close to a clear statement. 

They principally rely on the definition of "interstate 

commerce," but as this court said in Aramco, that kind 

of boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the 

presumption against extraterritoriality.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test for 

whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or 

not?

 MR. CONWAY: Well, our test is that, at a 

minimum, section 10b should be held not to apply to 

transactions involving shares of foreign issues on 

foreign exchanges, because that presents the greatest 

danger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the 

context of the modern section 10b implied right, which

has the fraud on the market presumption and holds 

issuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half 

years of trading, all on an Australian exchange. That 

is massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here 

are seeking an American court to effect, and that is -­

basically, it's a direct form of market regulation that 

Australia has not seen fit to impose upon itself.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that 

point: Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a 

group of Americans who were shareholders of the 

Australian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock 

over the Australian exchange.

 MR. CONWAY: We would -- well, we would 

submit that that rule should be the same. That they 

should -- they should not also, they should not be 

allowed to sue under section 10b. They -- they -- you 

know, those people chose to purchase on the Australian 

exchange. And in terms of the threat to international 

comity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't 

think other countries would take nicely to a -- to a 

rule of law that would allow Americans, essentially, to 

bring their rules, their law, their remedies, fraud, on 

the market, what have you to foreign countries -­

you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example. 

Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and 

meets Jones in the hotel. And Jones says, I have a 

bridge I want to sell you. Look out the window. Say, 

Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge? Yes. And that's a lie.

 Here's what you do. You invest in buying 

shares of my company sold on the German exchange. Okay?

 MR. CONWAY: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Conduct took place in the 

United States, a terrible fraud. This is contrary to 

fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it 

should apply at least where Schmidt is an American 

citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then.

 What do you do with that case? The fraud 

took place totally here.

 MR. CONWAY: Well, I disagree with that, 

Your Honor, I think the fraud is carried out when the 

transaction occurs in a foreign country. But I do agree 

that Professor Sachs is absolutely right -­

circumstance.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but your position and 

hers is: That's no more a valid claim than this one or 

any other one we dream up. That's why it's a pure 

example, and I want to know how you feel about it. 

And -­

MR. CONWAY: Well, I think that -- I think 

the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept 

within the statute, you have to ignore the language and 

the presumption against extraterritoriality.

 If you go to petition appendix 78, that has 

its text in section 10b, and section 10b refers to the 

use or employment of any manipulative device or 

contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or 

sale of any security registered on a national securities 

exchange. And that's -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Or any other. Or -- read 

the next word.

 MR. CONWAY: That's correct. Any security 

not so registered. And this Court has held -- it has

held in cases like Aramco, American Banana, Moritson, 

that the words "any" and "every," words of universal 

scope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that 

something referred to is anything, anywhere else in the 

world. And for example, the Court is small against the 

United States. In the case where the presumption of 

extraterritoriality didn't really apply the court held 

that in a statute, you normally assume that things being 

referred to are thing in the United States. Now -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the government going to 

tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign 

exchange test, is based on considerations like those 

suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge 

hypothetical?

 MR. CONWAY: I think they do. I think they 

look to -- I think their view is that the statute is 

vague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly 

did and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you 

have to make do and decide what the best rule is. And 

with respect to the government, that is essentially 

doing what this Court has said under the presumption 

against extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do. 

That's essentially legislating, trying to figure out 

what Congress would have done, had "a particular 

problem" -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the limitations on 

discovery give you substantial protection were we to 

adopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange 

test with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes 

account of the government's test?

 MR. CONWAY: Your Honor, I think the problem 

with the government's test and with the Second Circuit's 

test, is that it would still allow the application of 

U.S. law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign 

authority of other nations.

 And I can give an example. There was a case 

over the summer that the Petitioners attached to their 

first supplemental brief on the petition for certiorari. 

And it's a case called PC shifts. And it's an 

interesting case because it involved a Canadian company 

with headquarters in Britain and most of whose shares 

traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

 And what happened there was that the 

CEO spent time in Florida -- it was a shipping company. 

We spent time in, Miami running the show from Miami. 

And the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a 

ruling that it held was consistent with the Second 

Circuit decision in this case held that nonetheless, the 

application of U.S. law could be applied to transactions

of -- of foreign plaintiffs on the Toronto Stock

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a consideration that 

this discovery alone would be an offense to foreign -­

MR. CONWAY: Yes, discovery alone. Yes, 

Your Honor. Discovery alone. I think the French brief, 

for example, points that out. I think a number of the 

brief -- there have been blocking statutes that have 

been enacted by various countries because of the -- what 

they deem to be the offensive scope of discovery. In 

France, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence 

that is actually admissible in trial.

when you say to use or employ in connection with the 

purchase or sale of any security registered on the

registered.

Honor. I think that's a fair reading of the statute. 

And this Court is required, under both the presumption 

against extraterritoriality under its decision and the 

Charming Betsy Rule to interpret a statute, take the 

permissible construction of the statute that is least 

likely to result in an extraterritorial of the law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Purchased -- purchased or 

sold?

 MR. CONWAY: Purposed or sold, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's not -- what if 

it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a 

sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that 

otherwise the person would dispose of?

 MR. CONWAY: Well, I -- I don't know that 

that would state a claim, a private claim under Blue 

Chip Stamps. And any -- and if the share or the 

securities are held abroad, if it's a foreign security, 

and I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm 

assuming that if it's a foreign security held by a 

foreigner -- that really would be something that would 

be subject to foreign law, whether or not Australia 

wants to represent -- recognize holder claims of the 

sort that this Court rejected in Blue Chip Stamps. 

That's a question for Australia to decide.

facts if you had -- altering according to the 

hypothetical, you had U.S. plaintiffs who purchased 

National Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange, 

you don't doubt that they can sue, do you?

 MR. CONWAY: No, and in fact, we told the 

district court, we did not move to defense on 

extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr. Morrison, 

who inexplicably is still here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. CONWAY: We argued that Mr. Morrison's 

claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no 

damages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation 

best based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we 

also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed 

for failure to plead fraud with the requisite 

particularity of the PSLRA.

 But we certainly do not dispute that when a 

company like ours registers shares on -- registers 

shares with the SEC, ADRs with its SEC and lists them on 

a New York stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New 

York -- I mean, U.S. law for purposes of those -­

National Australia Bank. So the dangers of -- of a 

threat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less.

 It's a much, much easier case to deal with 

if -- if -- if you are only dealing with the ADRs. Now 

if another company decides to list half its equity on 

the New York Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes 

the determination for itself, how much of this kind of 

litigation it wants to subject itself to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were 

litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud 

violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the 

case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause 

of action under the securities law. Would -- would the 

fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial 

litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a 

factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in 

this suit? Or would the test be just the same in your 

view?

 MR. CONWAY: I think the -- I think you have 

to take each statute separately. You have to look at

what the language of the statute says, whether it -- it 

admits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether 

that -- frankly whether that extraterritorial reading is 

required or compelled. If there is any other possible 

construction, as the Court said in -- in Charming Betsy, 

the court is required to accept that construction,

conduct that ultimately, you know, led -- in a but-for 

causal relationship to what happened in the Australia 

occurred in the United States, but that's true in a lot

of other cases. For example, Aramco, Mr. Boureslan was 

hired in Houston. So was the cook in Foley Brothers v. 

Filardo. And in Microsoft v. AT&T, basically all of the 

conduct, the relevant conduct was in the United States, 

because what the -- what section 271(f) proscribed in 

Microsoft was the shipment -- the supply in or from the 

United States of a component of a patented invention.

 And what this Court held in Microsoft was 

that notwithstanding AT&T's argument that, "Hey, the 

presumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really 

apply because this is just regulating the supply in and 

from the United States," this Court held that the 

presumption against extraterritoriality applied because 

what would happen is, a single act of supply would 

result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a 

disk was put into a computer abroad.

 And that is exactly analogous to the 

circumstances in this case, where what we -- what 

happened was some -- some allegedly false information 

was transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in 

annual reports, print, print, print; sent out to the -­

sent out to the Australian market, and resulted in -­

allegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in 

liability every single time somebody purchased -­

purchased a share of stock of the National Australia

Bank on the Australian securities exchange. And so that 

is exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v. AT&T.

 Again, another point I think that's relevant 

is the, section 30 of the Exchange Act. Congress did 

not make a clear statement in section 10. It did make 

clear statements in section 30. Section 30(a) addresses 

transactions on foreign exchanges. Section 30 as a 

whole is entitled Foreign Exchanges, and section 30(a) 

makes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate 

regulations that -- that apply to brokers and dealers 

who effect transactions of securities on foreign 

exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of 

shares of shares of U.S. issuers.

 And that's at -- for reference, the text of 

section 30 is at page 19 of the law professors' brief. 

And section 30(b) also, it says that the SEC can 

regulate the -- regulate businesses in securities of -­

of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to 

the extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion 

of the Act domestically.

 And so Congress made two clear statements in 

section 30. It did not make any clear statement in 

section 10.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is that your only 

point? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need

section 30 if -- if 10(b) were -­

MR. CONWAY: That's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- were read as broadly.

 MR. CONWAY: That's absolutely right. The 

reading -- my friend's reading of section 30 would 

render section 10(b) -- I mean the reading of section 

10(b) would render section 30 superfluous. And there 

are other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act 

where Congress has made clear statements to show that it 

can make clear statements. Section 30A which 

immediately follows section 30, is the Foreign Corrupt 

Practices Act.

 So Congress -- if Congress -- if there is a 

loophole, and that's what this Court said in Microsoft 

v. AT&T; if there is some kind of loophole that presents 

some kind of a problem, that Congress needs to fix, 

Congress can do it. Congress can do it with a clear 

statement.

 In sum, Your Honors, countries -- nations of 

the world do things differently. They -- they -- they 

have different rules of liability. We see in the amicus 

briefs different rules of materiality, different rules 

of disclosure. And some rely on -- on public 

enforcement more than others.

 The French rely on l'action publique, as

they say; and some nations approach ours in their 

generosity to plaintiffs. Australia allows opt-out 

class actions; so does Canada. Canada allows opt-out 

class actions; it dispenses with, for example, the proof 

of reliance, it dispenses with scienter in some cases. 

Yet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability 

to $1 million or 5 percent of a -- of a company's -­

JUSTICE BREYER: How does it hurt the other 

countries if what we would say on their reading of this 

is, Congress has said, "Look, if some terribly bad 

conduct happens in the United States; they lie through 

their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who 

buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will 

give you a remedy. Come to us" -- now, how does that 

hurt Australia?

 MR. CONWAY: Well, it hurts Australia -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Or France or England or any 

of these others?

 MR. CONWAY: Exactly the same way this Court 

said it hurts in Empagran. In Empagran this Court noted 

that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a 

reading of the FTAIA that would have allowed foreign 

plaintiffs to come and sue for -- for foreign vitamins 

transaction in a foreign country would essentially allow 

plaintiffs to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the

liability and the narrower remedies that other nations 

provide. And that is exactly true here, where, you 

know, for example, Australia does not permit 

fraud-on-the-market class actions. It doesn't allow -­

it doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market 

presumption.

 And as I said, for example, Canada restricts 

these actions, it has generous liability rules and 

allows opt-out class actions, but it says -- it caps 

damages at 5 percent of an issuer's market 

capitalization or $1 million, whichever is greater.

 And so that's the -- that is the problem. 

It's not just substance but it's remedy. Other nations 

want to do things in different ways; they should be 

allowed to. What is going on here is essentially a --

Brandeising -- experiment a global scale. And that's a 

good thing.

 It's a good thing because it enables 

countries to judge for themselves what kind of rules 

they want to have for people who buy shares on their own 

exchanges. And to apply section 10(b) it cases like 

this would cut that experiment short. It would amount 

to exactly the soft of legal imperialism that this Court 

rejected, rightly, in Empagran. The Court should reject 

it here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case presents two distinct questions: 

First whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated 

Section 10b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a 

private action.

 In our view, the alleged fraud violated 

Section 10b, because significant conduct material to the 

fraud's success occurred in the United States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are -- there 

are a lot of moving parts in that test. You know, 

significant conduct, material, you require it to have a 

direct causal relationship. Doesn't the complication of 

that kind of defeat the whole purpose?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, we don't think 

so. In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which 

it will be -- the significant limit on private actions,

as this case illustrates, the district courts even 

accepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint 

will often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading 

for its failure to satisfy that test. It's not a 

difficult test -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's only for the 

private companies?

 MR. ROBERTS: That's right. And in terms of 

the other test, again, I don't think it's that 

complicated. The -- the significance part of it is 

essentially trying to assess the amount of the conduct 

of -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if -­

what if significant elements of the fraud occur in four 

different countries?

 MR. ROBERTS: If -- if -- the critical 

question is whether there's significant conduct here 

that's material to the broad success. And the reason 

for that is if Section 10b didn't cover that kind of 

conduct, then that would risk allowing the United States 

to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for 

export. It would allow thing like masterminds in the 

United States engineering international boiler room 

schemes in which they direct agents in foreign countries 

to make fraudulent representations that victimize

Schmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge.

calls him up.

would be able to take action if there is significant 

conduct in the United States -­

moment. What's bothering me, taking off from what the 

Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test. 

Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that 

when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue. But 

when you phone your parent company, knowing that they

you can't sue.

 And then what occurs to me is suppose you 

phoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent 

company and you knew they would tell a reporter. I'm 

focusing on the practicality of your causation test.

 MR. ROBERTS: If the conduct is directed or 

controlled from the United States -­

in Australia reviewed the numbers that were sent from 

Florida to any degree, they just directly copied them, 

some low-level clerk directly copied them, would the 

direct cause test be met?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, if the action was just 

ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met. 

Again, the critical question, in our view, under the 

direct cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the 

United States that is directly responsible for the 

plaintiff's injury?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you give no 

weight to the fact that it was on the Australian 

exchange?

 MR. ROBERTS: The -- the fact that the 

transaction happens on the Australian exchange is not 

dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United 

States is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if 

it turned on just a transaction on the Australian 

exchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a 

fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed 

entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a 

transaction on an overseas exchange.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, because your 

time is running out, there is a basic question here.

You are asking us to make a distinction between what the 

SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for. 

Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors.

 Is there any other instance in which we have 

made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the 

private litigant doesn't?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, the -- the -- the private 

litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have 

to show that the SEC doesn't have to show: Reliance, 

loss, loss causation. All of those go to the causal 

link between the injury and -- and the fraud. And we 

think that the direct injury requirement is an 

appropriate application of those more general causation 

requirements in the context of transnational fraud.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am frankly less concerned 

with your -- your test for the private cause of action, 

the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with 

that -- than I am with your test for -- for the 

jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a 

totality of the circumstances test. It doesn't seem to 

me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional 

question. You don't want to spend time litigating the 

totality of the circumstances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay.

 MR. ROBERTS: And it's true that bright line 

rules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to 

administer, but the -- there is a danger in bright line 

rules for fraud prohibitions because they can provide a 

road map for evasion of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any 

indication that our friends around the world are 

comfortable with your test?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the briefs that have 

been filed by Australia and United Kingdom and France 

are limited to the private right of action. They base 

their -- what they want to do is to limit the private 

rights. And I think the United Kingdom brief 

specifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action 

could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if 

the Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions, 

that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the 

possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the 

United States or directed in the United States and it 

couldn't be addressed.

 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. And we would

private right of action if the alternative for a holding 

substantive prohibitions didn't apply here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Roberts, you 

urge deference to the SEC's interpretation in 

administrative adjudications?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything 

other than those two proceedings over the last 35 years?

 MR. ROBERTS: Those are the two 

administrative adjudications. The SEC's administrative 

adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in 

the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that 

happen are -- don't involve people that are registered 

broker/dealers and the like. There are numerous Civil 

Actions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the 

same approach. The SEC v. Berger case that we cite in 

our brief is one of them.

 I can name some others. There is 

SEC v. Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district 

court in Utah, and SEC v. Shay in -- in the southern 

district of New York. SEC v. Banger in the northern

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DUBBS: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me 

begin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to 

get back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge.

 As to -- we have alleged that in -- that 

effectively, ministerial activities did occur here. The 

Second Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that 

the numbers were mechanically incorporated. That's as 

close to ministerial as you get.

 We used, in the complaint, the were 

"adopted." We said that they were asleep at the wheel. 

The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no 

checkpoints. The checkpoints are illusory. If there 

was a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the

checkpoint, and the MSR number went right through the 

checkpoint. Those are the allegations, and we should be 

able to stick with the allegations.

 Now, turning to the statute, my colleague 

indicated that the language with respect to foreign and 

interstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco 

decision, was boilerplate. That's wrong. In this 

statute, those specific statutory approaches towards 

stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute. 

They are not in the jurisdictional statute. That's 

important. That's why that's different.

 As to the Leasco example and Bersch example, 

what Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because 

Leasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was 

very important under Judge Friendly's typology. And in 

Leasco, you have this extended line of causation 

beginning with representations in the United States 

about a friendly, tender offer. Then there was a phone 

call, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and 

then there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his 

investment bankers: Go into the London Stock Exchange 

and start to buy.

 That extended line of causation would not 

pass muster under the direct cause test. The direct 

cause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area

under cases like Hemi, that would not pass muster. What 

that shows, and Judge Friendly said that if you have a 

foreign Plaintiff, the direct cause is appropriate, that 

shows that the direct cause test is narrower, it's a 

screening device, and it limits the possibilities when 

you have a foreign Plaintiff.

 Now, that is a proper way to cabin the 

private cause of action. Taking an eraser to the 

statute and saying: The only words that count are on an 

exchange, doesn't do it if you are going to keep a 

linkage between the private cause of action and the 

expressed words of the statute. If that can't do it, 

what are the other tools? And the other tools are the 

direct cause test, and this Court has been very ably 

working through some of these difficult fact patterns in 

the RICO area.

 Now, in this case, there is not the problem 

that there is in Hemi; there is not the intervening 

cause. You have a related party, NAB, that may or may 

not be involved that allegedly is broken -- breaking the 

chain of causation. It is -- has to be, under that 

doctrine, a totally third party, as it was in Hemi, 

where you have the State of New York, the City of New 

York and had all these bouncing balls going back and 

forth. This is a straight shot between that MSR being

fabricated in Florida and going on to the financial 

statements. There is no intervening cause.

 And even if we assume that in some senses, 

it was normal to look at those financial statements, 

that in and of -- of itself has failed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
