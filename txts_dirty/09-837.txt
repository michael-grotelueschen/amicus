3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 09-837, Mayo Foundation for Medical 

Education and Research v. The United States. 

6  Mr. Olson. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Congress expressly exempted from Social 

12 Security taxes wages paid to a student who is enrolled 

13 and regularly attending classes. The medical residents 

14 at Petitioners' schools are enrolled and pursuing a 

formal accredited curriculum that has a rigorous core 

16 curriculum, as I said; hundreds of classes, conferences, 

17 lectures; laboratory research; written exams; grades; 

18 and intensive, hands-on clinical patient training under 

19 the supervision of faculty members.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, are -- are all 

21 institutions that employ residents schools? 

22  MR. OLSON: I don't know -- I don't know 

23 whether all -- as I understand, the resident program, 

24 which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for 

Graduate Medical Education, does involve an

1 accreditation program which would probably fit -- where 

2 it's taking place, would probably fit the definition of 

3 schools. That is certainly not an issue in this case. 

4 There are -- these -- the institutions that we 

represent -­

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it might -- it might 

7 be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to 

8 have residents who are not working at, quote, "schools," 

9 subject to the FICA tax, and other residents whose 

training is approximately the same escape the tax. 

11  MR. OLSON: Well, that was a judgment that 

12 Congress made. Congress made the exemption with respect 

13 to students, and it tied specifically in to someone who 

14 is enrolled and regularly attending classes -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can't give me the 

16 reality there. Are all resident programs conducted in 

17 schools, or are there resident programs that would not 

18 qualify because they take place in institutions that are 

19 not schools?

 MR. OLSON: The only reason I'm hesitating, 

21 Justice Ginsburg, is I don't know the entire universe 

22 out there. Every program, residents' program, that has 

23 been involved in the various cases that have discussed 

24 this have been at schools or universities or colleges. 

I'm aware of no program that involves residency and

1 resident programs accredited by the ACGME that is not 

2 involve in and does not take place in a school or a 

3 university or college. So it could be something out 

4 there that I am not aware of, but I'm not aware of 

anything of that nature. 

6  It is undisputed that these individuals in 

7 these residents' programs are enrolled and that they are 

8 regularly attending classes by various definitions of 

9 the word "class." The clinical experience that they are 

receiving in hospital rooms, in lecture halls, in all 

11 circumstances that they're involved in, are educational. 

12 They are classes, and it is undisputed -- undisputed -­

13 that the purpose of these programs is to educate doctors 

14 so that they can achieve board certification and 

hospital privileges. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, are residents 

17 supervised their entire 40 to 80 hours? Is there an 

18 attending physician standing over their shoulder and 

19 looking at what they're doing?

 MR. OLSON: Well, there's two parts to that 

21 question. The answer to the second part is: Of course 

22 not. There is not a supervising attending physician 

23 standing over their shoulder at every moment, but they 

24 are being supervised at all of the time during their 

residency program; that is to say that the work that

1 they do is under the supervision, in that broad sense, 

2 of an attending physician who looks over what they do, 

3 comments on what they do, and so forth. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What I -- how I look at 

this case is: How do you draw the line between a 

6 student who is working and a worker who is studying? So 

7 the issue for me is: Is the Treasury Department's 

8 identification of how to draw that line unreasonable? 

9 Do we owe them deference?

 MR. OLSON: Well -­

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's use the example 

12 that's been floated around the briefs: the general 

13 counsel of the university who takes classes to increase 

14 his knowledge. Is he a student who is working, or is he 

a worker who's studying? 

16  MR. OLSON: There is -- well, the various 

17 courts that have considered this have found the 

18 statutory provision -- that Congress has spoken to the 

19 subject. It has provided an exemption for students, and 

it has provided its own limitations. You have to be 

21 enrolled and regularly attending classes -­

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't the general 

23 counsel who's going to, let's assume, either three 

24 classes a week or 6 -- 6 hours of classes, is working 

40 hours as general counsel, and he's regularly enrolled

2  MR. OLSON: Well -­

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't he part of the 

4 exemption?

 MR. OLSON: The -- the Internal Revenue 

6 Service imposes a predominance requirement with respect 

7 to this. The courts that have considered it have said: 

8 This is not a question of law; it is a question of fact. 

9 Is someone really a student or not? Common sense and 

common understanding of the word "students" would lead 

11 one to the conclusion of that. I -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why wouldn't common 

13 sense lead you to the conclusion that if someone is 

14 working 40 unsupervised hours without an attending 

physician at their side, taking care of patients, that 

16 that's really not a student? That's what the Treasury 

17 Department is saying. 

18  MR. OLSON: Well, that is what the Treasury 

19 Department is saying. But, first of all, you have to be 

an employee for this provision to apply at all. This 

21 provision -­

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think 

23 receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make 

24 you an employee of someone?

 MR. OLSON: No. No. In fact, the

1 government will say that the amount of remuneration is 

2 immaterial. The government says that in its 

3 regulations. The IRS says that, and it has said it for 

4 many, many, many years. And right from the beginning, 

the amount of the remuneration has no significance at 

6 all. 

7  The fact is, as every court that has 

8 considered the question has concluded, is that these 

9 residents are under supervision. It -- you may be 

supervised if someone's not standing over your shoulder. 

11 If they review at the end of the day or at the beginning 

12 of the -- of the course what you've done, what you -­

13 what you -- what situations you've encountered, the 

14 standards that are being applied -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why doesn't that -­

16 assume it's not the general counsel of the university 

17 but a lawyer working in the general counsel's office. 

18  MR. OLSON: Well -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He's being supervised by 

the general counsel, his work's being reviewed, and he's 

21 attending classes at night. 

22  MR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, that 

23 is a different case. This is a refund action based upon 

24 the situation -- the facts are on the ground with 

respect to these residents. That is not the case here.

be excluded by the predominant requirement -­

6 predominancy requirement, which we're not challenging, 

7 which is not involved in this case, and the Government 

8 hasn't challenged here. 

9  These individuals cannot achieve what they 

need to achieve for board certification and hospital 

11 privileges except by having clinical experience. That 

12 is -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what they want to 

14 achieve is a higher long-term pay, but they can go out 

and work as doctors.

18 cases, in -- in a very, very narrow circumstance can 

19 they work as doctors. They won't have hospital 

privileges. They won't -­

22 percent of the physicians were not board certified.

4 be board certified. It's an enormous impediment, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how about the 

6 architect residents who are working in universities? 

7 Are they medical -- like medical residents as well? 

8  MR. OLSON: Well, they may be. I haven't 

9 studied whether an architect, if they are in a school --

Congress decided what this exemption would cover. It 

11 says: If you are a student enrolled in a school, 

12 university, or college, and you are regularly attending 

13 classes, then you would be covered. 

14  Now, that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, why not read 

16 that provision -- now we are going to the statute -- if 

17 such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as 

18 saying, look, there's a student status, and the service 

19 is distinct from the student's status?

 Take the typical work/study program in a 

21 college. That would seem to fit this language to a tee. 

22 There's a student, and the student is working part time, 

23 but you are -- there -- there is no independent 

24 significance to the term "student" as you read the text; 

that is, the student and the services are all together.

2 there." It's -- the student is -- the education is the 

3 service. 

4  MR. OLSON: Well, the services are performed 

for the purpose of receiving an education. As -- as the 

6 Internal Revenue Service construed this provision, up 

7 until the fact that they lost several cases, was that if 

8 your purpose was to achieve or pursue a course of 

9 studies -- that's the old regulation. If your -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't -- wouldn't 

11 this fit the work/study student who is studying 

12 philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech 

13 department? 

14  MR. OLSON: I didn't hear that last word.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- it seems to me 

16 that -- what came into my mind when I read these words 

17 was a work/study program where the student is studying 

18 and that's the status of student. The work is separate 

19 from that. It's not necessarily to advance the person's 

education. It's to give the student some money. So 

21 that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this 

22 was describing student status, okay; and the student is 

23 also working for some money. 

24  But you seem to say that the service -­

that -- that it's -- the student status is not

1 independent from the service. 

2  MR. OLSON: Well, this -- absolutely, that's 

3 true in this case. The students -- the service that the 

4 students are performing in hospital rooms, looking at 

patients, listening to lectures, working in 

6 laboratories, is a part of what they're getting paid 

7 for. 

8  So they have to be an employee to begin 

9 with, in order for this exemption to apply. They 

have -- it might be -- it's -- I don't know whether you 

11 have in mind someone being paid for -- by someone 

12 outside the school, but this -­

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I have in mind the 

14 typical work/study program. The -- the student signs up 

for work/study and may be assigned to work in the 

16 administration, helping out with clerical things there. 

17 But the student status is one thing; the services are 

18 another. 

19  Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that 

the earnings of the student in the work/study program 

21 would not be subject to FICA? 

22  MR. OLSON: Well, the government's got 

23 various categories of examples. The situation that 

24 you've just described sort of falls close to one of 

those examples, but this is -- that is not this case.

1  The government would say, I would think, 

2 that if you are a student, even though your service is 

3 unrelated to your education, you would fall within the 

4 exemption. I think that's one of the examples that the 

government gives. 

6  I might have guessed that it would come out 

7 differently. But in this case, the purpose for the 

8 service is education. The goal of the service is 

9 education. It's not to earn a living. And -- and it's 

-- and the goal of the universities is not to make 

11 money. It is to provide -­

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you keep 

13 focusing, Mr. Olson, on -- on this case. And one of the 

14 things that I think is important in the tax code is that 

you not have litigation of each different case, so the 

16 different courts are coming out with different rules. 

17 And, at the end of the day, you put one next to the 

18 other, and it looks pretty hard to tell the difference. 

19  So why doesn't it make sense simply to refer 

to -- defer to the Service's interpretation? 

21  MR. OLSON: Well -­

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You go back and -­

23 both of you go back and forth with hypotheticals, each 

24 of which sort of supports, but this basically a very 

familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an

1 employee and both a student, and to try to draw the line 

2 in some categorical way doesn't make sense. The only 

3 way you can draw the line is to have somebody say: This 

4 is going to be the line. And if anybody is going to say 

it, it ought to be the IRS. 

6  MR. OLSON: Well, I know we're in the 

7 Supreme Court, but five courts of appeals that 

8 considered this said that the language is clear. It 

9 does not admit to a categorical exclusion of residents 

in programs like this. It -­

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, those five courts 

12 did it before -- most of those opinions were rendered 

13 before the new regulation.

government having -­

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only one of them -­

17  MR. OLSON: The government having lost based 

18 upon the words of the statute and the regulations that 

19 they had promulgated that had to do with the goals, the 

purpose, the objective, and the nature of the 

21 activity -- lost every one of those cases and said: 

22 We're going to adopt a regulation that does have the 

23 virtue that the Chief Justice mentioned of -- of being

2 student exemption, or if you're only doing it during the 

3 daytime -­

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Is it -- is it -- the -­

the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question -- I was 

6 uncertain. Suppose a student is working 45 hours a week 

7 in the grounds department cutting lawns, and he does -­

8 cutting the school lawn, and he earns enough money to 

9 help with his way through college. Now, I thought, 

under this, that he is not within this statute because 

11 it's 45 hours and not 40? 

12  MR. OLSON: Oh, yes. The -- the United 

13 States -­

14  JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. OLSON: -- would take the position that 

16 it's not 45 hours. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: That it's not -- okay. 

18 So -- so, what they're doing is -- it started out with 

19 the word "student" and the word "service performed" in 

the statute. Then, for many, many years, they have 

21 talked about the employment, how it has to be an 

22 incident to the study. And "incident" is the key word. 

23  And so now what they've done is interpret 

24 their own word "incident" as saying if it bulks too 

large in comparison with the -- with the studying, it's

1 not incident to the study; it's a separate thing. And 

2 that's true whether it happens to be medical school or 

3 it happens to be lawn mowing. They can't -- they don't 

4 want it as so big in comparison to the study that it's 

not really part of trying to get the study. It's just 

6 too big. And they use the 40 for that.

12 part in terms of 40 hours a week?

"incident" we mean it can't bulk too large -­

6  MR. OLSON: Well -­

7  JUSTICE BREYER: -- in respect to the whole. 

8 So the problem for you is not that it's not education. 

9  MR. OLSON: That -- that -­

JUSTICE BREYER: It's that the work is the 

11 education. 

12  MR. OLSON: That last step that you made is 

13 just like Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's "Through the 

14 Looking Glass": A word is what I say it is.

 It -- the work that the -- the residents do, 

16 the services they perform are all incident to the 

17 educational process. There's no dispute that the goal 

18 is the education, both from the standpoint of the 

19 university and from the standpoint of the student, that 

that is what is accomplished. And what -­

21 Justice Breyer, what they've said is because you are

3 somehow they're no longer a student. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, there has been 

a concern expressed that if we accept your position that 

6 residents are students, it will have ramifications for 

7 other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor 

8 Relations Act. Suppose the residents wanted to organize 

9 and collectively bargain. If they're students, they 

can't do that. 

11  And let's take the Title VII and the other 

12 antidiscrimination in employment statutes. If they're 

13 not employed, if they're students rather than employees, 

14 then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation.

 MR. OLSON: That is the fallacy that the 

16 government is making, that you have to either be a 

17 student or an employee. That argument is not correct, 

18 because in all other respects, these residents are 

19 employees. The exemption provided in 3121(b)(10) does 

not come into play unless you are an employee. 

21  So for all those purposes, Title VII, the 

22 Fair Labor Standards Act, and so forth -- those are 

23 other statutes that define the term in a certain way. 

24 What the -- what the code says in 3121(b)(10) -- that 

you are an employee, but if you are an employee of a

4 FICA taxes. It doesn't have any other implication.

 And the Government's position in that 

6 respect, and the argument that's made in the other 

7 briefs, is -- are classic red herrings. They distract 

8 from the real issue. 

9  You don't have to be either an employee or a 

student. In fact, you have to be both for this 

11 exemption to apply, and that is what is happening here. 

12  Now, again, this is -- there may be 

13 circumstances where there might be something that's 

14 close to the line and the government might say, well, 

you're not really a student. And the government really 

16 tried that in the Second Circuit, in the Sixth Circuit, 

17 and the Eleventh Circuit, and -- and the Seventh 

18 Circuit. And in each one of those cases, the court -­

19 and uniformly, all five circuits, including the Eighth 

Circuit -- until the government decided to change the 

21 regulation to say, essentially, residents are out -­

22 that's basically what they said. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: I looked it up in the 

24 dictionary, and the meaning number 1 b of "incident" is: 

an accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or

1 condition. Minor. In other words, there's the big 

2 thing, and then there's the incident. 

3  Now, if that's the meaning, well, this says 

4 40 is trying to get at whether it's minor or the whole 

-­

6  MR. OLSON: That's the same dichotomy that 

7 doesn't exist. The -- the person is a student. They're 

8 just doing it long and arduously, and they're doing it 

9 for several years so that they can be board certified as 

good doctors in their specialty. 

11  The idea that somehow you are a student if 

12 you do it for 39 hours, and if you do it for 41 hours -­

13 the programs are rigorous. They -- they have been 

14 designed by the accreditation programs to be rigorous, 

so that the -- a doctor will see lots of patients, do 

16 lots of clinical work, because that, according to all of 

17 the record in all of the cases, is where the education 

18 takes place. 

19  You need the classes. You need the 

laboratory. But you need to work with patients doing 

21 the things that we want doctors to be doing with respect 

22 to us when they are certified as a specialist in 

23 neurology or whatever it might be. 

24  So Justice Breyer, the idea that -- this is 

a classic definition of not only an arbitrary but a

3 the things where you would have to be a student, and 

4 you're doing the types of things that you would make -­

make you a student, and you're doing it for the purpose 

6 that would make you for a student, but if you do it a 

7 little bit too much, you're too much of a student, and, 

8 therefore, you're not a student. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's because -­

MR. OLSON: It doesn't make sense. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: -- of the second meaning 

12 here. It's very surprising, I found, first reading the

22  So they're trying to work out, with that 

23 word "incident," is the studying of greater or principal 

24 import? And what they're saying is, when it's 40 hours

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

12  MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

13 please the Court: 

14  FICA student exemption covers individuals 

who are predominantly students but perform incidental 

16 employment for their schools. It does not cover 

17 Petitioners' medical residents. They are full-time 

18 employees, and the Treasury Department has reasonably 

19 concluded that an employee's paid work does not make him 

an exempt student, even if he also learns from his job. 

21  And that's true for three reasons. First, 

22 the text of the student exemption makes clear that it's 

23 not a broad exclusion for apprenticeships and other 

24 learning jobs. Instead, it's a narrow exemption that 

applies only to students performing services for a 

24

Official 

1 school, college, or university where they're enrolled 

2 and regularly attending classes. 

3  And, second, when employees are working long 

4 hours and being paid substantial amounts, they and their 

employers should be helping to fund the Social Security 

6 system, and they should be earning credit towards 

7 benefits so that they and their families will have 

8 something to fall back on if they become disabled or 

9 die.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the question is whether 

11 someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why 

12 shouldn't we ask: Why are they enrolled in this 

13 program, and why is the institution enrolling them in 

14 the program?

 Why are residents enrolled in the program? 

16 Are they enrolled in the program to make money, or are 

17 they enrolled in the program either because it's a 

18 licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want 

19 additional education, and why is the institution hiring 

them? Is the institution hiring them to get the value 

21 of their services or is it hiring them for educational 

22 purposes? 

23  MR. ROBERTS: It's probably both, Your 

24 Honor, but it's not workable to determine student status 

by looking in a particular case whether the predominant 

25

25

Official 

1 motive or the motive of the employee or the employer is 

2 education. People who -­

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in general, though. 

4 In general, why are residents -- why do medical school 

graduates become residents? Do they do -- are they 

6 doing that because they want to earn the 40 to $50,000 a 

7 year that they're paid, or are they doing it for some 

8 other reason? 

9  MR. ROBERTS: I think they're doing it for 

both -- for both reasons, Your Honor. But many, many 

11 individuals pursue their jobs for the primary purpose of 

12 learning, like judicial law clerks, like other 

13 apprentices. But they're not excluded -- they're not 

14 covered by this exemption.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because they don't work 

16 at schools. 

17  MR. ROBERTS: Because they don't work at 

18 schools, colleges, and universities, and they, you know, 

19 may not be enrolled and regularly attending classes. 

And so the Treasury reasonably concluded that because 

21 this isn't a general exemption for apprenticeships, that 

22 they shouldn't construe it as providing a special 

23 exemption for apprentices who happen to be employed by 

24 schools, colleges, and universities. And -­

JUSTICE ALITO: What if they -- on average 

26

25

Official 

1 they were paid $10,000 a year? Would it be the same? 

2  MR. ROBERTS: Yes. If they would -- if 

3 their work -- I mean, here, basically, they have work, 

4 and the argument is that that work qualifies them as 

students. And what the -- what the Treasury Department 

6 has concluded is that it's going to treat work and study 

7 as distinct categories in deciding whether somebody is 

8 predominantly a student, and that it's not going to 

9 count the work as study even if there's some educational 

component to it. 

11  And that's reasonable for several reasons, 

12 as I said. First, because the statute just isn't a 

13 general provision that's designed to cover 

14 apprenticeships. And, second, because when people are 

primarily workers and they're working for long hours, 

16 they should be covered and participating in the FICA 

17 system. 

18  And, finally, it -- it would be very 

19 difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis what's 

their purpose, what the employer's purpose. You know, 

21 is this job more like study? Is this job more like 

22 work? And on that basis -- and to, on that basis, 

23 decide whether that should make them a student. 

24  So considering all of those things, the 

Treasury has decided to draw a bright line and say: 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Study is study; work is work; and if you're not a 

2 student independently of that, then your work doesn't 

3 make you a student. And the Treasury has also decided 

4 that if you're working full-time, that then you're 

predominantly an employee rather than predominantly a 

6 student, and you're not covered by the exemption. 

7  In addition, FICA's historical development 

8 indicates that the student exemption doesn't cover 

9 medical residents, because at the same time that 

Congress enacted the student exemption, it also enacted 

11 a separate exemption for medical interns, and it decided 

12 not to include residents in that exemption. And those 

13 actions would have made little sense if the student 

14 exemption had the scope asserted by Petitioners.

 And then, in 1965, Congress repealed the 

16 intern exemption in order to give young doctors an 

17 earlier start in building up Social Security coverage. 

18 And that repeal also wouldn't have achieved its purpose 

19 if many and most residents were covered -- were excluded 

from FICA under the student exemption. 

21  These -- these residents are people. 

22 They're working between 50 and 80 hours a week. They're 

23 working over a long period of time, and they're 

24 providing critical patient care with minimal 

supervision.

2 the school said: You have to get all this clinical 

3 experience, but we're going to pay you for the first two 

4 hours of the day that you're doing that. Does that 

change the analysis at all? 

6  You seem to be focusing on how many hours 

7 they're working. But what if the school says: Well, 

8 look, we recognize some of this is going to school and 

9 some of this is working; so, just like the IRS, we're 

going to have an arbitrary rule and we're going to say 

11 you're being paid for the first two hours. 

12  MR. ROBERTS: Well, the rule is that the 

13 paid work doesn't count towards student status, and it 

14 wouldn't -- it doesn't count whether you're doing it for 

4 hours, for 10 hours, or for 40 hours. So, in a

17 only working for paid time for a certain amount, that

you accept their classification, it looks more like the 

21 work is incidental to their status as a student. The

12 individuals have to be engaging in that to qualify as 

13 students and performing -- giving somebody something of

17  MR. ROBERTS: Clinical work can qualify as a 

18 course under certain circumstances. But the clinical 

19 work that medical students are doing, if you're 

referring to that, is of an entirely different order 

21 than the work -­

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it certainly can if 

23 they're a -- if they can be a student in the last year 

24 of medical school, and they -- they're doing 

subintern-level work. That's a clinical program where

Official 

1 they would be categorized as students. 

2  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, it's clinical work, but 

3 it's -- but it's very different than the work that the 

4 residents are doing.

 First, there's the distinction that the 

6 residents are getting paid and that the medical students 

7 are paying tuition. But, secondly, from that the 

8 residents are providing valuable patient care. Medical 

9 students are primarily participating in the clinical 

activities solely in an educational capacity. And I can 

11 -- if I can describe the different things that they're 

12 doing. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: We now have a lot of 

14 briefs -- we now have a lot of briefs filed in this 

Court by -- in which a lot of the work is done by 

16 students in law school. I assume they're getting credit 

17 for that. Is that -- is that not a course?

21 not a course? 

22  MR. ROBERTS: It -- it might be a course, 

23 Your Honor, but they're also engaged in other classes

3 I'm questioning why you're resisting the proposition 

4 that clinical work can constitute a course.

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not resisting the 

6 proposition that clinical work can constitute a course. 

7 What I'm saying is that when you're -- when you're being 

8 paid to provide services, that doesn't count as a 

9 course, because the IRS has decided to treat work and 

study as distinct categories in -- in applying this 

11 exemption, and that that's a perfectly reasonable 

12 distinction. 

13  Nothing in the statute precludes them from 

14 doing that, and Petitioners concede that -- that it's 

reasonable to interpret the statute as limited to 

16 individuals that are predominantly students. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, do you know 

18 the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is: 

19 Are all hospitals with resident programs schools?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, they're not. 

21 First of all, under the IRS's regulations, the IRS 

22 defines schools, colleges, and universities to include 

23 only institutions whose primary function is the 

24 provision of formal instruction.

 And, second of all, if -- on J.A. 27a, in

1 the record in this case, there's an example of residency 

2 programs that are not students. The -- one of the 

3 hospitals that -- the Hennepin County Hospital that has 

4 University of Minnesota residents also has its own 

residents. And just looking on page 27a, if you have 

6 the J.A., there's a question: Do the Hennepin County 

7 residents -- are they enrolled in any academic 

8 institution that you are aware? Not at the present 

9 time.

 So, that is an example of one, Your Honor. 

11 And that does point out an anomaly about Petitioners' 

12 interpretation of the exemption. Medical residents who 

13 work for hospitals that are operated by schools, 

14 colleges, and universities would be exempt from FICA 

tax, but residents who work for other hospitals wouldn't 

16 be exempt, even though their work is equally 

17 educational. That's just an illustration of the broader 

18 principle that this isn't an apprenticeship exemption, 

19 and that's why, because of that, the Treasury has taken 

this approach to the situation where people are learning 

21 on the job. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, the 

23 Petitioners' brief says twice that there's some 

24 question. Assuming that we hold that the -- the 

residents are subject to the FICA tax, there's some 

33
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 question whether, even if they had to pay the tax, 

2 whether they would be eligible to receive Social 

3 Security benefits or, I take it, credit for four 

4 quarters in full.

 MR. ROBERTS: There's no -- there's no 

6 question, Your Honor. It's always been the Social 

7 Security Administration's position that medical 

8 residents are not students exempt from the Social 

9 Security Act. The Social Security Administration stated 

that in a Social Security ruling as far as back as 1978, 

11 and they continue to adhere to that position. 

12  In addition, as a practical matter, the way 

13 the Social Security Administration determines whether 

14 people get coverage for a particular period under the 

Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come 

16 in, and if FICA tax has been paid, then they put them 

17 down as being covered under the Social Security Act. So 

18 as a practical matter, it works that way as well. 

19  As I said before, these workers who are 

working between 50 and 80 hours a week over many years 

21 for substantial salaries are precisely the kind of 

22 workers whose employers should be supporting the Social 

23 Security system and who should be earning credit towards 

24 disability and survivor benefits. And we would ask that 

the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.

11 benefits. It's quite unclear in the other circuits. 

12 And I invite your attention -- and this is cited in the

pursuing a course of study rather than earning a

13 The Court cited the National Muffler case in the Cottage

Cottage Savings case in the Boeing case just a couple of 

16 years ago. You may tell me that the factors in National 

17 Muffler are no longer something that you would apply, 

18 but they're all sensible factors with respect to whether 

19 you would give deference to a regulation that pops up 

65 years after the enactment of the statute, after the 

21 government has lost five cases on the facts which are 

22 directly relevant to the facts here, and it's a new 

23 regulation, and there has been no reliance.

3 stop you at step 1. Government -- the Congress 

4 addressed the factor at issue in this case. It said 

what students are: People who are regularly -- are 

6 enrolled and taking classes. 

7  To the extent that you get to the second 

8 phase, those factors seem to be appropriate to consider. 

9  If this is important, and if there is some 

anomaly out there, what the government should have done 

11 is turn to Congress, which enacted the regulation that 

12 described student and described what the limitations 

13 were. It had said nothing to do about a categorical 

14 limitation that if you're too much of a student, you're 

not a student. It is backwards. If there is some 

16 anomaly, and if the government wants to collect the 

17 funds from these programs that it has really never 

18 collected them from before, then it should turn to 

19 Congress.
