 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 09-571, Connick v. Thompson.

 Mr. Duncan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DUNCAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case asks when a district attorney's 

office may be liable under section 1983 for inadequately 

training prosecutors. The Petitioner, Orleans Parish 

District Attorney's Office, was found liable for the 

terrible injuries caused to Mr. Thompson by a Brady 

violation on the theory the office was deliberately 

indifferent to Brady training, this despite the fact 

that there was proved no pattern of previous misconduct 

by office prosecutors.

 The district court exempted this case from 

the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed 

analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton 

opinion. There, the Court suggested that a city may be 

liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police 

officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly 

force.

Extending that hypothetical to this case was 

error. It misunderstood Canton's distinction between 

single-incident and pattern liability, nullifying 

Canton's stringent standards of fault and causation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't this something in 

between? Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one 

rookie police officer. Here, it wasn't one rogue 

prosecutor. There were four prosecutors who knew of 

this blood evidence, and there were multiple 

opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them 

apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this 

quiet.

 Now, if we were just talking about -- what 

was his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case. 

But we have the three other prosecutors. And so I think 

it's questionable to characterize this as a single 

incident.

 MR. DUNCAN: I understand your question, 

Justice Ginsburg. Our argument does not turn on whether 

it was one or three or four prosecutors. What our 

argument does turn on is that the theory from the Canton 

hypothetical, which does not require a pattern, was 

clearly at issue in this case. The district court 

analogized to Canton in order to allow the jury to find 

liability absent a pattern.

There is no question that, whether it was 

one or four prosecutors, this is a single incident of a 

Brady violation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this is a 

single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort 

is likely to happen without training, then one incident 

is enough.

 Every prosecutor knows that there can be 

Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady 

means, because it's not self-evident in every situation, 

correct?

 MR. DUNCAN: That's -- that's true, Justice 

Sotomayor. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So if you 

know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors' 

offices are filled with young ADAs who have just come 

out of law school. If you know that they are going to 

meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively 

known, like that if you get a lab report, you should 

turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that 

what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab 

reports?

 Now, I know you claim you had that policy.

 MR. DUNCAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can talk later about

whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the 

jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not. 

That's a sufficiency of the evidence question.

 But if you know that lab reports have to be 

turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not 

to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no 

policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had 

no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible 

for a Canton-like violation?

 MR. DUNCAN: The question is under the Brady 

scenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on? 

Does it fall on the single-incident line or the pattern 

line? We say it falls on the pattern line.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Life doesn't always come 

in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this 

doesn't fit into a single rookie.

 You have -- if you have four prosecutors who 

are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like 

there's kind of a culture in the office that we don't 

turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because 

one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will 

show you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from 

Thompson to have it mean anything.

 So there was misunderstanding about that. 

But what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into

a single incident, it doesn't fit.  So we have a 

situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly 

confronted before.

 MR. DUNCAN: I think the Court has in 

Canton, Your Honor. Let me answer it this way: If we 

pay close attention to the function of the 

single-incident hypothetical in Canton, I think it 

illuminates the kind of notice, the kind of fault, and 

the kind of causation that needs to arise out of a 

general situation.

 So looking carefully, what Canton said is: 

A policymaker who fails to give police officers the 

basic constitutional standard for deadly force, which 

they are not equipped to know in the beginning, and 

without which they --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you tell me -- I 

think I have a copy.

 MR. DUNCAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes. 

This is -- this is -- I'm referring to the -- the basic 

Canton standard is at 390, page 390 of the Canton 

opinion. And specifically, the footnote is footnote 10, 

that discusses the two possibilities, the no-pattern and 

the pattern possibilities.

 So -- and I'm reading from Canton at 

footnote 10. City policymakers know -- "For example,"

the Court said, "city policymakers know to a moral 

certainty that their police officers will be required to 

arrest fleeing felons. The city has armed its officers 

with firearms, in part to allow them to accomplish this 

task. Thus, the need to train officers in the 

constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force... 

can be said to be 'so obvious' that the failure to do 

so" is "deliberate indifference."

 Now, what we have there, as Justice 

O'Connor's concurrence in that case and then later the 

Court's opinion in Bryan County explain, you have a 

failure to inform city personnel of the basic standard 

without which they have no hope of doing their job in a 

constitutional manner. So you put your employees in a 

situation of impossibility, and when a deadly force 

violation occurs, what you have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: These are people who 

haven't gone to law school, right?

 MR. DUNCAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And do not know that you 

cannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?

 MR. DUNCAN: They've got no background 

equipment to know what the constitutional standard is. 

And so that satisfies, in a general situation --

lawyers, it might have been different.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DUNCAN: It could be, Your Honor.

 Here, you're giving --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Depending on the law school 

they went to or what?

 {Laughter.)

 MR. DUNCAN: It could be.

 However, what you are giving to lawyers here 

is the task of analyzing legal judgments. Can lawyers' 

judgments go astray, Justice Sotomayor? Absolutely. 

Absolutely. But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now what you're 

suggesting is that for certainty you know that a 

lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a 

particular area of law is that complicated.

 Your people disagreed -- some of your people 

disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab 

report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when 

you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady 

violation. That has been conceded in this case, so I 

accept as a working proposition that they should have 

known that.

 What you're suggesting is you get a pass 

because, even though you know that there's an area of

law that a young lawyer is not going to be able to 

figure out on their own, you fail to train them and 

you're okay.

 MR. DUNCAN: Well, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not the Canton 

example.

 MR. DUNCAN: That is not -- that's the 

Canton example, Your Honor. What we have here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what you're 

saying.

 MR. DUNCAN: No, that's not what we're 

saying. We're not saying that the policymaker 

inevitably knows my prosecutors are going to make this 

mistake, and so I need to train on it and I don't care 

about training on it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then why don't we 

just --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can we just -- can we clear 

something up?

 MR. DUNCAN: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you -- are you accepting 

the proposition that Brady always requires that lab 

reports be turned over?

 MR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. What we would 

concede in this case is --

JUSTICE ALITO: I know you concede that 

there was a Brady violation here --

MR. DUNCAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- but in answer to some of 

the questions, it seems to me you were possibly -- or at 

least you did not express an opinion on the suggestion 

that it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn 

over a lab report.

 MR. DUNCAN: I'm not aware that it would 

always be a violation of Brady. However, of course, we 

have evidence in this case that the -- uncontradicted 

evidence, that the office policy was to turn over all 

scientific reports. But --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Duncan, could I give you 

a hypothetical -- -

MR. DUNCAN: Sure.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- just to test how strong 

your position is here.

 So let's say that there is a new DA comes to 

town, and he says, there's going to be one attorney per 

case from now on, and it will be a random assignment 

system. So sometimes important cases will be tried by 

experienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by 

people right out of law school. And there will be no 

Brady supervision at all, no Brady training. And there

is a closed file system, that we only turn over what 

we're required to turn over and not anything else.

 And in addition to that, if I, the DA, find 

that you have turned over things that you're not 

required to turn over, that will be taken into account 

in your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary 

purposes, et cetera. That will be very severely frowned 

upon.

 So he, the new DA --

MR. DUNCAN: I'm sorry -- repeat the last 

part again, the "severely frowned upon" part.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: If you turn over anything 

that you didn't have to. Okay?

 MR. DUNCAN: Exactly. I understand.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: If you give any material 

that you're not required to do by law.

 And so he puts into place this whole system 

and -- and says, okay, go to it. And what happens is 

that there are Brady violations. And there's a Brady 

violation in a capital case and the person sits on death 

row, or the person is executed, whichever, and there's a 

claim brought.

 Is that claim not a good claim?

 MR. DUNCAN: If there is a pattern of 

demonstrated --

JUSTICE KAGAN: There's not a pattern, 

because he just came to town and he just, you know, 

instituted all these policies, and this is the first 

Brady violation.

 MR. DUNCAN: Not for the first Brady 

violation, Justice Kagan. But in your hypothetical, you 

noted a policy of actually assigning inexperienced 

prosecutors randomly to perhaps high-profile cases.

 If that were the facts, the jury, as they 

could have in this case, could have found that an 

official policy actually caused the violation. But they 

didn't find it in this case. So the hypo leaves open 

that possibility.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the failure to train or 

supervise in any way and the setting up a structural 

system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady 

violations, that would not be enough?

 In other words, even if the jury said yes, 

you are liable under that second theory -- not the 

policy theory, but the failure to train and supervise 

theory -- that -- that would have to be rejected?

 MR. DUNCAN: No -- exactly, Your Honor. No 

liability there, because it doesn't meet the stringent 

fault and causation standards of Canton.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is that so? The 

-- I've read the instruction that the court gave, and it 

seemed to me the instruction the Court gave was 

word-for-word taken from Canton. And when I read the 

question that you presented in your Petitioner's brief 

-- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case 

was about was an instance where there was only -- it was 

conceded that there was only one such instance.

 But then when I read your second reiteration 

of the question, which is a little different, and read 

the briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones. 

And so what you're really asking us to do is to decide 

in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence 

supports them. I didn't think I was getting into that, 

and, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly 

supports it, but others could disagree. But why are we 

getting into that business in this Court?

 MR. DUNCAN: We're not asking you to.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then what is it 

you're asking? Is there something in the instructions 

that is wrong? What?

 MR. DUNCAN: Yes, the instructions --

incident theory --

I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying, what in 

the words stated are wrong? And where is the request 

that they be stated differently? That I should look at 

that, and that they weren't. Okay.

 MR. DUNCAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. Let me 

help you with that. The -- the -- at the Joint Appendix 

page 828, we have the instructions on deliberate 

indifference.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What's 

the page number.

 MR. DUNCAN: 828.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 828.

 MR. DUNCAN: Joint Appendix 828.

 There are the instructions on deliberate 

indifference. Let me start here, Justice Breyer. These 

instructions are taken from the Second Circuit's Walker 

decision, which was the first court that I am aware of 

to allow for the possibility of single-incident 

liability in a Brady situation.

 The second instruction there allows a 

choice. It allows a choice for the jury to find that a 

single-incident situation -- I'm sorry -- that a

situation involving a Brady decision could arise and be 

a basis --

JUSTICE BREYER: What are the words -- I 

mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are 

pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said. So 

what are the words on page 828 that you think he should 

have said that he didn't say?

 MR. DUNCAN: "The situation involved a 

difficult choice or one that prosecutors had a history 

of mishandling."

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. What he says 

here is, "The situation involved a difficult choice or 

one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling, 

such that additional training, supervision, or 

monitoring was clearly needed."

 So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading 

the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo 

here. It looks to me like he gave those words.

 MR. DUNCAN: That is the -- I'm sorry. Then 

I misunderstood your question. Those are the actual 

instructions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying what is it that 

you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you 

asked him not to do that he did do? That's what 

happens. That's the way you object to an instruction.

MR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. The argument 

is not about the specific jury instruction. It's about 

the legal theory. What it's about --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. If you don't 

object to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm 

saying, that what you're objecting to is you don't think 

the evidence was such that, given that instruction, the 

jury could find guilt. And that's what I thought this 

case wasn't about to begin with, and there are three 

other instances. So I don't see why, given this 

instruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.

 MR. DUNCAN: What our main complaint is, is 

about the failure of the district court to grant a 

motion for summary judgment and a judgment as a matter 

of law on the basis that a failure-to-train theory under 

these circumstances does not permit the single -- the 

single-incident --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understood -- and 

maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there 

was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could 

be handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to 

train for one incident.

 MR. DUNCAN: Absent a pattern. Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it doesn't matter 

what the facts are. The facts that Justice Kagan gave 

you would never constitute an actionable claim against a 

prosecutor; is that your position in this case?

 MR. DUNCAN: That's -- under the Canton 

hypothetical, yes. It would have to fall on the pattern 

side because the general Brady situation is unlike the 

single-incident --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I add to my 

hypothetical, then?

 MR. DUNCAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose that this new 

district attorney said -- you know, every day he came 

into the office and he said: I think Brady is just 

crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the 

Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't 

get caught, anything you do is okay by me.

 MR. DUNCAN: That sounds like a policy to 

me, Your Honor. That sounds like a policy, an 

actionable policy on the part of the policymaker.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a policy. He's 

just, you know, making his views known around the 

office.

MR. DUNCAN: Well, this Court has defined 

"policy" as a deliberate choice to embark on a course of 

action in Pembaur, which this Court accepted. That 

sounds like a policy to me. If it's not a policy --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Then the policy is just that 

you -- you have to turn over what you have to turn over, 

nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you'll 

get penalized for doing so. That's the policy.

 MR. DUNCAN: Well, then the policy is 

constitutional. So what we would look to is, are 

prosecutors failing to exercise their judgment properly 

pursuant to that policy? And that falls very squarely 

within the second part of the Canton choices, which 

requires a pattern.

 This case is about the alleged failure to 

remedy, to guide, to reinforce, the pre-existing legal 

judgment that a prosecutor has by virtue of being a 

legal professional.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so? I mean, you 

are assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a 

course in criminal procedure, and I think there are many 

law schools where they don't even have such a course and 

others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's 

compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure. So 

you're assuming that. And, of course, the time is

running. There's something I wanted to ask you about 

Brady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would 

want special vigilance. And that is, Miranda warnings, 

you know what was said; search and seizure, you know 

what the police did. But the problem with Brady -- and 

this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know. 

If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, 

there's a very high risk, as there was in this case, 

that it will never come to light.

 So, recognizing the legal obligation of the 

prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady 

evidence because it doesn't help the State's case, 

shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking 

about a Brady claim?

 MR. DUNCAN: Well, of course, there should 

be vigilance, but the question you pose, 

Justice Ginsburg, is whether the latency, the 

hiddenness, that characterizes Brady violations should 

change where we locate the Canton violation. Should it 

be enough to put it into the single-incident, so-obvious 

category, or still in the pattern category? But Canton 

doesn't indicate that the latency of a particular 

violation should -- should turn on which category it 

goes into. Instead, it's the nature of the employee 

duties and the employees themselves and how

that situation gives notice to a policymaker about when 

there are obvious training risks. That's what we're 

talking about.

 So to go back to the hypothetical in Canton, 

whether or not a deadly force situation is secret or 

not -- of course, it's not. But the office has failed 

not just to train, but to inform of the basic 

constitutional duty without which those officers have no 

chance of fulfilling their duties. And when they do a 

deadly force violation under those circumstances, the 

causal link will be very strong. It will be strong 

enough to meet Canton.

 And so there you have -- there you have a 

situation where deliberate indifference and causation 

are met without the pattern. But what -- you do not 

have that in the situation of Brady compliance because, 

as -- as everyone agrees Brady involves gray areas. It 

is -- it is impossible to determine beforehand exactly 

why a Brady violation will occur and what specific 

training measures would prevent it from occurring.

 And what that means is this falls plainly 

within what Canton said about the pattern situation. 

And here's what Canton said in the footnote 10 following 

onto the hypothetical. "It could also be that the 

police, in exercising their discretion, so often violate

constitutional rights that the need for further training 

must have been plainly obvious...."

 That's the situation we have posed by the 

Brady situation in general.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But, look -- I 

-- he read the instructions. They came right out of 

Canton. Seems perfect.

 Now you're saying, well, whether they did or 

not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have 

liability if there's only one incident. And at that 

point, I say, gee, I don't know. I mean, maybe it 

depends on what the incident is. Maybe the incident 

involved somebody saying, hey, Brady? What's Brady? Or 

somebody saying, what's a criminal trial? I mean, that 

person needs training.

 And -- or -- but I don't even have to think 

of that here, because there were four incidents here. 

And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird 

hypotheticals. So where we have four instances and we 

have correct instructions, what's the problem?

 MR. DUNCAN: Your Honor, there weren't four 

instances. There was one Brady violation that possibly 

could have involved one to four prosecutors. That's 

one --

 MR. DUNCAN: No. No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All involved -- in other 

words, there has never in this office been an instance 

of a Brady violation outside of this case.

 MR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. That's not 

true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not before this 

case. There was some --

JUSTICE BREYER: After, that's what it was.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- later, as far as we 

know.

 MR. DUNCAN: There were some -- there were 

four reported Brady violations before this case, in the 

decade leading up, involving this office, that had 

nothing to do with the circumstances involved here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. There were four Brady 

violations involving this office, okay?

 MR. DUNCAN: Correct, out of tens of 

thousands of prosecutions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now we're 

talking about not one; we are talking about four --

 MR. DUNCAN: What was -- the Fifth Circuit

even try to prove a pattern, and he did not prove a 

pattern of violations. The Fifth Circuit panel said 

that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This is helpful. Thank 

you.

MR. DUNCAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at J.A. 28 second, 

would the instruction in your view have been proper, if 

the "or" had been replaced by an "and." So: "The 

situation involved a difficult choice and one that 

prosecutors had a history of mishandling."

 MR. DUNCAN: That's closer to what it should 

be, Justice Kennedy, yes, because that begins to capture 

the pattern requirement. It's not -- it's not the 

pattern instruction that was specifically put forth by 

the Petitioners in instruction number 15.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Has there been -- has 

there been any argument that you have waived your 

objection to the instructions?

that legal theory at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, what I'm trying 

to figure out is whether your position is that under no 

circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan 

set forth, could you be charged with a single-incident 

Canton violation. That is your -- your theory?

 MR. DUNCAN: With respect to the Brady 

situation, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Brady situation.

 MR. DUNCAN: Let me answer it this way: 

What -- what the Canton single-incident hypo is talking 

about is failing to provide employees with basic tools, 

without which they absolutely have no chance of 

fulfilling their constitutional obligations. If we --

it's difficult to imagine that situation for 

prosecutors.

 It is -- it's conceivable that a district 

attorney's office set up -- sets up a structure where 

prosecutors have no chance of even knowing whether 

there's Brady evidence in the file. If you have that 

situation, then it's closer to the Canton 

single-incident hypothetical, but not involving the 

exercise of legal judgment in particular cases. We say 

no.

exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what 

you're supposed to turn over? That was Justice 

Ginsburg's question.

 MR. DUNCAN: That's exactly -- that's my 

point. That's my point. If you don't -- if you don't 

even -- in other words, if you don't even have a police 

file, for instance, you can't exercise your legal 

judgment if you don't even know what -- what the 

subject of your legal -- the object of your legal 

judgment is.

 But that's not this case. What we're 

talking about here is a failure to remedy, reinforce, 

refine existing legal judgment that prosecutors have.

write into section 1983 a per se rule that the only way, 

the only way, a civil rights victim can ever establish 

the deliberate indifference of a district attorney is if 

he can prove a prior significant history of assistant 

prosecutors violating other citizens' constitutional 

rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: For -- for Brady 

violations. They limit the principle to Brady 

violations.

 MR. COONEY: Yes, Your Honor. And I would 

submit that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a significant 

limitation, don't you think?

 MR. COONEY: But I would submit, Your Honor, 

that this Court's -- that their requirement for proving 

deliberate indifference is, first, contrary to the 

teaching of this Court in Canton and subsequent cases. 

It finds no place in the language of section 1983 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But at the -- but at the 

outset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong --

that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to 

have a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train 

case. You didn't mention that.

case; is it not?

 MR. COONEY: It is absolutely a deliberate 

indifference to the need to train and provide other 

protections to the office.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think that's very 

important.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, if you could -- could 

you just say as succinctly as possible what you would 

tell assistant district attorneys if you were the 

district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you, with 

the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what 

kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with 

respect to Brady?

 MR. COONEY: Yes, Your Honor. First of all 

I think Canton says you have to look at the specific 

circumstances. And so I don't think there's a 

one-size-fits-all way or message that has to be 

provided.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but you are training 

them, so: Now I want to tell you what you have to do 

under Brady.

 MR. COONEY: Well, first --

Connick's testimony and, in fact, the concession that 

the Petitioners made on pages 6 and 7 of their merits 

brief that the office started with what the brief 

described as "Connick's disclosure policies were no 

mystery" -- turn over what the law required and nothing 

more. I mean, that would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, 

Justice Alito's question was, what you would tell the 

assistant DAs? What's your answer?

 MR. COONEY: And Mr. Chief Justice, with --

if -- first of all, I wouldn't start with that rule. 

But if I started with that rule it would be incumbent 

upon me --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't you start with 

that rule? The rule is perfectly lawful, my goodness.

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I'm not saying it's 

an unlawful rule. However, it requires a countervailing 

message. And if you're going to adopt --

JUSTICE ALITO: I really would appreciate it 

if you'd get to my question. Brady requires that 

exculpatory evidence be turned over. Now, do you -- do 

you think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know 

that?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I don't know that. 

It seems from the record in this case they thought that

only something that screamed "exculpatory evidence" on 

its face needed to be turned over.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Now, you phrase --

you are the instructor. You phrase the lesson that you 

think is required by Brady that has to be given to them.

 MR. COONEY: I think at a minimum it has two 

pieces, Your Honor. It has basic instruction about how 

to go about fulfilling the Brady obligation, and how do 

you go about looking through the file to make sure you 

know what's there, making sure you have documents that 

are in the possession of the police.

 Thinking in advance, as this Court talked 

about in the Agurs case, about what the evidence is 

going to be at trial and looking thoughtfully at that 

evidence to determine whether or not the evidence was 

favorable to the accused and needs to be produced.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. That's your 

instruction on Brady. Now, you're basing liability on 

-- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady. So 

you say they should have instructed on Brady.

 What else should they have instructed on?

 MR. COONEY: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're the -- you're 

the new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct 

my people. What -- what do they instruct on? I know

they instruct on Brady under your view. What else?

 MR. COONEY: I think the second thing that 

the -- that the office really should do is to -- to talk 

about the importance of safeguarding the innocent here, 

that our job is not just to secure convictions.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we're looking 

at -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to 

violate the Constitution. I think that's a good thing, 

to tell them they have an obligation as well to protect 

the innocent.

 But we're worried about violations of our 

constitutional requirements. We know Brady is one. 

What's the next one? What's day 2 in the course?

 MR. COONEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- I do 

think that there are other constitutional requirements 

involved. Most of the hypotheticals, however, that have 

been brought before the Court as a parade of horribles 

aren't actions by the district attorney.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, with respect, I 

really don't think, as a young district -- assistant 

district attorney, that you have told me anything that's 

going to be really helpful to me other than, you know, 

follow the law, which you certainly should do, in 

dealing with my obligation to turn over physical

physical evidence.

 Now, suppose I have -- I have several cases. 

I have this case, where I have got blood -- I have 

physical evidence, I have a blood test. I have another 

case where all I have was physical evidence, but there 

has been no testing of it.

 Now, do I have to turn over that physical 

evidence?

 MR. COONEY: In this case, there has been a 

stipulation by the district attorney's office that you 

do. And I think if you think about the evidence in this 

case --

JUSTICE ALITO: I have to turn over all 

physical evidence that's in my possession?

 MR. COONEY: No, Your Honor.

that you're going to give me to tell me where I'm going

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do I know that 

before the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, didn't they here? 

Didn't they make it available?

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do I know that before 

the physical evidence is tested?

 Suppose I've got all sorts of items that 

were found at the -- at the scene, and they might have 

DNA on them. They might have epithelial samples on 

them -- you know, all this fancy forensic testing that's 

done these days. Do I have to turn over all of that?

 MR. COONEY: No, Your Honor. In this case, 

what we're talking about is a piece of evidence, a 

specific piece, several specific pieces of physical 

evidence, that it has been stipulated the prosecutors 

knew contained the blood of the perpetrator.

 It -- the rule and the training that should 

have been provided in this instance, particularly since 

the DA argues that it was perfectly clear that that 

should have been produced --

JUSTICE ALITO: Now, you see what I'm 

getting at is that you're dealing with a very specific 

situation. So the instruction would be: If you have 

physical evidence and you have tested it for blood and

you have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but 

you don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type 

of the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that 

has to be turned over.

 And you're saying that the failure to 

provide training to every assistant district attorney on 

a question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a 

potential claim, gives rise to a claim?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, what I'm saying is 

I think there are at least three layers to the training 

that were missing here. One was the clear message about 

the importance of Brady compliance. The second was the 

basic ground rules about how you go about your Brady 

obligation. And, third, if you have evidence that can 

conclusively establish to a scientific certainty the 

innocence of the person being charged, you have to turn 

it over or get it -- get it tested. You can't just put 

it in your hip pocket and say, I know --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Wait a 

minute. What evidence is there that they put this in 

their hip pocket?

 There was a disclosure that the evidence 

existed. Where is the evidence that the defense counsel 

didn't have access to asking for it?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or asking for it to be 

tested? Where was that suppressed?

 MR. COONEY: The -- the only information --

there was a discovery response that was filed very 

shortly before trial, long after Mr. Thompson was 

charged with the crime, where in response to one of the 

questions, the response was: "Inspection to be 

permitted." If you look at the chronology --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what -- where's the 

Brady violation for telling a defense attorney there was 

a blood sample there, you can test it?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, there was no 

information provided. It was -- the simple response was 

that the request was for all scientific evidence, and it 

simply -- and physical evidence from the scene of the 

crime. The answer was: "Inspection to be permitted."

 Then the blood evidence, the very next day, 

after the response was provided, was removed from the 

crime lab by the prosecutors, never to be found again. 

And defense counsel testified without impeachment at 

trial that he went to the evidence locker, looked in the 

evidence locker, found certain pieces of physical 

evidence consistent with the discovery response, but not 

the blood evidence, neither the blood report nor the 

physical specimens that were involved in this case, Your

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that you are claiming 

there was suppression of that evidence?

 MR. COONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if it is --

prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional 

rights by making improper statements in their closing 

arguments.

 Do you have to instruct new -- I suspect new 

prosecutors coming out of law school don't know what 

those rules are. Do you have to give instruction on 

what they can say in closing arguments?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think, first of 

all, the issue has to rise to a constitutional level in 

order to be talking about this for section 1983 

purposes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. My 

understanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in 

criminal law. I need training in that. But my 

understanding is that comments in a closing argument can 

give rise to a constitutional violation.

 So you should -- you should train those 

people. You know that. You know that that can happen, 

just as you know there can be Brady violations. So they 

need training in exactly what they can say and can't say

in closing argument.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And Miranda and proper 

supervision of affidavits in support of search warrants, 

and proper instructions that tell the police not to 

exceed the scope of the warrant. So this is -- our 

course is expanding.

 MR. COONEY: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the point of 

concern here is that we're going to have to go through a 

list, case by case, of everything there has to be 

training on.

 MR. COONEY: I think -- I think there are 

some important distinctions here. And, first of all, 

when you're talking about search and seizure, when 

you're talking about Miranda, you're talking about those 

things, the actor that is committing the constitutional 

tort there is not the district attorney. It's the 

police. What we're talking about here, the 

constitutional tort --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you're talking 

about improper comments in closing argument, it is the 

prosecuting attorney.

 MR. COONEY: But the second important 

distinction, Your Honor -- and I do believe training 

should be given there. But I think there's a

fundamental distinction between a Brady violation, which 

happens in private and may never be revealed and, if 

revealed, often happens long after trial and long after 

incarceration, and a situation where a prosecutor makes 

an improper comment during a closing jury, which is made 

in public. Defense counsel has the opportunity right 

there to stand up and say, Your Honor, I object, and the 

court has the ability to address that issue then and 

there.

 With a Brady violation, you don't have any 

of that. It's made in secret. It's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't -- you 

don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think they do. 

But I think there's -- there's a particular issue. 

There's particular force in this context because of the 

unique nature of Brady, because it's made in private, 

because it is -- by definition, if the information has 

been concealed, it has not been revealed prior to the 

time the defendant suffers constitutional harm. He's --

he's found guilty, he's sentenced to death, et cetera.

 The Brady violation, unlike your situation, 

Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't come to light, perhaps ever. 

But in Mr. Thompson's case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have --

MR. COONEY: -- more than a decade after he 

was convicted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's something like I 

was trying to get at before when I said Miranda is out 

there, you know what was said, you know what was seized, 

talking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn't 

come out with it, high risk it will never come out.

 So we have use of force, plus -- that can 

kill people if you're not properly trained. Brady, 

because if they don't come up with the information, it 

could have what almost happened in this case.

 Anything else on this special list?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The concern was that you 

don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical 

law school course before you let them do their job.

 MR. COONEY: I agree with that concern, Your 

Honor. And -- and I think it's important to remember 

that in this case, this was a no-training case. The 

evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson was 

there was zero Brady training in the office.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So what would have been 

enough? I mean, is an hour a year enough? Is an hour a 

month enough?

 MR. COONEY: I think that would have been

dependent on what its content was, Your Honor, and the 

other circumstances of the office.

 If you look at Canton, what Canton does is 

it asks the question: Is there an obvious need for 

training based on the circumstances of this 

particular --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. As I understand it, 

you -- you really have a need to train them, when you 

know defense counsel is coming over to look at the 

physical evidence, don't remove from the locker some of 

the physical evidence.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to give a course 

in that?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, what -- what 

happened is the physical evidence very conveniently was 

being sent to the crime lab when it was removed. And so 

we don't know what the motivation was as to why that 

physical evidence was removed at that time. What we 

know is for many, many months --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, you shouldn't 

have -- you shouldn't have mentioned it. I thought you 

were -- you were asserting that it was intentionally 

removed in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing 

it.

MR. COONEY: What we assert, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that.

 MR. COONEY: It was certainly not -- it was 

intentionally not placed back in into evidence after it 

came back from the crime lab, and there was actual 

testimony from the grand jury that was handling this and 

looking into this situation for some period of time --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, there's a 

MR. COONEY: -- of not just that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There is a causation 

problem here. Even assuming training, if Deegan was 

going to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as he 

admitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lack 

of training is just irrelevant.

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think there 

are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm very concerned 

about that causation aspect.

 MR. COONEY: First of all -- let me address 

that directly. First of all, the causation question was 

put to the jury; the jury instruction very clearly said 

in order for there to be liability here, the fault must 

be in the training program, not in the individual 

prosecutor. And the defense argued vehemently that

there was a lack of causation. What's interesting here 

is --

JUSTICE ALITO: But the judge actually, 

though, instructed the jury -- this is back on J.A. 

828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's 

failure to adequately train, monitor, or supervise 

amounted to -- deliberate indifference, et cetera.

 So liability could have been predicated not 

on the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a 

process by which superiors in the district attorney's 

office reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were 

made by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, the concept of 

monitoring or supervision was actually a concept that 

defendants injected into the case. And so, to the 

extent that there is any concern that there's an 

expansion from training, it's been error that's invited. 

And I don't believe it's error, Your Honor, but it's not 

something that -- that was put into the case by the 

defense or the court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't 

that be error? That the -- the head of a very large 

office is personally liable under Canton for violations 

that are -- that are produced by actions taken by 

subordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to

review all of the decisions that are made by those 

subordinates? Doesn't that go well beyond anything 

Canton permits?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, again, the clear 

thrust of this case was a failure-to-train case. The 

concept of monitoring and supervision was introduced by 

the defense, not by the -- by the plaintiffs. But to 

get back to Justice Kennedy's case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you please state 

in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train 

these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do? 

What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally; I'm 

asking specifically -- what is the exact training that 

was required in this situation that caused the violation 

in this case?

 MR. COONEY: Number one, there was 

absolutely no Brady training at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Forget about no Brady 

training. What -- I think Justice Alito asked this 

question. What specifically would the training have 

said or done that would have avoided this Brady 

violation?

 MR. COONEY: First of all, I think a broad 

statement in training about the importance of 

safeguarding the rights of the accused --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, that seems to 

suggest that you're claiming that if there was an 

intentional violation by the prosecutors, that that 

statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing 

something he or she knew was illegal. Is that what 

you're intending?

 MR. COONEY: No, it isn't, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. So tell me.

 MR. COONEY: The -- the second aspect of --

of it, though, is what I said to Justice Alito, and that 

is that if you have physical evidence which, if tested, 

would establish either the guilt or the innocence of the 

-- of the defendant, it needs to be produced. Or at 

least tested.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes to the 

sufficiency --

MR. COONEY: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether they had a 

policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so 

there was no Brady violation from the failure to test 

here.

 MR. COONEY: The Brady violation was for 

failure to produce; you're right.

right on this? Here -- I read on page 4 of your brief

that it seemed what happened -- and I might not be 

right. Correct me if I'm not. What happened is a piece 

of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the 

prosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what 

it said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was 

type B. And the person on trial has blood of type O. 

Is that what happened?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, certainly what the 

crime lab report said was that the blood that was tested 

of the perpetrator was type B.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the -- and the 

prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?

 MR. COONEY: We don't know that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, that's something --

MR. COONEY: That's the unresolved factual 

question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I see.

 MR. COONEY: And I think that's where 

causation comes in, Your Honor, because I think there 

are two possibilities.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Did it turn out at the 

trial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?

 MR. COONEY: It turned out that Mr. Thompson 

was in fact type O. But the evidence is --

that?

 MR. COONEY: The evidence is unclear as to 

whether or not the assistants knew at the time that John 

Thompson had type O blood.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask you what 

-- most law offices with which I'm familiar, the 

training is mentoring. In other words, the young 

attorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by 

following them along -- around.

 Would it have been an adequate training 

program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors, 

you don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after 

a year, and you're going to follow one of the 

prosecutors around and learn from them? Is that an 

adequate training program?

 MR. COONEY: If, in fact, the senior 

prosecutors, Your Honor, have a good familiarity with 

the constitutional requirements --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. COONEY: -- absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even -- even if the 

violation that becomes the basis for the claim later on 

is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year? We 

-- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year. 

They went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but

there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn 

about this type of question. And --

MR. COONEY: I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that give rise 

to a claim of the sort you're bringing here?

 MR. COONEY: I think the failure here -- and 

I think we have to come back to the deliberate 

indifference piece because what would happen there in 

that instance, Your Honor, even if the training was not 

provided, I think as experience has shown under Canton, 

that claim would fail for failure to show the deliberate 

indifference of the policymaker.

 But here you had substantial evidence about 

Mr. Connick's indifference.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cooney, when you -- when 

you gave the specific instruction that you think should 

be provided to assistant district attorneys, what you 

stated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I 

think. You -- did I understand you correctly?

 You said that Brady means that if the 

prosecutor has physical evidence which, if tested, might 

establish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatory 

evidence that must be turned over.

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, that certainly has 

been the position taken by the district attorney's

office in this case --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is that consistent with 

Arizona v. Youngblood?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I believe it -- it 

is consistent with Brady that if -- if one has a piece 

of evidence that can conclusively establish that the 

defendant is innocent, that it can't be the law that the 

prosecutor can just put it in his hip pocket, not get it 

tested, and not turn it over to the defense, and not 

worry about whether they're prosecuting an innocent man.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, you see, it was 

tested. And it was made available to the defense. 

Turning over -- using the word "turning over" is 

ridiculous, because they're not going to physically give 

it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he 

wants. They're going to give it to a lab that will 

establish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera.

 So it was made available. He went to look 

at it, but the looking at it wouldn't have told the 

defense attorney anything. They had to make it 

available for testing. He never asked for testing. 

They did the lab reports. So now we come down to the 

only failure is in the turning over of this report. 

Correct?

 MR. COONEY: No, Your Honor. First of all,

there is -- there is a stipulation, stipulation L at 

J.A. 14: Prior to the armed robbery trial, Mr. 

Thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the 

existence of the blood evidence, that the evidence had 

been tested, that a blood type was determined 

definitively --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, what did I just 

say? The failure to turn over the report, correct?

 MR. COONEY: But -- but -- yes, Your Honor. 

But what also is present here is the defense never had 

the chance to -- never saw the physical blood evidence 

itself.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Never knew it existed?

 MR. COONEY: Never knew it existed, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's --

MR. COONEY: There is testimony, 

clear testimony to that effect. If you look at Mr. 

Williams's testimony in this case, there is a section of 

the cross-examination where John Thompson's defense 

counsel at the original criminal trial said just that. 

He didn't know it existed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't -- it isn't 

clear from what -- according to what you said earlier, 

it isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from

the defense. It might have just been -- you said it was 

sent to the lab when -- when he came to look for it.

 MR. COONEY: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So would training have --

have gone into that detail? Don't send something to the 

lab when defense counsel is coming over to look for it. 

I mean, you know, that -- that's pretty detailed.

 MR. COONEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, but here 

there's a stipulation that the crime lab report with the 

conclusive evidence about the perpetrator's blood 

type was never --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but -- but that --

MR. COONEY: -- ever provided.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the lab report. 

That -- that's what Justice --

MR. COONEY: And the physical evidence was 

never seen, Your Honor, by defense counsel.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: For all we know, by 

accident, right? And the training would -- would 

probably not have remedied that -- that difficulty.

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, four prosecutors --

it is clear that four prosecutors knew about the 

existence of blood evidence for months, and it was never 

produced to the defense. And that blood evidence would 

have conclusively established John Thompson's innocence.

JUSTICE SCALIA: The defense was told to 

come over and look for it -- to look at it. And when he 

came over to look at it -- for all we know, by 

accident -- it was -- it had been sent to the lab.

 MR. COONEY: But -- but Your Honor, the "it" 

was not come over and see the blood evidence. It was --

there was a broad request for -- for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand, but --

yes. Okay.

 MR. COONEY: -- physical evidence at the 

crime scene, including things that had nothing to do 

with the blood. So there's nothing that the defense 

lawyer would have known by going to the evidence room to 

say: I know there is nothing here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that --

isn't that best practice? In other words, I thought 

that was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does 

is say look at everything we've got. And as my brother 

has suggested, what is important may not be there for 

either deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.

 MR. COONEY: But the point here, Your 

Honor -- and I think this goes to the causation point, 

that -- that it would appear -- it would appear from 

looking at Mr. Williams's testimony that there was a 

deliberate effort to stay away from blood evidence in

the carjacking case. And Mr. Williams conceded that. 

So this idea that this was an innocent error on the part 

of the prosecutors does not find support in the record.

 The question is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it was willful --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that dooms your 

case. If it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an 

intentional violation of Brady, there is no training 

that was going to stop him from doing that.

 MR. COONEY: No, Your Honor, I think there 

is a difference between a tactical choice to do 

something sharp, on the one hand, and a knowing Brady 

violation, on the other hand.

 And the jury could clearly conclude --

particularly because the 30(b)(6) witness in this office 

testified that, in his view, it wasn't Brady material 

unless the -- unless the prosecutors knew John 

Thompson's blood type -- the jury could clearly conclude 

that what happened here was these four prosecutors 

didn't understand and never got a clear message about --

about what Brady required, and they -- they did not 

produce this evidence.

 There is nothing that clearly showed that 

they committed knowing Brady violations in this case.

confused as to sort of how much is enough by way of 

training and how you would ask a court or a jury to 

decide that.

 You suggested to the Chief Justice formal 

training wasn't -- isn't necessary if there's some 

supervision, if there's some mentoring. But, you know, 

this seems to give cities no sense of what they have to 

do. No safe harbors. Is that your position?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think that Canton 

articulates a very flexible test. And I don't think 

Canton says there is one size that fits all. And I 

think the protection that district attorney's offices 

get from Canton is from the standard of deliberate 

indifference.

 And if one looks at the 21 years of 

experience under Canton, there have been between 6 and 8 

cases against prosecutors' offices under this kind of 

theory, in total, where there was some payout from the 

prosecutors' offices to the defense. Total. In the 21 

years.

 So -- and the Court said -- this Court said 

in Canton, judge and jury doing their job are adequate 

to the test. I think we have been spending a lot of 

time focusing on how much training. The fact is, this 

is a no-training case, where evidence that the -- that

the defendants now concede should have been produced 

wasn't produced, and four people knew about it and 

failed to produce it.

 In addition, there were multiple additional 

pieces of Brady material in the murder case that weren't 

produced. And this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would this have been 

-- would this be a no-training case if the rule was you 

have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair 

prosecutor before we let you have a case, and, in fact, 

you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a 

capital case? That's all it says. Is that sufficient 

training?

 MR. COONEY: I think, again, you would have 

to look at the circumstances of the office. I think 

with this -- this presumption against disclosure that 

was present in Connick's office, that takes this case 

out of the realm of the typical prosecutor's case, 

because it is a bare minimum disclosure rule.

 I think there needs to be -- if you're going 

to have that bare minimum disclosure rule, there needs 

to be something to counterbalance it. If you look at 

what the assistants testified to in this case, they all 

knew what not to produce. What they didn't know was 

what to produce.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what do you do with 

the Dubelier testimony? Didn't he testify that it was 

standard operating procedure to turn over all lab 

reports?

 MR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think there are 

two very quick answers to that. If one looks at J.A. 

550 to 551, which was Mr. Glas, the grand jury 

prosecutor's, testimony.

 What he clearly said was, during the grand 

jury, when Mr. Connick decided to terminate the grand 

jury, Mr. Connick and his first assistant were actually 

arguing with Glas that if the prosecutors didn't know 

John Thompson's blood type, they didn't need to turn 

over the blood report.

 So that's number one. I think there is an 

issue of fact that has to be resolved in our favor 

solely from J.A. 550 and 551.

 And the second is, Your Honor, the -- the 

rule, the bare minimum discovery rule. Louisiana law 

did not require the production of crime lab reports in 

1985.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

 Mr. Duncan, have you 3 minutes remaining.

MR. DUNCAN: Justice Alito and Justice 

Kagan, you asked repeatedly questions designed to elicit 

a response from my colleague:  What would you tell a 

ADAs with respect to training -- and I believe Justice 

Sotomayor as well -- that would have prevented such a 

thing? And I didn't hear a clear answer.

 The legal issue in this case turns on the 

fact that, in the deadly force scenario that Canton 

marks out as the paradigm single-incident case, it is 

very clear what a police office needs to tell a police 

officer. Here's the deadly force standard under 

Tennessee v. Garner: Don't shoot people unless there's 

a reasonable probability of physical danger to yourself 

or to others. You've got to tell them that.

 With respect to the Brady scenario, it's not 

clear at all. Yes, of course, training is useful. Yes, 

of course, training is important. But how do you 

connect up a lack of specific training with a particular 

violation that occurs?

 And having heard the argument, I'm -- I'm no 

longer clear as to what the theory of the case of my 

colleague's is about what caused the violation. 

Whatever caused the violation, I haven't heard about a 

specific training measure that would have actually 

prevented what happened in this case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you train 

your new hires? First day, somebody right out of law 

school shows up and says, I want to be an assistant 

district attorney. How do you train them?

 MR. COONEY: I think the first thing you do 

is you have a hiring process that emphasizes the 

important of -- the importance of Brady, as this office 

did. Brady was important. One witness said --

McElroy -- from the moment you walked in the door, you 

had to write an essay on Brady. Brady was emphasized as 

being very important. And then --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Duncan, that I think you 

can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury 

found.

 MR. DUNCAN: I -- I don't think -- the jury 

couldn't have found that that didn't occur, Your Honor. 

The jury found that that was inadequate.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: The jury found that there 

was inadequate training.

 MR. DUNCAN: Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: In fact, the jury found -- I 

think, if you look at the record -- the jury could have 

found, a reasonable jury could have found, that there 

was no training here.

 MR. DUNCAN: A reasonable jury could have

found -- well, Your Honor, we don't contest the finding 

of inadequate training. What we contest is the 

ingredients that lead -- that can lead to a deliberate 

indifference finding on the basis of inadequate 

training.

 And what we say is that this case, that is a 

general case about you failed to train on Brady, it 

doesn't fit within the single-incident hypothetical. 

And what I was trying to get at with -- with response to 

your questions and Justice Alito's question was that, if 

you can't say with any specificity, well, what training 

do you give?

 You asked repeatedly, Your Honor, how much 

training is enough? So is an hour a year? I thought I 

heard my colleague say that an hour a year may make this 

not a no-training case, and so what you have there is a 

pattern --

JUSTICE BREYER: So we have to overturn the 

jury finding?

 MR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. Absolutely 

not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We don't?

 MR. DUNCAN: No, you do not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because they found that the 

failure to adequately train amounted to deliberate

indifference to the fact that inaction would obviously 

result in a constitutional violation. That's what they 

found.

 Now, how can we -- assuming that's true and 

accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there 

was something unlawful? Because you're arguing --

you're all arguing about whether the training program 

really was adequate or not. They found it was not. 

What do we do?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer.

 MR. DUNCAN: Thank you, Your Honor, Mr. 

Chief Justice.

 The correct resolution is the lower court 

should dismiss the failure-to-train claim as a matter of 

law because there was no demonstration of a pattern of 

violations, and this situation does not fall within the 

narrow range of circumstances that Canton foresees for 

single-incident liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
