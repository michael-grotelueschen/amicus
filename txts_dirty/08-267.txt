 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 08-267, United States v. Denedo.

 Mr. Shah.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, 

or CAAF, held that military appellate courts possess 

open-ended jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to 

entertain a coram nobis challenge to the merits of a 

final court-martial conviction. This Court should 

reverse that decision, both because the All Writs Act 

cannot supply jurisdiction that Congress chose not to 

confer and because Respondent is a civilian who may no 

longer invoke the military court system.

 As this Court explained in Clinton v. 

Goldsmith, military courts, as Article I courts, are 

strictly limited to the bases of jurisdiction conferred 

upon them by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or 

UCMJ. Three related aspects of the UCMJ make clear that 

it does not confer jurisdiction over Respondent's coram 

nobis petition.

First, as noted in Goldsmith, the UCMJ 

narrowly circumscribes military appellate jurisdiction 

to the findings and sentences of a court-martial 

conviction. That is a direct review jurisdiction. UCMJ 

Articles 66 and 67, which define appellate jurisdiction, 

do not contemplate any further review within the 

military appellate courts.

 Second, once direct appellate review is 

complete and the military authority executes the 

judgment, UCMJ Article 76 affirmatively forecloses any 

further military court review. As this Court has 

recognized on two prior occasions, UCMJ Article 76 marks 

the terminal point of proceedings within the 

court-martial system.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, how does that 

differ from the general rule that a judgment becomes 

final and has preclusive effect once the appellate route 

has been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired? 

It seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule 

that applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil 

cases, stating when a judgment becomes final for 

preclusion purposes.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, yes, Article 76 does 

that, but it does more than that. As this Court 

recognized in Gusik and in Councilman, it marks the end

of proceedings within the military court system.

 Now, beyond the text, what this Court looked 

at in Gusik -- in Gusik, it was a Petitioner seeking 

habeas review. One of his alternative arguments in 

Gusik was that Article 76 essentially violated the 

Suspension Clause because it -- it marked the end of --

no further proceedings within the military court system 

as well as within the Article III court system. The 

Court agreed with the Petitioner that Article 76 marked 

the end of any further proceedings within the military 

court system. It disagreed that it also effected a 

repeal of Article III habeas jurisdiction, but there was 

no disagreement between the Petitioner, the government, 

and this Court in Gusik that it did mark the end of 

proceedings within the military court system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So therefore one could say 

that that point wasn't decided in the case, right?

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, one could say 

that, but this Court again in Councilman ratified that 

line that the Court drew in Gusik. It -- it reiterated 

the reasoning that Article 76 forecloses any further 

proceedings within the military court system. So I 

don't think it's just dicta. It was relevant to its 

denial of the Suspension Clause claim, and the Court 

reiterated that in Councilman 25 years later.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where in your view, in 

that the government is putting forward, can this -- can 

Denedo go? He said, I was misinformed by my counsel. I 

never would have entered a plea if I had known I would 

be subject to deportation. And he said, I never found 

out about it until what, 8 years later, when the 

government -- 8 years after his conviction, the 

government said, you're subject to deportation. Where 

can he go with that plea?

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, it appears that 

Respondent no longer has any further remedies to -- to 

pursue. But we think the important point is that in a 

general -- in the general case, Petitioner is bringing 

-- the exact same claim the Respondent is bringing is 

normally going to have several avenues of remedy outside 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're assuming now, 

because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that 

he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in 

failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by 

the government's action, so he was unaware and, 

therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier. You 

have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just 

out of any court.

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think it's

important to note that the UCMJ marks the high-water 

mark of process within the military justice system. 

What the UCMJ did is it took the prior system, which 

didn't even allow for real direct review within the 

military court system, and it made that direct review 

system much more robust. It added an intermediate court 

of review. It took administrative review that was 

embodied within boards of tribunals that had typically 

been under the Judge Advocate General. It moved that 

out and gave it greater independence to provide more 

robust intermediate appellate review. It added an 

entire level of a new court, the Court of Appeals for 

the Armed Forces, which provided additional -- a new 

level of review. And then it said still --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, part -- part of 

independence is the assurance that the court has the 

ability to do justice in the case before it, and I think 

the purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect 

the integrity of the court, and that's all this court is 

asking. So that's quite consistent with what you've 

just said.

 MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, in 

enacting the UCMJ, Congress was balancing several 

values. On the one hand, it was balancing the rights of 

service members, but at the same time, it was balancing

the important value of maintaining good order and 

discipline within the armed -- within the armed forces, 

mindful of the military's primary mission in fighting 

wars and defending the nation.

 Now, given those competing values, it was --

it was reasonable for Congress to draw a line at some 

point and say it, the conviction is final and to the 

extent you want to seek further collateral review you 

have to go to the civilian system to seek that review. 

That -- that line is reasonable not only from a 

historical standpoint, but also from a practical 

standpoint, given the institutional limitations --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there collateral 

review available in the civilian system in your view?

 MR. SHAH: Yes, as a general matter there's 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean in this case.

 MR. SHAH: In this case, Respondent no 

longer has any reviews because the time has passed. 

2241 would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the answer is no in 

this case?

 MR. SHAH: No, there is no further review, 

Your Honor, in this case. Now, as a general matter 

there are ample avenues of review within the civilian

court system. For the entire time that a Petitioner 

would be confined, he can seek 2241 habeas relief in the 

Federal court system. Even after --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, you just said 

something about -- you answered my question and Justice 

Stevens' question: This person is out because it's too 

late for him. He was convicted in what, was it --

MR. SHAH: 1998, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And the government 

never said anything about deportation until 2006? And 

they went through -- he twice applied for 

naturalization, is that correct?

 MR. SHAH: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And he was turned down on 

grounds that had nothing to do with deportation. The 

government never alerted him to the possibility that he 

would be deportable. They turned down his application 

with no hint of that, and you say that he is -- he's out 

of time, but nothing counts against the government 

because of that 8-year lapse?

 MR. SHAH: Right. Your Honor, in the 

denials I agree with you that they did not alert him to 

deportation, but it based its denials on his military 

court convictions. So to that extent he was somewhat on 

notice that the military court convictions were posing a

problem to his citizenship, potential citizenship 

status.

 Now, it is true, you're absolutely right, 

that the government did not begin deportation 

proceedings until October 2006, and until that time he 

was not on notice, but the fact that this particular 

claimant -- that the time has run should not be 

dispositive. For example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the time -- I mean, 

the time may very well run in the civil system, and yet 

I take it that under -- you accept Morgan and in the 

Article III system this -- in comparable circumstances, 

this Petitioner could seek coram nobis.

 MR. SHAH: Right. There are two reasons, 

Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And I take it you also -- I 

don't think there's any dispute that the All Writs Act 

applies to the Article I court as well as to the Article 

III court. And I take it -- and I would like your 

response to this. I take it you accept the fact that in 

testimony before the House, at least, at the time the 

present system went into effect the general counsel for 

the Department of Defense, Mr. Taft, testified to a 

House committee that coram nobis would be available in 

the -- in the Article I courts. And if that is so,

isn't the kind of the most reasonable way to construe 

the statute, including Article 76, as allowing for this?

 MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. Mr. Taft's 

testimony that you're referring to was not given at the 

time of enacting of the UCMJ.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What was the occasion for 

it?

 MR. SHAH: That was during a subsequent 

amending process of the act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What were they amending at 

the time?

 MR. SHAH: It was I think it was in terms of 

the 1983 amendments to the UCMJ. There have been 

several --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're way ahead of me 

because I don't know what the '83 amendments would refer 

to. What was the subject matter?

 MR. SHAH: Okay. Well, what Mr. Taft was 

testifying to, we believe, are -- he was -- the specific 

testimony that Mr. Taft was giving was related to the 

boards of correction, I believe, and whether that the 

boards of correction should retain jurisdiction review 

of final court-martial judgments, so his testimony was 

related to that distinct issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, with respect to the

boards of correction, I take it there's nothing 

specifically in the statute that says there's coram 

nobis jurisdiction?

 MR. SHAH: Nothing specific in the UCMJ?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. SHAH: There's nothing specific in the 

UCMJ --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, if he was right about 

that, that would undercut your argument that, with 

respect to a special court-martial and subsequent 

proceedings, there could be no coram nobis because 

there's no specific reference in the statute in either 

case?

 MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. What Mr. Taft 

was testifying to was the state of the prevailing law in 

1983 before the CAAF. The fact that Congress did not 

amend the UCMJ in light of Mr. Taft's testimony -- this 

Court has said on multiple occasions that we don't read 

into congressional silence --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I quite agree. The 

premise of my -- sort of my argument to you a second ago 

was that if we accept the proposition that Mr. Taft was 

making a correct statement of law --

MR. SHAH: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- then the logic would in

effect answer your argument that because there is no 

specific grant of coram nobis jurisdiction with respect 

to special court-martials and subsequent proceedings, 

there couldn't be any. That's the only point that I was 

trying to make.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I don't think we can 

read that into the silence, and here's why. We have 

much more precise legislative history on this very 

point. At the time the provision was enacted, at the 

time the UCMJ was enacted, there was Article 73 of the 

UCMJ provides one means of collateral review within the 

military justice system once a court-martial conviction 

is final, and that's a new trial petition, which is 

limited to certain subject matter and certain time 

limits.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It is pretty limited. What 

is it, it's limited to fact and fraud.

 MR. SHAH: To fraud on the court and newly 

discovered evidence.

 The person who drafted that provision --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it available to 

someone who enters a guilty plea?

 MR. SHAH: It does not appear it would be 

available to someone who has entered a guilty plea. The 

government is not aware of any cases where the military

has granted an Article 73 petition to someone who has 

pled guilty.

 But the important point is at the time that 

provision was enacted, the person who drafted that 

provision testified before Congress and said, we've 

considered the universe of post-conviction remedies, and 

specifically named coram nobis relief, and said that 

we've looked at it and we think the only circumstances 

that warrant appeal within the military court system 

beyond coram nobis are those stated within or including 

coram nobis are those stated within Article 73 

specifically.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you just -- and 

I'm doing this from memory, so my premise of the 

question may be wrong. But I do recall the quotation of 

testimony in the brief, and I -- if I recall it 

correctly, the person testifying said that the 73 was 

sort of a combination of coram nobis and new -- and new 

trial motion practice. But my recollection was that 

there was no statement, or at least it wasn't quoted in 

the briefs, to the effect that this is all there is.

 Now, there was -- it was explaining what 73 

did, but it was not an explanation to the effect that if 

you didn't get under the tent flap in 73 you were out 

completely. Am I correct about that?

MR. SHAH: Well, I'll read the testimony to 

you, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. SHAH: And this appears on pages 25 to 

26 of the government's brief, and it says: "What we did 

was to combine what amounts to a writ of error coram 

nobis with a motion for a new trial on newly discovered 

evidence. We have provided for both of them and to our 

minds they are the only additional circumstances over 

and above the appeal that need a remedy."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I see.

 MR. SHAH: So I think that's conclusive on 

this point and provides a firm ground on which to 

distinguish this Court's decision in Morgan, which you 

referenced earlier, that applies coram nobis in the 

Article III system. Congress considered it for the 

Article I system and rejected it in the military courts.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Does that mean that your 

argument boils down to the proposition that the relevant 

provisions of the UCMJ were intended to eliminate coram 

nobis, or is there more to your argument than that?

 MR. SHAH: I don't think it's to eliminate 

coram nobis. It was never available within the military 

court system.

not quite sure I understand your argument. Maybe you 

can explain why you contend that if the Respondent had 

been convicted in a Federal district court and 

everything else was the same, he would be able to 

petition for a writ of coram nobis, but he can't in the 

military courts. What is the basis for that? Both a 

Federal district court -- a Federal district court is a 

creature of statute. It has the jurisdiction that 

Congress gives it and no greater jurisdiction. It has 

certain what's been termed inherent authority. The All 

Writs Act applies to it. All of those things are true 

of the military courts as well. So what is the basis 

for the distinction?

 MR. SHAH: There are two distinctions, at 

least two distinctions, Your Honor. The first is in the 

Federal court system there is an independent basis of 

jurisdiction when someone is bringing a Federal 

constitutional challenge, collateral challenge to their 

conviction. That separate independent basis of 

jurisdiction is 1331. There is -- there is independent 

basis of jurisdiction. The All Writs Act does not 

confer jurisdiction. The Court made that very clear in 

Goldsmith. What it requires is an independent basis of 

jurisdiction. That exists in Article III courts. It 

does not exist in the military court system. That's the

first distinction.

 The second distinction, Your Honor, even if 

this Court wasn't convinced by that jurisdictional 

argument, is that Congress specifically considered 

whether to -- to allow coram nobis petitions within the 

military court system. The All Writs Act was designed 

to be a residual source of authority to fill gaps within 

the system. It is not --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well -- well, that, as I 

understand, was the argument I started out with: That 

the --Your argument is that the UCMJ was intended to 

eliminate coram nobis if it had been previously 

available. That's your -- that's the argument you're 

making now?

 MR. SHAH: Well, again, I would -- I would 

quibble with the characterization to -- to -- that it 

was previously available. As of the enactment of the 

UCMJ in 1950, coram nobis relief had never been 

available within the military justice system.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the difference 

on the face -- on their face between the relevant 

provisions of the UCMJ and the provisions that govern 

the ability of a criminal defendant in Federal district 

court to get relief after being convicted? There are 

limited avenues that are provided under the Rules of

Criminal Procedure and under the statutes --

MR. SHAH: Right. Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- just as there are in the 

UCMJ. What -- what is the difference?

 MR. SHAH: The difference is significant, 

Your Honor. In the -- in the military court system 

there is only one avenue for post-conviction relief. 

That is, after your -- and I'm speaking after your 

direct review -- appellate review process has been 

complete, there's only one, and that is the Article 73 

new trial petition. Of course, in -- in the Article III 

system there are several independent grants of 

jurisdiction, the habeas jurisdiction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the Morgan 

case said that coram nobis was not dependent on any 

independent basis of jurisdiction. Didn't the Court say 

that a coram nobis application challenging a conviction 

is a step in the criminal case and not like habeas, 

where relief is sought in a separate case and record, 

the beginning of a separate proceeding?

 MR. SHAH: Right. In -- in Morgan, Your 

Honor, the Court was refuting the argument that 2255, 

section 2255, occupied the field and, therefore there 

wouldn't be a coram nobis petition. It rejected that 

argument. But I don't think the rejection of that

argument means that coram nobis, which is still a 

residual source of authority, is available when Congress 

has specifically rejected its application within the 

Article I system.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but you're 

shifting ground a little bit. The tenor of the 

questions from Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg really 

is to the effect: Does coram nobis require an 

independent source of -- of jurisdiction? And I should 

think not.

 MR. SHAH: Well, your --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The whole idea of coram 

nobis is to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction 

the court already has.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, this Court could not 

have been clearer in Goldsmith. It says the All Writs 

Act requires an independent basis, an existing 

independent basis of jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I acknowledge that. 

But there is a source of jurisdiction here. Coram nobis 

is to ensure the accurate exercise of jurisdiction that 

the court has earlier asserted.

 MR. SHAH: With respect, Your Honor, I would 

argue that the past jurisdiction in this case does not 

constitute an existing basis of jurisdiction.

JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose -- suppose that 

the problem was a professional soldier convicted a 

certain number of years ago of a particular crime, a few 

years later through some amazing mistake they wrote the 

wrong number down. The clerk just wrote the wrong 

number of the code provision. That's all.

 MR. SHAH: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it made it a felony 

instead. It was actually a misdemeanor. What's he 

supposed to do? I mean, normally you go back to the 

Court and say: Judge, you know, they just made --

everyone admits it's a simple transcribing error. Would 

you please correct it? Now, how -- how is that supposed 

to work in the military?

 MR. SHAH: If he is still within custody --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No, he's -- he's 

finished his sentence. This is several years ago. They 

just now discovered it, and it could affect him in the 

future that it happened in fact to be a misdemeanor he 

was convicted of. But the -- the code section they 

wrote down is a felony.

 MR. SHAH: Well, if the military isn't 

willing to correct that sort of error on its own as an 

administrative matter and that he needs some judicial 

forum to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, that's right.

 MR. SHAH: -- to get relief, he can go to 

the Court of Federal Claims and bring a Tucker Act 

action. There is a 6-year statute of limitations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, this is 7 years.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SHAH: Well -- well, then, Your Honor, 

he probably wouldn't have a judicial forum.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He can't even do that. So 

nobody in the military, in fact, once their thing is 

final -- then it has nothing to do with it, in your 

view, that he has left the military?

 MR. SHAH: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are saying -- you are 

saying, whether you are in the military, whether you are 

out of the military, no matter how egregious, no matter 

how obvious, there is no route for a military person, a 

professional, to go and get an obvious error corrected 

if -- if he has missed the statute, that there was an --

the civil statute of limitations, it's hard for him to 

go to the Tucker Act. He's been in the Philippines the 

entire time.

 MR. SHAH: Justice Breyer, to make your 

hypothetical work he has to no longer be in custody. He 

has had to have discovered this error 6 years after the

conviction has happened.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it happened. It 

really happened.

 MR. SHAH: The military would have had to 

deny this -- correcting his --

JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to do is 

suggest that I think you -- I can't quite decide what 

stool you want to rest on. Part of this you say, well, 

he's a civilian that has left the military. And then I 

read that. It seems to have nothing to do with it. But 

your other argument seems to be that doesn't matter.

 MR. SHAH: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: No military soldier can 

correct an error, no matter how egregious, even a 

technical -- you know, they just wrote the wrong thing 

down, because Congress didn't want them to. Now, I 

doubt that Congress thought about that. I'm just not 

sure they didn't want them to.

 MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, once 

again, your hypothetical, I think there would be an 

administrative recourse there. And, of course, there's 

always the fail-safe of a presidential pardon if the 

obvious -- if the error is that obvious and that 

egregious.

 Now, you did refer to a second argument,

which is an independent argument, which is that the 

military courts lack jurisdiction for the independent 

reason that Respondent -- it's an independent reason, 

Your Honor, that he lacks any remaining connection to 

the armed forces and, therefore, cannot invoke the 

military courts. This Court held in Toth v. Quarrels 

that Congress lacks power under Article I to extend 

military court jurisdiction over a civilian.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but that's --

that's a different -- that's a different issue from --

from whether it -- it may retain some residual 

jurisdiction to correct an error with respect to someone 

over whom it has had jurisdiction.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, once again, that 

would be relying on the long-expired past jurisdiction. 

It is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- you made that 

point before. And I -- I want to follow up with one 

question on that. As I recall, it was in response to 

the -- to the Morgan argument. The -- the Morgan 

analysis was, well, this isn't a -- a new ground or a 

new assertion. It is jurisdiction as would be the case 

in habeas. It, in effect, is -- is kind of a 

metaphysical continuation of the -- the jurisdiction 

that existed before.

And your response to that was, in effect, a 

Goldsmith response. And -- and you said past 

jurisdiction doesn't mean present jurisdiction. The 

past jurisdiction is over, and that's under -- under the 

statute and under Goldsmith that's -- that's the end of 

it.

 Couldn't that same argument simply have been 

made, however, in -- in Morgan? In other words, Morgan 

was a case in which the point of finality had been 

reached. There was no specific statute in Morgan saying 

there's coram nobis jurisdiction, and yet the Court's 

analysis -- I -- I called it metaphysical a second ago 

-- was that this really was simply a continuation of the 

past jurisdiction. If that was a sound argument in 

Morgan, why isn't it a sound argument with respect to 

the -- the military code here?

 MR. SHAH: Well, because the military --

Congress specifically contemplated that possibility, and 

now I'm going back to my Article 73 argument, Your 

Honor, and to the legislative history which shows what 

Congress was trying to do in Article 73. That is, to 

encapsulate whatever post-conviction remedy it's 

intended to be available within the military court 

system appears in Article 73 that considered coram 

nobis.

JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it did do that, and 

there's -- there is no question that it certainly made 

finality provisions in Article 76. But in the civilian 

system, so far as express provision is concerned, there 

are limits. There are statutes of limitations, and it 

seems to me that the same argument could be made there 

that was made here --

MR. SHAH: Well, I think this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was made there.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think the structure 

of the military court system is different than the 

civilian system, and -- and that goes back to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Outside of 1531, is there 

any structural difference?

 MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. In the military 

court system, Article 76, even though it was first 

enacted in 19 -- in 1950, there were other provisions 

analogous to it. It's always been understood within the 

military system that once a conviction was final and the 

military authority executed the judgment, that was it in 

terms of review within the military justice system, save 

for a presidential pardon. Any further relief to be 

obtained was through an Article III habeas petition in 

the Federal courts. That's the understanding that 

Congress had when it enacted the UCMJ, and that's the

understanding --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You could say the same 

thing, that when the statute of limitations is passed in 

a habeas case or, indeed, after habeas has been fallen, 

so far as the statutes governing Article III courts are 

concerned, that's the end. And yet Morgan says, no, it 

isn't the end. There's this coram nobis jurisdiction.

 MR. SHAH: Well, the difference is in 

Morgan, the Court specifically said that Congress did 

not intend to occupy the field when it passed 2255 

governing habeas relief for Federal prisoners. That's 

not the situation here. We know that Congress intended 

to occupy the field when it passed Article 73.

 So regardless of the jurisdictional 

arguments, Your Honor, there's no right of action, 

there's no right of coram nobis relief within the 

military courts.

 Your Honor, if there are no further 

questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my 

time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. SHAH: Thank you.

MR. FREEDUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Because there are courts, appellate military 

courts must have coram nobis power to protect the 

integrity of their judgments. The court of appeals 

correctly asserted the same coram nobis power that 

Article III courts have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, "they 

must"? Do you think it's unconstitutional to deprive 

them of that?

 MR. FREEDUS: No, Your Honor. We believe 

that they were given the All Writs Act authority as a 

birth right in 1950, and that includes all prerogative 

writs, including coram nobis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what you mean by 

"they must have"?

 MR. FREEDUS: And also, Your Honor, they 

must have the ability to protect the integrity of their 

judgments just like other Federal courts have. The 

superior court in D.C. has the power to issue coram 

nobis to protect its judgments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but -- but is 

it unconstitutional for Congress to say military courts 

are different, they've always been different, the need 

for finality is greater there, and we're conducting a

different rule for there?

 MR. FREEDUS: I think Congress has the 

authority to legislate very broadly in the area of 

collateral remedies, and Congress could take away the 

writ of coram nobis if it left in its place an adequate 

and effective substitute, like it did in 2255.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, oh, oh, so it would be 

unconstitutional if they did not leave in its place an 

adequate and effective substitute --

MR. FREEDUS: Our view is that if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which would cover every 

situation no matter how fanciful, right?

 MR. FREEDUS: No, Your Honor. We believe 

there has to be reasonable opportunity to bring a 

colorable constitutional claim for which there is no 

other avenue of relief, which we believe is the case 

here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- which case 

of ours establishes the proposition that there always 

has to be an available avenue of relief?

 MR. FREEDUS: The best authority we have for 

that, Your Honor, is Webster v. Doe, which we believe 

stands for the proposition that courts should read 

statutes so as not to preclude judicial review of a 

constitutional claim absent an express congressional

intent to do so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's 

different than saying there always has to be available 

relief. That's saying you think Congress usually 

intends there to be available relief. And that would be 

a doubtful assumption here, given the rather clear 

expressions of finality that -- that are -- that are in 

the UCMJ statutes.

 MR. FREEDUS: On -- well, if I could make 

two points, Your Honor. On the first, we don't believe 

that there is square authority for the bedrock 

constitutional proposition that Congress can wipe away 

all avenues of relief for a claim. We believe that we 

were --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you 

don't think there's authority for the proposition they 

can do it?

 MR. FREEDUS: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking for 

authority that says they can't do it.

 MR. FREEDUS: I'm not aware of any, Your 

Honor. We would -- I think we are --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did coram nobis 

relief -- you say it has to be there. Was it ever used 

before in the military courts?

MR. FREEDUS: Yes. I would like to -- yes, 

Your Honor, it has been used since 1966. I assume you 

may be asking about before 1950.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, yes.

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes. Well, the reason it 

hasn't happened before 1950 is that the UCMJ was created 

in 1950, and that was the first time there were military 

courts. There were no courts, so therefore no All Writs 

Act authority prior to 1950.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Worse still. My goodness. 

So you were --

MR. FREEDUS: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- convicted by a 

court-martial and had no basis for -- for getting that 

revised, and that -- that lasted for a couple of hundred 

years, right? And that was okay or it wasn't okay?

 MR. FREEDUS: That was -- I think that's the 

impetus behind the UCMJ, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. I mean, 

you can patch it up and say that they thought it wasn't 

a good idea to have just military courts. But it's very 

hard to make the constitutional argument you're making 

when for a couple hundred years in military, in military 

courts, which are different, there -- there was no 

relief at all.

from this Court to support that proposition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then it comes, as 

Justice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not 

we should read the statutes here in a particular way to 

avoid confronting that question?

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, I think 

where -- we're comfortably in that neck of the woods and 

we really don't need to get closer to the scarier 

question that was alluded to. I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you say it's lurking, 

you're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional 

avoidance?

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, we are.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's much of 

a lurk when for 200 years this was going on. It's not 

lurking to my mind.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are making -- I 

thought that the core of your argument is that the All 

Writs Act applies to all courts established by Congress, 

the military courts are included in that definition, and 

there is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it 

doesn't apply to the military. But the All Writs Act 

requires that the writ be in aid of the court's 

jurisdiction. So if you would spell out how the writ

here is in aid of the military court's jurisdiction.

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor. We believe 

it does it in a very similar way that this Court 

explained in the United States v. Morgan, and that is 

the writ of coram nobis aids the past appellate 

jurisdiction that the Navy court had when it affirmed 

and reviewed Mr. Denedo's conviction. It had 

jurisdiction there.

 And the coram nobis writ by its very nature 

allows a court to correct an error in a case that was 

before it, but it failed to perceive that error while it 

had the case before it. And had it known the facts we 

now know after all the remedies are no longer available, 

the Court would not have issued the judgment that it 

issued.

 That's the -- in that sense, that's how the 

writ aids the jurisdiction the Court had in the past.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's so, then I 

guess you can have courts reviewing the civilians. They 

will review after the event the court-martial 

jurisdiction, the court-martials of people while they 

were in the military. That will become a matter of 

course anytime. I mean, there are many, many errors. 

We have approximately 5,000 petitions a year claiming 

some kind of constitutional error, and sometime they're

right.

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's what you foresee?

 MR. FREEDUS: I would -- yes and no.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What way is it no?

 MR. FREEDUS: No is when the individual is 

not in custody and the six-year statute of limitations 

has expired for all the types of claims that are 

available for collateral tactic of a court-martial 

conviction, a declaratory judgment attack, a mandamus 

attack, Court of Federal Claims attack, all those --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- in other words, in 

the case I posed, he would -- he -- in your view, he 

wouldn't have any remedy, you would agree with the 

government about that, if it's seven years later you 

find a clerical error?

 MR. FREEDUS: We agree. But we don't think 

it's necessary, actually, to decide the issue here. The 

issue here really is whether coram nobis is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if, in fact, you're 

waiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all 

jurisdiction because the statute of limitations has 

expired, why do you need this? Why can't they just go

hasn't existed for 200 years? Why don't they just go to

a civil case?  And moreover, why doesn't your client 

fall within that situation?

 You're claiming that if all the statutes 

have run and everything, there is no coram nobis 

jurisdiction, I thought in your case they had all run.

 MR. FREEDUS: This gets to the other piece 

of the answer I was trying to give, and that is a 

petitioner from the military system could not file a 

coram nobis petition in the Article III courts or the 

Court of Federal Claims because there's no authority 

that supports the proposition that you can take a coram 

nobis petition and attack a judgment from a different 

jurisdiction. Coram nobis has to allow the court that 

issued -- that -- that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying that 

what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis, 

indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was 

in it can bring constitutional challenges?

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, in the 

military justice system.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay, and we see those 

every day, don't we? But there is one difference. The 

difference is that often, though not always, a person in 

habeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system 

conviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the

instance that we're talking about, he can never be 

retried. So in fact the difference would be, in your 

view, the civilians who bring this would never be 

retried if they're right.

 MR. FREEDUS: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so they would have in 

that sense greater protection in the military system 

than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in 

habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not 

always there. Now, why would Congress have intended 

that?

 MR. FREEDUS: I think it's the very nature 

of the coram nobis petition, Your Honor, and that is 

coram nobis petitioners have already served their entire 

sentence, so the societal interest to seek a retrial is 

much lesser than in the habeas case where there's a 

lengthy sentence less -- left, and if someone gets out 

of jail --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

collateral consequences of the conviction are pretty 

dramatic. In this case they decide whether the guy 

stays in the country or is deported.

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so I think 

Justice Breyer's question is still on the table. Why

would Congress intend to afford greater relief and 

remedies to somebody who's outside -- was within the 

military system and is now outside, than to an ordinary 

civilian under Article III jurisdiction?

 MR. FREEDUS: I think there is a classic 

distinction between the habeas and the coram nobis 

petitioner. In a coram nobis petitioner under 2255, if 

they were to file a successful petition long after a 

statute of limitations had expired, they would be in no 

different position than a coram nobis -- a successful 

coram nobis petitioner in the military.

 We would say, we do believe there's a -- a 

colorable argument for -- the ability to retry Mr. 

Denedo, but it's not pivotal to our case. Our view is 

that the inability --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where? Colorable --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the civilian courts or 

the military courts?

 MR. FREEDUS: The military courts, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think you have a good 

answer to what my question was. I thought that was a 

good answer. It's helping me. And -- but where I'm 

slightly -- and maybe this is just not relevant to this 

case or maybe it's for the future. Coram nobis, I

thought, was a writ that means really like technical 

clerical errors or something really unusual. Is this --

I mean, it's hardly ever there.  I've not really seen 

more than a handful of cases.

 So -- so is this writ supposed to be 

available for what you're claiming is what I call a 

typical error of inadequate representation? And I don't 

know the answer to that question, but I think it's --

maybe you could say that's not presented. Maybe that's 

for a later case. I don't know how to treat it. That's 

why I'm asking.

 MR. FREEDUS: I think Morgan is helpful on 

that, Your Honor. Morgan is a violation of the right to 

counsel, and it's this Court's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was -- that question 

wasn't resolved, was it? I thought we were just talking 

about the authority of the military courts to issue this 

writ, and the question that Justice Breyer has raised, 

well, is this ineffective assistance of counsel adequate 

grounds to issue the writ? I thought that question was 

certainly not raised before this Court.

 MR. FREEDUS: Well, the government hasn't 

urged that there's no ineffective assistance of counsel. 

It's not in their opening --

perfectly good answer.

problem which I'm trying to think through: Where are we 

going with this?

way or the other way? That's why I asked the question. 

So all I'm asking is your best thought on it.

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor. I think 

United States v. Kwan and United States v. Castro are 

two court -- two cases that give the answer to your 

question and both of those indicate that ineffective 

assistance of counsel in very similar factual 

circumstances to this is a basis for coram nobis relief 

after -- after the ineffective assistance is discovered.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Military courts now since 

1950 have quite a record of saying coram nobis is 

available in these courts. However, they have routinely 

thrown out the cases on the merits. Is there any case 

within the military where the military has said anything 

like inadequate assistance of counsel qualifies as a 

reason to grant the writ?

 MR. FREEDUS: Aside from this -- this case 

below, Your Honor, I don't know of a case that raised 

ineffective assistance of counsel. And you are correct 

that the vast majority of these cases are thrown out of 

court in the most -- in the briefest of orders. There 

are cases where relief has been granted. They are few 

and far between. Del Prado is one. It involved a 

compositional jurisdictional error to the -- to the 

court. An individual failed to elect military judge 

alone in writing and waived the right to have a -- a 

member's jury trial, and that was deemed a 

jurisdictional defect. And long after the case was 

final the conviction was set aside, and I would note the 

Court in that case observed the personal jurisdiction 

was no obstacle to granting the coram nobis relief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that person retried, do 

you know?

 MR. FREEDUS: I do not know, Your Honor.

decision indicates that he was restored all rights and 

benefits, but it stops shy of saying, you know, here's 

your uniform back.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand correctly 

that since 1989 there were a total of 30 coram nobis 

petitions filed, and of those only 4 were granted?

 MR. FREEDUS: The statistics that we cited 

in our brief, Your Honor, were ten coram nobis petitions 

at the court of appeals within the last 10 years --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. FREEDUS: -- and 176 writ appeals from 

the lower courts up to the court of appeals that don't 

break out the category of writs. They could be habeas, 

they could be coram nobis, mandamus, so we don't know 

what percentage of the 176. But even if it was a -- a 

significant percentage, it's still a tiny percentage of 

the court's overall docket.

 But they are rarer than hen's teeth, Your

jurisdiction of the military court in the circumstance 

where the individual is still in the military, he's been 

convicted, and he is in custody? So he wants to get out 

of custody. Now, what's the theory of that? He can --

I take it it's accepted, is it, that they can, that such 

a person can ask the military justice system -- I don't 

know which court -- for release on the ground that he 

didn't -- wasn't adequately represented or some other 

ground?

 MR. FREEDUS: That would be a habeas case, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. It's a habeas 

case. Now, do you have -- can you do that in the 

military?

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes. There are --

JUSTICE BREYER: And what's the theory of 

the jurisdiction that the military courts have over 

that?

 MR. FREEDUS: It's similar in that it's All

 JUSTICE BREYER: So how does this aid the 

direct review that is to be had, since there is none?

 MR. FREEDUS: It aids it in the same way 

this Court recognized it can do so in Goldsmith, where 

it acknowledged that a mandamus writ could issue after 

finality --

 MR. FREEDUS: -- to compel adherence to the

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, within the 

military justice system. In that -- in Goldsmith it was 

a situation where Goldsmith was out of the -- you know, 

out of the military. He had a final -- I guess he was 

in custody, Cut he had a final court-martial conviction, 

and this Court indicated that a writ of mandamus could 

issue to aid past appellate jurisdiction to compel 

adherence to the --

you're talking about somebody who is, I guess that's the 

issue, out of the military system.

 The problem with your position is that it 

would dramatically expand the jurisdiction of the 

military system. It would sort of follow everybody 

they've dealt with around for their life, right?

 MR. FREEDUS: The fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At any time somebody 

who is out of the military system, whose judgment is 

supposedly final under the provisions that Congress has 

established, he could come back and knock on the door 20 

years later and say, I want to review my conviction.

 MR. FREEDUS: That's correct, Your Honor.

within the military system.

 MR. FREEDUS: He would be a civilian, former 

service member --

the civil system, do courts appoint special masters when 

they're an appellate court and they have to find out if 

coram nobis was --

MR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do they use district 

courts as special masters?

 MR. FREEDUS: They --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, the court 

had to invent a procedural device: There's going to be 

a new court-martial, which is a little odd because it's 

a new court-martial sitting in judgment on somebody who 

isn't even in the military any more.

 MR. FREEDUS: It's not a court-martial, Your 

Honor. It's what's called a DuBay proceeding, and what 

happens is -- and this in the decretal paragraph of the 

decision below. A remand is for further factual 

development, and if the case can be disposed of on 

declarations, if the government came forth -- it didn't 

do so below -- but if it did so on remand and provided 

affidavits that blew our affidavits out of the water, 

the court could dismiss the petition out of hand.

 If they couldn't do that or if there is a 

credibility contest that needed to be resolved, what 

would happen is the court would order what's called a 

DuBay hearing, where a judge is appointed. And it's

just like an evidentiary hearing. Witnesses are 

presented and they're cross-examined and then findings 

of fact and conclusions of law are drawn. And then that 

is put into a record, added to the record of trial, and 

reviewed in the coram nobis petition.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all of that is 

extra-statutory in your -- this instance?

 MR. FREEDUS: We don't believe so. We 

believe the court -- the Navy court here has decisional 

authority under Article 66 to do factfinding. It's a 

very unique court. Congress created these courts with 

factfinding power, which is different than I think 

virtually all appellate courts, save maybe one or two 

unusual situations. But these courts have factfinding 

power, so it's right in Article 66. And these courts 

also have rulemaking authority. And so does the court 

of appeals, and it has exercised that to provide for 

these procedures. So we don't believe --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where are -- where are the 

procedures set out for -- for military habeas?

 MR. FREEDUS: They're not, and actually that 

-- that -- this Court pointed that out in Noyd v. Bond. 

It said that military appellate court have habeas power, 

but the court of appeals hadn't provided rules, and 

Congress could facilitate with rules but hadn't, but

that didn't stop this Court from saying habeas power 

existed. The absence of the procedure --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you -- are you arguing 

then that if it has habeas power without a -- a textual 

basis, there's no reason to argue that it lacks coram 

nobis power because there's no textual basis?

 MR. FREEDUS: I think the answer to that is 

yes. The negative in there caught me. But, yes, I 

think that's what we're saying.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this Court has never 

held that the military courts have habeas jurisdiction?

 MR. FREEDUS: Yes, it has, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In what case?

 MR. FREEDUS: In Noyd v. Bond this Court 

squarely held that military -- the Court of Appeals at 

the time has habeas authority.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For someone still 

within the military system?

 MR. FREEDUS: That was the case where the 

individual was pending appeal, I believe.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to Justice 

Ginsburg is that we have never held that with respect to 

a situation like the facts here, where you're dealing

with somebody who is outside -- long departed from the 

military system?

 MR. FREEDUS: Well, I would -- I would 

direct the Court's attention, if I could, to footnote 11 

of Goldsmith, where this Court says: "And of course, 

once a criminal conviction has been finally reviewed 

within the military system, and a servicemember in 

custody has exhausted other avenues provided under the 

UCMJ to seek relief from his conviction" -- citing Noyd, 

the six pages therein which refers to the military 

court's habeas power -- this Court in Goldsmith put 

habeas power in the context of a -- a final case, so 

habeas authority after final relief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's talking about somebody 

still within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote 

correctly, right?

 MR. FREEDUS: An individual is out of the 

military if they -- if their dismissal has been executed 

-- or their discharge has been executed and they're in 

Leavenworth. They could even be moved to another 

Federal penitentiary and still in custody.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The --

MR. FREEDUS: So they're not really in the 

military.

from Goldsmith says: "And a servicemember in custody." 

So I think Goldsmith, in that footnote that you're 

citing, is presenting a service member still in custody, 

having exhausted all other areas, can come to a Federal 

district court and seek habeas. It's not talking about 

someone who is out of the military.

 MR. FREEDUS: I read it differently, Your 

Honor. I read it -- the next clause in that sentence is 

referring to habeas outside. I read this sentence as 

clearly saying that there's direct review. There's 

habeas after direct review within the military. And 

then there's of course collateral review in the Article 

III courts, if -- if everything misfires within the 

military justice system.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what am I missing? 

I thought that the footnote reads once a criminal 

conviction has been finally reviewed within the military 

system a service member, having exhausted all other 

areas, can petition in a Federal district court for a 

writ of habeas corpus. I don't see anything that talks 

about someone who is no longer a service member.

 MR. FREEDUS: Right. I -- I see the 

in-custody and exhausted avenues provided in the UCMJ as 

referring to a phase before you get to the Article III 

courts. Obviously, if I'm reading it wrong, the Court

will let me know, but I read that as prior to Article 

III review.

 If I could talk briefly about the 1983 

legislation -- it came up in opposing counsel's opening. 

I think it sheds a lot of light on the availability of 

coram nobis relief. When Mr. Taft testified, he wasn't 

simply giving his -- he wasn't simply stating the state 

of the law. He was providing the state of the law as a 

premise for legislative action, in particular stripping 

collateral review authority from the correction boards, 

which used to be able to review collaterally, after 

final judgment, military convictions. And that existed 

before the UCMJ was enacted.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is -- this is 

at a hearing. This isn't a Member of Congress, 

obviously, that we're talking about. It's not even a 

single Member of Congress?

 MR. FREEDUS: This is the chief counsel for 

the Department of Defense proposing the legislation and 

offering the only premise there was for the particular 

legislative change that I'm referring to, which is 

stripping the -- the correction boards of this 

collateral review power and saying, when we do that, 

don't worry, Congress, because it will channel these 

collateral -- post-final collateral attacks into the

military courts, and -- and they can have habeas. He 

says habeas -- I'm sorry --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the specific 

MR. FREEDUS: -- coram nobis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the specific 

provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by 

very strict finality provisions.

 There's no suggestion in his testimony that 

the availability of the relief that he's talking about 

continues after the individual is outside the military 

system. He's channeling -- he says these are channeled 

through a specific provision applicable only within the 

military system.

 MR. FREEDUS: I don't read it that way, Your 

Honor. I read it as channeling apt post-final attacks 

within the military -- within the courts in the military 

justice system, even though the person is -- is -- a 

final judgment typically happens before an individual is 

no longer in the service. A final judgment is final 

because the discharge has been executed. So what he's 

referring to is, once you have a final judgment, you 

then can seek collateral relief in the military the way 

you used to be able to do it in the correction boards in 

the military courts. And he was saying, now that we're

getting rid of this one collateral remedy in the 

correction boards, we're giving you this other one. 

We're not giving -- we're just channeling all of them 

into the military appellate courts, which is a more 

appropriate judicial forum. And he says clearly it 

would denigrate the courts to have administrative bodies 

overturning their judgments, once again showing that 

these are final judgments that we're talking about. And 

the only -- that was the only premise he offered to make 

the change.

 So stripping away one remedy while leaving 

another intact was the single premise, which is 

reflected in the House -- the Senate report on page 52 

of our brief, where Congress adopts the exact language 

out of his sworn testimony with, you know, a tiny 

variation, but that's the premise for the change in the 

legislation.

 I'd also note that, in that legislation, 

this is the Department of Defense proposing to open the 

door to this Court's jurisdiction for the first time in 

-- in 28 U.S.C. 1259. And when it did that -- it had to 

survey the whole landscape of military justice 

jurisdiction, and when it did that, it saw there were 

direct review cases, which are reflected in 1259 

paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and this other category that is

defined by what's not in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and 

that's the All Writs Act cases. The government 

acknowledges --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I've had 

the chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and 

like Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in 

there that the relief he's talking about continues after 

someone is out of the service.

 MR. FREEDUS: I think that's implicit in 

final judgment, Your Honor. If there's a final 

judgment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a final 

judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts 

within -- in the military system, just like you have --

a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review 

in our system.

 MR. FREEDUS: Your Honor, the -- the key 

difference is that -- two things: He's referring to 

post-finality, which means that the discharge or the --

you know, the sentence has been executed. The person is 

out. They're a civilian at that point. And coram 

nobis, by its very nature, is someone who is not in 

custody. So I don't think it's too much of an inference 

to read that what he is saying here is --

review in the appellate system. Someone is -- the 

judgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek 

review. Are they discharged while the review is going 

on?

 MR. FREEDUS: No, on direct review, you're 

right, Your Honor. They're -- they remain within the 

service, and it's interesting that the government cites 

Mr. Taft's testimony as authoritative on that point. 

And that -- that makes good sense. Keep the person in 

for a direct review so that if the sentence is set 

aside, we can retry.

 But there has been decades of 

military justice authority that says even if someone is 

discharged before their conviction is set aside -- so 

they're on direct review, their conviction is set aside, 

after they're already out in their civilian world, you 

know, doing whatever they're doing -- if the government 

wants to retry them, they do. And the government is --

is the party that asserts continuing jurisdiction to 

re-prosecute.

 And that's why this case is so 

distinguishable from Toth v. Quarles, because in Toth 

there was no conviction while the individual was on 

active duty. And that's why there couldn't have been a 

retry. Here there was conviction on active duty, which

is where jurisdiction attaches. It cements in. And if 

the government wants to invoke that to retry Mr. Denedo, 

it can try that.

 I would say, though, that if --

if there were a personal jurisdiction loophole here, 

like there was for the MEJA, the Military 

Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, Congress could fix it 

in a heartbeat. But we're talking about, you know, ten 

cases in ten years. So even if someone, you know, got 

away without retrial --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you don't 

think that if you prevail in this case, we're going to 

see a lot more coram nobis petitions than we did before?

 MR. FREEDUS: I -- I think there would be an 

uptick, and there may actually have been an uptick while 

this case has been up here at this level, because it has 

-- it has gotten a lot of visibility in the military, 

just like there was an uptick after Noyd v. Bond when 

this Court declared for the first time that military 

courts had All Writs Act power.

 So I think there could be an uptick. But 

once the novelty of it wears off, I think we will see 

level off. And you will see the same trend that we have 

seen since 66 when it was available the first time. I 

mean this isn't new. The only thing new here is the

government's interpretation of Article 66.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. FREEDUS: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Mr. Shah, you have three minutes remaining.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shah, could you tell us 

what the government's position is on whether, when 

somebody has been discharged from the service and then a 

conviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in 

the service is set aside, can he be retried in military 

courts?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAH: Not if he has passed his 

enlistment period, no, Your Honor. The government's 

view is they would not be able to retry him.

 I would just like to make four quick points 

in response. First, to the Chief Justice's question, 

could someone be in custody after finality? Of course, 

yes, that -- that could be the case. The military 

doesn't have to issue a bad conduct discharge as part of 

its sentence. He could still be in confinement within 

the military during the post finality period.

 The second point I would like to make is 

that Noyd v. Bond is clearly distinguishable. That 

dealt with habeas review within the military while the

person was still pursuing his direct appeal. So there 

was a clear, independent basis of jurisdiction in the 

Noyd v. Bond type situation, and that's the Article 66 

and 67 direct review jurisdiction, and that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What has direct review got 

to do with habeas?

 MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, the --

the habeas would be in aid of the direct review 

jurisdiction. In -- in Noyd -- in the Noyd v. Bond --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In the civil system we 

regard it as -- as entirely a separate proceeding.

 MR. SHAH: Well, what was going on in Noyd 

v. Bond, Your Honor, is he was pursuing a habeas 

petition for release pending the -- the resolution of 

his direct appeal. So the military courts just referred 

the petition to the same court reviewing his direct 

appeal on the merits, and it became part and parcel of 

that jurisdiction.

 The third point I would like to -- to make 

is in response to Justice Kennedy's question, which 

shows the incompatibility of coram nobis relief within 

the military justice system. That they've had to create 

this DuBay procedure where -- where a new court-martial 

-- and DuBay sets this out. The new court-martial does 

have to be convened, and then they would have a

factfinding tribunal in which new -- a new military 

judge would have to be assigned to govern it.

 None of that is specified within Congress's 

scheme. That has all been created. It shows the 

incompatibility of the practical burdens that this 

procedure places on the military, and nothing in Article 

66(c) which governs the jurisdiction of the military 

appellate courts, the intermediate courts, references 

any independent factfinding power. It says in a case 

referred to it, the court of criminal appeals may act 

only with respect to the findings and sentence as 

approved by the convening authority. It may affirm only 

such findings of guilty and the sentence or such part or 

amount of the sentence as it finds correct in law and 

fact and determines on the basis of the entire record.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you 

briefly make your fourth point.

 MR. SHAH: The fourth -- fourth point is in 

response to Justice Breyer. My military colleagues 

inform me that in the situation of a true clerical 

error, they could go to the Board of Correction of 

Military Review and seek correction of that error.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
