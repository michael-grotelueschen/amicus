 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 05-1575, Schriro versus Landrigan. 

Mr. Cattani.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT E. CATTANI

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CATTANI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Ninth Circuit's rejection of a reasoned 

State court factual determination and decision is 

improper under any deferential standard of review, and 

it is particularly improper under the highly deferential 

standard of review required under the AEDPA. This 

morning I'd like to try to develop three -- three 

points.

 First, the State court's factual finding 

that Landrigan instructed his attorney not to present 

any mitigating evidence was not an unreasonable finding 

and, in fact, is the most logical interpretation of the 

record. Although Landrigan now argues that the record 

does not show whether his decision not to present 

mitigation evidence was knowing or voluntary, that is 

not a claim that was ever developed in State court. He 

never alleged in his State post-conviction proceedings

that that, his decision to do that was not knowing or 

voluntary.

 Secondly, an evidentiary hearing is 

unwarranted in this case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask about the first 

one? Does the Constitution require there be no 

involuntary?

 MR. CATTANI: It would require that it would 

be knowing and voluntary, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if the record showed 

that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to 

voluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't 

the district court be able to reexamine that?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, there's no colloquy 

requirement for a defendant to waive presentation of 

mitigation. And I think it would have been enough if 

the defendant or defense counsel had simply said my --

if the attorney had said my client has instructed me not 

to present any mitigating evidence, and that would be 

adequate. If a defendant chooses to make a claim that 

his waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden 

would shift to him to do that in a post-conviction 

proceeding, and he did not do that in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How would he make such a 

claim in this case where in open court he was asked by

the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether 

it was the case that he did not want any mitigating 

evidence introduced? And he said, right, yes, that's 

correct?

 MR. CATTANI: I agree, Your Honor. It would 

be very difficult for him to make that argument and I 

suspect that's why the argument was not raised in the 

State post-conviction proceeding.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know if you 

got to the third point you were going to make. You were 

outlining three different points. But it seems to me 

that from the very start, what happens is that you and 

your brother for the respondent are talking past each 

other. You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the 

State court's finding. The respondent says what we --

all we want is a hearing in the district court, and 

those are two different issues.

 We want a hearing in the district court, 

i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial 

or incorrect. Those, it seems to me, are two different 

issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each 

other on this point.

 Did you see the same thing?

 MR. CATTANI: Yes, I did, Your Honor, and I 

think the reason for that is, in our view an evidentiary

hearing is not necessary because the factual finding by 

the State court obviates the need for one. An 

evidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that 

would never have been presented. Given this factual 

finding, the State court is in effect saying no matter 

what counsel might or might not have developed, it would 

not have been presented at sentencing because this 

defendant specifically instructed his attorney not to 

present any mitigating evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your view, what is the 

standard for when the district court may hold an 

evidentiary hearing? I know there's an element of 

discretion in it.

 MR. CATTANI: A district -- the district 

court can order an evidentiary hearing if the defendant 

has been denied an opportunity to develop relevant facts 

necessary to resolve a colorable claim in State court. 

And I think here the defendant fails on two different 

points.

 First --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the only time the 

district court can hold a hearing?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, it has to be through no 

fault of his own and if the facts were not developed in 

State court. Certainly it's the petitioner's

obligation, a defendant's obligation to present these 

claims in State court and the only -- the reason --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but it seems that if 

he doesn't do that, then that's a bar. But if he has 

done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, but that's the point 

here. He has not done that. He did not attempt to 

develop facts or he was not precluded from developing 

facts that would be relevant to a resolution of his 

ineffective assistance claim.

 If I could, Your Honor, there are two 

different parts of that question. First, the facts are 

not relevant. The facts that he's seeking to develop in 

an evidentiary hearing is this additional, this 

mitigation that should have been developed. If, in 

fact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to 

be presented is accurate, then these other facts are not 

relevant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't that the 

problem in your argument? Because your argument 

assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a 

moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he 

informed the court that he did not want mitigation 

evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of --

binds him as a matter of law for all time.

And what he is saying here is look, if I had 

known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence, 

as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end 

of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver, 

if you want to call it that. I would not have made that 

representation to the court. And what I want is an 

evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact, 

when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I 

didn't mean this.

 And he wants a hearing for that. The only 

way it seems to me that you can properly win on the 

issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I 

think you said a moment ago. That once there is a 

finding that he made a statement, whatever its 

predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating 

evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a 

matter of law.

 My question is, do you have any authority 

for that?

 MR. CATTANI: Simply the AEDPA 2254(e). I 

don't have a specific case that also would go directly 

to that point.

 Your Honor, I would also --

question highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit

opinion, for me anyway. Do you understand the hearing 

that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is 

the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation 

evidence that he now wants to present?

 MR. CATTANI: It seems to me the hearing is 

directed at presenting all of the mitigation evidence 

that he now wants to present.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't it have to go to 

both? Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to 

show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence 

that was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that 

I wouldn't have objected to.

 And he then wants to proceed with respect to 

his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the 

existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't 

look to.

 There's a dual purpose, I thought.

 MR. CATTANI: I would agree with that, but 

Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't agree with it. 

I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear 

that it did not agree with the district court's 

determination that he had waived mitigating evidence. I 

thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that 

finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating

evidence.

 MR. CATTANI: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that so? I mean, 

that's what that -- one of the reasons the case was 

here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a 

district court factual finding that he had waived any 

mitigating evidence. Isn't that what happened?

 MR. CATTANI: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it wasn't remanding for 

a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence. 

It made the determination that he had not waived it, and 

then remanded for investigation into what that 

mitigating evidence would be.

 MR. CATTANI: I don't know that it's 

completely clear as to what the Ninth Circuit is saying 

can be developed and how that evidence can be used.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's clear at least 

that they disagreed with the finding of the district 

court that there had been a waiver, no?

 MR. CATTANI: That's right, Your Honor, and 

I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's clear that they 

disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive. 

Is anything clear beyond that? I mean, I guess I'm 

hesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the

Chief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court 

did.

 I mean, there's no question that they found 

that the -- the State trial court's finding with respect 

to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not 

necessarily dispositive. I don't think it's clear that 

they found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm 

wrong.

 MR. CATTANI: The Ninth Circuit ordered an 

evidentiary hearing to allow him to develop whatever 

mitigation he's proffered in Federal court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But that could 

have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual 

purpose. One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or 

the nondispositive character of the State court's 

finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate 

assistance of counsel.

 And the question here is that, the immediate 

question is what exactly did the State court find with 

respect to -- oh, sorry -- what exactly did the Ninth 

Circuit find with respect to the State court finding?

 And there's no question that the Ninth 

Circuit assumed that the State court finding was not 

necessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's 

clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you

could help me if I'm wrong.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, the Ninth Circuit 

clearly held that the State court's determination of the 

facts was unreasonable. And that's the problem with its 

decision because if the determination of facts was 

reasonable, it obviates the need for any further 

evidentiary hearing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on the waiver point, 

let's assume that this case had not come in -- come 

here, and you had gone back to the district court 

pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit.

 Surely you would have taken the position, or 

you could have taken the position if the evidence 

developed that way, that he really knew or should have 

known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived. 

You certainly could continue to take that position in 

the district court.

 MR. CATTANI: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the district court 

would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I 

make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there 

wasn't.

 MR. CATTANI: Yes, but the point we've tried 

to make is that he was allowed an opportunity to develop 

his claim about whether his -- whether he made that

statement and whether he intended to instruct his 

attorney not to present any mitigating evidence. He 

submitted an affidavit where he said, if my counsel had 

told me there was this evidence of a genetic 

predisposition to violence, I would have allowed that to 

be presented.

 The court -- there was no need for an 

evidentiary hearing because the court simply accepted --

accepted as true that Landrigan would have provided that 

testimony.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how could the district 

court on remand find that there was a valid waiver when 

the Ninth Circuit says on A-17, the appendix to the 

petition, for all the foregoing reasons, Landrigan has 

not waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective 

assistance of counsel?

 MR. CATTANI: I think you're correct. The 

Ninth Circuit has specifically found that the 

determination of facts was unreasonable and found that 

Landrigan has established a colorable claim of 

ineffective assistance.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it has not waived. Not 

that the district court was -- didn't have enough 

evidence before it. It says the foregoing, Landrigan 

has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective

assistance.

 So how can you possibly say that that 

question is still open?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The district court has to 

accept that he hasn't waived. And what it's sent back 

for is for all of the facts that show -- that show he 

had ineffective assistance of counsel.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question. 

It seems to me that there are two separate parts to the 

waiver issue. One, did he intend to say I don't want to 

put on any mitigating evidence?

 But then the second part of the question is, 

was that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just 

as a guilty plea or something like that has to be.

 So is it enough for you to say it's clear 

what he intended, or is it also part of your burden to 

say that that intent was expressed in a way that was 

knowing and voluntary, compliant with the rule that 

applies to waivers of constitutional rights?

 MR. CATTANI: I think it's clearly enough 

simply to say that, as I indicated, even if it had just 

been an avowal by the attorney that this defendant has 

instructed me not to present mitigating evidence, that 

that would be enough.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a sufficient 

waiver without inquiring as to whether it was a knowing 

and intelligent waiver, that he knew what he could put 

in, and so forth and so on?

 MR. CATTANI: Yes, it is, Your Honor. I 

think to the extent that the defendant wants to raise 

that, he can raise that in a State post-conviction 

proceeding. He should make that type of argument in the 

post-conviction proceeding.

 And that's not what he did here. An 

analogous situation is that -- came up in a case that 

the defense, that Landrigan has cited, Iowa versus 

Tovar. And this Court expressly noted that the time to 

raise a claim -- that case involved whether it was a 

counsel -- it was a decision to waive counsel at a plea 

proceeding. And this Court noted that the time to raise 

that is in a post-conviction proceeding, and that the 

burden shifts to the defendant to raise that issue.

 And here if you look at the, the petition 

for post-conviction relief, if you look at the affidavit 

that Mr. Landrigan submitted, there, there is nothing in 

there that suggests that "I did not understand what I 

was doing when I instructed my counsel not to present 

mitigation. I, I did not understand the concept of 

mitigation." There's nothing in there to suggest that.

So I would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there something that, 

isn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly "I 

didn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been 

aware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given 

that instruction?"

 So he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying 

well, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I 

understood there was this kind of evidence and intended 

to preclude its introduction? Isn't that clear?

 MR. CATTANI: It's clear he is saying that I 

would have permitted one type of mitigating evidence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's the same thing, 

isn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent 

my waiver was not knowing?

 MR. CATTANI: He, he's raised to it that 

extent as to that particular piece of mitigation. And 

the trial court is expressly saying I disbelieve you 

when you say you would have allowed presentation of that 

mitigation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And he's saying if you will 

give me a hearing, district court, I will try to 

demonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on 

that point was unreasonable. The State court made that 

finding based on its observation of me at trial and, and

at the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a 

further chance to develop my evidence on, on 

post-conviction.

 And I want a hearing to develop that 

evidence in front of you, Federal district court, in 

order to prove that the State court's finding in light 

of that evidence was unreasonable.

 Isn't, isn't it correct that that's what 

he's asking for now?

 MR. CATTANI: He is, Your Honor, but I would 

suggest that there is no further evidence that was 

presented that he was attempting to present in State 

court regarding whether his waiver was knowing or 

voluntary.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How would -- how do we know 

that?

 MR. CATTANI: How do we know we know that? 

Because of the, the affidavit he submitted. And he, 

he's required to submit an affidavit to establish a 

colorable claim. And, and he's required to allege in 

his post-conviction petition that his waiver is not 

knowing or voluntary. But the burden is on the 

defendant --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you, I don't think you 

mean this, but you're not arguing that he just omitted

the magic words not knowing and voluntary?

 MR. CATTANI: I don't think, I don't think 

he just omitted them. I think he was not raising that 

claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, I thought a second 

ago you -- you admitted that to a degree he was, because 

he is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind 

of mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived. 

Therefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing 

waiver.

 MR. CATTANI: He raised that as to that one 

aspect of mitigation. But it would have been very 

simple for him, a simple matter for him to argue I 

didn't understand the whole concept of mitigation. I 

didn't understand what I was doing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Look, it would have been a 

better affidavit, it would have been better pleading. 

We can stipulate to that. But is there, I don't see 

there is any serious question that he is arguing right 

now that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about 

it I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be 

precluded from, from getting it in now.

 And, and if there's no question about that, 

then -- then I think we're just fighting about words.

resolved by the State court's factual determination that

that I would have allowed presentation of genetic 

predisposition of violence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And he says in the 

district, he says in the district court: I want a 

hearing to show that I was credible. So credible that 

the State court finding should be seen as an 

unreasonable resolution of a factual issue. I want a 

hearing.

 That's all he's asking for, isn't it?

 MR. CATTANI: I would just suggest that 

there is no further evidence other than putting 

Landrigan on the stand to say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's pretty good 

evidence, isn't it? I mean, he may be a believable 

witness on this point. I don't know.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I don't think there was 

any need for an, for the trial court to put Landrigan on 

the stand having already presided over Landrigan's trial 

and sentencing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he wants, if he 

wants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the Ninth 

Circuit, right? Because the Ninth Circuit held that he 

didn't waive --

MR. CATTANI: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- this claim?

 MR. CATTANI: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The part of the 

opinion that Justice Alito quoted on page A-17.

 MR. CATTANI: That, that's right, Your 

Honor. And I think that's why this case should be 

relatively straightforward.

 Because the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth 

Circuit's finding, that the State court unreasonably 

found that, that Landrigan expressly instructed that his 

attorney not present any mitigation, given that --

that's the problem with the Ninth Circuit's opinion. 

Everything else builds on top of that.

 If that's an incorrect holding, then the 

rest of the ruling is, is incorrect.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Even if it is incorrect, if 

we -- we don't know precisely what he meant by the words 

he said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a 

hearing? At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't 

he, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school 

teacher, the various others? And he'll say anyone who 

listens to those people will see that I have the most 

horrendous upbringing anyone could have. The worst 

you've ever heard.

And my argument is that if only my lawyer 

had looked into this at that moment in the trial, he 

would have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what 

I can present for you.  And if he had done it and told 

me that, anyone would have said, "of course, present 

it." And I want a chance to show that that's true of my 

case.

 Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on 

that? No hearing was given him in the State court.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, the problem with, that 

Your Honor, is that he didn't ask for, for a hearing to 

present testimony from, for example, his biological 

mother and his ex-wife, who would have presented the 

very evidence --

JUSTICE BREYER: In State court he didn't.

 MR. CATTANI: In State court in the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, is the 

requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a 

State court on a general matter, "I would like to show 

through a hearing," then he gives a whole lot of 

affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce, 

that then the State says "no," you go into Federal court 

and say "I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have 

a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra 

things," no, you can't do that?

MR. CATTANI: Well, there is a requirement 

in State court that you plead with specificity what type 

of claims you're raising in a post-conviction --

JUSTICE BREYER: Didn't he say my claim is 

ineffective assistance?

 MR. CATTANI: Ineffective assistance --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Because he didn't 

investigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in 

which I was raised, and had he done it, he would have 

found roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to 

show that he should have done that because it would have 

changed the result?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, his argument at 

State court was not that he didn't investigate that; his 

argument in the post-conviction proceeding was he could 

have presented that through some other witnesses. 

The -- his argument at the trial -- at the 

post-conviction --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not what I 

understood his argument that he wants to raise to be. 

In his affidavit, it is a different argument. It is the 

biological component of violence. "Look, my grandfather 

was convicted, my father was convicted," and so the 

mitigating evidence he wants to present at sentencing 

that is I'm biologically predetermined to commit crimes.

JUSTICE SCALIA: The criminal gene argument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- which is 

certainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation 

at a sentencing hearing.

 MR. CATTANI: Certainly. And that is, that 

is the main point I'm trying to make is that that was 

the only thing he was asserting in his post-conviction 

proceeding, was that "I would have liked have raised 

this argument that I'm generically predisposed to 

violence." The rest of the argument I think would have 

been frivolous because it was so obvious that he had 

restricted, he had limited his counsel's, restricted his 

counsel from presenting the very type of evidence that 

we're talking about now, this other type of evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought all that evidence 

was basically before the district court anyway. Didn't 

the district court know about all of that when it made 

its ruling?

 MR. CATTANI: Yes, Your Honor and the trial 

court knew about it when it made its ruling.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the district court 

had a proffer, but the district court but had not heard 

witnesses, it had not heard evidence.

 MR. CATTANI: But, but the focus here is on 

the reasonableness of the State court's factual finding.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but the 

reasonableness of factual findings depends on what the 

evidence is that can go in on the issue of 

reasonableness. And there's a universe of difference 

between a proffer of evidence which the district court 

says "well, I'll assume that," on the one hand, and on 

the other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses 

perhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court 

actually hears.

 You know, you, sometimes you get a lot more 

impressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make 

for the sake of argument. And that seems to me a world 

of difference.

 MR. CATTANI: I don't necessarily disagree 

except that we're -- the focus has to be on what the 

claim was that was raised in the State post-conviction 

proceeding; and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The only thing, but the --

the -- I guess on that point, my only, my only reason 

for raising this with you is on that point, it's not 

enough to say well, the district court assumed this. Or 

for that matter, the State trial court assumed this.

 That is not the same thing as putting in the 

evidence.

 MR. CATTANI: Except in this case we

certainly had the trial court that presided over the 

sentencing and had seen Landrigan in person and was 

uniquely qualified to make a credibility assessment 

regarding the points that Landrigan made in his 

affidavit, that "I would have allowed presentation of 

genetic predisposition."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask what might be an 

awfully elementary and stupid question? But -- it seems 

to me that there's no question about the facts of what 

he said. And you can interpret him saying I don't want 

any mitigating evidence put it. But isn't it clear that 

the waiver of the right to put in any mitigating 

evidence at a capital sentencing hearing is a 

constitutional right of very important dimensions?

 And can that right be waived if the record 

does not show whether or not he knew the full right 

of -- that is available to every defendant in a capital 

case? Namely, he had been advised by his counsel he 

could put in all sorts of stuff. Is there anything to 

show that there was that kind of waiver here, on the 

face of the record?

 MR. CATTANI: There, there's not a specific 

colloquy that goes through --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it is, as a matter of 

law, an ineffective waiver. Isn't the Ninth Circuit

dead right, not factually, but just as a matter of law, 

that you cannot waive this right unless the record shows 

that he's fully advised of the scope of the right that 

he's waiving.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, first, there's no 

authority that I'm aware of that would require any type 

of a specific colloquy. I think this record --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's new to me also. I 

never heard of it.

 MR. CATTANI: And I think that would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But why should it be, why 

should there be a less complete colloquy for this kind 

of waiver than a guilty plea itself? Now I admit 

there's no authority on the point. But isn't it 

absolutely obvious?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I think the reason 

there's no need for one is because a defendant can come 

in and if he really believes that his waiver was not 

knowing and voluntary, he has an opportunity to pursue 

that type of claim in a post-conviction proceeding. And 

he can come in and proffer whatever evidence he wants to 

proffer if, in fact, that's his claim, that he didn't 

understand --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Some kind of waivers, like 

waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a

colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what 

consequences of foregoing counsel are. So the judge 

discusses with him and, you know, points out what a --

what a significant decision that is. But it doesn't 

take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the 

question, you know, "do you agree that your counsel 

should not introduce any mitigating evidence?" I mean, 

it's clear on, on its face.

 MR. CATTANI: I would agree, Your Honor. 

And I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But doesn't that assume 

that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is? I 

mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, "I 

thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what 

the, these two relatives were going to testify to. 

There was really much more, if my counsel had 

investigated." And that's not a knowing waiver.

 MR. CATTANI: I think that type of argument 

was belied by what, what happened at the time of 

sentencing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, unless the argument 

is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to 

argue, that -- that when you make waiver of all 

mitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's 

reached that far in the criminal process what mitigating

evidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements 

of mitigation that could have been introduced. Which 

will almost never be the case. So that it's always 

possible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating 

evidence to come into the court a year later and say, 

"Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence 

I didn't know about at the time.  My grandfather was a 

criminal. I didn't realize that at the time. And now I 

want" -- you know -- "therefore my waiver was 

uninformed" and, you know, we go back to square one and 

try the case again.

 That would always be possible, wouldn't it?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I agree, Your Honor. 

And it's because the nature of mitigation is so open 

ended, it would be difficult to explain precisely and 

have a waiver of every conceivable item of mitigation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And so are you, are you in 

effect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a 

knowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based 

upon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation 

evidence that in this case might come in? Are you 

saying it need not be knowing in that sense?

 MR. CATTANI: I think a defendant needs to 

understand the nature -- the basic nature and concept of 

mitigation. But this case provides a good example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're not answering 

my question. I -- we all agree that he needs to 

understand the basic concept of mitigation. Does his 

waiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that I just 

described? Or doesn't it? What's your position?

 MR. CATTANI: It does have to -- it does not 

have to be knowing as to every conceivable aspect of 

mitigation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it will nonetheless 

kind him if he comes in later and says look, I accept 

the fact that it's my burden to show at this point that 

my waiver was not a knowing one, and that there us 

mitigating evidence that I would have let in?

 Are you saying that he simply as a matter of 

law cannot say that? Or cannot be heard to say that?

 MR. CATTANI: He is bound by that, Your 

Honor. And if I could --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the answer to my 

question is yes?

 MR. CATTANI: Yes.

we have a situation where the defendant is now trying to 

proffer evidence that is inconsistent with what counsel 

was trying to present at the time of sentencing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are -- what you 

are saying is that it was sufficient when he said, I 

don't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence, 

and the trial court said, do you know what that means, 

and he said yes?

 MR. CATTANI: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That doesn't have to be 

fleshed out at all, unlike a Rule 11 colloquy. To see 

if he really understands? Do you know what that means, 

and he yes and that's the end of it?

 MR. CATTANI: I think that is sufficient, 

Your Honor. And again, here he's now raising this claim 

of genetic predisposition. The sentencing memorandum 

that counsel submitted attempted to pore Landrigan as 

someone who is basically a good person who committed 

this crime because he was under the influence of alcohol 

and drugs. This new type of evidence -- and the 

sentencing memorandum -- and you'll see that Landrigan 

had been evaluated by an expert, who had said he didn't 

have any mental deficiencies.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 I'd like to begin by clearing up what 

exactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver 

and what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that 

set of issues in our judgment. I then would like to 

spend a couple of minutes on what I think the Ninth 

Circuit did and what effect that would have on this 

Court's disposition of the case. And if there's any 

time remaining. I'd like to turn to the question of 

whether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant 

an evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're 

asking for.

 Now, with respect to this question of 

whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid 

counsel for the State is just wrong about this. It's 

important to understand how this comes up. We asserted 

a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient 

performance and prejudice. The State asserted as a 

defense to that claim: No, no, he's waived.

 And the trial judge, the State habeas judge 

in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that 

and said, well, yes, he's waived. We then filed a

petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't 

rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing 

and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst. 

That's at page 92 of the joint appendix.

 That motion for rehearing was denied without 

any further comment. We then took a petition to review 

to the Arizona Supreme Court. That's also in the joint 

appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in 

which we specifically argued that you can't look to this 

so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of 

ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and 

intent.

 Now, in the State's response to our 

petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint 

appendix but is in the record, the State says: No, this 

waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally 

defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct 

review. But the one thing the State does not say is 

that you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too 

late, it can't be considered.

 We then went to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I'm looking at 

page 92 of the joint appendix. I don't, I don't see 

that.

 MR. VERRILLI: I may have the wrong page.

 I'm sorry for the delay here. The motion 

for rehearing is, I'm sorry, 99, and on 102 is where we 

raise it, and then subsequently -- then subsequently we 

raise it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that effective? Does 

the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, it doesn't have to, 

but, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it your obligation to 

raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion 

for rehearing?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, there's no -- but the 

point is that's not -- when we took this to the Arizona 

Supreme Court that's not an argument that the State made 

in opposition to our raising Johnson against Zerbst. 

Then when we got to the Federal district court we raised 

this again, this exact argument in Federal district 

court, and the State in Federal district court didn't 

object that we had failed to raise this appropriately in 

the State proceedings.

 We took it to the Ninth Circuit. They

didn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it 

appropriately in the State proceedings. The first time 

that question has even been raised here is in the reply 

brief on the merits in this Court.

 And I think that's tied to the next point I 

want to make, which is significant, which is as the case 

comes to this Court the Ninth Circuit has ruled that we 

have met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are 

therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

 Now, what the State is essentially saying 

is, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an 

evidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you 

didn't raise them adequately in the State court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And is it just an 

evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination 

to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the 

waiver question?

 MR. VERRILLI: On both, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why did -- the 

court on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver. So 

why would they then send it back for an evidentiary 

hearing on waiver?

 MR. VERRILLI: Let me move to that if I 

could, because I do think that's significant. I think 

the Court has elucidated the two potential readings of

the Ninth Circuit's decision. It seemed to us as we 

prepared this case on the merits that the reality is 

that the two, the issue of performance and the issue of 

waiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after 

a hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a 

diligent job of performing the investigation, and did 

instruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence 

was, then you view the waiver in a different light than 

of course you would if the counsel hadn't. So we 

acknowledge here that the proper disposition of this 

case ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't your 

assertion even in this motion for a hearing. It wasn't 

that he didn't know what he was giving up. It was 

rather the sentencing transcript, you say, "does not 

establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and 

intelligently waived his right to present mitigating 

evidence. Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that 

right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in 

frustration with his attorney during that particular 

proceeding."

 MR. VERRILLI: We're trying to establish 

there, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that was a factual 

matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was

present at the time. And he didn't think it was in the 

heat of anger. He did think that it was a valid waiver. 

Now, you're raising a totally different issue. You're 

saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all 

the elements of mitigation that the waiver might 

embrace. That wasn't the argument you were making here.

 MR. VERRILLI: Your Honor, I want to respond 

directly to Your Honor's question, if you'll just permit 

me one more thought about the Ninth Circuit and I'll 

turn right back to that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. VERRILLI: So in other words, we are 

making a more modest request for relief here which, is 

affirmance of the judgment sending back for an 

evidentiary hearing, but with a recognition that the 

evidentiary hearing ought to deal with the issue of 

waiver, which should be understood to be left open. I 

think we're conceding something here, that waiver ought 

to be left open and not definitively resolved. It's 

premature to definitively resolve that against the State 

without an inquiry.

 Now, turning to Your Honor's point, the --

with respect to whether there was a waiver here or not 

and what the State judge did or didn't do, something 

very significant here that I think the State's argument

just overlooks. There's an assumption in the State's 

argument that Landrigan's conduct at the sentencing 

hearing itself was a waiver and considered to be a 

waiver. But if one looks at the transcript of that 

hearing, and this is D to the appendix to the petition 

and beginning at page D-4 -- D-3 is where the colloquy 

occurs where this alleged waiver happened. The very 

next thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs, 

is the trial judge says: Okay, I want to hear from the 

mitigation witnesses.

 Then the mitigation witnesses say: Well, 

we're not going to testify. Then the very next thing 

that occurs is the trial judge says: Well, I want a 

proffer of what they would have said. Then when -- then 

when all that's said and done, the trial judge says to 

the lawyer -- - and this is at D-15 -- you got anything 

else, and the lawyer says, no, Your Honor, that's all 

I've got, all I've got is what's in the sentencing memo 

and these two witnesses. Then the judge proceeds to 

pass sentence. That's the -- the particularly important 

pages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see 

that what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's 

statements as a waiver, because if she had treated those 

statements as a waiver what she would have said is, 

well, here's the aggravation case, Mr. Landrigan has

waived mitigation, he has a right to do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is belt and 

suspenders, that's all. The -- I don't think any judge 

likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver. 

This judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't 

waived it there's nothing there --

MR. VERRILLI: I respectfully --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because he wasn't 

bringing in at this point the biological -- by the way, 

biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor 

rather than an aggravating factor?

 MR. VERRILLI: Let me address your second 

question first and then your first question.

 I think that that in two senses does not 

accurately represent what this mitigation case presented 

to the State court and presented to the Federal court is 

all about. With respect even to his affidavit, which I 

don't think fairly under Arizona procedure can define 

the full scope of his claim, but with respect to that 

affidavit alone, what it says is not genetic 

predisposition. It says the "biological component of 

violence." That's the language that Mr. Landrigan's 

affidavit uses.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the prior 

paragraph says it's because of the history of his

biological grandfather, biological brother, and 

biological child. That suggests to me it's a genetic 

claim and --

MR. VERRILLI: But one other thing it does 

that's very significant, Mr. Chief Justice, is it also 

says that these witnesses can attest to the use of 

alcohol and drugs by the biological mother when 

Landrigan was in utero.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he knew 

about that. He knew about that mitigating evidence at 

the trial because his biological mother was there.

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, but what he's saying 

that he would have agreed to, it seems to me the only 

fair reading in this affidavit, which again I don't 

think fairly defines the full scope of what he's allowed 

to proceed with under Arizona procedure, but with 

respect to this affidavit he's saying, well, if you had 

had an expert who could have come in and given testimony 

about fetal alcohol syndrome and the organic brain 

damage and other impairments that it causes, I would 

have cooperated with that. And that's really 

significant because if you look at page D-21 of the 

appendix to the petition --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How could that be 

helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother

to testify about drug and alcohol abuse? What use would 

the expert be if the potential predicate --

MR. VERRILLI: Because all the biological 

mother would have had to do was to give that information 

to the expert. That's a routine matter, for experts to 

gather factual information and assimilate it into an 

expert opinion and then provide it to the court. That 

could have happened easily here.

 And I think it's very significant because on 

page 21 you'll see that the trial judge makes a 

fundamental error about this exact issue. She says: 

Well, I'll grant this, I'll take the mother's testimony 

as a proffer. I'll consider the possibility of fetal 

alcohol syndrome, but all fetal alcohol syndrome 

establishes is that the kid will also have a 

predisposition to addiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The defendant would 

have been happy to have his biological mother talk with 

the expert, but was unwilling to have his biological 

mother say the same thing in court?

 MR. VERRILLI: Sure, and I don't think 

there's anything unreasonable about that. Those are 

very different experiences, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. It 

seems unreasonable to me. He was trying to spare his

mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court? 

That's what he had in mind?

 MR. VERRILLI: If I -- whatever else 

happened, the trial judge here considered this evidence 

of mitigation and did a weighing. And the key point I 

want to make sure I make here is that therefore any 

evidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on 

fetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other 

evidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the 

time and had considered at the time and had weighed at 

the time by this trial judge. And that's a claim of 

prejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even 

if one assumes -- and we dispute it and I'd like too 

talk about that -- but even if one assumes that there is 

a finding and we can't do anything about it that 

Landrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation 

of any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you 

think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the 

presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always 

possible that some additional evidence would come up and 

you say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have 

waived it?

 MR. VERRILLI: I don't think there's a yes 

or no answer to that question. It's something --

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes. Yes, it's possible. 

It's certainly possible.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. VERRILLI: But I think I don't -- I want 

to make sure I don't leave any implication that the rule 

we're asking for here is going to open the door to lots 

of claims, because I don't think it does for two sets of 

reasons. One is a procedural set of reasons and that's 

the -- that, we refer the Court to the Blackledge 

against Allison decision -- that if -- that it's not 

going to be enough in every case for you to plead an 

adequate claim and then jump right to an evidentiary 

hearing. As the court said in Allison, the district 

court has available to it a number of tools that it can 

use to test the claim before granting an evidentiary 

hearing. So there's a limitation there. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you do it 

concretely, Mr. Verrilli, for this case. The defendant 

is being rather obstreperous and says: I don't want any 

mitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy. And that's 

how he's trying to portray himself. What -- you said, 

and you allow for the possibility that there could be a 

knowing waiver of mitigation. What would have had to

transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?

 MR. VERRILLI: I think that's important, and 

hopefully it will help explain why we think that this is 

a narrow -- that the rule we're asking for here is a 

narrow one, and it's not going to open the door to lots 

of claims. It's clear that just like the waiver of any 

other fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial, 

the defendant's got to understand what mitigation means. 

He's got to understand its significance in the 

proceedings --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he certainly 

understood that. He said if you want to give me the 

death penalty, bring it on, I'm ready for it. The 

purpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the 

imposition of the death penalty. He says bring it on.

 MR. VERRILLI: And he needs to be assisted 

by competent counsel. That's a consistent theme of this 

Court's decisions on the Johnson inquiry. And so if you 

have a situation in which you have documented that the 

client understands what mitigation is -- and frankly I 

don't think, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, 

this is the kind of documentation that ought to suffice. 

But even if you had that, even if you documented that 

the defendant understood it, even if you documented that 

the defendant clearly waived it and documented that was

done with counsel's assistance, then it seems to me it 

is going to be very hard for a habeas petitioner to 

plead something that's going to get past --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't the type 

of documentation that would be sufficient? He 

understands what the consequence of not putting 

mitigating evidence on is going to be.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, because I think there 

isn't clarity at all that he understands what mitigating 

evidence is, what the full scope of it is and how it 

could --

THE COURT: He's present in the court while 

they're making a proffer of this sort of mitigating 

evidence. The judge is quite careful, saying okay, if 

he doesn't want the evidence, I want to know what it is. 

And he called the two witnesses. And all that this 

defendant does is undermine his lawyer's effort to 

present the mitigation.

 MR. VERRILLI: But again, Mr. Chief Justice, 

at the time the trial judge didn't treat that as a 

waiver. And so I don't think you can cut off his 

ability to litigate an ineffective assistance claim 

years later on the ground that it was an ineffective 

waiver.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, are you claiming that

-- are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately 

represent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to 

the question of waiver? In other words, when -- that 

the attorney should have insisted that the judge go 

through some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with 

him about waiver and inform him of certain things about 

what he was giving up? Are you making that claim?

 MR. VERRILLI: I think, Justice Alito, we're 

making a couple of different claims, not that claim, but 

a couple of different claims. One is, and it pertains 

particularly to a mental health expert, that even if 

Landrigan behaved exactly the way -- at 13 -- he in fact 

behaved in the counterfactual world in which he had 

received adequate representation, that the mental health 

expert testimony could have been proffered to the Court, 

had it been prepared and developed, would have been 

considered, and could have made a critically important 

difference and for precisely the reason that 

Justice Ginsburg's question suggested, which is that 

he's obviously behaving badly in this situation.

 What the trial court ruled out of that is, 

well, he's an amoral person. What the mental health 

testimony would give you is an alternative frame of 

reference for making a reasoned moral judgment about 

this guy, and could be critically important in

explaining that behavior. So even within the confines 

of accepting that the world would have unfolded exactly 

the way it did, it was ineffective to have dropped the 

ball on preparing that kind of evidence.

 Then it's also ineffective in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I'm not 

following you. You mean the mental health expert's 

testimony could have gone to whether the judge should 

have accepted the waiver?

 MR. VERRILLI: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's what you 

were saying, I'm sorry.

 MR. VERRILLI: No, to the basic weighing the 

mitigation which the judge undertook based on all 

proffered evidence. Then beyond that, we're making an 

argument that the waiver that, even if you are going to 

consider that a waiver, you can't consider it a knowing 

and voluntary waiver, knowing intelligent waiver 

supported adequately by the efforts of counsel.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a separate 

question, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver? 

Isn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which 

is a question of fact, which is a question of whether 

had he been informed of the possibility of mitigation 

evidence relating to a history of family violence, he

would have persisted in blocking the admission of any 

mitigation evidence? Isn't that the issue? Not whether 

it was knowing and intelligent. That would be a 

separate legal question.

 MR. VERRILLI: No. I don't think that's the 

issue. With all due respect, Justice Alito, I think the 

test under Strickland is whether there was sufficient 

performance, which we think we have a very powerful 

record of here, and then a reasonable probability that 

the outcome would have been different. And I think the 

inquiry here that the State habeas judge is undertaking 

is the reasonable probability inquiry. That seems to me 

to be a mixed question that requires --

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, it's a mixed question. 

But if the post-conviction relief court found as a 

matter of fact that even had he known about the 

possibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he 

would have persisted in refusing to cooperate -- if 

there was such a finding, and know you dispute it -- and 

if you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would 

have to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, taking our first 

argument to the side, our first argument which I've been 

discussing about what happened at the hearing, I think 

with respect to that argument the answer's no, that

argument stands without any need to disprove the factual 

finding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we 

don't concede that.

 But if it is a factual finding, then yes, we 

would have to disprove it by clear and convincing 

evidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're 

asking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the standard? I 

ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard 

previously -- I think the State was saying that the only 

issue that was raised before the State proceeding, 

collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing 

proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that 

he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something 

like that.

 When I've looked at this, it's on page 88, 

the motion filed says we have two claims. One claim is 

the claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about 

it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and 

alcohol.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where are you quoting from? 

I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Joint appendix A. And then 

there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to 

failing to investigate these alternative sources, we

also want to say that counsel failed to explore 

additional grounds, and that was the sister. And the 

sister was going to testify that the mother -- the 

foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she 

has a whole list of things in her affidavit.

 So is that still before us? I mean, isn't 

that something you want to argue?

 MR. VERRILLI: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Your Honor, for 

bringing us back to that question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And then the claim would be 

this: You want a hearing in which you're going to 

present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what 

the school says, what happened to him at school, all 

things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the 

State court, and that the biological gene. And you want 

to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your 

mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this 

been looked into and presented to the defendant, the 

defendant would not have said don't present any of that, 

it would have been presented, and it would have made a 

difference.

 What -- is that what you want to do?

this one, fetal alcohol syndrome expert testimony is 

very important.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, with that too.

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what the Ninth Circuit 

said is, we'll give you a hearing. We don't know if 

you're right or wrong. What's the standard for giving 

you the hearing? I -- a lot of things in the law aren't 

always written down exactly, and I was under the 

impression that trial judges often give hearings on what 

you might call seat of the pants. I'd like to hear more 

about it. I've been on appellate courts where rightly 

or wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know 

more about this. I can't quite understand it. Let's 

have a hearing. And we're going to tell the trial judge 

to do it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I thought you 

already conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for 

a hearing on this question of whether he had waived, 

effectively waived mitigating evidence.

 MR. VERRILLI: No.

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not actually talking 

about waiver. My question was just generally what I 

asked. What is the standard there on whether you get a 

hearing?

 MR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, would you 

permit me to answer that question, and I'll come back to 

Your Honor's?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever.

 MR. VERRILLI: Thank you. The -- with 

respect to the standard, there are two things that we 

have to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing. 

One is that we're not disentitled under the analysis 

under Section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the Court's 

Michael Williams decision, to show that the court below 

found it, it was not raised in the cert petition. We 

pointed out in the brief in opposition that it wasn't 

raised, it had nothing about it. That's established and 

the case comes to the court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is established? 

That you've satisfied (e)(2)?

 MR. VERRILLI: That (e)(2) does not apply to 

us proceeding to an evidentiary hearing.

satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?

 MR. VERRILLI: Because the -- there is no 

lack of diligence here that would trigger us meeting the 

heightened requirements of (e)(2), and therefore it 

doesn't apply to bar us. That's the theory.

 Now, with -- the other thing we have to 

show --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, you'll 

just have to bear with me.

 MR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying you 

satisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of 

diligence. Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B), 

which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would 

have found him guilty, in other words words subject to 

MR. VERRILLI: No. No, Your Honor. That's 

-- as we understand the Michael Williams decision 

interpreting that provision, Your Honor, those 

requirements only kick in in a situation where you 

haven't shown diligence and therefore you're at fault, 

and you can overcome your fault by meeting those 

heightened standards. They don't apply in a situation 

where you have been diligent and therefore you're not --

they don't apply to you at all.

 With respect to the -- what else -- with 

respect to what else we'd have to show, we'd have to 

show that -- and this is the Townsend standard, which 

nothing has changed -- that we've alleged facts which, 

if proven, entitle us to relief. Those are the two 

things we have to show and we've done both of those 

things.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the district court has 

substantial discretion in determining whether or not to 

grant that hearing on that basis.

 MR. VERRILLI: And the Ninth Circuit -- and 

it seems to us actually, Your Honor, under Townsend in 

that situation the hearing's mandatory. The district 

court would have discretion under habeas, under habeas 

practice, to hold a hearing as a discretionary matter 

even in a situation where we haven't shown a mandatory 

entitlement to it. So there is discretion there.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Part of that discretion 

is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a 

likelihood of a different result?

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me that 

that is the difficult part of your case based on this 

evidence.

MR. VERRILLI: Well, but I think -- what I 

think is important there is that that issue ought to be 

decided after an evidentiary hearing when you know what 

it's going to be. It's premature to decide that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we know what the 

fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, that's true.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And we could make a 

determination or the court of appeals could make a 

determination or the district court could make a 

determination how likely that would to be affect the 

result.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, they could, but it 

seems to me not until you actually hear the expert 

testimony, and then we have all of the other testimony 

that Justice Breyer detailed that you'd want to 

consider.

 I do want to try to come back, 

Justice Scalia, to your point. Yes, we acknowledge that 

the Ninth Circuit went too far in the way Your Honor 

described. But you don't get from that conclusion to 

the conclusion that you ought to grant the relief that 

the State is requesting here, which is a reversal and 

directing dismissal of the petition, because to get to 

that you have to show that there's no set of

circumstances under which we could prevail.

 We're -- our position is an intermediate 

one, which is that the right answer here is that the 

judgment to send it back for an evidentiary hearing was 

correct and should be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do 

with -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the 

dissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the 

mitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, "genetic 

predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its 

aggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was 

undeterable and even from prison would present a future 

danger"?

 MR. VERRILLI: I think the answer is that 

that is an inappropriately truncated assessment of the 

mitigation case and a wrongly focused assessment of the 

mitigation case, which ought to Focus on the troubled 

history and the fetal alcohol syndrome, which provide a 

medical mental health explanation for his conduct which 

is quite different and that -- and so that's what ought 

to be balanced.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was presented 

in the State court proceedings.

 MR. VERRILLI: That's not correct, Your 

Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The biological 

mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.

 MR. VERRILLI: The fact that she used 

abusive -- that she abused alcohol, but not the medical 

expert testimony explaining what effects that would 

have. That's precisely the thing that wasn't there and 

that was the big problem.

 So I do think that that -- that's why we 

need an evidentiary hearing, to develop that. This 

weighing, by the way --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think the 

State trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol 

syndrome?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, if you look at page 

D-21, Mr. Chief Justice, what you'll see is actually 

proof in the transcript that she had no familiarity, 

because she said on page D-21 all it does is predispose 

you to being an addict yourself. But fetal alcohol 

syndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that 

can bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability.

 If I could just say --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just one other 

question on a different matter. In Judge Bias's 

dissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from 

the Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed

with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled. Can 

you comment on that?

 MR. VERRILLI: Sure. What there was that 

the Ninth Circuit, upon receiving this letter, contacted 

counsel for Mr. Landrigan, asked him -- asked them to go 

visit him in prison and find out what's going on. They 

did so. They reported back to the Ninth Circuit that 

Mr. Landrigan did in fact want to proceed with the 

appeals. He has continued to want to proceed with the 

appeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns 

out there were neurological problems that were 

afflicting him, very serious, at the time. So that's 

what happened.

 If I could say in conclusion, just remind 

the Court what it said in the first Norrell decision, 

that even in the world of habeas there's a difference 

between deference and abdication. And in a situation 

like this one, in which the State court has not afforded 

an evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the 

development of the evidence that bears directly on 

Mr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication 

to hold that he can be conclusively barred from 

proceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on 

the basis of the present record.

 Thank you.
