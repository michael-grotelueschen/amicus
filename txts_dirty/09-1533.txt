 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-1533, DePierre v. 

United States.

 Mr. Pincus.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether the 

dramatically harsher mandatory minimum penalty for what 

the statute terms cocaine base applies to all offenses 

involving cocaine or only those involving substances 

with the characteristics of crack cocaine. In its brief 

in the Kimbrough case, the government described the 

provision at issue here as reflecting Congress's 

determination that, and I'm quoting, "crimes involving 

crack should be subject to considerably more severe 

penalties." We agree.

 Congress's targeting of a limited subset of 

the substances qualifying chemically as -- as cocaine is 

manifest in the statutory structure, in the language, 

for three basic reasons. And I'm going to be looking at 

page 2 of our blue brief, which has the relevant

statutory provision.

 First, the only way to give different 

meaning to two distinct terms that Congress used in the 

statute -- "cocaine" on the one hand and "cocaine base" 

on the other -- is to make clear that cocaine base means 

something different than all substances with the 

chemical formula C17H21NO4.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Pincus, if -- if I 

understand your interpretation correctly, it would 

exclude freebase. How is that a sensible interpretation 

of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a 

commonly known substance? Congress was aware of it. 

The Richard Pryor incident had occurred. Everybody knew 

it was dangerous. Wasn't it at least true that Congress 

meant to incorporate that substance as well?

 MR. PINCUS: Let me answer -- answer your 

question with a little bit of detail, Justice Kagan, 

because I think our reply brief wasn't as clear as it 

might have been, because the word "freebase" has, 

really, three different meanings. It means a 

manufacturing process; it means a method of use of a 

cocaine-related substance; and it also means a 

substance.

 So just to be clear: Freebase, the 

manufacturing process, occurs when cocaine

hydrochloride, the powder form of cocaine, is mixed with 

ether and ammonia in a very volatile mixture and boiled. 

Most -- many users of freebase inhale the fumes that are 

released during that manufacturing process. That 

process is very dangerous, as the Richard Pryor incident 

showed, because the substance is quite volatile and will 

explode. If that process -- if the substance is not 

used then, but goes to the very end, when all of the 

liquids are boiled off, then it does produce a rock-like 

substance similar to crack cocaine.

 Our submission is that the -- if the 

substance is permitted to go to the end, and if, in 

effect, ether and ammonia are used as a substitute for 

sodium bicarbonate, then the substance does qualify 

under the statute, because it is a rock-like substance 

that has -- is chemically cocaine, and was produced in a 

method similar to the reacting of sodium bicarbonate 

with baking soda.

 But in -- when the process is in the middle 

of the production process, we don't think Congress meant 

to reach that for a couple of reasons. First of all, 

because that was -- is -- that substance is not 

something that's easily marketable. And one of the key 

things that Congress was concerned about was the 

marketability of crack cocaine in its rock-like form.

That's what made the really big difference.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, if the -- the 

substance that is involved in this case was a rock-like 

substance and it wasn't a powder. So why doesn't it 

belong? It's a rock-like substance. Why should it be 

outside the category cocaine base?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think there would be a 

factual question in this case. None of the courts 

below, Justice Ginsburg, determined whether, in fact, 

this -- the substance at issue in this case was crack 

cocaine, because the district court ruled that that 

wasn't necessary, that all chemical -- as long as the 

substance chemically qualified as cocaine, it satisfied 

the statutory requirement, and the First Circuit agreed. 

So in this case, there -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Correct me if am I wrong 

about this -- I may have a misimpression -- but I 

thought you were objecting to a charge to the jury that 

charged cocaine base and didn't charge crack.

 MR. PINCUS: We're -- we're objecting to 

the -- the fact that the district judge charged the jury 

and himself determined that in order for this very 

severe 100-to-1 penalty to apply, it was not necessary 

for the substance to qualify as crack cocaine. All it 

had to do was to be a chemical form of cocaine.

JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you, how 

should a judge instruct a jury to determine whether a 

substance is crack? Should the judge use the definition 

in the sentencing guidelines?

 MR. PINCUS: A judge could use the 

definition in the sentencing guidelines, Your Honor. 

Let me just say, as a threshold question, in many cases 

this won't be a jury question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But in those -足

MR. PINCUS: In those cases, we think there 

are three -- there are three elements. One is the 

substance has to qualify chemically as cocaine. The 

second is it was prepared by processing cocaine 

hydrochloride with sodium bicarbonate or with a 

different reactant that produces a similar chemical 

effect. And third, that it's a rock-like or otherwise 

solid, that is smokeable, that is able to produce the 

inhalable vapors. We think those are the key -足

JUSTICE ALITO: It has to have all three of 

those characteristics?

 MR. PINCUS: All three of those 

characteristics.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought you just said 

that freebase would qualify, and freebase would not have 

the second of those characteristics; isn't that right?

It was -- it would not be prepared using a base?

 MR. PINCUS: It would, because ammonia is 

one of the -- is one of -- it's ammonia and ether that 

have -- that are used to prepare freebase.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So if it had any base?

 MR. PINCUS: Any base. We are -- the lower 

courts, in applying the sentencing guidelines 

definition, have said that sodium bicarbonate is not 

required. We think it is not required. They've 

recognized other substances, and we think as long as the 

process is similar, that that's what the sentencing 

guidelines capture, that's what the statute captures.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 

can understand the argument that -- that Congress was -足

was directing its statute at crack, and crack had -- had 

a very definite meaning, which didn't include any 

substance that -- that is rock-hard and has been 

produced in the manner you suggest.

 You're coming up -- you're urging upon us a 

definition that neither is the definition of crack nor 

is the chemical definition of cocaine base. It's 

neither fish nor fowl.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, Justice 

Scalia, I think that Congress was focused on crack.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Crack.

MR. PINCUS: Because it -- because it was a 

substance that had particular characteristics.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. But you 

don't argue that. That's not the meaning you want us to 

give it.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, we do -- we do want the 

meaning to be a substance with those particular 

characteristics. I think the only question that 

we're -- that we're debating is whether baking -- the 

use of baking soda is essential, because all of those 

other -- those other three characteristics are 

characteristics of crack.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's essential to crack.

 MR. PINCUS: Well -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't call it crack 

if it weren't made that way, would you?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think in 1986, the 

definitions were not that clear. And I think the 

sentencing commission has said, and certainly the lower 

courts have said, both in applying the limited 

definition of the statute for which we contend and also 

in interpreting the sentencing guidelines, that the use 

of a different base gets at what Congress -- is still a 

category of substance that Congress -- Congress cared 

about.

Obviously, if the Court would like to 

construe the statute more narrowly and say baking soda 

is required, we wouldn't object to that. But we think 

that Congress -- one of the reasons that Congress used 

the term "cocaine base" was that it was trying to 

capture a category of substances that had particular 

characteristics and wasn't focused so much on the exact 

chemical formula that went into it, because Congress 

knew, in the drug area, it would -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: How does "cocaine base" 

suggest what you want? It has to be -- it has to be 

rock and it has to be base cocaine produced in one of 

the fashions you suggested. I don't know how "cocaine 

base" remotely suggests that.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think in -- in three 

ways, Your Honor. First of all, because Congress didn't 

use the term "cocaine," which is used elsewhere in the 

provision, it clearly meant a subset. It didn't mean 

all of the -- all of the substances with the chemical 

formula that satisfies the chemical term "cocaine."

 Second of all, the statute shows just by the 

100-to-1 ratio that Congress was focused on something 

that was especially dangerous, much more dangerous than 

powder.

 Third, the legislative context was, as the

Court said in Kimbrough, that this was a statute that 

was enacted in response to a particular problem, and I 

think the question we're debating is: Would Congress 

have said, when it defined the term -- when it defined 

the term "cocaine base" -- and I should say, "base" was 

one of the street terms, colloquial terms, that was used 

at the time to -- to describe these categories of 

substances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All of them or just crack?

 MR. PINCUS: It was -- "freebase" was a 

word. "Base" was a word. "Crack" was a word. The -足

the legislative debate didn't distinguish necessarily 

the chemical -- the chemical process for creating the 

substance. What it focused on was a substance that had 

characteristics that had led to the epidemic that 

Congress was concerned with, and those characteristics 

were easy marketability, because it was a solid, 

incredibly strong addictive potential, and inhalability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the 

provision refers to "a mixture or substance which 

contains cocaine base." You read cocaine base to be 

crack, so you have to be talking about a mixture or 

substance which contains crack. What contains crack? 

Crack is the problem they're getting at; yet the 

statute, as you read it, has to talk about a substance

which contains crack, not just crack.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, and we think 

the reason that Congress used that phrase was often in 

this reactive process at the end of the day the rock 

will not be pure cocaine in a rock form. There may be 

some cocaine hydrochloride that didn't react with the 

base. There may be -- then there often is some of the 

base reacting -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of an odd 

way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to 

phrase the provision if what they want to get at is 

crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which 

contained crack. That suggests to me, when you talk 

about substances that contain something, what they 

contain is a base that then is used in the substance. 

think that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're 

talking about crack. They want to stop the use of 

crack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that 

they're talking about substances which contain crack. 

It would occur naturally, that language formulation, if 

you think of cocaine base as broader than just crack.

 MR. PINCUS: Respectfully, I disagree, Mr. 

Chief Justice. The provision just above large Roman 

numeral IV talks about compounds and mixtures, and 

Congress is sensitive in crafting the drug laws that

often, because these substances are not prepared in a 

chemistry lab, there are many, many impurities 

associated with them. For example, even cocaine 

hydrochloride, cocaine powder, is not pure cocaine 

hydrochloride. It's often diluted, it's often cut with 

other impurities. And so in all -- throughout the drug 

laws Congress has used that and we think that's exactly 

why it used a similar phrase here, because the crack 

rock does not contain 100 percent chemical cocaine in a 

rock-like form. There will be cocaine powder often, 

cocaine hydrochloride left. There will be baking soda 

left or the other reactant, and so it will be a mass of 

substances, and Congress needed that language to avoid 

defendants saying: This substance is not 100 percent 

cocaine in a crack form and therefore I don't qualify 

under (iii) .

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You kind of elided 

the point there in your verbal formulation. It's easier 

to say this is something that's not just cocaine. It's 

harder to say this is something which is not just crack 

because crack is a type of cocaine. You can say it 

contains, as the government says, cocaine base.

 MR. PINCUS: I may be missing your point, 

Your Honor, but I think even cocaine in a crack form has 

other -- the rock that Congress was trying to get at has

other things in it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying 

Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might 

not be able to get at that if we just say crack?

 MR. PINCUS: No, that the defendant, that 

the defendant would say this -- if it doesn't, if it 

didn't say a mixture which contains, if it said cocaine 

base, then the argument might well be, you have to -足

you have to distill the substance to find out how much 

cocaine base is actually in it, as opposed to how much 

of it actually is cocaine in a rock form, as opposed to 

other things have been mixed in, instead of, as this 

Court decided in Chapman, it's the whole package that 

one weighs.

 And so I think Congress was getting at the 

idea that it didn't want people to either avoid the 

falling within clause (iii) entirely or trying to 

escape the 50-gram crack threshold by saying there are 

other things in here that you have to take out before 

you, before you can impose this penalty on me.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -足

JUSTICE ALITO: Other than crack and free 

base, are there other forms of cocaine base that are 

actually in use in any substantial amounts in this 

country by drug users?

MR. PINCUS: Well, I think we don't know, 

Your Honor. There are -- certainly cocaine leaves can 

be in the country, and under the government's definition 

of the statute cocaine leaves would qualify under clause 

(iii) . Cocoa paste -- coca paste can be imported into 

the country. There are cases like that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are there actually people in 

the United States who are smoking coca, coca paste? 

thought that that was exclusive to South America.

 MR. PINCUS: They may not be smoking it, 

Your Honor, but they may be bringing it into the country 

in that form and then converting it into -足

that's happened?

point to regarding the cocaine that was intermingled in

cases where it was not cocaine hydrochloride, it was 

cocaine. So it was either coca paste or some later, 

more distilled form of chemical cocaine as opposed to 

cocaine hydrochloride, but it was not in a rock form,

a substance is tested and chemically it is pure 

C17H21NO4, no trace of sodium bicarbonate, no trace of 

ammonium, is it possible for a defendant to be convicted 

and given the crack penalty?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, it is, Your Honor. There 

are cases applying the sentencing guideline test, which 

is a similar test, in which the courts have said the 

absence -- I think what you're getting at is if the 

reactant is not present?

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's right. And I don't 

think -- could you just reiterate what the second prong 

of your test is because I thought -- I was under the 

impression it required the presence of a reactant.

 MR. PINCUS: It is that it was prepared by 

processing sodium hydrochloride with a base or with 

baking soda or similar reactant.

powder, in theory -足

that's how this was made?

 MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, the courts have not 

required -- the courts applying the sentencing 

guidelines have said that a chemist can testify based on 

his knowledge, and they've found the sentencing 

guidelines satisfied, that in his professional opinion 

that's how this substance was prepared.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Would it be enough for you 

if it had the right chemical definition and it was a 

rock-like substance, just those two things? Would that 

be enough? If the government could show it has the 

right chemical definition, it's rock-like, it's solid, 

does it have to show anything else?

 MR. PINCUS: I think that the element of the 

sentencing guidelines which we're picking up in our 

second element, Your Honor, is useful in making clear 

that this is a substance that was -- went from cocaine 

hydrochloride back to cocaine base, because I think 

that's one of the -足

question that Justice Alito is asking, whether the 

government has to show anything particular to 

demonstrate that it was prepared from powder cocaine.

physical showing. It can -- it is enough for the 

government's chemist -- and there's always a chemist 

that testifies in these cases -- to say in his opinion 

that's true.

 I think -- I think as a fallback we would 

certainly be happy with the definition that just had the 

first and the third ingredients in what I've said, but I 

think the second is important because one of the things 

that Congress was focused on was the potency of the 

crack and crack-like substance.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, you've lost me. 

You've responded to the Chief Justice when he raised the 

problem that this has to be not just cocaine base, it 

has to be a mixture containing cocaine base, you 

responded to him by saying: Well, crack always has some 

mixture in it; it's never -- it's never pure; and that's 

why crack would be covered.

 But in response to Justice Alito, who asked 

you what if it's pure, if it's pure cocaine base, 

without any admixtures, you said that would still be 

covered. I mean, both answers can't be right.

 MR. PINCUS: I may have misspoken in my 

response to the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia. I 

thought the Chief Justice's question was that the 

formulation of a mixture or substance which contains -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. PINCUS: -- somehow meant that Congress 

was getting at the chemical, all chemical forms of 

cocaine because -- because that formulation was more 

sympathetic than thinking that it required a rock-like 

substance. And in responding to the Chief Justice, all 

I was trying to say was not that it was always true, 

that there are other things present, but just that it is 

often is true that there are other things present and 

that Congress's use of the word "mixture or substance" 

therefore was designed to deal with the ordinary case 

where other things may well be present and did not want 

to allow defendants to escape by saying this is not 100 

percent cocaine in its chemical form and therefore I'm 

not covered by clause (iii) .

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -足

MR. PINCUS: I think the question here is --

I'm sorry, Your Honor -- is the converse of that 

question, which is: But if it is 100 percent cocaine in 

its chemical form in a rock-like state, is that covered 

too, and I'm just trying to say: Yes, that's certainly 

covered, too, but so is the dirtier form of a rock that 

has other things mixed in.

MR. PINCUS: I think -足

JUSTICE ALITO: -- and smoke it after it's 

in that form?

 MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think our view -足

that's one of the reasons that we would say rock-like or 

a solid that is otherwise smokeable, to deal with people 

saying: Oh, if it doesn't have to be a rock I'll 

pulverize it. Even if it's tiny little rocks, if it 

still has the smokeability characteristic, which is what 

Congress was focused on, we think that that would be -足

that that would be sufficient.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you get cocaine into 

a rock form without using a base? Is there some way 

that the rock type form of cocaine could ever be 

achieved without a use of a base?

 MR. PINCUS: No, I don't believe so, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And coca paste, what can 

you do with coca paste? Can you make it into powder or 

is it only useable as a -- ultimately for a rock-like 

formation?

leaves are mashed up in kerosene and other things and 

they're -- through a process. They are -- the first 

step is to convert them into coca paste, which is this 

sort of mushy brown substance with many, many impurities 

in it. It then typically is subject to subsequent 

processing which turns it into cocaine hydrochloride, 

colloquially cocaine powder. And then the way -- the 

way that crack is produced is that cocaine powder is 

turned back, using the process we've been talking about, 

into chemically cocaine in this rock-like form.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mentioned leaves 

several times, and you talked about that in your -- in 

your brief. If this were a trial court and we had two 

world-class chemists, strictly from a chemical 

standpoint wouldn't they tell you that the cocaine in a 

leaf is in a salt form, not a base form?

 MR. PINCUS: I -- I don't think they would, 

Your Honor. We -- we talk in our -- in our brief, we 

cite a number of studies that have found that cocaine is 

present in the leaf in both the salt and the chemically 

basic form, and I -- I think that the study -- we 

explain in detail why the government study, which is a

years old -- doesn't capture the new learning -足

MR. PINCUS: No, I think it's just -- you 

know, different leaves have different characteristics. 

The mix will be different. But -- but as a -- a matter 

of the chemical composition, there will be some cocaine 

in its chemical form and there will be some cocaine salt 

in the leaves, and I -- I think even more important, 

Congress believed that. So -足

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no, no.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

and the form that is chemically cocaine, and the studies 

that we cite on pages 9 and 10 and in the footnotes on

to tell whether the extraction process had made it into

the leaf. More modern processes make clear that there 

are both forms in the leaf. And -足

MR. PINCUS: I think then that would mean 

that the -- the -- under the government's interpretation 

of the statute, offenses involving leaves, as long as 

there were more than 50 grams of them, would fall within 

clause III, and that doesn't make any sense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just said it's an 

academic issue because there's not a market for leaves 

or for paste. What Congress was getting at was crack. 

The judge used the term cocaine base. Assume you are 

right. What should happen? Could you go back to the 

judge and he would then say, well, this is -- the 

chemists testified this is crack?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, we would like 

to go back to the judge, because in this case in fact 

the chemist didn't testify. The chemist did testify 

that it was chemically -- it was cocaine in its chemical 

form, but the chemist did not testify: In my experience 

this is crack, based on looking at lots of samples.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- it was -- the 

testimony was it was a rock-like substance. What wasn't 

said was -- what is it? Bicarbonate, sodium 

bicarbonate, was not mentioned.

whether it was crack or not principally came from the 

informant in the case and a little bit from an agent who 

also said that he believed that cocaine powder was 

chunky.

 And so we believe we have a fair argument on 

remand, when the district judge looks at the facts, that 

he will say the government did not meet its burden, even 

though it's only a preponderance.

user; and Congress did not limit the statute to one form 

of cocaine base. This Court shouldn't do it, either.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, cocaine paste 

-- coca paste is smokeable in its paste form?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, it is smokeable in its 

paste form, and that evidence was before Congress. It's 

cited in our brief.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Assuming we 

accept the -- the brief of the physicians and 

scientists, they say clearly that coca leaves can be 

chewed, but they are bulky and contain a lot of organic 

matter in addition to cocaine. I understood their 

scientific explanation to say that coca leaves contain 

coca -- cocaine.

 I think you've taken the contrary position, 

but let's assume we accept the sciences answer. What 

does that do to your argument?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, of course we don't 

think that that's right as a scientific matter. But 

probably more importantly, that's not something that we 

can prove. We have the world's experts working for the

them who would get up in court and say that coca leaves 

contain cocaine in its base form. We -足

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're representing 

that you will never prosecute someone who possesses coca 

leaves under subdivision (iii)?

 MS. SAHARSKY: The Romanette provision, 

Romanette (iii), which would be the sentencing 

enhancement, we have never applied in any case to coca 

leaves. We have never even had a case where it's been 

an issue. We've never considered it -足

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're representing 

to the Court that you won't?

 MS. SAHARSKY: We don't have a chemist who 

would testify that. We would not be able to make that 

showing in court.

 But perhaps a more important question is 

whether there was evidence before Congress that the 

provision in Romanette (iii) would apply to coca leaves, 

and there wasn't. There was evidence before Congress 

about different base forms of cocaine, that 

distinguished between the salt form and the base form, 

and it mentioned substances like coca paste, it 

mentioned substances like freebase, and it mentioned 

crack.

the term that -- that Congress eventually used, cocaine 

base, is that that came from science. Petitioner says, 

well, you know, "base" was a colloquial term. The 

reason that "base" was used is because cocaine is in its 

base form. That is what makes it smokeable.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's a bizarre term, Ms. 

Saharsky. It's -- I mean, cocaine base means the same 

exact same thing as cocaine, because cocaine is a base. 

It's like referring to an apple by saying "apple fruit" 

or referring to a poodle by saying "poodle dog." I 

mean, it's a strange way to speak about it.

 MS. SAHARSKY: It is an extra clear, extra 

precise way to think -- to speak about it, and we think 

that there's a good reason that Congress did that. In 

the preceding provision in Romanette (ii), Congress was 

defining the whole world of cocaine-related substances. 

So when it used "cocaine" there -- and it does mean 

cocaine base there -- but cocaine, its salt, its optical 

and geometric isomers, it's talking about everything. 

It didn't need to distinguish between the different 

forms. And that formulation had already existed like 

that in the Controlled Substances Act.

 But then in 1986 Congress was hearing 

testimony about a specific form, the base form of 

cocaine. Did you, at that point -- would one want

Congress to have just said "cocaine" in Romanette (iii)? 

No, Congress said "cocaine base" because it wanted to be 

extra clear.

 There's another reason -- another -足

JUSTICE KAGAN: It's a strange way to be 

extra clear, to -- to use a different phrase that's 

meant to mean the same thing as another phrase. To use 

two different phrases that are meant to mean the same 

thing is not a very good way of being clear.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, it's really just adding 

the extra word "base." It's not like they're two 

completely different words. It's just the addition of 

"base" to be extra clear.

 Another way to think about it is this: In 

1986, prior to 1986, this Court had decided cases in 

which it had said, somewhat imprecisely, that cocaine 

hydrochloride was cocaine. It called it "cocaine" 

throughout its opinion. It didn't make a scientific 

finding, but that's how the Court referred to cocaine 

hydrochloride, "cocaine." This was in its 1970 decision 

in Turner. It was in its 1985 decision in Montoya de 

Hernandez.

 Congress is presumed to know about this 

Court's decisions. It knew perhaps that courts had used 

the term "cocaine" imprecisely, despite the fact that it

has a specific scientific meaning. Congress was going 

to be extra clear and use the term cocaine base. 

Another -足

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why did it draft it 

to say "cocaine salts, et cetera," as opposed to 

"cocaine, comma, its salts, et cetera"? If it intended 

to differentiate between true cocaine and its byproducts 

like salts, et cetera, why didn't it just simplify the 

language in Roman numeral number (ii)?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, I think that it does 

that, Your Honor. I'm looking at page 19 of the 

government's brief. This is -- you know, throughout the 

briefs, you have Romanette (ii) and Romanette (iii). If 

you look at Romanette (ii) -- again, I'm on page 19 of 

the gray brief, but it's in other briefs, too --

Romanette (ii), Roman (II): "Cocaine, its salts, 

optical and geometric isomers." In Roman (II), 

"cocaine" does refer to the base form; "its salts" 

refers to cocaine hydrochloride.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why would it do 

that? If it's going to treat cocaine base, which is the 

same thing as cocaine, differently from cocaine salts, 

why doesn't it just say cocaine salts?

MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- it say "cocaine and 

its isomers" or something? "Its isomers." Why is it 

using "cocaine" in an identical scientific way in Roman 

numeral number (ii) and in -- in (iv)?

 MS. SAHARSKY: The base form has to be 

somewhere in Romanette (ii), because the way that 

Congress drafted these two provisions together is that a 

large amount of substances are listed in Romanette (ii) 

and then a subset is pulled out in Romanette (iii). And 

Romanette (iii) says, you know, 50 grams or more of a 

mixture of substance described in clause (II) which 

contains cocaine base. So you need to have something 

that's described in clause (II) and that would contain 

cocaine base, and that would be the word "cocaine" in 

Roman (II). So you couldn't just say "cocaine salts," 

meaning the hydrochloride form, optical and geometric 

isomers. You need something to get the base form 

into -- into Roman (II).

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but you could have -- in 

Romanette (iii), they could have said 50 grams or more 

of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base, 

period. There was no need to have it described in 

clause 2 if there's nothing implied in Romanette (ii)

cocaine.

 On your submission, it's just bad 

draftsmanship?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that there is a 

redundancy, but I think it is understandable in light of 

the fact the courts had used the word "cocaine" somewhat 

imprecisely. I think it's also understandable in light 

of the fact that Congress was putting an enhanced 

penalty in play, and that if Congress had not been extra 

clear there would be criminal defendants, perhaps like 

Petitioner, coming to court and saying, if Congress had 

just said "cocaine," that that wasn't clear enough.

 It's true that -- you're right, Justice 

Alito, that Congress could have said: Here's some 

things in (ii); here's some things in (iii); they don't 

overlap. Congress didn't do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is in (ii) now, on 

your reading, your expansive definition of "cocaine 

base"? What is in Romanette (ii) other than powder?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there is, in Roman (I), 

coca leaves, except those from which all of the active 

substances have been taken out. In Roman (II), the 

salts of cocaine, their optical and geometric isomers 

and salts of isomers. You have (III), which is 

ecgonine, which is a smaller molecule that is part of

the cocaine molecule. It was made -- it was used in 

pharmaceuticals a while back. It's not something that's 

really seen in the production process now. And you 

would have compounds, mixtures, or preparations that 

don't contain cocaine base.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What about optical and 

geometric isomers of cocaine? Those -- those fall under 

Romanette (ii), Roman (II), but not under (iii). Are 

there such things?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. There are optical -足

optical isomers are -- isomers are generally substances 

that have the same chemical definition, the same -- but 

different spatial arrangements of atoms. Optical 

isomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images, like right足

and left-handed versions of the same molecule. Those 

are -- those are both cocaine base. There is a 

right-handed cocaine base and a left-handed cocaine 

base. They're both cocaine base. We think that those 

would be counted within Romanette (iii).

 Geometric isomers, which are never seen, are 

slightly different. They are based on spatial 

arrangements where a certain part of the molecule is -足

it is pushed out or pushed up axially or equatorially. 

They're -- you know, geometric isomers are not seen.

MS. SAHARSKY: I would say cocaine 

hydrochloride would be the primary one, which would be 

powder cocaine.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. That's -- so there 

seem to have been a lot of words here, but in practice, 

(ii) is powder and everything else is under (iii)?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the things that would 

be under (iii) would be any form of cocaine base: That 

would be coca paste, freebase, crack, whatever you want 

to call it.

 Just to explain, Justice Ginsburg, why there 

are so many words here: You know, this definition is 

taken from -- is the same -- the stuff in Romanette 

(ii), this long definition -- from other places in the 

Controlled Substances Act. It's taken from Schedule II, 

where Congress is defining the whole world of 

cocaine-related substances that are subject to Federal 

law, so that's -- that's where all of this comes from. 

This was something that existed -足

JUSTICE BREYER: It's my understanding here 

that -- that the problem in this case -- tell me if I'm 

wrong -- is because cocaine can become -- can be a salt. 

People sniff it often, I guess, if it's a salt. And

that's bad. And then there's a kind that's worse, 

that's freebase or crack, and that isn't a salt and it 

isn't a poodle and it isn't an acid. It takes a base 

form, right?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so that's why they have 

a higher punishment. Then the odd problem is that maybe 

a cocaine leaf, but certainly cocaine paste, which are 

more primitive forms, also have a chemical-based 

solution, they too. So they've written this statute 

that sounds like -- that sounds like "Who's your 

father's son who's not your brother?" It takes a long 

time to figure it out.

 All right. So would you have an 

objection -- and I wonder if the other side would have 

an objection -- if what we said this word "cocaine base" 

in (iii) means is that it is cocaine in the chemical 

form of a base after it has been processed beyond the 

stage of coca paste? And that's how we read it. That 

would seem to exempt the things they're most worried 

about, the paste and the leaves.

 And I'm not going to repeat the same stupid 

joke, poodles and fruits, but you see the point. Is 

there any objection from the point of the government to 

define it in that way, or the other side? And why?

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. There's an objection on 

behalf of the government, and there are several reasons 

why that's true. The first is there often won't be 

evidence of how the substance was made. Second -足

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I don't care how it was 

made. All we do is test it. Now, all we have to do is 

test it, and then we look to see if it's a leaf. That 

isn't tough, I don't think. And then we have to look 

and see if it's this yellow stuff that looks like paste, 

and I guess that isn't too tough, either.

 So those are the only things you have to do. 

You have to test it, look and see if it's a leaf, look 

and see if it's a paste. Now, even the -- I mean, I say 

"even." I mean, certainly the DEA could do that.

 MS. SAHARSKY: With -- with all respect, 

Your Honor, I -足

JUSTICE BREYER: Certainly they could, 

right?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I just -- I don't think it's 

that easy.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, that's what I want to 

know.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Okay. First of all, if you 

talk about the chemical testing that can occur, DEA 

chemists can tell you if it contains cocaine base or if

it contains cocaine hydrochloride.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We got that part. Right.

 MS. SAHARSKY: They're not going to start 

making guesses about how it was processed. They're just 

going to tell you what they can -足

JUSTICE BREYER: That's fine.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But they don't need to do 

that, Ms. Saharsky. Suppose we just said it needs the 

right chemical definition, and it's rock-like, 

rock-like, crystalline, whatever you want to call it. 

So it's rock-like. It's not a paste; it's not a leaf; 

it's a rock.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Fine. As soon as the Court 

starts saying not a paste or rock-like or something like 

that, you have some problems.

 The first is, you're basically giving a 

national uniform roadmap of -- to evasion on behalf of 

drug traffickers. It doesn't -- crack, for example, or 

the rock form, doesn't have to be rock-like. You can 

grind it up in a coffee grinder and make it into a 

powder. It is still smokeable. It is chemically the 

exact same thing.

we're supposed to be interpreting one. And there is no 

way to -- to get that out of these words, no way, 

absolutely no way. Is there?

 MS. SAHARSKY: That is exactly how I should 

have started, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But this is -- but this is, 

Ms. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -足

your definition creates all kinds of issues about why it 

is that Congress used two different phrases to mean the 

same thing, and then how it is that if they did use two 

different phrases to mean the same thing, you're 

effectively reading cocaine out of the statute in 

Romanette (ii), right?

 MS. SAHARSKY: No. I think that that's 

based on a misunderstanding of how the statute works. 

You need to have "cocaine" in Romanette (ii) so that 

when Romanette (iii) says something contained in (ii) 

that contains cocaine base, it is pulling out a 

substance that is in (ii). But it's -- it's not a 

redundancy.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but no, cocaine is the 

same as cocaine base. So it's like saying -- it's like 

saying apples, oranges, and bananas cost one dollar;

aforesaid apples cost three dollars. That's a strange 

way to write a statute.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That is how Congress wrote 

the statute, though. It defined a large amount of 

substances and then it pulled out one substance.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But why would it say apples 

cost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say 

apples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Because these definitions in 

Romanette (ii) preexisted in other parts of the 

Controlled Substances Act, in the definitions section in 

802, in the definitions of controlled substances in 

Section 812. This subseries of definitions, which are 

the whole world of cocaine-related substances, are used 

several places. So Congress pulled them over and it 

used them here too, to define the whole world of 

everything -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -足

MS. SAHARSKY: And then it pulled out one 

thing for special treatment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it not relatively common 

statutory drafting to include something in an earlier 

section which is also included in a later section that 

imposes a higher penalty? For example, as I recall from

statutes that provide that the taking of a human life, 

homicide, is -- is punishable by so much; and then it 

says the taking of a human life with malice aforethought 

is punishable by more.

 Now, does -- does the second include the 

first? Of course it does. It includes the first and 

then something. And it seems to me that's the same 

thing here. It includes the first, the cocaine, but it 

has to be within a compound mixture of preparation.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, you are 100 percent 

correct, and I think that the statutory language makes 

that clear because it says it has to be a mixture of 

substances described in clause (ii).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, Ms. Saharsky, you 

do get the problem that Justice Breyer was trying to 

avoid. That is, on your definition this paste, which is 

supposed to be less addictive, less addictive than 

powder, gets bracketed with crack, which is more 

addictive.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that there is 

evidence that paste is less addictive than powder. They 

contain the exact same chemical, which is cocaine in its 

base form. And the question -- they both can be smoked. 

Now, the question is does one have a higher percentage 

purity of the chemical than the other? Maybe, but that

just depends on how it was prepared. And there are 

cases in the courts of appeals, several in the cases 

that gave rise to the circuit split in this case, where 

the courts appear to be grappling with whether something 

that was a little bit wet but still rock-like should be 

called paste. So -足

JUSTICE BREYER: But you define it in your 

brief, and this is very interesting to me -- you talk 

about it being a yellow substance that came directly 

from grinding up leaves, something like that. You have 

the definition there. It's written.

 Take that definition that you wrote, and 

what you've said that's very interesting to me that I 

would like to know, is that, that substance, in some 

significant amount of time is actually more addictive, 

more dangerous than the salt, which is ordinarily 

sniffed? Now, is that what you're saying, because I 

received from this material the contrary impression. 

had the impression that the yellow paste that comes from 

the leaf directly is, if anything, less addictive and 

less harmful, if anything, than the salt which you 

sniff. Now, which is it?

JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.

 MS. SAHARSKY: It is the case that the 

paste, just like the freebase and the crack, can be 

smoked, and for that reason is seen as more addictive 

than the powder.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So now if I want to find a 

citation for the authority that paste, yellow, made out 

of leaves is in fact more dangerous and Congress could 

have thought that than -- more dangerous than ordinary 

salt sniffed, I will read what? Because that -- that --

I did have that wrong impression.

 MS. SAHARSKY: You would read our brief

to, in other words. I -- I mean, I trust your brief 

implicitly, but I don't know on the scientific matter or 

the congressional. I would like to know what to read on 

that.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And in -- on these 

pages of our brief we're citing evidence that was before 

Congress in the hearings in this case. There were 

statements by two different authorities who are 

scientists -足

MS. SAHARSKY: No, that's okay. It's right 

here. It's like 29, 30, 31. There's a Dr. Beck who -足

from Yale, who testified specifically about the dangers 

of smoking coca paste.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll read that. 

Thank you.

 MS. SAHARSKY: And one I -- the point I 

really wanted to make is that, you know, once the court 

says it has to be pasty, or it has to be yellow, you 

know, any of those things can be changed. The one thing 

that can't be changed is the chemical composition. It's 

still in the base form; it's still deadly; it still can 

be smoked.

 The paste doesn't have to be yellow, just 

like crack doesn't have to be white or off-white. There 

was evidence that a few years ago there were folks in 

Ohio that were coloring crack green for St. Patrick's 

Day. Any of these things can be changed. It doesn't 

have to be rock-like. It can be ground up to a powder 

and it can be smoked that way.

 But the important think is that it's the 

same thing chemically. And I think if you look at the 

Controlled Substances Act, not just in this provision, 

but holistically, what Congress was concerned about was 

dangerous chemicals.

This gets back to the point that the Chief 

Justice made, which is the reference in the provision at 

issue here to a "mixture or substance" containing 

cocaine base. The thing that Congress looked at was: 

Do you have a substance which may not be 100 percent 

pure; it's sold on the street; but does it contain the 

dangerous chemical?

 Congress defines throughout the Controlled 

Substances Act the things that it was concerned about in 

chemical terms. And that's just not because it was an 

easy way to define things. It does give greater 

accuracy and certainty. But it's because the harms that 

are visited on people, the reason that they are 

controlled substances, that they don't have approved 

medical uses, and that they are extremely addictive, is 

because the chemical is inside of them and the chemical 

is dangerous.

 So whether you get the chemical out of 

paste, whether you get it out of rocks, whether you 

grind the rocks and make it into a powder, whether you 

freebase it, it is the same thing.

 And just to -- to make sure the Court has 

you know, some example or some thoughts as to the issues 

that would be caused if the Court started making up 

definitions of crack, you know, a word that doesn't

appear in the statute and does not have any clear 

meaning -- you know, Petitioner says it wasn't clear in 

1986, the definition of crack -- I just want to give the 

Court an example of some of the problems that the -- the 

issues the courts of appeals have confronted.

 In several courts of appeals there have been 

substances which I think perhaps under Justice Breyer's 

definition would qualify as paste. The courts didn't 

call them paste, but in the Bryant case in the Fifth 

Circuit they said there was a brown, soft, mushy wet 

substance that contained cocaine base was being brought 

in the United States. The Easter case in the Tenth 

Circuit: a wet gooey, cream-colored substance.

 Those courts are ones that use the chemical 

definition of cocaine base, and they said, look, they 

contain cocaine base, they have the deadly chemicals, 

they count.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, my understanding of 

how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following: 

You start with the leaves; then people vigorously 

macerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or 

more; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is 

mixed with an alkaline material such as sodium 

bicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and 

water; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish

solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, that's true. But it 

also can be dried. It can -- can be dried and smoked; 

it has been dried in South America, so it's not always 

wet, it's just a question of, you know, whether it has 

had time to dry or not.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Now, if a chemist 

analyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase, 

wouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of 

other substances that would not be present, in 

quantities? Other substances would be present in 

quantities in the coca paste that would not be present 

in the crack or the freebase?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, they all -- any of 

those would have impurities that are not cocaine base. 

All three of them would be identically -- chemically 

identical if that they would all contain cocaine base; 

but you're right; the impurities would be different 

because the method of preparation would be different.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So a DEA chemist could test 

-- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of 

the type that is smoked in South America by some people. 

This is crack or freebase that has been mixed with water 

into a pasty substance -- a chemist could make that -足

that differentiation, couldn't they?

MS. SAHARSKY: I think it really depends, 

Your Honor. I think if it's just a -- a regular DEA 

chemist, they would be able to tell you what chemicals 

they can find through standard techniques like infrared 

spectroscopy, like gas chromatography, and they can say 

we've identified these chemicals in this substance. 

Unless it is a chemist -- and we do have some that have 

additional knowledge of methods of preparation, DEA 

agents who have that kind of experience, have seen it 

prepared -- those chemists -- regular chemists would not 

be testifying about how it was prepared.

 For example in this case the chemist 

testified that the -- the sample had cocaine base, it 

did not have detectable amounts of sodium bicarbonate, 

and then defense counsel said well is -- is this -- do 

you think that it's -- or I'm sorry, the chemist, the 

defense counsel said -- wanted to -- tried to 

distinguish it from freebase, and said it's freebase 

crack; and the chemist said you know, I can't answer 

those questions. I can tell you scientifically what it 

includes.

 And that -- that's really the -- the issue 

of proof, is that you can tell chemically that it has 

the substance that Congress was trying to get at, the 

cocaine base. I suppose you can tell what other

impurities are there, but you know, Congress doesn't 

care about the impurities, it cares about the cocaine 

base; and that's why you know, it says mixture of 

substance containing cocaine base.

 You know, one -- one other thing that I just 

want to make sure is clear to the Court, is that there 

was ample testimony before Congress at the time that it 

enacted this provision about the chemistry of this all, 

that when Congress spoke about cocaine base, it was 

understanding that base meant chemically the base form, 

and that again is near the pages I cited to Justice 

Breyer in our brief. But two different scientists, one 

was the head of the National Institute for Drug Abuse; 

the other was the -- was a professor at Yale. Both with 

experience, and they said things like the form of the 

drug is the freebase, the usual kind of cocaine is a 

salt. It is cocaine with hydrochloride, it is a salt 

like sodium chloride. But this has no chloride attached 

to it, it is freebase, which is just plain cocaine.

 So Congress knew the base form of cocaine is 

what would normally be called cocaine. It learned about 

the science and it used the term cocaine base.

 And I take your point, Justice Kagan, some 

of the other Justices: There is perhaps redundancy in 

saying cocaine base instead of just saying cocaine, but

when Congress in 1986 was faced with a situation where 

courts, including this Court, had used the term cocaine 

to refer imprecisely to the cocaine hydrochloride form 

and Congress was going to put a mandatory minimum 

penalty in place, Congress had every incentive to be 

extra clear, and that's exactly what we think that 

Congress was doing here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, coming back 

to Romanette (iii), you have 50 grams or more of a 

mixture or substance described in clause 2. Doesn't -足

it really doesn't have to be a mixture. It could be 

pure, couldn't it? It says "mixture or substance," not 

mixture.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, it could be pure. I 

don't know that we've seen any cases like that, but it 

is almost always cut with something else.

 So just to wrap up and be as clear as 

possible, what Congress had intended to do in the 

Controlled Substances Act really was to pull out 

chemicals that -- that have certain pharmacological 

effects on people that are dangerous. Congress did that 

by using the term "cocaine base." That is a term that 

is expansive and includes all these kind of forms that 

we've been talking about today.

figure out whether a substance that's wet, off-white, 

rock-like, paste-like counts as cocaine base. Certainly 

the Seventh Circuit has had several cases like that. It 

struggled. If this Court picks just one definition to 

limit the term "cocaine base," it's really setting up a 

road to evasion for drug traffickers to change to a 

different form. We hope that this Court won't do that. 

We just don't think the text supports it. It says 

"cocaine base" without any limitation. And this -- we 

just don't think that this -- this Court should be 

adding a limitation based on what it thinks Congress 

must have intended but didn't say in the text.

 If the Court has no further questions, the 

judgment below should be affirmed.

Just a couple of points.

should be excluded from Clause 3, and I'm quoting,

"because they do not present the heightened concerns 

associated with crack cocaine."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but she says there's 

no way -- and she does cite this professor from Yale and 

so forth, who says if the stuff has the base in it, it 

can be abused in ways that if it has the salt in it, it 

can't be abused. That's all we can look at.

 MR. PINCUS: But Your Honor, I -足

JUSTICE BREYER: That's her point. That's 

her point. You can respond to that if you want.

 MR. PINCUS: I think that is her point. But 

I think the question here -- all of these substances are 

criminalized, and they're all going to be penalized. 

The question is: What deserves the 100-to-1 sanction? 

That, to us, means something that Congress was 

especially concerned about, and certainly, because the 

government agrees that cocaine hydrochloride is only in 

2, something that's worse than cocaine hydrochloride, 

which is a pretty bad thing. As Judge Posner said, 

there's no reason to imagine that Congress meant to 

punish paste more than cocaine hydrochloride.

 JUSTICE BREYER: She says there is a reason. 

It's because it contains base, and for many years, it 

was smoked in Latin America and can be smoked here. 

That's her reason. Now, your response is, it's a bad

reason?

 MR. PINCUS: Our response is that it is -足

it does not have the potency that crack had. It was 

smoked here and didn't give rise to the epidemic that 

occurred once crack was created, because that was more 

potent, more marketable, and led to all the evils that 

Congress was trying to get at.

 Second point: We would be very happy to 

accept your definition.

 Third point, about the statutory language: 

I think the critical question here, as several members 

of the Court have noted, is that "cocaine" -- not just 

in Romanette (ii), but throughout the statute -- means 

all chemical forms of cocaine. If that's what Congress 

meant in (iii), there was no reason to just -- not to 

just say it. The words "cocaine base" could have a 

chemical meaning, but the word "base" was also in this 

debate as a word that was being used to describe the 

specific evil that Congress was aimed at. And so we 

think, at the worst, there's ambiguity here.

 We think it's quite clear that by using 

those different terms, Congress meant something 

different, but at worst, there's ambiguity here. And an 

ambiguity, under the rule of lenity, means that the 

clause should be construed narrowly.

And, Justice Scalia, going to your point in 

your analogy to State law, the problem here is that 

everything that is in clause 2 is in clause 3 under the 

government's interpretation, because clause 2, Roman 

(II), has the word "cocaine," and clause 2, Roman (IV), 

says any compound mixture or whatever containing 

cocaine. Under the government's theory, that provision 

will never, ever be invoked, because every offense that 

uses cocaine is sanctionable under 3. And so it's not 

the situation with -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same with homicide 

and murder. Every murder, every murder, is a homicide.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, but the question here is 

whether every homicide -- whether every lesser form of 

homicide is also capital murder. And what the 

government's position means: Every lesser form of 

homicide, everything that's in (II) that sets up a 

punishment, is also in (III), and we think that's the 

problem with their interpretation.

 And it's why, if it's unclear, as you said 

maybe it was, then the rule of lenity should apply, and 

Congress can fix it. If Congress meant to include all 

of these other substances, Congress can easily fix the 

statute. But we think, given the way the statute looks 

right now, that's not possible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume for the 

sake of a hypothetical that the statute was the same but 

that things were reversed; that the smaller universe of 

items was the salt rather than the crack, and so they 

put an enhancement in Roman numeral number (III) for 

salt rather than crack.

 Is your argument that it's redundant based 

on the fact that a larger grouping of the chemicals 

listed in Roman numeral number (II) is excluded by Roman 

numeral number (III), so that -- is that the basis of 

your argument?

 MR. PINCUS: That particular argument would 

still apply. Our principal argument, if I may answer 

the question, is that in this -- in the government's 

interpretation, the word "cocaine" and the word "cocaine 

base" -- the phrase "cocaine base" have the same 

meaning. That evil wouldn't be present, and therefore, 

our argument would be harder, but it is present here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
