 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-5274, Dean v. United States.

 Mr. Forster.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FORSTER: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

Court:

 The issue before the Court in this case is 

whether the discharge provision of 924(c) carries with 

it some requirement of intent. We believe that the 

answer to this question is yes. And to that end we 

would cite to the leg -- to the text of the statute 

itself as well as the history involved, the presumption 

of mens rea that is inherent in all statutes such as 

this Court's case law has been clear on as well as the 

principle of the rule of lenity, if we get to that 

point, and if the Court deems that there is some type of 

ambiguity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Forster, there are 

three levels under this: Possession, brandishing, and 

if the gun is discharged. You don't quarrel with the 

notion that Dean at least brandished this gun?

MR. FORSTER: We -- we do not dispute that, 

Your Honor. No, he clearly intentionally brandished the 

weapon.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're talking about a 

three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun 

is discharged?

 MR. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor, that's 

exactly right. And the statute in 924 requires that the 

use of the firearm be during and in relation to the 

underlying crime of violence, which in this case is a 

bank robbery. And we believe that the proper reading of 

the statute would require that the discharge also be 

done during and in relation to the underlying crime of 

violence. Otherwise, the statute simply would not make 

any sense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think one of the 

stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive 

voice. It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm. 

It says a firearm is discharged. And that seems to me 

to take it away from the element of intent that you're 

trying to focus on.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I think that it's 

a transitive verb the way it's used. By definition it 

would have some object. Someone would have had to have 

discharged the weapon. And so I think that the Court's

cases on mens rea and so forth would continue to apply, 

even given the way that it's phrased in the statute. I 

don't think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's 

different -- I don't remember the grammar too well. You 

think "if firearm is discharged" is different than 

"firearm discharges;" is that your point?

 MR. FORSTER: I'm not sure it would make a 

difference in this case, Your Honor, because I don't 

think there's any -- I think that by definition the 

Court would have to ask itself who discharged the 

weapon. I don't think you can just use the word 

"discharge" in a vacuum. It has to be during --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure 

that's right. I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries 

to flee and the security guard is forced to use his 

firearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the 

bank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as 

well.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe 

the statute would, because the individual who would be 

charged with it would not himself have "during" or "and 

in relation to" the underlying crime of violence.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't say -- it 

says, "if the gun is discharged." And I think on the

government's reading it would cover the police officer 

who is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun.

 MR. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor, I think under 

the government's theory that would be true. But I think 

that would open up --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what --

I guess I'm not following this.  You say it would be 

true that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his 

own gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that 

would come within this?

 MR. FORSTER: No, Justice Scalia, not under 

our reading. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say under the 

government's it would? I don't think it would under the 

government's either. Do you?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have to use or carry 

the firearm before -- before section 2 even applies.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's the police 

officer who snatches the gun.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, that's different, yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's different.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's using the 

robber's gun, but by the police officer who is 

apprehending him. In other words, as I understand the 

government's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the

police officer. It has to be the gun of the robber, but 

it doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police 

officer who discharges it.

 MR. FORSTER: That's true, ma'am.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess it's also the 

government's view -- this is even weirder -- that it 

doesn't matter who brandishes the gun. The -- the bank 

guard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that 

also gets additional time served for the bank robber. 

It doesn't seem fair.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe 

that the -- that the hypothetical of the guard waving 

the gun around, I don't think that would meet the 

definition of "brandish" the way 924 defines it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has very specific --

what are the words that define what is brandishing?

 MR. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, "brandish" 

is defined under the statute a couple of different ways. 

The -- the dictionary definition of "brandish," which is 

to grab something and wave it around, is certainly 

contained in that.

 But the definition goes further. The 

definition also says that if I, for example, make known 

that I have a gun, if I pass a note saying I have a gun, 

that would also be brandishing under the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't think the 

government or anybody was reading the definition of 

brandishing to include a police officer.

 MR. FORSTER: The way the government's brief 

-- well, with regards to brandish, Your Honor, I don't 

know that the government goes that far.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it runs into the 

problem, which is also a different problem for you, and 

that is the brandishing must be for the purposes -- for 

the purpose of intimidating.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that's probably going to 

eliminate the case in which the officer grabs the 

felon's gun. So the problem that it seems to me that it 

creates for you is that "brandish" is specifically 

defined to have that particular intentional element. 

There is, however, no definition of -- of the -- of the 

term in question here, which suggests that they did not 

have any discharge -- that they did not have any --

any -- any intent to impose an intent requirement. When 

they do it, they know how to do it. In this case they 

didn't do it.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I would disagree 

with that simply for this reason. This Court's case law 

is clear that if Congress wants to do away with the mens

rea element, they must affirmatively do so. And I don't 

think that it's proper to say that because there's a 

specific definition of "brandish," therefore they meant 

discharge to be basically strict liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it improper? I 

mean, it may not be conclusive, but it seems to me 

evidence that points in that direction.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I think that that 

would be disregarding the presumption of mens rea that 

exists pursuant to this Court's case law as well as the 

requirement --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We have -- we have lots of 

cases in which it makes sense to disregard that 

presumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I 

mean, accomplice liability being an example.

 There are -- there are -- there are lots of 

State crimes in which it is dispensed with, reckless 

driving, death resulting. And in all of those cases 

what in effect the rationale is that the -- that the 

individual who is being charged has created a risk, no 

one can control that risk, including himself. But he 

bears the responsibility for, if you will, bad luck if 

the risk is realized. And that is the rationale for --

for holding him liable for discharge here without any 

particular knowing or -- or intentional act in making

the discharge.

 So why doesn't that make sense and why is 

that not an answer to the usual presumption that there 

will be a specific state of mind required?

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't think this 

statute is driven by consequence. And as I understand 

Your Honor's hypothetical --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? Why?

 MR. FORSTER: Because the words that the 

statute uses are directly focused to the -- to the 

conduct of the defendant: "Possess, use, brandish, 

discharge," as opposed to, for example, carjacking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is conduct. I 

mean, it isn't just bad luck. This is -- what we have 

here is a negligent bank robber. I mean, he has left 

the safety off, okay, and -- and trips the gun. I mean, 

bank robbing is bad enough, but negligent bank robbing 

is something --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is something that should 

be punished more severely.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, certainly under 

the statute the Court has far more authority than the 

ten years it imposed, and I think Congress is clear that 

they -- they allowed for substantially larger sentences

in such a case. This case obviously just discusses the 

application of the mandatory minimum.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your 

argument would give rise to very serious problems of 

proof. Every time a gun goes off, the bank robber would 

be able to say it was an accident. I mean, we had a 

particularly klutzy robber here that everybody agrees it 

was an accident, but, you know, in many cases it won't 

be clear.

 Yes, I was pointing the gun at the person, 

but I didn't mean to fire it. It just went off. And 

he's sad about it just as everyone else is. And that 

would get to the jury in every case.

 Just because it was easy here doesn't mean 

it's going to be easy every time to draw a line. And it 

gets back to Justice Souter's point. If you pose the 

risk that the gun is going to go off, that's 

additionally punishable conduct.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, obviously -- I 

mean, the risk certainly does go up. But as I -- as I 

think the statute is written, it's not driven by what 

the risk is. As I say, as opposed to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not my 

question, really. The question is the problem of proof. 

Yours is an easy case. Most cases it's not going to be.

Most cases when the gun goes off, the robber will be 

able to say, I didn't intend that it discharged. It 

was -- it was an accident.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe a 

jury would be -- would make that decision, because under 

this Court's authority in Harris, that would be for the 

judge; and -- and obviously criminals would make these 

claims, and it would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me? That would be 

for the judge?

 MR. FORSTER: Under this Court's authority 

in Harris, Your Honor, brandish and discharge are not 

elements of the offense that must be indicted and proved 

to a jury. They are sentencing elements or enhancement, 

if you will, that -- that would be up to the judge, and 

that's this Court's Harris ruling.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that undermine your 

argument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has 

to apply, because this is just a sentencing element?

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe 

so. This Court has never said that merely because it is 

a sentencing enhancement rather than an element of the 

offense that somehow the statutory rules of construction 

cease to apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it part of the

background here that it was proposed at the time these 

enhancements came into the law, it was proposed that 

there be a specific state of mind requirement for the 

discharge of the gun, and that was not enacted?

 MR. FORSTER: I didn't hear the -- I'm 

sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that part of 

the legislative history was that there were proposals --

I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between 

"possess" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent 

element -- "brandishing," very clear, for purposes of 

intimidation -- then "discharge" has no -- it's just 

that the gun is discharged.

 Weren't there proposals to include something 

like what was included for the other two, that is, that 

there be an intent requirement?

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, there were various 

drafts in the House and the Senate that -- that 

specifically provided the intent requirement. The 

compromise that came out was basically a disagreement 

over the penalty, and the language that the Congress 

used, "during and in relation to," necessarily implies 

some type of an intent element. I think the circuits 

are clear on that; it has to be knowing, otherwise it's 

not during and in relation to.

And so I believe that the choice of language 

that Congress uses -- there has to be the connection, we 

believe, between the use -- during in relation to and 

the discharge. Otherwise the statute makes no sense, 

because it wouldn't be triggered by anything.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I can't get anywhere 

with the language, to tell you the truth. I could read 

it either way. It -- the House language is the same. 

The person "discharges," yeah, but what if he discharges 

it accidentally? Is the accidental case or unintended 

case meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?

 MR. FORSTER: We don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you don't get anywhere 

-- I just can't get anywhere with the language. The 

reason they put the "is discharged" is probably for 

parallelism. It was a drafting section in the Senate, 

and they do their job in a stylistic way. I found 

nothing that suggests anything other than that.

 So -- so where am I? Sometimes a person who 

discharges the weapon accidentally is really much worse 

than the one who does it purposely. Purposely, he 

shoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person 

dead; okay? So I mean, I can't get too far with that.

 So where -- so there we are. Is there 

anything else -- there is the post problem that the

Chief Justice mentioned. Is there anything else you can 

say to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the 

other way in this statute?

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would you say, look, this 

is why you win?

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, in the committee 

reports and so forth I think it's pretty clear that they 

did not intend an unintentional or an accidental 

discharge to be covered.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why do you think 

that? I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who 

is a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it, 

and it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a 

tremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally 

has been thought meriting a higher sentence.

 And it is also true that he doesn't have the 

same state of mind as the one who does it purposely. 

That is true, too. Both are true. And so now what 

should I do? I know what you want me to do, but why?

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, the requirement --

we think that the discharge again must be during and in 

relation to. There has to be that connection. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- it's during the 

bank robbery.

JUSTICE BREYER: It's in relation to the --

I mean, you know, in a sense it is, in a sense it isn't; 

same problem.

 MR. FORSTER: I don't think this case --

this Court's case law would support a finding that an 

accidental use would have been in relation to. That's 

this Court's ruling in Smith.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there's accidents 

and accidents. And couldn't one say, looking at this 

that, well, we will -- the State will find that the 

culpability that we will attribute to this statute is 

reckless? If recklessness were the requirement 

certainly the facts in this case would fit, would they 

not?

 MR. FORSTER: I think that the evidence 

would suggest that he was reckless --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You accept that --

MR. FORSTER: -- but I don't believe that it 

was knowing. And then I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say reckless is not 

enough, it has to be knowing. This is not a mere 

accident. It's -- this -- the gun was loaded, it wasn't 

locked, and he's raking in money with one hand, holding 

the gun with the other. The teller is crouching down. 

I mean, there was -- there was a pretty substantial risk

of something going wrong, right?

 MR. FORSTER: Absolutely, there was. But I 

think this Court's authority in Smith talks about the --

the intent element that is inherent in this. It has to 

be purposeful, it has -- it cannot be by accident, and 

that's what this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? You place a lot of 

reliance on this: During and in relation to any crime 

of violence or drug trafficking crime. But that --

that's in the prologue, and it applies only to the 

matter covered in the prologue -- to wit, "During and in 

relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking 

crime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court 

of the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in 

furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."

 That -- that's what all that language 

"during and relation to" applies to. And then it 

continues: "Shall," if that "in relation to" exists, 

"in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:" 

One, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less 

than five"; two; and number three, what we're dealing 

with here, "if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced 

to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years."

 I don't see how that language during and in 

relation to any crime of violence applies to anything,

except the use or carrying of a firearm.

 MR. FORSTER: Justice Scalia, sir, we 

believe that the proper -- that the better reading would 

be some connection between those two, between the 

discharge and the underlying, the during and relation 

to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? How could you 

-- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer 

than by ending the first, the introduction with a dash, 

and then putting 1, 2, and 3? I mean, it seems to me 

that it applies to the portion before the dash.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, if that were the 

-- if that were the interpretation, then it would lead 

to what we consider to be some of the absurdities as far 

as the results go. If there is no connection between 

"during and in relation to" -- I will refer to it as the 

connection. In absence of that connection, any number 

of different things could occur, and that connection is 

what makes this statute make sense.

 And I believe that the government basically 

acknowledges that in their brief, that there has to be 

-- if there's not some connection -- I think it's page 

29 of the government's brief. When we discussed the 

absurd results that might flow from a statute where 

there is no such connection, what the government says --

I believe it's on page 29 -- is that to avoid these 

absurd results, this connection does exist. But then 

the next sentence they say: But it doesn't mean there 

is a mens rea.

 And it seems to me that what the government 

wants in that case is the "during and relation to "has 

to apply to discharge to avoid the absurd results, but 

yet they don't want Smith to go along with it. And 

Smith said that during and relation to is purposeful, 

has to have an effect, and it can't be done by accident.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How would -- how would a 

discharge not be during and in relation to? Give me an 

example of -- of what you're worried about.

 MR. FORSTER: Any discharge any other time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He sees a duck fly by the 

window and he's a hunter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- excuse me. 

That's not -- that's not covered. Number 3 only applies 

to someone who has already been guilty of what's set 

forth in the prologue.

 MR. FORSTER: That's the connection that we 

believe is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the only 

connection that's necessary. You have to have done what 

was set forth in the prologue, and it has -- has to be

in the course of doing that. But "the course of doing 

that" means just in the course of using a firearm in 

connection with the bank robbery.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't think 

that's the -- the best way to read it. I think it has 

to be during and in relation to the bank robbery.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the "use or carry" 

certainly has to be in relation -- during and in 

relation to, but that's step one. So he already is 

using and carrying or carrying in relation to the bank 

robbery. And then -- so that's the starting premise. 

That excludes all your things about years before or 

years after he carried -- he carried a gun. You -- step 

one narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun 

in connection with a bank robbery.

 MR. FORSTER: And -- and I would agree with 

that, and then when you take this Court's authority in 

Smith to say that that type use during and in relation 

to cannot be accidental. And so I go back to the 

original question Your Honor asked me, did he 

intentionally brandish it? Clearly. And so we believe 

that if -- if this case we are here about is fit into 

Smith, he's on the hook for the seven years under 

brandish, but because the discharge was accidental, it 

cannot constitute use under this Court's authority in

Smith.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a question 

about that. I thought that "or possesses" was separate 

from the "uses or carries." Is possession an example of 

using or carrying or is it as it says -- "or who in 

furtherance of such crime possesses"? Is that a 

separate -- separate enhancement?

 MR. FORSTER: I don't know that I would use 

the word "enhancement," Your Honor. The principal body 

of 924 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. FORSTER: -- "carries" with "uses" as in 

this case as well as later on in the statute 

"possesses." So it says both.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But merely possessing is 

enough to get the first enhancement of five years.

 MR. FORSTER: If it is in furtherance --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or relation to.

 MR. FORSTER: If it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The "uses or carries" 

doesn't -- doesn't necessarily apply to the possession.

 MR. FORSTER: The -- I believe, under the 

reading of the statute, Your Honor, they're separate. 

He could have been charged arguably with possession --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

MR. FORSTER: -- in furtherance of, but he 

wasn't. He was charged with using during and in 

relation to the underlying crime of violence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we have to find that 

the phrase "if a firearm is brandished" and the later 

phrase "if a firearm is discharged" require intentional 

brandishing and intentional discharging? Why can't we 

limit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the 

firearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon 

or if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite 

undetermined whether it has to be intentionally 

discharged, or even intentionally brandished for that 

matter.

 MR. FORSTER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The definition of 

brandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put 

another person in fear.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I think that you 

would then have to turn to this Court's -- well, first 

of all, I think it's the best reading of the statute. 

It doesn't make sense any other way to say that you can 

have the gun discharged but not be during and in 

relation to the underlying crime of violence. It 

doesn't make sense.

statutory rules of construction would say that if 

Congress wanted to do away with the mens rea element in 

this case, they would have had to have done so 

expressly. And we don't believe that they did.

 Now, every circuit that has discussed the 

requirement "during and in relation to" has found a 

knowledge requirement that you can't not know the gun is 

there, for example. There has to be the knowledge 

requirement. And this Court's authority in Smith 

suggests or says clearly that it cannot be used 

accidentally.

 So now the question becomes this: If the 

Court decides that during -- that the discharge must be 

during and in relation to, and when the Court does that 

it takes its own authority in Smith to say that it has 

to be purposeful, it has to have the effect of the 

commission of the crime, now is -- would the use in this 

case be subject to Smith? And Smith is clear that 

accidental discharge simply -- or accidental use, rather 

-- it didn't talk about discharge exactly -- but that 

accidental use would never be because it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- you say that this 

background -- that there has to be a state of mind 

element. And we can accept that that's a general 

principle, but here we have a provision that does

require a state of mind -- specifically requires a state 

of mind for the possession, for the brandishing, intent 

to intimidate, but here is this other one that suddenly 

doesn't. So wouldn't the text of this statute say --

the third one, discharging a gun, they didn't mean to 

have any element because -- any element of mens rea --

because they had it in number 1 and 2, and 3 leaves it 

out.

 MR. FORSTER: Your Honor, if -- I believe 

such an interpretation would basically mean that that 

silence would be interpreted as a strict liability, that 

silence with regards to the specific intent requirement 

would mean the Congress meant that no intent was 

necessary. And that's simply never what these cases 

from this Court have held. There's the presumption that 

Congress operates against, and if they wish to eliminate 

the mens rea element, they must do so expressly. And we 

simply do not believe that it -- that it happened in 

this case.

 One last point is, we believe there's 

nothing else that Congress would have had to have done 

to establish a general intent, and if that's true, then 

I think the very least that could be said about our 

interpretation is that it would be a reasonable one, in 

which case lenity principles would then come into play.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 By its terms, the sentencing factor in 

section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no mens rea 

requirement. Rather, it requires a certain fact to be 

present in the course of the section 924(c) offense, 

namely that the firearm is discharged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it require that the 

discharge be during and in relation to the crime? I 

mean, suppose the bank robber, you know, he sees -- son 

of a gun, he sees among the customers a man that ran off 

with his wife a year ago, and he is just overcome with 

anger, and he -- you know, he takes a shot at this guy. 

It's not in relation to the bank robbery. Would --

would that discharge be covered?

 MS. MAYNARD: As long as the discharge 

occurs while the 924(c) offense is going on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MS. MAYNARD: -- yes, Justice Scalia, it 

would -- it would apply. The "during and in relation 

to" language from the principal paragraph is part of the 

offense, but it does not carry down to the separate 

sentencing factors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

police come in and say, "Drop it"; he says, "Oh, my 

robbery's over"; he drops it, and it goes off?

 MS. MAYNARD: That case might present a 

question about whether or not, once he drops it in 

compliance with a lawful order to do so, he is still 

committing the section 924(c) offense. If the section 

924(c) offense is deemed to be over at that point, then, 

no, the firearm would not -- the fact would not have 

been present while the course of the section 924(c) --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's the line 

between is it going on. But assuming the offense is --

the bank robbery is still going on, like he's got 

confederates gathering up the money or something, does 

that fall under your theory that the gun is discharged?

 MS. MAYNARD: In our -- under our theory, 

the -- there must be a temporal connection between the 

offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, 

which is a section 924(c) offense, the using or carrying

the firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery 

in your hypothetical or possessing it in furtherance of 

the bank robbery in your hypothetical.

 If one concluded that because the bank 

robbery continued, even though he was no longer using or 

carrying the firearm or no longer possessing it, that 

the 924(c) offense also continued, and the firearm 

discharges when he drops it, then, yes, the firearm is 

discharged while the section 924(c) offense is ongoing, 

and, yes, the mandatory minimum would apply.

 But -- but that hypothetical presents 

questions about the beginning and end of the section 

924(c) itself, not questions about whether or not the 

discharge was intentional or accidental.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that --

regardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do 

you think he has to discharge it or that he has to 

brandish it? It is the passive voice. Does it mean if 

anybody discharges it or brandishes it?

 MS. MAYNARD: Two -- at least two points 

about that, Your Honor. The passive voice makes clear 

that Congress cared about the fact of the discharge, 

that Congress was indifferent as to who discharged the 

weapon. Because the "is brandished" is also stated in 

the passive voice, we think Congress was also

indifferent as to who brandished the firearm, although 

there is a separate provision giving content to what it 

means to brandish, and brandish must be done in order to 

intimidate. So -- but if a confederate, for example --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Grabs it out of his hand 

and brandishes it.

 MS. MAYNARD: -- and brandishes in order to 

intimidate the victims in the bank, then yes, both of 

them would be subject to the brand -- to the brandishing 

enhancement. And even if one thought that the language 

in the -- in the sentencing factor, "if the firearm is 

discharged," applied only to the defendant's conduct, 

which -- that's not our position, and we think that 

clearly -- it clearly encompasses others -- ordinary 

liability rules under Pinkerton and aiding and abetting 

principles would hold a confederate liable for discharge 

by another.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if the 

police officer -- the police officer disarms the robber 

and ten minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes 

off.

 MS. MAYNARD: Again, I think that would 

present questions about whether or not the section 

924(c) offense was still continuing, if the law 

enforcement officer has the weapon.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, assuming it 

is. I mean, he has got the one guy neutralized but the 

others are still, you know, under the teller's window, 

and that isn't over. So then the guy who is captured 

already gets an extra three years because the officer 

mishandled the gun?

 MS. MAYNARD: If the section 924(c) offense 

is -- is -- is ongoing and if the firearm is discharged, 

the mandatory minimum sentence applies. One might 

conclude that if third parties take the weapon and 

discharge it -- and, by the way, I do believe these are 

purely hypotheticals. They point to no case where 

that's actually been the case -- but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there probably 

aren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such 

klutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes 

off, either.

 MS. MAYNARD: That's true, there may not be 

very many accidental discharges. But there's no reason 

to believe Congress wanted courts to engage in the 

inquiry about whether or not the defendant accidentally 

discharged the weapon. If this Court were to her -- to 

hold that accident -- accidental discharges are not 

covered by the sentencing factor, I think that we would 

see more claims of accidental discharge.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I interrupted your 

answer.

 MS. MAYNARD: About the third -- if one is 

concerned about the actions of third parties who are not 

confederates in any way taking the weapon -- and we do 

believe it does under the statute's language need to be 

the firearm that is the basis of the section 924(c) 

offense, and not someone else's firearm. But if -- if 

-- in other words, not the security guard's firearm. If 

the firearm is discharged by third party causes you 

concern, one could conclude that that is not the manner 

in which the defendant committed the offense; and that 

this Court's decision in Harris described this type of 

sentencing factor, these very sentencing factors, as the 

kind of factor that one looks at: Is a fact present in 

the manner in which the defendant committed the offense?

 And so one might conclude that if the law 

enforcement officer disarms the robber and then later 

discharges the weapon, that that fact of a discharge is 

not part of the manner in which the defendant committed 

the offense. We don't think that's compelled, by the 

way.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be the same --

you would give the same answer if the teller grabbed the 

gun from the robber and it went off?

MS. MAYNARD: If the teller grabs the gun 

from the robber and it discharges, as long as the 

section 924(c) offense is continuing, then the firearm 

is discharged.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your alternate 

position would apply to the teller as well as the police 

officer?

 MS. MAYNARD: One could reasonably conclude 

that if the teller discharges it, it is in fact the 

manner in which the defendant committed the offense. 

But I do think there's reason to believe Congress may 

have been concerned about the fact of the discharge by 

anyone. I mean, what you're talking about is someone 

who's engaging in inherently dangerous activity. They 

brought an armed weapon to commit a crime of violence or 

a drug trafficking crime, and they've handled it in such 

a way that either it is discharged --

JUSTICE BREYER: There is another --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't really have to 

decide all this stuff, do we? We just have to decide 

whether if he discharges it the discharge has to be 

intentional.

Your Honor, but that it was the robber that discharged 

the weapon. And in fact the Petitioner testified that:

was accidental. But I think that it --

opponent's argument -- I don't know if it's right or not 

-- but that there's sort of a background rule that 

generally we assume when Congress prohibits conduct, it 

means intentional conduct; and normally if they don't 

mean that, they make it rather clear in the statute.

 Is that a correct -- is his background 

principle correct?

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Justice 

Stevens, with respect to sentencing factors. I think 

there's no case in which this Court has indicated -- and 

no common law principles --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What's the difference 

between a sentencing factor that adds five years to a 

sentence and an element of the crime? There are a lot 

of us that think that -- you've read Harris and

that really makes all that much difference.

in which this Court was interpreting these very 

sentencing factors here, the Court note -- noted that --

the question.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If it were an element of 

the crime, would you then agree with his background 

rule?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, because if it 

were an element --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then the fact that the 

sentencing factor is an element really isn't 

significant.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think it might be a harder 

case for us if it were an element of the crime, but it 

wouldn't be an element that would be necessary.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would it be a 

harder case for you?

 MS. MAYNARD: Why would it be a harder case 

for us? Because if it were a harbor -- hard -- if it 

were an element of the crime, then it would be an 

aggravated offense, and then one could debate whether or 

not the --

Congress intends to punish intentional conduct?

 MS. MAYNARD: I think there is a background 

rule with respect to the definition of criminal offenses 

that Congress intends some mens rea.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you really then are 

relying on the difference between an element of the 

crime and a sentencing factor?

 MS. MAYNARD: Not -- no, Your Honor, not in 

this way, because it -- it would -- it would be a more 

difficult caper -- case for us, I can see, but that you 

would still be talking about somebody who was engaged in 

wrongful conduct. There would be no danger.

 I mean, one of the reasons the Court assumes 

a mens rea requirement or reads in a mens rea 

requirement when one's not there, is because of the fear 

of capturing innocent conduct; but what you would be 

talking about is someone who has taken a loaded weapon 

to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking 

crime and used it during in relation to that crime or to 

possess it in furtherance of that crime, and is already 

guilty. They are engaged in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's entirely 

fortuitous; you have two bank robbers, they both do 

exactly the same thing, in one case the gun goes off and 

the other it doesn't. Does that -- does it seem -- does

it seem fair to add three years onto the sentence of the 

one whose gun happens to go off but not on the sentence 

of the one whose doesn't?

 MS. MAYNARD: They both engaged in 

inherently dangerous activity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they both did. 

That's my point, they both did exactly the same thing.

 MS. MAYNARD: And it's common in criminal 

law to hold criminals responsible for their unintended 

consequences of their criminal acts, and that's -- in 

your hypothetical it wouldn't be unusual at all to hold 

someone liable for the accidental discharge when they've 

taken a loaded weapon to commit a violent crime, here a 

bank robbery, and handled it in such a way that it goes 

off. It's completely reasonable for Congress to 

conclude --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You get three extra 

years for having bad luck?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, no, well they're -- just 

to be clear, they're both subject to life imprisonment 

for taking the gun and committing -- and using it to 

commit the bank robbery. So it's not tacking on three 

years; it's increasing the minimum; and that is a 

significant difference, Justice Stevens that this Court 

has recognized with respect to these various factors in

Harris itself, that the -- whether or not there was a 

discharge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is this guy 

likely to get life for a bank robbery, the gun 

accidentally goes off? I don't know whether it's his 

first offense or not.

 MS. MAYNARD: As a practical matter, no, 

Your Honor. However, had the accidental discharge 

caused a death, then he would have committed a more 

serious offense, and that may have been the penalty. 

But the point is that one is often subject to higher 

penalties than one might have expected by the unintended 

consequences of one's criminal act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What would you think -- to 

go back to Justice Stevens' question, I would start with 

the assumption that, normally, not always, where you 

have a criminal statute and the crime has elements, that 

Congress intends that the elements be carried out with a 

guilty state of mind; I would start with that 

assumption.

 Now I would agree with you that sentencing 

is different, and the reason that it's different is 

because sentencing often goes up or down depending upon 

whether the harm that is foreseen does or does not 

occur, irrespective of the state of mind. So we

couldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think that's correct, Your 

Honor, and that's our view.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, having done 

that I wonder if the background rule should come into 

play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at 

stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there 

are many ways in which the sentence will go up. If this 

person had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder 

in the course of a felony. There are all kinds of other 

statutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't 

apply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give 

him the higher sentence, if he warrants it.

 But if you apply the mandatory minimum where 

the judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to 

take people who the judge and others think fall into the 

minimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and 

force them to have a higher sentence. Now, that would 

be a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum 

sentencing matters.

 MS. MAYNARD: But that would be a 

reconceptualization of the rule of lenity, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it would. It would.

 MS. MAYNARD: And what, it would be a -- as

you said for this Court, in Muscarello, the rule of 

lenity has never been a rule where the defendant always 

prevails; and it would be an odd notion to have a more 

muscular rule of the rule of lenity in the sentencing 

enhancement context than you have with respect to the 

crime itself.

 The whole point of having the mandatory 

minimum is to take away discretion from judges. What --

and the language of the statute here in our view is 

clear. It says "if the firearm is discharged," and I 

think it's the present tense that gets you the -- the 

temporal connection to the crime here. If it is 

discharged while you are using or carrying it or 

possessing it, in the offense in the principal 

paragraph, Congress wanted you to have ten years.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I can't -- I can't --

the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of 

this that really says why they use "is discharged" or 

used "as opposed to discharges." And I find those very 

metaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see 

either something in the history or some functional 

consideration.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, in the blue brief they 

lay out the House's final version, and we have the 

House's final version in one of our footnotes. And then

they lay out the Senate's final version.

 And one important distinction, Justice 

Breyer, between those two versions is that the House's 

version would have made it active voice, but not only 

active. But it would have been amenable to the argument 

that during and in relation to -- discharges, because 

it's structured different.

 But the House would have set the penalty for 

a discharge at 20 years.  Okay. That's -- you can infer 

from that that the House thought an intentional 

discharge should subject you to 20 years.

 The Senate's version, which put it in the 

passive voice, said if the firearm is discharged and set 

a mandatory minimum of 10 years. And I think you can 

infer from that, Justice Breyer, the -- the current 

structure allows what you're positing, which is more 

culpable defendants who intend to discharge the firearm 

to receive a higher sentence. And one could infer, I 

think, that the House thinks that should be 20 years.

 So I think the -- the current structure does 

allow judges to take into consideration. It just sets 

the floor. And Congress is entitled to do that, and I 

think they have clearly done that and then to take out 

of the realm of debate whether or not the defendant 

intended to discharge the firearm or didn't mean to

discharge the firearm.

 I would like to -- to say one factual point, 

which is in the -- in the indictment Petitioner actually 

was charged with use or carrying. It just seems -- if I 

could explain, the "use or carry during or in relation 

to," is one prong, one way in which to commit the 

principal offense.

 "Possessing in furtherance" is another way 

to commit the principal offense. The "use or carry" is 

not modified by "possession in furtherance of," and 

"possess" is not modified by -- by "during or in 

relation to," which is another reason it makes no sense 

to -- to trail the "during or in relation to" down to 

the generally applicable sentencing factors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a difference, a 

practical difference, between the two formulations?

 MS. MAYNARD: The legislative -- well, the 

words are actually different; the text is different; and 

the legislative history suggests that Congress wanted a 

beefed-up "in relation to" requirement for possession in 

order to make sure that incidental possession during --

you know, incidental possession while one is also 

committing a crime wasn't captured. So the "in 

furtherance of" --

make sure I understand, is that the "in relation to" 

language modifies both "use" and "possession"?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, sir. The "in relation to" 

-- the "during or in relation to" modifier modifies only 

"use or carry." And if one is charged with a "use or 

carry" offense, then the government must show that you 

"used or carried during or in relation to" in the way 

those words have been given meaning by this Court.

 If you're charged with possession, the 

government must show that you possessed the firearm in 

furtherance of. Now, the -- the "in furtherance of" and 

the "in relation to" prong have been given similar 

meanings by the courts, although generally it's thought 

that the "in furtherance of," like I say, is a sort of 

beefed up "in relation to" requirement because --

JUSTICE BREYER: "Carries," what about 

"carries"? If a person is carrying the gun in his 

pocket but he doesn't know it, which could happen, does 

that fall within "carries" or not?

 MS. MAYNARD: He would be carrying, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So is he guilty of the 

first; do we know?

also committing a crime, he would be carrying -- if he 

was also committing a crime of violence, he would be 

carrying it during the crime of violence. But under 

this Court's decision in Smith, if it were --

JUSTICE BREYER: The carrying has to be --

although the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the 

carrying has to be in relation to the crime.

 MS. MAYNARD: The statute does say that 

carrying has to be in relation to --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it just said "who 

in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."

 MS. MAYNARD: I am sorry. I thought you 

were asking me a "carry" hypothetical. If you are 

asking me a "possession" hypothetical --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it's a "carrying." My 

-- my interest is the -- whoever, blah, blah, blah, for 

which the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a 

firearm, or who in furtherance of any such crime 

possesses a firearm. So I thought that the "in 

furtherance" does not modify "carry".

sorry. I answered --

if the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the 

firearm in his pocket and doesn't know it? He picked it 

up from the tailor, and now is -- is there an intent 

requirement there? Do we know? Did Smith talk about 

that? Do we know? I mean is there, you know, a state 

of mind requirement?

 MS. MAYNARD: It's hard to see how one could 

meet this Court's definition in Smith for -- for "in 

relation to," which was to have --

JUSTICE BREYER: Smith says "in relation to" 

and so the carrying has to be in relation to. And since 

the carrying has to be in relation to, that pretty much 

MS. MAYNARD: The underlying --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- covers the state of 

mind.

 MS. MAYNARD: The carrying had to be in 

relation to the underlying drug crime or crime of 

violence. This Court gave content to "in relation to" 

in Smith to mean have some purpose or effect, facilitate 

or further the underlying crime, not be by accident or 

coincidence.

 The gist of Petitioner's argument here is 

they want to read that "accident or coincidence" 

language down to modify "discharge." And structurally

that -- that just doesn't work. And if -- if I can make 

one more point about why it's clear it isn't that, which 

is that the -- the "in possession in furtherance of 

requirement" -- I mean one of the things they say in 

response to our argument is that we are willing to put a 

temporal limitation on the sentencing factors, but not 

an "in relation to" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just make sure I 

understand your position? "During and in relation to" 

modifies the first words it follows. "In furtherance 

to" modifies "possession." Now, do either "in relation 

to" or "in furtherance" to it modify the three 

subsequent subparagraphs?

 MS. MAYNARD: Definitely not, no.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So neither of them 

applies. So it doesn't have to be "in furtherance of" 

or "in relation to"?

 MS. MAYNARD: The -- the sentencing factors 

are set out separately. And you don't get to them --

JUSTICE STEVENS: None of the sentencing 

factors require that that factor be in -- either in 

relation to the crime or in furtherance of the crime? 

It could be just walking down the street, you happen to 

have a gun?

the principal offense, Justice Stevens, before you get 

to sentencing factors. So you have to have either --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Sentencing factors need 

not be in relation to the crime nor in furtherance of 

the crime.

 MS. MAYNARD: Right. The definitive --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be during the 

crime.

 MS. MAYNARD: It has to be during and -- but 

there -- but it's not because the word "during" appears 

in the principal offense, which is how they would have 

our argument be. The -- the -- it has to -- the 

sentencing factor has to occur. First you have to 

commit the principal -- let me just back up. You have 

to commit the principal offense.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why does it have to be 

"during"? It -- it doesn't in the statute?

 MS. MAYNARD: It has to be "during" for 

three reasons. One, the -- the language of the 

sentencing factor says if the firearm is discharged. 

It's in the present tense. So the present tense of the 

"is discharged" language -- it has to be while you're 

using, carrying -- "uses, carries, or possesses" is also 

in the act.

 The "is discharged" has to happen while

you're using, carrying, or possessing. That takes out 

hypotheticals about, well, it was discharged at the 

factory before I got it, and law enforcement discharged 

it well after they took it from me to test the 

ballistics on it. Those aren't covered because it's not 

"is discharged" while you're using, carrying or 

possessing.

 Secondly, this Court in Harris recognized 

that these are the types of sentencing factors that one 

considers when deciding whether a certain fact is 

present in the manner in which an offense is committed. 

So the fact has to be present in the commission of the 

offense. That's just the way this type of sentencing 

factor operates, and the courts so interpreted these 

particular sentencing factors in Harris.

 And we know that it's not because of the 

"during" in the principal paragraph, Justice Stevens, 

because there is no "during" element to the "possession" 

prong. Nevertheless, the sentencing factors apply to 

that prong, and we would apply temporal in cases that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There is an "in 

furtherance." There is an "in furtherance of the 

crime."

JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to make sure I 

understand. You are saying it need not be "during" or 

-- you said it has to be "during" but not because the 

statute includes the word "during."

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what does -- where 

does the "during" come from then?

 MS. MAYNARD: The "during" comes from the 

fact that the sentencing factor is in the present tense, 

and says "is discharged." That means that the "is 

discharged" must occur while the offense is -- is 

occurring. So the temporal limitation comes from, and 

is from, the nature of these types of sentencing 

factors, which ask: Is this factor present? That's 

what Congress cared about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say it can't come 

from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue, 

it wouldn't apply to the mere possession.

 MS. MAYNARD: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the possession could be 

at any time, before the crime, after the crime, 

whatever.

 MS. MAYNARD: Possession -- it would just 

have to be possession that was in furtherance of an 

underlying crime. Once you're guilty of that, if the

 MS. MAYNARD: Some temporal limitation, and 

the limitation is what -- is that it must be discharged 

while you're committing the offense for which you're 

being sentenced when we're looking at sentencing 

factors, which is set forth in 924(c).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's committed when 

the guy is trying to escape, and the gun goes off 

accidentally? Is that in -- I mean is that during the 

crime?

difficult hypothetical about whether or not the 924(c)

crime. He still had it with him all the way through, 

and the gun went off after he left the bank.

point -- in other words he was still possessing it in 

furtherance of the underlying crime of violence, and it 

discharges -- then, yes, the sentencing factor, by its 

plain terms, applies.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then you're telling me 

that it need not be during as long as it's in 

furtherance of. So the "in furtherance of" is also 

incorporated implicitly in the sentencing factors.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the -- no, the "in 

furtherance of," it -- the inquiry we would be making at 

sentencing, Justice Stevens, is not was the discharge in 

furtherance of. You would -- you would -- all you would 

be asking is, were you still possessing the firearm in 

furtherance --

JUSTICE STEVENS: This must be during?

because if that was the only -- if that was the source 

of the contemporaneous requirement, there would be no 

contemporaneous requirement for the in furtherance?

 MS. MAYNARD: That's right. And also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The provision -- the in 

furtherance provision.

 MS. MAYNARD: The reason we don't believe 

that's the correct reading is because, as this Court 

indicated in Harris, the principal offense -- the 

principal paragraph sets forth the complete crime, and 

it ends with "shall." So once you do the things in the 

principals for crime, you're guilty. And then the only 

question is, what shall your sentence be?

these difficult hypotheticals such as the one that 

Justice Stevens put about the gun going off while the --

while the individual is escaping, that's going to be a 

problem whether you adopt your interpretation or the --

or the petitioner's interpretation, even if you assume 

that it has to be during and in relation to it's still

Stevens. Your hypothetical could still raise a

this case is we're talking about a category of crimes in 

which somebody person mistakenly fires the gun, that 

doesn't happen very often. The whole -- the whole

to recognize, though, that Congress didn't want to open 

the door to claims that -- that the firearm was 

discharged accidentally.

defendant -- and says I didn't really mean to shoot the 

guy?

fact of a discharge is what Congress is clearly

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FORSTER: This Court in U.S. Gypsum was 

very clear when it said that far more than the simple 

omission of the appropriate phrase of a statutory 

definition is necessary to justify dispensing with the 

intent requirement.

 And our argument is simply this, merely 

because this might be a sentencing enhancement rather 

than an element of the offense, this Court never says 

that the normal rules of statutory construction cease to 

apply under those circumstances, which means that the 

mens rea presumption is appropriate in this case, and 

just like this Court said in the passage I just cited.

did not do that in this case. If they wanted to do 

that, they could insert the words "intentionally" or 

"unintentionally discharge," in which case that would be 

clear. And that simply is not the way this statute 

reads.

 The best reading of the statute, I believe, 

and this is what Your Honor was headed toward, is to 

read the discharge to require during and in relation to. 

I just think that's the best --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that helping? I mean, 

this did take place during, and you would have thought 

when something goes off accidentally it's in relation 

to. I mean, you know, I can imagine an argument to the 

contrary, but it isn't obvious. It just is --

MR. FORSTER: But, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: They have during, in 

relation to and in furtherance of, so their in 

furtherance of doesn't carry over. The first two do. 

An accidental discharge is it not in relation to the 

crime?

 MR. FORSTER: Not under this Court's 

authority in Smith. I think Smith is clear, the purpose 

and effect and not be used by accident.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What was the case you 

cited when you started your rebuttal?

MR. FORSTER: U.S. Gypsum.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that the antitrust 

case? You caught me by surprise.

 MR. FORSTER: I believe it is. I believe it 

is, Your Honor.

 Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no other 

questions, I thank the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

the case is submitted.
