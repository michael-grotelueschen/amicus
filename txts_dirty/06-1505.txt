3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 06-1505, Meacham versus Knolls Atomic Power

5 Laboratory.

6             Mr. Russell.

7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             This case presents a single important but

12 narrow question.  Everyone agrees that under the

13 reasonable factor other than age provision of the Age

14 Discrimination in Employment Act, a business practice

15 that is reasonable is not unlawful even if it has a

16 disparate impact on older workers.  The question here is

17 simply what happens in cases in which the proof on

18 reasonableness is in equipoise, which party bears the

19 risk of nonpersuasion.  And on that question the statute

20 is not silent such as to leave to the courts to decide

21 for themselves what answer makes the most sense.

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there a hypothetical

23 universe where a scheme that discriminates on the basis

24 of age is reasonable, but there is another alternative

25 that doesn't discriminate on the basis of age?  Is the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

4

1 first alternative still reasonable, or does the

2 existence of a nondiscriminating alternative make it

3 unreasonable?

4             MR. RUSSELL:  This Court made quite clear in

5 City of Jackson that the existence of alternatives,

6 while sufficient perhaps to satisfy Wards Cove and to

7 show a violation under Section 4(a)(2), is not

8 sufficient to show that the action is unreasonable.  And

9 that's what the Court found to be the case in Smith.  So

10 the standards are, in fact, quite different.

11             The reasonable factor other than age

12 provision looks at the reasonableness of the actual,

13 existing practice, and that's where the "because of age"

14 refers to the business practice there.  It doesn't --

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If that's true, then is it

16 necessary either on the burden of production or burden

17 of persuasion aspect of the case to consider other

18 alternatives?

19             MR. RUSSELL:  It is in our view necessary in

20 order to decide whether there is a --

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is it necessary in

22 light of the answer you gave me at the outset?

23             MR. RUSSELL:  It is necessary in order to

24 establish whether you even get to the RFOA provision.

25 By its terms --



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

5

1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Whether you even get to --

2             MR. RUSSELL:  Even get to it, because by its

3 terms the RFOA provision only applies to conduct that is

4 otherwise prohibited by Section 4(a)(2), and the test

5 for whether something is otherwise prohibited under

6 Section 4(a)(2) is Wards Cove.

7             This Court in Smith said that language,

8 which was identical to the language Congress used to

9 describe the unlawful- employment practice in Title VII,

10 has the same meaning in both statutes.  And in order to

11 establish a violation of Wards Cove, you do have to

12 often look at questions of alternatives.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Russell, this is the

14 problem that I have with your double inquiry.  First,

15 you decide business necessity.  Then you decide

16 reasonable factor other than age.  Once you determine

17 that there is no business necessity, there is a readily

18 available alternative, so what you're left with is a

19 pretext for age discrimination, what -- what function is

20 there for anything else to perform?

21             I mean, I understand the business necessity,

22 whether you have it pre-1991 or post, but I don't

23 understand putting this other test on top of it.  It

24 sounds like you're making it harder for the -- for the

25 plaintiff.

1             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, we think that the

2 layering of the tests arises out of the structure of the

3 statute as Congress wrote it.  If this Court disagrees

4 with us, however, and thinks that there is room in the

5 statutory language to treat the language of 4(a)(2)

6 differently in some sense or to apply a different Wards

7 Cove test, then you're still left with the question of

8 who bears the burden of reasonableness.

9             And on that grounds we agree entirely with

10 the EEOC that that question is still determined by the

11 language of the statute, which makes quite clear that

12 Congress thought that this was an exception to liability

13 upon which the employer bears the burden of proof.  And

14 it made that -- made that clear both by setting the RFOA

15 up as an exception to liability, which this Court has

16 long told Congress will be construed as establishing an

17 affirmative defense absent strong indications of

18 contrary legislative intent, and by sandwiching that

19 defense in the same sentence as two other affirmative

20 defenses, which would be a very strange thing to do if

21 Congress in fact intended the courts to figure out, you

22 know, one of the three is not like the others, That it's

23 intended, instead, as a modification of the definition.

24             And, third, Congress I think it -- it does,

25 and it is telling that, in defining the unlawful



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

7

1 employment practice, that is in defining the plaintiff's

2 case in chief, Congress used the same language that it

3 did in Title VII, and this Court has never construed

4 that language to require proof of unreasonableness.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your friend,

6 of course, makes the point that the age discrimination

7 prohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that

8 there are more likely to be instances in which a

9 reasonable factor other than age came into play than

10 there would be a basis for discrimination on the basis

11 of race.

12             MR. RUSSELL:  We acknowledge that.  This

13 Court pointed out in Smith that Congress itself

14 recognized that there was a difference between age and

15 other kinds of discrimination; but it took that

16 difference into account not by defining the unlawful

17 employment practice differently, but by providing age

18 discrimination defendants a capacious defense that's not

19 available to any other defendant in a Federal employment

20 discrimination statute, and by in 1991 not extending the

21 modifications to Wards Cove to ADEA plaintiffs.

22             Congress already specifically addressed this

23 question of whether Wards Cove should be adjusted in

24 order to make age discrimination claims harder to prove

25 than Title VII claims, and it agreed that it should; but



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

8

1 it didn't do it in the way that Respondents suggest.

2 Instead they lowered the bar for Title VII plaintiffs

3 and left in place the Wards Cove test for age

4 discrimination.

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it a strain to say

6 that an employment practice was because of an

7 individual's age, but at the same time was based on

8 reasonable factors other than age?

9             MR. RUSSELL:  Well --

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't the latter negate

11 the former or come very close to negating the former?

12 And if that's the case doesn't that suggest that it's

13 not really an affirmative defense but what's necessary

14 to show liability?

15             MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think it does.  We use

16 the example in our brief of a weight-lifting

17 requirement.  It's quite possible for that requirement,

18 and quite likely, that it will have a disparate impact

19 on older workers because of their age.  The effect will

20 be felt by workers because of their age.  At the same

21 time, it is quite possible that that practice itself

22 will be entirely reasonable.  And the difference is

23 between what the "because of age" refers to in the two

24 different provisions.

25             So if you look on page 3 of the blue brief,



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

9

1 you have the language of the RFOA provision, and the

2 reasonable -- the "factors other than age" refers to in

3 that case the differentiation, that is the business

4 practice itself.  But if you turn to the prior page on

5 page 1A and look at the language of (a)(2), the business

6 practice, that is, the limiting, segregating, or

7 classifying, doesn't have to be because of age.  There

8 wouldn't be a disparate treatment claim.  Instead what

9 "because of age" refers to there is the effect of that

10 facially neutral practice.  That is, the employee has to

11 show that the neutral practice deprives or tends to

12 deprive people of opportunities because of their age.

13             And the way that you do that is through the

14 first step of the Wards Cove analysis, by showing that

15 the practice falls more heavily on older workers as a

16 group, so that you can reach the conclusion that the

17 plaintiff is feeling the effect because of her age as

18 opposed to because of her sex or some other reason

19 specific to her.  So it's not the fact that a showing of

20 RFOA negates the showing that a disparate impact is felt

21 because of age by the plaintiff.

22             As we were -- as I was mentioning before,

23 the language of the statute we think strongly points in

24 favor of an ordinary reading of this as an affirmative

25 defense.  The Respondent's principal objection is that



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

10

1 this doesn't give adequate weight to the differences

2 between age and other forms of discrimination.  But as I

3 mentioned, we -- we do think that Congress took that

4 into account in a different way, and there is, we think,

5 quite an important value here in providing Congress

6 clear rules of interpretation so that it knows when it

7 enacts statutes using a particular formulation the

8 courts will construe it in an ordinary way, absent some

9 compelling indication to the contrary.

10             We recognize, of course, in Betts that this

11 Court found such a compelling counter-indication in the

12 legislative history of that statute, and in the -- the

13 law's traditional treatment of benefits -- retirement

14 benefits and seniority rights.  But Respondents can't

15 point to any kind of similar showing in this case that

16 Congress would have intended this catch-all provision to

17 mean something other than what it seems to say.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The expression comes from

19 the Equal Pay Act, with a substitution.  In the Equal

20 Pay Act it's "any other factor other than sex" and here

21 it's "a reasonable factor other than age."  And my

22 impression is that that formulation in this Equal Pay

23 Act has been rather problematic.  First, you have to

24 find there is a differential between the pay of men and

25 the pay of women, so -- and then you go to any other



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 factor other than sex.

2             Are you suggesting any different analysis

3 for the age category than for the sex category.

4             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, certainly what you have

5 to show before you get to the defense is different in

6 the two statutes.  They are similar in the sense that

7 neither requires proof of intentional discrimination.

8 For example, in Corning Glass Works all the plaintiffs

9 showed there was that a facially neutral practice, that

10 is paying the night shift folks more than the day shift

11 folks, resulted in women getting paid less than men for

12 the same work, and that was sufficient to shift the

13 burden over to the employer to show that it was based on

14 any other factor other than age.

15             And in here we think that it's similar, that

16 the plaintiff has to show that a neutral employment

17 practice has a disparate impact on the basis of age.  We

18 think in our view, in addition, the plaintiff has to

19 make the full Wards Cove showing that would be

20 sufficient in Title VII to establish liability

21 conclusively.  And at that point, then the burden does

22 shift to the employer but it's a modest burden.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The burden of production,

24 of course.

25             MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

12

1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what about the burden

2 of persuasion?

3             MR. RUSSELL:  The burden of persuasion as

4 well.  We think that this is --

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is it that if the

6 employer has the burden of production, and I assume that

7 is satisfied by his saying, here's the plan that we

8 used, here are the factors we used, here is the reason

9 we used them.  What is so difficult for the -- what is

10 the difficulty in saying that the employee then has to

11 show that that is unreasonable?

12             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, we think there are some

13 difficulties, but it's ultimately I think beside the

14 point.  The question is not what rule would make sense,

15 but what does the statute -- what rule does the statute

16 contemplate?  And we think by phrasing the RFOA

17 provision as a traditional affirmative defense --

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You think the statute

19 doesn't make sense, so we don't --

20             MR. RUSSELL:  I think the statute makes

21 perfect sense the way it's written, but if you

22 disagree --

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your point that it's

24 sandwiched between two things that are clearly

25 affirmative defenses, BFOQ, the employer has the buried



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

13

1 of production and persuasion.  And I forgot what the

2 third one --

3             MR. RUSSELL:  The foreign law exception.

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is also an affirmative

5 defense.  So I take it your point is why should this

6 middle one be any different?

7             MR. RUSSELL:  Yes, we think it would be

8 entirely odd for Congress --

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm well aware of

10 the statutory format here.  But what I want to ask is

11 why is it beyond the employee's means and capacity to

12 show that this is unreasonable?  It seems to me that

13 that's the gravamen of this case.

14             MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think it's beyond the

15 employee's means.  I don't think it's an impossible

16 burden.  Certainly Congress could have written the

17 statute in a way that imposed that burden on the

18 employees.  We do think that it makes sense because --

19 that the factors that weigh in on the reasonableness

20 tend to be in the employer's possession and they have

21 better access to it; it makes sense for them to bear the

22 burden.

23             But ultimately our argument isn't grounded

24 on the claim that it would be impossible for Congress to

25 have imposed that burden.  It's grounded on the claim



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

14

1 that the text of the statute indicates that Congress

2 made a different decision, that is it accommodated the

3 employers' interests in dealing with the special facts

4 of age discrimination differently.

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if I find the text

6 of the statute neutral or at least not clear, then it is

7 proper for me to ask as a matter of efficiency where the

8 burden should be placed, is it not?

9             MR. RUSSELL:  It is.  It is.  And my answer

10 is that we do think that most of the facts going to

11 reasonableness are in the employer's possession.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the facts

13 -- I mean, given discovery, that doesn't seem a very

14 compelling case.  Once you require the employer to come

15 up -- in other words, the burden of production -- and

16 say, well, the reason we did it was this, then it's just

17 a matter of discovery.  The plaintiff can say, oh, well,

18 then let me depose that person who is the head of, you

19 know, whatever the department.  If it's for safety

20 reasons, for some reason, or training issues, well, then

21 we depose the person who is in charge of training or

22 safety and ask them those questions.  And it doesn't

23 seem to me that the fact that the employer possesses the

24 information, given very liberal discovery we have, is

25 much of a factor.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

15

1             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, that's true in every

2 case in which informational disadvantages are cited as a

3 reason for putting the burden of proof on one party or

4 the other.  Discovery can always mitigate that

5 disadvantage.

6             But we ultimately think, you know, if you

7 find the statute so ambiguous as to think that it's a

8 really critical consideration of what makes the most

9 sense, then you ought to defer to the judgment of the

10 EEOC on this question.

11             I would like to address if I could one

12 specific --

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the argument was that

14 EEOC never spoke to disparate impact?

15             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, it's certainly clear

16 that the EEOC -- what their position is, and that they

17 read their regulation as addressing disparate impact;

18 and we think that, although it's an inartfully drafted

19 regulation, by using the terms "individual claim of

20 discriminatory treatment" rather than the term of art

21 "disparate treatment," the language is broad enough to

22 bear their reading, particularly when you see that it

23 was enacted in the aftermath of a Department of Labor

24 regulation that nobody disputes addresses

25 disparate-impact cases, and it has no indication that



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

16

1 they were disavowing that position.

2             But if I could address the one other

3 objective --

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  In this area of the law,

5 "treatment" and "impact" are words that have

6 tremendously different meaning.  Isn't it strange to

7 argue that they used the term "treatment" when they

8 really meant "impact"?

9             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I -- I think that the

10 terms of art are "adverse impact" and "disparate

11 treatment."  And so that their failure to use either one

12 of those, I think, supports the idea that they weren't

13 talking about either one specifically.  I agree, it's --

14 it's a hard to read regulation.

15             But if I could turn, for a moment, to the

16 Adams Fruit objection, which is Respondent's insistence

17 that this is not the kind of question that the Court

18 should defer to an agency on.  My point is simply that

19 this is a substantive question of law.  It's a question

20 of whether reasonableness is an element of the unlawful

21 employment practice in section 4(a)(2), the same kind of

22 question this Court asked in Smith when it decided

23 whether discriminatory intent was an element of the

24 4(a)(2) cause of action.

25             And the -- Congress has delegated authority



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

17

1 to the EEOC to address those kinds of questions.  In

2 fact, it went so far as to delegate to the authority --

3 delegate to the EEOC the authority not only to construe

4 the exceptions that are in the Act, but to create

5 additional exceptions.  So I think Congress would be

6 very surprised, indeed, to find out that this is not the

7 sort of question to which it had delegated authority to

8 the EEOC to answer.

9             If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

11             Mr. Joseffer.

12              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

13              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

14                     AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

16             MR. JOSEFFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17 please the Court:

18             Congress enacted the ADEA against a settled

19 background rule that defendants bear the burden of

20 persuasion on affirmative defenses and other exceptions

21 to liability.  And Congress made very clear in the

22 statute that the "reasonable factors other than age"

23 provision is precisely such an affirmative defense.  It

24 did so first by saying that the provision applies to

25 activities that are "otherwise prohibited by subsection



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

18

1 A."

2             That has to mean that liability for

3 disparate impacts exists under subsection A without

4 regard to whether the employment practice is based on

5 reasonable factors other than age.  The latter inquiry

6 is then a defense to the liability that would "otherwise

7 exist" under subsection A.

8             The second is a point that Justice Ginsburg

9 made, which is that this subsection (f)(1) lists three

10 different defenses right in a row.  It appears to be

11 common ground that the other two are clearly affirmative

12 defenses as to which the employer bears the burden of

13 persuasion.  And considering that all three are

14 introduced by the same "otherwise prohibited" language

15 and they are set forth in a single sentence separated

16 only by commas, there is no basis for distinguishing

17 among them.

18             Now, the defendant's main argument seems --

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure that if the

20 statute contains three different conditions, three

21 different commands, that it follows that the procedural

22 implementations for all of these has to be the same.

23             Do you have any authority for that

24 proposition?

25             MR. JOSEFFER:  No.  I mean, it's just a



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

19

1 matter of how to interpret the particular statute.  And

2 since our point here is that this is a subsection on its

3 face --

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you want to say that

5 Congress was well aware of burden of persuasion, burden

6 of production problems with affirmative action, then

7 they wouldn't have drafted it this way, that's one

8 thing.  I'm not sure that that's true.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose you could appeal

10 to the maxim noscitur ex sociis, couldn't you --

11             MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and say if it's in with

13 two other chickens, it's probably a chicken?

14             MR. JOSEFFER:  Exactly.  I mean, words are

15 generally known by the company they keep.  And with

16 these three in a row, it would presumptively assume that

17 they are all --

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  These are not words.

19 They are operative provisions of law.

20             MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  They are three

21 separate clauses that are set forth, introduced by the

22 same, in our view, dispositive language, which is the

23 "otherwise prohibited" phrase.

24             It's also the only way to make sense of the

25 statute as a whole, because the defendant's view seems



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

20

1 to be that "because of age" under subsection (a)(2) and

2 "reasonable factors other than age" under subsection

3 (f)(1), should essentially be conflated such that the

4 second, more specific provision is essentially

5 surplusage.

6             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that "based on

7 reasonable factors other than age" in the ADEA means

8 something different from because of such -- I'm sorry,

9 that the -- because of an individual's age in the ADEA

10 means something different from because of such

11 individual's race, color, religion, sex or national

12 origin?

13             MR. JOSEFFER:  It modifies -- it modifies

14 something different.  "Based on reasonable factors other

15 than age" modifies the underlying employment practice,

16 the differentiation.  Over an (a)(2) -- and this was the

17 basis of the Court's decision in Smith in part --

18 "because of" does not modify the underlying employment

19 practice.  It modifies the adverse effect of the

20 unemployment practice.  In other words, the statute

21 refers to -- and this is on page 1a of the blue brief

22 appendix -- it refers to an employment practice such as

23 a classification that adversely affects an individual

24 because of that individual's age.

25             So "because of" logically modifies what



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

21

1 comes before it, which is "adverse effect."  And that's

2 confirmed by the fact that the first sentence that talks

3 about the employment practices is written in the plural,

4 whereas "adverse effect" and "because of" are written in

5 the singular with respect to individual, which is

6 another point the Court made in footnote 6 in Smith.

7             And that also has to be the case because

8 disparate impact liability is not based on intent.  It

9 doesn't matter why the employer draft -- has the

10 employment practice.  What matters is the effect.  So in

11 any disparate impact case there are two basic inquiries:

12 the first is, is there an adverse effect on the

13 protected class; and the second is, has the business

14 practice nonetheless justifiable.

15             And here Congress broke those two out.

16 Subsection (a)(2) addresses is there an adverse effect

17 on the -- on the protected class.  And then in (f)(1),

18 Congress specifically addressed the justification

19 standard.  That's one reason that we disagree with

20 Petitioners about their four-part test.  Here Congress

21 clearly -- here the first part of Wards Cove tells us

22 whether there is an adverse effect under subsection

23 (a)(2).  But then when it comes to the justification

24 step, Congress clearly said that the justification is a

25 reasonable factor other than age.  So there is no need



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

22

1 to read in a different justification standard from the

2 second and third prongs of Wards Cove.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The problem is that you

4 would be making this provision more generous to the

5 plaintiff than -- for example, in Title VII the defense

6 is business necessity; the employer has the burden of

7 production; the employee has the burden of persuasion.

8 Here you'd read -- you're saying you come into the

9 covered category, you were shown because of age through

10 impact, and then the burden -- the total burden is on

11 the employer.

12             Am -- am I making myself clear here?

13             MR. JOSEFFER:  I think -- I think I

14 understand the question.  This statute is far more

15 employer-friendly in the standard than Title VII because

16 it relies on the reasonable factors -- the

17 reasonableness defense, which is a much lower standard

18 than the business necessity test under Title VII.  That

19 reflects the fact that there are more innocent

20 explanations for age disparity.

21             The separate question here, though, on

22 burden of persuasion, I think the key point there is

23 that in Wards Cove this Court only had the equivalent of

24 (a)(2) to work with.  So it had not much textual basis

25 to go on with respect to the second and third factors of



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

23

1 Wards Cove and burden-shifting.  The Court had to do a

2 lot of gap-filling once it recognized the disparate

3 impact claim.

4             Since then, however, in every one of these

5 related civil rights statutes that Congress has enacted,

6 it has spoken more clearly on the justification stage;

7 and has always in every one of these statutes put that

8 burden on the defendant.  It did it in Equal Pay Act,

9 according to this Court's decision in Corning Glass.  It

10 did it in the revised Title VII.  It did it here.  And

11 even in the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress

12 specified that business necessity is a "defense."

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I was

14 surprised not to see Chevron cited in your brief.  What

15 -- what sort of deference do you think we should give

16 the EEOC regulations here?

17             MR. JOSEFFER:  Auer -- in our view the

18 regulation itself as far as it goes is entitled to

19 Chevron deference, because it's a notice and comment

20 rulemaking pursuant to delegated legislative authority.

21 We recognize, however, that the regulation on its face

22 is at best inartfully written; and therefore, the

23 question is how to interpret the regulation.

24             We think EEOC's interpretation of its

25 regulation in context is reasonable for a combination of



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

24

1 a few factors.  First, the Department of Labor

2 contemporaneously enacted a regulation putting the

3 burden on the employer in all cases.

4             Second, when the EEOC took over rulemaking

5 authority, it didn't insert this unusual discriminatory

6 treatment language in there, but the EEOC's position at

7 that time and ever since has been that it did not intend

8 a substantive change.

9             And third, discriminatory treatment, while

10 it undoubtedly throws a real wrench in -- or wrinkle

11 into things -- excuse me -- and takes us out of Chevron

12 and into Auer, is not a term of art.  Disparate

13 treatment is a term of art.  The regulations otherwise

14 use the phrase "different treatment," but discriminatory

15 treatment is at best confusing, especially

16 considering --

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I

18 thought Auer deference tells you how to interpret the

19 regulation.  And having once interpreted the regulation,

20 you need to know what to do with it.

21             MR. JOSEFFER:  My understanding of Auer

22 deference is that the agency gets deference as the

23 reasonable interpretation of its regulation.  And the

24 agency has consistent --

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We know what the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 regulation -- we give it deference; we know what the

2 regulation means.  Now, does that regulation, as

3 understood in light of Auer deference, get Chevron

4 deference or something else?

5             MR. JOSEFFER:  It would get Chevron

6 deference.  I mean, I think the two-step process is the

7 regulation here, in our view, is clearly entitled to

8 Chevron deference as far as it goes.  And if you defer

9 under Auer to the agency's view of its regulation, then

10 that makes the Chevron case.  But it's through the lens

11 of Auer.

12             And finally, as a policy matter, Justice

13 Kennedy, one can reasonably place this burden of

14 persuasion either way.  I mean this Court put it one

15 place in Wards Cove.  Congress immediately abrogated

16 Wards Cove and put it in the other place.  The sky is

17 not going to fall either way.  But even if the text

18 wasn't so clear, one would logically put it on the

19 employer for a few reasons:  First, all else being

20 equal, the employer is at least in a better decision to

21 explain the reasonableness of its very own business

22 practice.

23             And, second, the parties are not ordinarily

24 expected to prove a negative, which is what the

25 plaintiff would have to do here.  And that's why in



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

26

1 every statute enacted after 1964, which is the first --

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is it proving a

3 negative?  They would just have to prove that it was or

4 was not a reasonable factor other than age.

5             MR. JOSEFFER:  Right, and --

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, and just adding on to

7 the Chief Justice, it seems the employer is the one that

8 would prove the negative.  He has to say there were no

9 -- here is a whole universe of other frameworks, and

10 none of these work.

11             MR. JOSEFFER:  No, it's a very simple

12 two-part test.  Once the plaintiff has established an

13 adverse effect, an adverse impact -- I mean, even the

14 defendant agrees that presumptively establishes

15 liability, because the defendant agrees to bear at least

16 the burden of production at that point.

17             And the question for the employer is just to

18 show that its business practices -- own business

19 practice is reasonable, is supported by some reasonable

20 factor other than age.  And it ought not be hard for an

21 employer, especially considering that the reasonableness

22 standard is not very daunting, to explain why its own

23 business practice is reasonable.  And if an employer

24 can't even persuade someone that its own business

25 practice is reasonable, then the odds are that there is



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

27

1 a problem.

2             Thank you.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

4             Mr. Waxman.

5              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

6               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7             MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court:

9             I want to make an argument both from

10 elegance and from function and from structure.  Under

11 the employment discrimination -- a wide range of

12 employment discrimination, beginning with this Court's

13 decision in McDonnell Douglas, this Court has applied a

14 three-step balance-shifting paradigm in order to help

15 juries resolve the question of whether discrimination

16 occurred.  In the disparate treatment cases there is a

17 burden -- the first step, the plaintiff has to establish

18 a prima facie case that he was the subject of disparate

19 treatment because of his race or sex.

20             The burden of production then shifts to the

21 defendant in order to explain, under disparate treatment

22 cases, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, which

23 eliminates the presumption consistent with Evidence Rule

24 301, and the burden of proof then resumes on the

25 plaintiff to prove discrimination because of the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

28

1 prohibited characteristic.

2             Now, in Wards Cove, this Court looked both

3 to Rule 301 and to the paradigm in other discrimination

4 cases to apply a three-part test, in which there is a

5 burden of proof to establish a presumption, a burden of

6 production to neutralize it, and then a burden of proof

7 to show because of race.

8             The Second Circuit has done exactly that in

9 this case, and we think they are right not just because

10 that harmonizes this Court's prior discrimination cases,

11 and not just because three seems to be more elegant than

12 the four steps that the Petitioners want or the two

13 steps that the Government wants, but because it makes

14 sense.

15             And this goes directly to the question, I

16 think it was, that Justice Alito asked:  Whether or not

17 the "reasonable factors other than age" inquiry is

18 simply what's necessary to show liability, that is, that

19 it was because of.

20             The ADEA doesn't prohibit disparate

21 treatment.  It doesn't prohibit disparate impact.  It

22 prohibits -- doesn't prohibit employment practices

23 simply because they correlate negatively with age.  A

24 plaintiff has to prove that he has suffered adverse

25 employment action because of his age.  And the question



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

29

1 whether an employer based its action on reasonable

2 factors other than age is part and parcel of that

3 inquiry.  It's not a free-standing --

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Waxman, the first

5 part --

6             MR. WAXMAN:  -- confession and avoidance

7 defense.

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The way you phrased the

9 first part, it sounded to me like you were going back to

10 the interpretation that this Court rejected, that is,

11 under the Age Discrimination Act there is only

12 differential treatment, not neutral factor with a

13 differential impact.

14             MR. WAXMAN:  No, not at all.  Not at all.

15 If I said that, I certainly don't want to be mistaken.

16 We are not up here arguing that there is no disparate

17 impact theory of liability under the ADEA as there is

18 under Title VII.  This Court resolved that question in

19 Smith, and it resolved it in large part by reference to

20 the "reasonable factors other than age" provision, which

21 Justice Stevens' opinion for a plurality of the Court

22 explained that, when you have a disparate treatment

23 case, if the plaintiff proves that his -- his or her

24 treatment -- if the defendant proves that it was because

25 of something other than age, it isn't disparate



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

30

1 treatment.

2             The fact that there is an RFOA provision, we

3 think, does reflect the fact that there is the potential

4 for liability under disparate impact, but as this Court

5 explained, it's narrower.  And it's narrower because --

6 not only because the 1991 amendments didn't apply to age

7 cases; it's narrower, because as this Court has

8 recognized in almost every age case it has decided, age

9 -- unlike race and sex and religion and national origin

10 -- often does -- sad to say by somebody who is in his

11 second decade of protection under the ADEA -- often does

12 correlate with reasonable employment factors.

13             And the fact that all -- what it means is

14 that at step one of the burden-shifting analysis, the

15 Wards Cove analysis, which in a race or sex case

16 establishes a strong presumption that the employment

17 action was because of race or sex because there are so

18 few employment characteristics that do correlate

19 negatively with one's race or one's gender, it's a

20 strong presumption which nonetheless need be met only by

21 a burden of production.

22             This Court has recognized that in the age

23 context, the presumption actually is quite weak.  And it

24 would be more than perverse to adopt the Government's

25 proposal, which is that notwithstanding the much weaker



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

31

1 inference, the burden of persuasion is now on the

2 employer, not the employee.  And, in fact, the principal

3 problem, I would say, with the Government the EEOC

4 proposal --

5             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Waxman, what do you do

6 about the language "otherwise prohibited"?

7             MR. WAXMAN:  Excuse me?

8             JUSTICE STEVENS:  What do you do about that

9 language in the statute?

10             MR. WAXMAN:  May I just finish my sentence

11 --

12             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Sure.

13             MR. WAXMAN:  -- Justice Stevens, and go

14 right to "otherwise prohibited"?

15             The government's proposal under which, once

16 the employer establishes the statistical disparity, the

17 burden of proof shifts to the employer, equates what

18 this Court has said over and over again is a prima facie

19 case or a presumption into liability.  It would dictate

20 precisely the opposite result that this Court found in

21 St. Mary's Honor Center.  It would allow the jury, upon

22 silence by the defendant, not to say, well, you may

23 consider this presumption to be enough if you don't hear

24 any other evidence.  It would tell the jury the proof of

25 statistical disparity is proof of discrimination.  And



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

32

1 that's just wrong.

2             Now, "otherwise prohibited" --

3             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Even that, there's a

4 question about not merely statistical disparity, but a

5 causal connection between an identified practice --

6             MR. WAXMAN:  Right.

7             JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- in the disparity.

8             MR. WAXMAN:  That's exactly right.

9             Now, with respect to the structure of the

10 statute and "otherwise prohibited," the -- my friends on

11 the other side of this case turn almost everything on

12 the fact that the "reasonable factors other than age"

13 provision applies in -- in subsection (f) and is -- as

14 Justice Ginsburg said -- is sandwiched in between two

15 other provisions that, for argument's sake, let's just

16 acknowledge are affirmative defenses on which the

17 employer would bear the burden of proof.  And why

18 doesn't that prove anything?

19             I'll go first to "otherwise prohibited" and

20 then explain why the sandwich effect is no more

21 persuasive here than it was to the Court in Betts.

22             "Otherwise prohibited" means that it is

23 prohibited subject to the following conditions.  It

24 doesn't say who bears the burden of those conditions.

25             What it reflects, Justice Stevens, is this



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

33

1 fact.  You could have taken everything that is in F and

2 just put it into A, but you would then have had to put

3 it into B and C and E.  And so what Congress said was --

4 it didn't say not -- things that are prohibited in

5 Section A won't be unlawful if X, Y and Z.  It says

6 "otherwise prohibited" in those sections.

7             In other words, it doesn't -- it means

8 nothing other than it's prohibited subject to the

9 following conditions.  Now, I will acknowledge for

10 argument's purposes -- and it actually suits my argument

11 -- to show that the BFOQ defense and the

12 foreign-employer defense are affirmative defenses.

13 Because as we -- as we know from Black's Law Dictionary

14 and this Court's decisions, Dixon, for example, an

15 affirmative defense is a defense that says:  I admit the

16 allegations of the complaint, but I have a justification

17 for it that the law recognizes.

18             Now, that's --

19             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't it -- isn't the --

20 isn't the weak point in your argument the following:

21 Your argument assumes that when the employer implicitly

22 says I admit the allegations the complainant made, that

23 the employer is admitting, in effect, to disparate

24 treatment.  That he is saying:  I did it because it was

25 my purpose to discriminate against the old.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

34

1             But if we read the "because" language as

2 also admitting the meaning, "I did it or it had an

3 impact by reason of the age, regardless of my intent,"

4 then this incongruity that you are arguing about

5 disappears.

6             MR. WAXMAN:  No.  It is quite to the

7 contrary, unless -- and it may be the case that I'm

8 completely misunderstanding you.

9             The point is that at step one the plaintiff

10 has to prove a statistical disparity, a substantial,

11 negative, statistical correlation.  And that raises a

12 presumption that what was otherwise a neutral -- appears

13 to be a neutral factor was, in fact, because of age.

14 That these --

15             JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, for the

16 purpose of discriminating against the old.

17             MR. WAXMAN:  Whether it's --

18             JUSTICE SOUTER:  And that's -- that's

19 disparate treatment.

20             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, no.  What this -- what

21 this Court said in Griggs is there are proof problems.

22 There are plenty of instances in which there is

23 undiscovered, unreconciled, unacknowledged inferences

24 about people.  And old people is the perfect example

25 where there is no history of invidious discrimination.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

35

1 There is no prior hurdle that, unlike black people and

2 women had to overcome -- which was another factor in

3 Griggs.  It's that we all get old, and people have

4 preconceptions sometimes about the enormity of

5 limitations of age which may not be justified.

6             So the way that these defenses, the

7 sandwich, if you will, works is the plaintiff under

8 Wards Cove shows his statistical case.  It's a prima

9 facie -- it shows that there is a disparate impact,

10 period.  But the statute --

11             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Waxman, you have to

12 keep in mind they are not just showing a disparate

13 impact.  Because of a particular practice there is a

14 disparate impact.  That's what you leave out.  So the

15 quality of the practice is what is at issue, and the

16 defendant doesn't come in and say I admit that it was

17 unlawful.  He first tries to prove it was necessary, and

18 he fails on that.  And if he fails on that, he has the

19 lesser burden of proving reasonableness.

20             MR. WAXMAN:  No, well let -- let me see if I

21 can't address Justice Souter's point first.  I do think

22 I understand your point, which is what's wrong with the

23 Petitioner's case.  But, Justice Souter, the point is

24 that once a prima facie case is established in an age

25 case -- let's just take the three provisions that are at



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

36

1 issue in (f)(1).

2             Under BFOQ, the employer gets up and says:

3 Well, ladies and gentlemen, the judge is going to tell

4 you that they have established a prima facie case that

5 the way that these otherwise neutral -- that this was

6 because of the plaintiff's age.  And you know what?  I

7 admit it.  I, in fact, admit that it was by accident

8 because of age.

9             JUSTICE SOUTER:  In an impact -- no.  In an

10 impact case, he is saying:  I admit that the impact

11 falls more heavily on the old.

12             MR. WAXMAN:  Correct.

13             JUSTICE SOUTER:  And -- and it seems to me

14 that's all he has to admit in an impact case.  And he

15 does so, and then he --

16             MR. WAXMAN:  What he basically says is:  I

17 agree that age was the factor, but I have an excuse for

18 it.  And, similarly, in the third exception, the

19 foreign-employers exception, he comes in and says:  You

20 have heard all of the statistics.  And you know what?  I

21 did do this to disadvantage old people, because my plant

22 is in a country that discriminates -- that makes it

23 illegal for people over 65 to work.  But --

1 people.  He did it because the foreign country requires

2 him --

3             MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  And that's why

4 I admit -- I admit that I did this in a way that had a

5 disparate impact on old people.  I did it, if you will,

6 in order to -- I have a justification for it.  Whereas,

7 in the reasonable factors other than age, the assertion

8 is everybody understands that the plaintiff has the

9 ultimate burden to prove that he or she suffered an

10 adverse employment action because of age, not because of

11 some factor that for entirely good reasons correlates

12 with age.  And the showing that there is a statistical

13 --

14             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, then you're -- then

15 you're just saying that there -- that there is no such

16 thing as a disparate-impact case.

17             MR. WAXMAN:  No.

18             JUSTICE SOUTER:  You're saying -- you're

19 saying that there's got to be a disparate-treatment

20 case.

21             MR. WAXMAN:  No, no; not at all.

22             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, then I'm not

23 following you.

24             MR. WAXMAN:  Let's take their -- let's take

25 their 50-pound hypothetical.  The employer says:  Okay,



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

38

1 from now on all of our employees have to be able to lift

2 50 pounds over their head, you know, 10 times in 30

3 seconds.  And older people or women -- let's say older

4 people, you know, say:  Well, statistically, that has

5 wiped us out.  That has had a substantial -- a

6 substantial adverse effect on us because we are old, and

7 we have less upper body strength.

8             The employer then gives -- comes forward

9 with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason or a

10 reasonable factor other than age, and says, for example,

11 well, you know, this is -- we need our employees to be

12 able to lift strong things.  If the plaintiff comes back

13 and says, I am an accountant, that's not reasonable,

14 it's a very different case than if this is a requirement

15 imposed on stocking clerks in an auto parts -- auto

16 parts shop where you do have to lift very heavy things

17 over your head.

18             In other words, the paradigm that this Court

19 set out in Wards Cove applies exactly the same way.  It

20 applies a three-part test except that at step three the

21 standard of justification is different.

22             And this, I think -- I hope, Justice

23 Stephens, goes to your question.  In Wards Cove this

24 Court said you show a prima facie case of a disparate

25 impact.  The burden then -- the burden of production



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

39

1 then shifts to the employer to explain that it was --

2 there is a business -- to articulate a business

3 justification for the facially neutral requirement.

4             And what the plaintiff then has to do is

5 bear the burden of proving that that wasn't a business

6 necessity; that there is one other way, one other way in

7 which it could have been done; and, therefore --

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you there agree that

9 there is a distinction between "business necessity" and

10 "business reasonableness"?

11             MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  And, in fact, I think

12 it's sort of embedded in the very opening of the blue

13 brief in this case, where the Petitioner says:  Well,

14 the Court has sometimes used the word "business

15 justification," and the Court has sometimes used the

16 word "business necessity," and we don't really think

17 that means anything, so we use the words

18 interchangeably.

19             But this case shows that it means everything

20 because at step three of Wards Cove the petitioner --

21 the plaintiff's burden is proving that it is -- that

22 there is one other way -- that all you have to show is

23 that it wasn't a necessity to do it that way in order to

24 achieve your objective and the employee wins.

25             But because of the differential in



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

40

1 correlation between age and employment factors, in this

2 case it is a business justification; that is, the

3 employee has to come in and say it just wasn't

4 reasonable to use that.

5             And this case is a perfect example.  Here we

6 have a research lab that has one client.  It's the

7 nuclear reactor division of the United States submarine

8 unit.  And they come, and they say -- and there is no

9 dispute about the facts here -- they say the Cold War is

10 over.  We aren't going to have as much work for you.

11 And since you're cost-plus, you're going to have to

12 reduce your work force; and because we are in a

13 different kind of war, we have new missions.  You are

14 going to have to design and engineer and implement

15 things that you hadn't done it before.  And so you need

16 to figure out a way to go ahead and do this.

17             And what the company did was to go through

18 all of its units and then subunits and sections, and

19 say:  Given the new mission that the Navy has told us we

20 are going to have to occupy, do you have people -- do

21 you have more people than you're going to get paid for

22 to do what you have to do?

23             If the answer is yes -- if the answer is no,

24 you're fine.  If the answer is yes, please consider the

25 following:  What are the skills within the people within



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

41

1 your section, subsection, or unit that are excess, that

2 in light of the reduced and changed mission we don't

3 need?  Identify those skills.  Then go through each one

4 of your employees; and if it is an employee with that

5 skill, rank them on a scale of 1 to 10 according to four

6 different characteristics:  Seniority, which gives a

7 benefit to older workers; recent job-performance

8 ratings; the criticality of the other skills they have,

9 do they have some other skill that is going to be

10 required; and their flexibility -- how willing have they

11 been, or are they, to learn new skills?

12             And the company has a training manual.  It

13 goes through and trains the managers to do this.  It is

14 approved by the Department of Energy and the Department

15 of the Navy.  But after the managers engage in this

16 analysis and prepare this matrix, they then have to

17 justify it before a central review board, which the

18 plaintiff's own expert acknowledged was set up in order

19 to make the managers defend each decision and make sure

20 that those judgments corresponded with overall

21 management's responsibilities.

22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Still, the numbers, the

23 way it came out, are rather startling.  That there were

24 31 people who were RIF'd; and of those, 30 turn out to

25 be over 40.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

42

1             MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  And as the

2 district court found and the court of appeals found,

3 those were strikingly stark numbers.  They were so stark

4 that they came to the immediate attention of the

5 company's management and general counsel, Mr. Correa,

6 who was -- who looked at this and said:  We are going to

7 get sued for age discrimination.  What should we do

8 about this?

9             And what he did about this, what the proof

10 showed, is he went back and said:  Is each one of these

11 decisions justifiable?  Did they really apply these

12 factors?  He testified that he considered just saying:

13 We'll go back and redo it so that the age distribution

14 comes out right.  But he was concerned that the New York

15 human rights law, which defines -- this is sort of

16 astounding -- defines "older worker" as somebody over

17 18, does have a reverse-discrimination provision.

18             But the point here is -- and, therefore, he

19 decided:  We did this right; we used a matrix that

20 unrebutted testimony said was the paradigm in industry.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the terms

22 "flexibility," "criticality" -- I mean the way you

23 described it, it sounds very mechanical, mathematical.

24 But those terms are -- they call for some human

25 judgment.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

43

1             MR. WAXMAN:  They definitely do.  And the

2 second question that was presented in this case, which

3 the Court didn't accept, was an assertion by the

4 Petitioner that the Second Circuit had assertedly held

5 that where a reasonable factor other than age derives

6 from a subjective judgment, the Second Circuit had held

7 that it was immune from review under disparate-impact

8 theory, which, as the Government pointed out in its

9 invitation brief, is not at all what the Second Circuit

10 held.

11             The point is that this Court in Smith and

12 earlier in Hazen Paper and earlier age cases was highly

13 cognizant of the fact that unless there is a test that

14 implies that -- that applies certainty for employers,

15 there is going to be -- age -- if this standard isn't

16 reasonable and if it isn't up to the other side to prove

17 that it's unreasonable, employers are essentially going

18 to take age into account.  They are going to do what

19 Mr. Correa testified he wouldn't do, which is rejigger

20 the results to come up with a -- a percentage that more

21 approximated the balance in the work force.  And that,

22 this Court has said repeatedly --

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, maybe because he

24 thought that, given the subjectivity of some of these

25 factors, that there was at least unconscious age bias in



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

44

1 the decisions that were made.

2             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, that is

3 why -- and it was testimony both from the employees in

4 the case and from our uncross-examined expert and even

5 their expert -- the review board -- the company set up a

6 central review board which was trained and which

7 examined every single manager about every single

8 decision, whether you call it subjective or objective.

9             Now, the district court -- the trial court

10 who heard the testimony said that he -- he deemed

11 flexibility and criticality objective.  He said they

12 were objective factors because of all the instructions

13 that were given, which we have reprinted in the joint

14 appendix in this case.  But even assuming -- and I

15 certainly take your point, Justice Ginsburg, that if you

16 ask a manager to evaluate an employee on the degree of

17 criticality of that employee's skills or the flexibility

18 of that employee, you can give her all the training in

19 the world.  You can give her a 16-point checklist.

20 Ultimately, you're relying on a judgment by a human

21 being of another human being.

22             But why would we not want employers to do

23 that?  Why would we want them to -- to retreat to the

24 safe harbor of some safe quota.  You know, gee, we have

25 a 60/40 split in our work force; and, wow, these



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 numbers, we did it according to Hoyle.  We've done --

2 this is the paradigm RIF process, but go back and do it

3 in a way that comes out with a specific set of numbers.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, is your

5 recent discussion about what happened here go simply to,

6 I guess, your alternative argument, that we should

7 affirm because you're right, regardless of who bears the

8 burden; or does it really go to the legal question

9 before us?

10             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I think it goes to both.

11 I mean it goes to -- it simply -- it certainly goes to

12 the question over whether, whoever has the burden on

13 reasonableness, you ought to do what you did in Smith

14 and what the Eleventh Circuit did in Montalvo, which is

15 the case you cited in Smith.  And in --

16             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Here we have a jury

17 verdict that was affirmed by the court of appeals.

18             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, we have a jury verdict.

19 We have a jury verdict under Wards Cove.  The court of

20 appeals, as we pointed out in -- to the court of appeals

21 the first time and in our petition for certiorari here

22 the last time and to the court of appeals the second

23 time and to this Court on pages 4, 5, and 7 of our brief

24 in opposition this time -- the court of appeals was

25 simply wrong in both step one and step three of Wards



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

46

1 Cove.  This is even assuming Wards Cove were the test.

2 There is -- under step three of Wards Cove, which is how

3 this case was tried, it was concededly the plaintiff's

4 burden to prove that there was some other way, one other

5 way, to do what the company wanted that established that

6 this wasn't a business necessity.  And I will represent

7 to the Court that in five and a half weeks of testimony

8 there is not one sentence of evidence to that effect.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was taken out of

10 it by Judge Jacobs when he redid it.  He said, we were

11 on the wrong track with business necessity.  Business

12 necessity is out.  It's only reasonable factor of age.

13             MR. WAXMAN:  What Judge Jacobs said is the

14 case was tried under business necessity, under which the

15 plaintiffs at least had to prove that there was some

16 other way that the company could equally have achieved

17 its objectives.

18             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, wasn't the issue of

19 reasonable factor under age tried in the trial court

20 when the case was tried?

21             MR. WAXMAN:  No, because the EEOC regulation

22 at the time, regulation (d), which deals with

23 disparate-impact cases, said that reasonable -- the

24 reasonable factors other than age provision is proven

25 by, and only by, the business-necessity defense, a



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

47

1 defense as to which the plaintiffs bear the burden.

2             And, in fact, in Wards Cove, the Government

3 in Wards Cove was on the employer's side.  The

4 Government urged the court to do exactly what it did.

5 And under the Government's own regulation 1625.7(d), the

6 burden of proving reasonable factors other than age was

7 correctly on the plaintiff, but incorrectly equated with

8 the substantive showing of business.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that --

10             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Am I correct to understand

11 that your trial counsel then took the position you must

12 prove business necessity?  I mean an absence of business

13 necessity, rather than reasonableness.  They didn't

14 advance their strongest defense.

15             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, no, we took the position

16 that reasonable factors other than age was a separate

17 test and was a separate defense.

18             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.

19             MR. WAXMAN:  The judge instructed the jury

20 to the contrary and said under Wards Cove --

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was Judge Pooler wrong,

22 then?  She said, in effect:  You forfeited reasonable

23 factor other than sex, because you didn't bring it up.

24 You were going on business necessity.

25             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, what happened was -- I



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

48

1 mean, Judge Pooler is wrong in certain respects, but not

2 that respect.  We -- our answer pleaded reasonable

3 factors other than age, but we didn't -- neither we nor

4 our opponents asked for a separate instruction on

5 reasonable factors other than age.  The jury was

6 instructed on the Wards Cove analysis because --

7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The jury didn't hear a

8 word about reasonable factors other than age.  They

9 heard about business necessity.

10             MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  I mean that --

11 and that's because -- you could say that it was a mutual

12 mistake by everyone involved.  But the EEOC had directed

13 under subsection (d) of its regulations that reasonable

14 factor other than age could be established only by

15 proving business necessity.  And both parties --

16             JUSTICE STEVENS:  As everybody now knows,

17 that was wrong.

18             MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  And the -- my

19 point is we are --  we are entitled to judgment in our

20 favor.  We are entitled to an affirmance because, number

21 one, the Second Circuit was correct that the burden of

22 proving reasonableness was on them, and the -- the

23 Petitioners have acknowledged expressly on page 53 of

24 their blue brief that if in fact it is true that the

25 Second -- if the Second Circuit is in fact correct, then



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

49

1 the judgment is affirmed, that is, they say when a --

2 "While a defendant has no obligation to press an issue

3 upon which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof --

4 and therefore the Second Circuit may have been justified

5 in reviewing the evidence of reasonableness in light of

6 its holding that Petitioners bore the burden of proof"

7 --

8             JUSTICE STEVENS:  But did you plead this as

9 an affirmative defense?  Did you plead it as an

10 affirmative defense?

11             MR. WAXMAN:  We pleaded it as a -- I can't

12 bring the complaint to mind, but we pleaded it as a

13 separately specified defense, yes.  We said, in our

14 answer to the complaint, we said this is a reasonable

15 factor other than age.

16             And so we are -- everyone acknowledges that

17 if the Second Circuit is correct as to where the burden

18 applies, the judgment should be affirmed.  Our

19 submission is that the judgment has to be affirmed

20 whether or not the burden applies as the Second Circuit

21 held.

22             Thank you.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

1               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

2                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3             MR. RUSSELL:  I'd like to begin by

4 addressing the general legal question that the Court

5 granted cert on, and particularly going back to this

6 idea, this assertion that the proof of the RFOA is

7 somehow a negation of the obligation that the plaintiff

8 has to prove that they have suffered a disparate impact

9 because of age.  It is simply incorrect.  It's based --

10 as, Justice Souter, I think you were suggesting in some

11 of your questions -- on a confusion about what the

12 "because of age" requirement is in a disparate-impact

13 case under Section 4(a)(2).  The requirement under

14 Section 4(a)(2) is simply to show that the effect of the

15 practice is felt because of age, while the defense in

16 the RFOA provision is to show that the practice itself

17 is reasonable even though it has this effect.

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the practice -- if a

19 practice correlates with a number of -- statistically

20 correlates with a number of different factors, is it

21 because of all of those factors?

22             MR. RUSSELL:  I think, under Wards Cove,

23 this Court has said that it does, and so under Wards

24 Cove you establish that the discrimination is felt by

25 older workers because of age by showing that all the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

51

1 workers as a group suffer disproportionately from it.

2             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Wards Cove, in other words,

3 says "because" may mean "correlation" and it mean

4 "purpose," either one.

5             MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  I mean --

6             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.

7             MR. RUSSELL:  But I think all you have to

8 show under 4(a)(2) is that the practice tends to

9 disadvantage older workers because of their age.  And so

10 again in our weight -- weight example, the employer

11 admits in our weight example that the effect of the

12 neutral practice is to fall more heavily, is to restrict

13 the employment opportunities of older workers because of

14 age, but says, even if that's true -- even if there is a

15 disparate impact because of age-- we are still entitled

16 to the defense because the practice itself is

17 reasonable.

18             It's also -- I would like to address the

19 suggestion that Griggs is directed -- or disparate

20 impact is directed at ferreting out intentional

21 discrimination.  Certainly it serves that function in

22 many cases, but that's not the sole purpose of it.  And

23 it's simply not the purpose of the prima facie case in

24 Wards Cove to give rise to an inference of intentional

25 discrimination, and the fact that it doesn't as strongly



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

52

1 in the age case I think isn't a reason to think that

2 Congress intended the courts to develop a different test

3 for showing what's otherwise prohibited under 4(a)(2).

4             And, finally, if I could address some of the

5 questions regarding what happened in this case.  This

6 case, Justice Stevens, was not tried with reasonableness

7 in mind, both because Respondents abandoned their

8 "reasonable factor other than age" defense, which they

9 had raised as an affirmative defense in their answer.  I

10 believe Mr. Waxman is incorrect when he suggests that

11 they in fact asked for instructions.

12             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, if he put in all the

13 evidence he's described, that would not have proven

14 business necessity.  It seems to me that evidence had to

15 go to the issue of reasonableness.

16             MR. RUSSELL:  It may have been relevant to

17 reasonableness, but that's not why it was put in.

18 Before the trial began --

19             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Was he arguing that it was

20 necessary to follow this one downsizing practice?

21             MR. RUSSELL:  They certainly, I think --

22 they used that argument to show that they had a business

23 justification and to try to rebut our showing of

24 alternative, equally effective practices.  But it was

25 clear by the time of trial that -- you know, they had



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

53

1 proposed jury instructions that didn't ask for

2 reasonableness to be part of the case.  We proceeded

3 with the case on the assumption that we would be

4 entitled to prevail under these instructions so long

5 that we showed that the current practice, reasonable or

6 not, had a disparate impact and was subject to an

7 equally effective alternative.

8             JUSTICE STEVENS:  And just one other detail,

9 Did -- the district judge not instruct the jury on this

10 defense?

11             MR. RUSSELL:  It did not.

12             JUSTICE STEVENS:  It did not?

13             MR. RUSSELL:  The only instruction was that

14 we'd be entitled to prevail if we showed Wards Cove, and

15 its --

16             JUSTICE STEVENS:  You have an unusual case

17 where the decisive issue, at least when you get to this

18 Court, is something the jury never passed on.

19             MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think that's right.

20 And ordinarily I think you would say that the

21 defendants, by not raising the issue to the jury, if

22 it's an affirmative defense, have waived it.  They ask

23 for an excuse, given the change in law.  We don't think

24 that the change in law excuses their failure to waive

25 it.  The regulation that they point to they themselves

1 have argued here isn't entitled to much of any

2 deference.  And, in fact, at the same time they were

3 simultaneously arguing that there wasn't even any

4 disparate-impact liability in the first place under the

5 ADEA.  So I don't think they can actually claim that

6 they were relying on that.
