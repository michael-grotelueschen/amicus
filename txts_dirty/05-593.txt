 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Osborn v. Haley.

 Mr. Grant.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. GRANT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The court of appeals misinterpreted the 

Westfall Act in a way that unfairly deprives tort 

plaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections 

routinely afforded in both Federal and State courts. 

That misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the 

text and history of the statute, the nature and 

operation of official immunity or the jurisdictional 

limitations of article III. Accordingly, the judgment 

of the court of appeals should be reversed and this 

State law case should be remanded to the State courts 

where it rightfully belongs. In the alternative, the 

court of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of 

appellate jurisdiction.

 Prior to the Westfall Act, courts considered 

whether, assuming the alleged acts occurred, the Federal 

employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

In Westfall v. Erwin, this Court added the additional 

requirement that the acts be undertaken with a 

discretionary function, but invited Congress to address 

the issue. In responding with the Westfall Act, 

Congress did not change the basic rule that scope of 

employment sets the line for immunity. Indeed, Congress 

confirmed that rule. In particular, Congress gave no 

hint that it was radically rewriting the rules to direct 

Federal district courts to determine the merits of 

wholly State law claims in some sort of unprecedented 

summary proceeding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it a wholly State 

law claim if the principal matter is whether this 

Federal employee is immune from suit? That's the 

threshold question that has to be answered. It's 

determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get 

through that Federal law gateway before you can go any 

place else in the suit.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, that is true in 

perhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases 

like this and a significant and recurring subset of 

cases there is no Federal law question because scope of 

employment simply is not at issue. What the Government 

does in those subset of cases is merely to assert the 

defense of he didn't do it or it never happened.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- it's not it 

never happened as though the Federal employee was off in 

Hong Kong. He was there on the premises. He is 

claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of 

his authority. It seems like it's a question of 

phraseology that you're dealing with.

 MR. GRANT: With respect, Your Honor, that 

is not the case, certainly in this case and in others. 

The Government has conceded that if Respondent Barry 

Haley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting 

outside the course and scope of his Federal employment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think Justice 

Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that 

the Government is entitled to say that during the time 

the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and 

he refrained from committing any unlawful act.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, there may be cases 

where even if the acts occurred, they were within the 

course and scope of the Federal employment. But in the 

case like this, as in Wood versus United States, as in 

Melo v. Hafer in the Third Circuit, the Government 

concedes, because the law and the facts require the 

Government and the employee to concede, that if the 

alleged acts took place they were necessarily outside 

the scope of employment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the actual 

statutory language refers to acting within the scope of 

employment at the time of the incident, and so a 

certification based on the view that at the time of the 

alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his 

scope would seem to be within the language of the 

statute.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, on its face the 

certification in this case, as in others, tracks the 

statutory language. But when the Government's position 

was examined in the district court, it became apparent 

that the Government's essential defense, in fact 

supported by two declarations, including the declaration 

of Respondent Haley, was that he simply did not do the 

acts alleged.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the question is 

what the district court should examine, and the statute 

talks about the incident out of which the claim arose. 

So that necessarily requires the Government to look at 

the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim 

arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify 

it.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: "Out of which the claim 

arose" it seems to me is of some importance. But the

dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood, 

didn't think it was important. I'm not sure they were 

right about that.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, this Court has 

consistently made a distinction between immunity and the 

merits. Starting in cases like Mitchell versus Forsyth 

in 1985 and continuing through cases like Richardson 

versus McKnight in 1997, the Court has consistently 

recognized that immunity is different from a defense on 

the merits. It's different from a defense of he didn't 

do it or it never happened. And I would say that, 

although the time of the incident is important, that is 

only one of several factors certainly under Kentucky law 

in determining whether something happened within the 

course and scope of employment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well how is it -- I 

mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw. You assert 

he didn't do it versus something else. But it's easy, 

let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you 

hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an 

accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, 

wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort. Now, 

are they denying the incident in that case?

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, the Court in Wood v. 

United States took account of the possibilities of

artful pleading and would allow the Government to 

challenge the characterization of the incident.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not just a 

characterization. If it's something that has, for 

example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you 

did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can 

say, no, I didn't. Now, is that a characterization or 

is that a denial of the incident?

 MR. GRANT: I believe that's a 

characterization, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it the denial of 

an element of the claim? There's no recovery for 

assault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice 

just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an 

element of the claim how do you draw a distinction 

between that and the existence or nonexistence of any 

act at all.

 MR. GRANT: There are, Your Honor, certain 

cases in which --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not asking about 

certain cases. I just want to know analytically how you 

do it or how you think we're supposed to do it.

 MR. GRANT: There are cases in which the 

merits and the immunity defense overlap and in those 

cases the district courts are fully empowered to make

factual findings.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in this case the 

immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the 

Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in 

terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope 

of his employment. Secondarily, as you said, the 

Government in effect elaborated on that and said the 

reason he was not acting outside the scope of his 

employment is that these acts which would have been 

outside scope didn't happen. Why is that any 

different from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo 

that there was no intent to harm?

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, because a claim of, 

that the alleged act did not occur, that he didn't do 

it, is not a claim of immunity. Again, this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's a claim upon which the 

immunity depends. The immunity is claimed -- the 

immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he 

was not acting outside the scope of his employment. The 

reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he 

didn't do what they say he did.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, I'm sorry if I have 

the same answer to the question, but again, this Court's 

jurisprudence has consistently distinguished between 

defenses, so to speak, on the merits, a claim that the

alleged act did not occur, that one of the elements of 

the State law claim is not met.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In this case, if Mr. Haley 

had said, I had some conversations with the private 

employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during 

the conversations, but I never told them to discharge 

her, would this, would that be something -- would your 

argument apply there?

 MR. GRANT: It would apply, Your Honor, if, 

if that factual determination were relevant to scope of 

employment under the applicable law, namely the agency 

law of Kentucky.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is it? I mean, 

that's -- the problem that I have with your argument, 

Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it 

happened or it didn't happen. There is a middle 

ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at 

the relevant time or place and when I was there 

everything that I did was within the scope of my 

employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the 

scope of my employment.

 MR. GRANT: There are cases in which there 

is a middle ground, Your Honor. But this case is not 

one of them, and there is certainly a distinct and 

recurring subset of cases, like Wood and Melo and

Kimbro, where it is conceded on the facts and the law 

that if the actions occurred, they occurred outside the 

scope of employment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why 

anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to 

come out. Why would it make any sense to give a Federal 

employee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he 

committed the act, and then you debate about whether it 

was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive 

him of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies 

that he did anything at all? Why would you want one set 

of cases to remain in the State court and the other set 

of cases to go to Federal court?

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, it's Congress that 

set the line at scope of employment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's what 

we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as 

you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some 

ambiguity in it. There being ambiguity, why should we 

find a line that doesn't make any sense?

 MR. GRANT: Well, Your Honor, I believe that 

line does make sense because if the Government's view is 

adopted and the view of the majority of the court of 

appeals, the merits of the wholly State law claim will 

be resolved in Federal court and resolved in a

procedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the 

right to discovery, that denies the tort plaintiff a 

right to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion 

to dismiss or motion for summary judgment, and denies 

that tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that can happen when in 

fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out 

to be wrong and there isn't any immunity. Still, the 

whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, in that situation, 

the merits will at least be tried under the normal 

provisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions, 

even if it does ultimately proceed against the United 

States.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But Mr. Grant, I'm a 

little puzzled. Why is the discovery in the Federal 

system any less valuable in the State system?

 MR. GRANT: Because what the Government 

advocates here, as I think most starkly illustrated by 

the Third Circuit's decision in Melo v. Hafer is some 

sort of summary proceeding that takes place before the 

normal processes of Federal litigation. After all, it's 

the Government's position that this employee is immune.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't that only summary 

for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was

proper?

 MR. GRANT: It's for the purpose of deciding 

scope of employment, but the Government's interpretation 

of that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the 

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not for 

deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says 

that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive 

with respect to removal.

 MR. GRANT: It is conclusive, Your Honor, in 

those cases that truly do implicate scope of employment. 

In this case, by contrast, the certification was 

essentially to raise the he didn't do it or it never 

happened defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what does it 

mean to say that the certification is conclusive with 

respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal 

if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going 

to have judicial review that is going to address the 

question of removal as opposed to the validity of the 

certification on the merits?

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, it's conclusive 

where it satisfies the definition in the statute. What 

is conclusive in the final sentence of paragraph (d)(2) 

of section 2679 is this certification, and this

certification of course is the one referred to earlier 

in that paragraph.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying 

it's only conclusive if it's right?

 MR. GRANT: No, Your Honor. It's only, it 

can be conclusive right or wrong, but it's only 

conclusive if it satisfies the statutory definition, 

being about scope of employment, not about the merits. 

In this case, for example, there never will be, never 

could be a true scope of employment determination, the 

Government having conceded it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose, Mr. Grant, that 

the district court had said, I'm going to deny the 

substitution of the United States as the defendant, but 

I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not 

going to order a remand until the defendant and the United 

States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling 

that I deny the substitution of the United States. 

Suppose that it had happened that way? Would you have any 

right to get back in the State court? Wouldn't that 

properly go to a court of appeals?

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, that, that could 

certainly go to the court of appeals under the 

discretionary appeal procedure in section 1292(b), or 

perhaps by mandamus.

 MR. GRANT: That would -- that would on its 

merits restrict the district court from remanding, but 

of course in this case, the district court did enter an 

order of remand based on its interpretation of section 

2679.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But your position is that 

the Attorney General's certification is conclusive --

is not conclusive in those situations in which the 

Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between 

an event denying answer and an event characterizing 

answer? Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that 

very nuanced decision in some instances, then the 

Attorney General's certification is not conclusive?

 MR. GRANT: The short answer is yes, Your 

Honor. The Attorney General's certification is not 

conclusive where it does not satisfy the statutory 

definition, where it is not a certification that truly 

implicates scope of employment. We have tried to draw 

the distinction between an unauthorized or improper 

certification, one that doesn't meet the statutory 

definition, and a certification as, as the Court in 

Aliota versus Graham said was wrong or erroneous on its

merits, so to speak, on the facts, on the law, of State 

agency law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Grant, these items 

we've been discussing are perhaps the more important 

features of the case. But your argument in your brief 

didn't begin with those. It began with the assertion 

that there is no jurisdiction to review the district 

court's remand order at all. I take it you're not 

abandoning that, are you?

 MR. GRANT: Absolutely not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then why was it first in 

your brief and not first in your argument?

 MR. GRANT: It was first in my brief because 

this Court ordered me to brief and address it, and I was 

happy to do so. The court of appeals in fact did lack 

jurisdiction in this case. This Court has made clear as 

recently as the Kircher opinion last term that section 

1447(d) means what it says. And in this case, the 

district court entered an order remanding the case to 

the State court from which it was removed, and 1447(d), 

of course, bars review of that order by appeal or 

otherwise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is at least 

considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 

2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for

purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification 

is conclusive. And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it 

suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal 

court rather than be immediately remanded without the 

availability of review.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, on the merits of the 

interpretation of 2679(d)(2), we tried to explain why 

conclusive does not operate in a case like this, but I 

think the important point for jurisdiction is that this 

Court has consistently said that even if a district 

court misinterprets a jurisdictional statute, that 

review is nonetheless barred by section 1447(d).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a different 

type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern 

on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for 

the adjudication of whether something is within the 

scope of a Federal employee's duty. It's not 

inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to 

specifically provide for review of that determination 

but then have that review take place in State court 

rather than Federal court.

 MR. GRANT: Well, Your Honor, Congress 

obviously knows how to make exceptions to section 

1447(d). I believe it was footnote eight of this 

Court's opinion in Kircher that cited a number of

examples. The Government in its brief relied on 12 

U.S.C. section 1441(a), and that statute which involved 

the Resolution Trust Corporation specifically refers to 

appeal and remand. And so what this Court has said is, 

the bar of section 1447(d), which has been around for 

more than a century, is not to be ignored unless there 

is a clear statutory command that makes an exception.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But here not only, not only 

does it say that the Attorney General's certification is 

conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no 

mention about remand in relation to a case that is 

removed after the Attorney General's certification. 

Whereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't 

certify and the case is removed, the statute does 

address the issue of remand. So if you put those two 

things together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress 

did not want these cases that are removed on the 

Attorney General's certification to be remanded?

 MR. GRANT: No, Your Honor. The authority 

to remand in this case proceeds from subsection C of 

section 1447. As this Court has said in various cases, 

including the International Primate Protection League 

case in 1991, when a Federal district court lacks 

subject matter jurisdiction because a case, a party 

attempting to remove has done so without authority to do

so, section 1447(c) obliges a remand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought your 

answer would have been even if, even if the remand was 

improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, 

(d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal 

court. Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it 

is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of 

review. I mean, we said in other cases that even when 

the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.

 MR. GRANT: That is my answer, Your Honor. 

Section (d)(2) goes, gives direction to district courts, 

but section 1447(d) gives direction to appellate courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's your answer, can 

I go back to the other main issue for a second? I would 

have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my 

mind, is the classic case where there should be 

jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I 

don't think anything happened, okay? So he was doing 

his job all day. But if something did happen, I'll tell 

you what, it was within the scope of his employment. 

And apparently, that's just what they did say here. And 

then it got mixed up in the courts below. In other 

words, if he made some phone calls and even if he 

mentioned the employee, even if he said something 

improper, it was within the scope of his employment,

which is just what they said. So because of that, it 

seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of 

nothing. Now you explain what your answer is.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, with respect, I 

believe the Attorney General said just the opposite, 

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: In the district court he 

didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the 

scope of his employment? I thought he had. Maybe he 

hadn't. I thought he had, but I'll ask him that.

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: In the district court I 

thought he said that.

 MR. GRANT: The Attorney General's 

submission, the Government's submission in the district 

court was that nothing happened.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it was there first, 

but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think 

nothing happened. But if the plaintiff can convince a 

jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince 

him of is within the scope of his employment. Now did 

that happen in the district court, that they said 

something like that or not?

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, the Government did 

make what it called an alternative argument.

that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if 

anybody, you know, thinks that's valid? But the --

what's the problem then? Because I would have thought 

that the reason this case appears difficult is because 

yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in 

and remove it.

 MR. GRANT: The district court, the very 

same district court that the Government so, so 

desperately wants to review the facts of this case, said 

that given Mr. Haley's declaration under penalty of 

perjury, it would not accept that alternative.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's wrong in that, 

isn't it?

 MR. GRANT: Well, the Government did not 

appeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the Wood issue was 

the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's 

outside the scope. It's like one employee shoots 

another, you know. There is nothing to do with scope of 

employment there, it's plainly outside. And of course, 

this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an 

act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing. 

But if it's arguable at least that something happened, 

if it happened at all it was within the scope of

 MR. GRANT: Your Honor, the Government --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the problem with --

there should be a problem with what I say from your 

point of view, so --

MR. GRANT: I think the problem is in the 

record, Your Honor, and the Government's brief at the, 

at the petition stage on page 14 in note five quotes its 

own appellate brief in the court of appeals, and that 

brief says the memorandum of understanding between the 

Forest Service and the private respondent showed that if 

Haley did cause the contractor to fire Osborn, he acted 

outside the scope of his employment. And the court of 

appeals quite logically took that --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying they have 

abandoned the argument?

 MR. GRANT: They have Your Honor and the 

court of appeals recognized that on page 3a of the 

petition appendix. If the Court has no further 

questions I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

and may it please the Court:

 In the Westfall Act Congress provided an 

absolute immunity for Federal employees for acts 

taken within the scope of their employment and it 

went further and provided that when the Attorney 

General certifies that the employee was acting 

within the scope of his employment at the time of 

the incident out of which the claim arose, that that 

issue of Federal immunity is to be decided by the 

Federal court. It is the Attorney General's assertion 

of this Federal defense of immunity that satisfies 

article III just as the employee's own assertion of 

immunity satisfies article III under the Federal Officer 

Removal statute and just as a, in other circumstances a 

plaintiff's assertion of a claim under Federal law 

satisfies article III.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if the 

Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a 

criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute? 

What happens then?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that 

the, the -- that would probably be a defect in removal 

procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even 

if it is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, on the

procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's 

just wrong. It's a criminal case. The statute says he 

can do it in a civil case. On the other hand the statute 

also says that his certification is conclusive.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor 

even if that is a case that would be removed without 

jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this 

case because this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, this one is a 

civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just 

trying to understand how broad your argument that this 

is not subject to further review goes.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the issue 

that is not subject to further review for purposes of 

jurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification 

that the employee was acting within scope. The 

statute doesn't provide that the Attorney General's 

certification that it is a civil action is conclusive 

but only the Attorney General's certification that the 

employee was acting within scope is conclusive for 

purposes of removal. That's the essential element of 

the Federal defense and that's what satisfies article 

III jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court in the 

Willingham case recognized that an employee could assert 

a claim of Federal immunity even though he was also at

the same time denying that he caused any harm to the 

plaintiff.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I thought your 

analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back 

and read the statute. Willingham is a very different 

statutory predicate. It's acting under color of law. 

This is much more specific. At the time of the 

incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not 

sure the analogy holds up.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well if anything 

the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as 

Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall 

act provides that the Attorney General is to certify 

that at the time of the incident out of which the claim 

arose the employee was acting within the scope. So 

arguably the necessary question is what was the employee 

doing at the time. The Federal Officer Removal statute 

is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim 

arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But yet that would 

be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney 

General can certify that the employee did not do 

anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's 

phrased in the affirmative. He has to certify that he 

was acting within the scope of his employment.

that's what the Attorney General did here, certified 

that Mr. Haley was acting within the scope of his 

employment at the time of the incident out of which the 

claim arose. And as several --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the issue then. 

And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's 

imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too 

complicated and probably is one that the Government 

should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault 

like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no 

doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of 

employment, everybody concedes it but Government. And 

the Government's position is, nothing happened. All 

right? Nothing happened. You say Government, would you 

like to argue that if something happened, and they may 

be able to prove something, something like a movement? 

No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree 

nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend 

on any scope of employment ground. All we are arguing 

is that ordinary work went on and that was within the 

scope of employment. Now, does this act cover it or 

not? Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought 

it was a close question but you read what I thought the 

other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close

question. So what is your basic response to that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: You are correct 

that our view is that yes, the Attorney General can 

certify in that case. The issue is really one along a 

continuum as I think Your Honor has recognized. Of on, 

on the one extreme, one might say that the Attorney 

General must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations 

as true. And, and I don't think that anybody here is 

arguing that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the position of 

the district court, though, wasn't it?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That was the 

position of the district court, although I don't think 

the Petitioner is now advocating that view. And that 

view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create 

the anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to 

certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of 

the employee would be narrower than the employee's own 

authority to assert the immunity, because again going back 

to the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it 

would be within the scope of employment for the prison 

officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner; 

rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but 

anything that happened between us and the prisoner 

happened within the scope of our employment. And so the

Attorney General's authority to certify has to be at 

least as broad as that in our view.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The basic point I think in 

Wood is this. I'm the district judge. And the 

Government, you come in and argue in the alternative. 

Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the 

scope of employment and they say there is no 

possibility. You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here 

if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that 

a jury could find that something went on here that was 

within the scope of employment that shouldn't have. And 

if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins 

either because of summary judgment or because -- no, 

sorry. I've gotten lost in what I said. Do you follow 

it?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- I think I do. 

In our view --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Good, I'm glad 

that someone did.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In our view, it 

would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent 

employee would be deprived of the benefits of the 

Westfall Act, and if I could use a more simple --

practicality of it. I don't think you can give me a 

case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge 

to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government, 

to tell me if anything went on here that might have been 

within the scope of employment. And I look at what 

you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't 

defend it. If you say yes, you can defend it and that's 

going to be the end of it as long as your view is based 

on a reasonable reading of the record.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I don't think 

that that could be the end of it. As Justice Ginsburg 

pointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or 

white and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor 

poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses, 

the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence 

that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee 

was acting within the scope or not.

 If I could use a simple example of assault. 

If the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee 

for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the 

supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her 

fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her. 

Even if that would be outside the scope of employment, 

the employee might say -- the supervisor rather might 

say, I never raised my hand at all. I raised my voice

certainly but I never raised my hand. A third party 

witness may say well I saw the supervisor wag her finger 

at the employee but not in a threatening fashion. Now --

JUSTICE BREYER: And as long as a jury could 

find that there is a view of the record such that the 

plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within 

the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that 

hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it. 

What's the problem?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, if the 

employee --

JUSTICE BREYER: The only problem is if you 

admit that you can't prove anything like that.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If the employee was 

acting within the scope of the employment when she 

wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within 

the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her 

hand at all.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, not a fortiori, for the 

reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the 

defendant the right to call in the Government to defend 

him no matter what he did. The reason that Congress 

wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which 

was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the 

question of the scope of Government responsibility to

take away that limited determination in Westfall. That 

was the only point. Congress could have written a 

statute the way. What's your response to that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But Congress made, 

established an absolute immunity where the employee was 

acting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner 

agrees that scope of employment is the essential 

question for immunity. So if in my hypothetical the 

supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment 

when she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising 

her fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by 

the Westfall Act from a claim arising out of the context 

of that employment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens in a 

case where the certification is clearly wrong? I mean, 

you get into a fight with your neighbor. It's got 

nothing to do with your employment at all but the 

Attorney General certifies that it does. You know: 

"They are always thinking about your cases. You must 

have been thinking about it at the time." That 

certification goes into the district court. The 

district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous, 

throws it out, then that State law assault case proceeds 

in Federal court?

Congress enacted the Westfall Act against the 

presumption of regularity of Federal officials and that 

is of course what this Court has often said as well, and 

so I don't think we should construe the statute on the 

presumption that the Attorney General would, would 

certify ridiculous cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well what about the, 

Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee 

working within the scope of his employment or was he off 

on a frolic of his own? I think that's the kind of 

question that the Chief Justice put to you. The 

certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General 

said what he was doing was within the scope of 

employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with 

his friends and they got in his car and killed someone. 

If that certification within the scope was wrong and 

instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United 

States isn't substituted.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. That 

would mean that the district court did not on the merits 

ultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the 

Court said in Mesa, the merits of the immunity defense 

have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of 

jurisdiction.

was about, was the certification reviewable?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. 

Lamagno was about whether the certification was 

reviewable. Your Honor is also correct about the facts 

of that case. One of the points of dispute between the 

Government and the plaintiffs there was whether 

Mr. Lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident, and, 

and the Attorney General certified on his understanding 

that Mr. Lamagno was not drunk. And that was upheld by 

the district court on remand after some discovery and 

summary judgment type litigation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court said that 

that could be reviewed.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. It 

can be reviewed and the Attorney General's certification 

is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is conclusive 

for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean? Does 

that mean that if the district court finds that in fact 

the defendant was not acting within the scope of his 

employment, the United States is eliminated as the 

defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where, where does that come

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the procedure 

for what happens upon the district court's review is not 

spelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review 

itself in particular. But the, the employee --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the United States 

should remain the party defendant and the United States 

should pay which would be the, you know, the price of 

the Attorney General's certification. He should be 

careful what he certifies.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the uniform 

view of the lower courts is that when the certification is 

overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee 

as the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a 

pendent claim. The Attorney General's assertion of the 

defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable 

because we presume regularity by the Attorney General, 

confers article III jurisdiction on the courts, even 

though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected. 

This Court held in the Carnegie-Mellon case that the 

district courts have discretion whether to exercise 

jurisdiction over pendent claims once the Federal 

question has been resolved. If the courts have

discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then 

certainly Congress can instruct them to exercise that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they wouldn't 

have discretion in that case, though, because the 

statute says the Attorney General's certification is 

conclusive for purposes of removal.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. 

Congress has removed the discretion in this class of 

cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought maybe your 

answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you 

can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the, perhaps, 

perhaps that's so. Certainly Carnegie-Mellon --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would still be 

conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean 

it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter 

jurisdiction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: By its text, the 

statute speaks to removal and that the Attorney 

General's certification is conclusive for purposes of 

removal. But I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Couldn't it be conclusive 

for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave 

the district court with discretion to remand on the

grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in 

fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong, 

and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the 

only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a 

pendent claim.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But the -- as the 

Court held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims 

after the Federal issue has been resolved is not a 

remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within 

the meaning of 1447(c). Rather, it is a discretionary 

remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and 

so --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In that case it would be 

reviewable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And it would be 

reviewable. That's why -- that's one of the reasons why 

the district court's order here is reviewable, because 

it is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c) 

because, first of all, Congress has instructed the 

courts that they are not to remand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's, that's what the 

district court said it was, though, isn't it? Didn't it 

-- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of 

jurisdiction?

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want us to review 

the, the assertion of the district court that it was 

remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would, 

would be reviewable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor, 

because here the Court need not go beyond the face of 

the district court's order to understand what it was 

doing. The court exercised jurisdiction over the 

Federal question that was properly brought before it by 

the Attorney General's certification and this Court's 

decision in Lamagno. After resolving that, the district 

court said, having concluded that the United States is 

not a proper party to this case, the court must now 

determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it 

also said that the absence of the U.S. as a party to the 

case destroys the court's jurisdiction. So it's evident 

that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and 

that it was a subsequent event that deprived it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me go back to the 

Chief Justice's hypo a little earlier. Could the 

district judge at that point dismiss the case without 

prejudice to refiling in the State court?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I don't think that 

that would be consistent with Congress's intent. The --

in all of the Government --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be consistent 

with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the 

case.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is true. But 

I think that the intent of Congress was the same as this 

Court, all the members of this Court, recognized in 

Lamagno. In Lamagno, even the dissenters, the 

plurality, all acknowledged what Congress intended by 

the "conclusive for purposes of removal" language was to 

prevent the shuttling back and forth of the case. Once 

it was removed, it was to stay in Federal court. That 

was what Congress intended. And one reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it's more than 

pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction 

leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the 

State claim or send it back. So this is -- what you're 

suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. By 

pendent jurisdiction what, what I meant to convey was 

that it is within the Court's article III jurisdiction 

to exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims that 

were pendent to a Federal claim. Under this Court's 

judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, 

that is discretionary with the court. But if it is

discretionary with the court, then certainly Congress 

can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction 

and that it would be consistent with article III.

 But another reason why Congress would have 

wanted the case to remain in Federal court even if the 

certification is overturned is, as we've alluded to 

before, the development of the case subsequent to the 

certification substitution decision may, may illustrate 

that the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that 

were within the scope of employment. The court would at 

the very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 

jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that. Justice Ginsburg's 

point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I 

take it is because these are not separate State claims 

appended to what you thought was a Federal claim. This 

is the same claim that you initially thought was a 

Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law 

claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for 

purposes of jurisdiction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The case is I 

think not distinguishable from removals under the 

Federal Officer Removal statute, where Congress has 

indicated that it is the Federal defense that confers 

jurisdiction rather than the Federal claim. Then, the

ultimate merits of the Federal defense are irrelevant to 

the jurisdictional issue. And the Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying there are 

two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if 

you look at that claim which is by definition Federal, 

then it's fair to look at the original State claim by 

analogy as a pendent claim?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that fair?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if the 

Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State 

court? I take it one of the concerns we have here is 

that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the 

certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court. 

Suppose that there is a denial of certification. Then 

under (d)(3) --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: (D)(3).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the employee can ask 

for a certification decision. I take it that's a 

Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law 

point, that the State court must hear and so now we're 

back in State court?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.

jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps 

you or helps the Petitioner.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that 

Your Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal 

law is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the 

outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for 

certification over the Attorney General's objection the 

statute allows the Attorney General to remove the 

petition to Federal court and the statute states that 

the district court shall find and certify whether the 

employee was acting within the scope.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in my case I guess I 

don't think it ever gets to district court because 

there's no certification, but then the employee can ask 

the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of 

employment. Am I right about that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: He can, you are 

correct. It is at the option of the Attorney General 

under (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that 

the review of his noncertification happens in Federal 

court. (D)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides 

that if the district court holds that the Attorney 

General was correct that the employee was not acting 

within the scope the case is to be remanded to State 

court. So the presence of the remand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But my point is I suppose 

the Government can just say, we're not going to make the 

certification and we're not going to remove.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then the State court 

still has to have the bench trial on the scope of 

employment.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure if that helps. 

It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting 

the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench 

trials in almost every case.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- I think what 

that illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of 

immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the 

court. And one reason that that is so essential under 

the Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity --

if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of 

the employee, that has many, many consequences, 

including that the United States is the proper 

defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal 

court, the case must be dismissed until an 

administrative claim is filed and that avenue is 

exhausted.

defenses come into play depending on how the scope of 

employment issue is resolved.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right, but that's the 

strongest argument I thought the other way initially, 

that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of 

his own. That you resolve in a bench trial. If the 

answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court 

anyway. I understand that.

 But if you're going to take your position 

whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood 

and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or 

not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope 

of employment, well, then you're going to have all these 

things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's 

supposed to normally be before a jury, for example.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so? If the 

employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United 

States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but 

it's staying in Federal court under this pendent 

jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be 

entitled to a jury trial?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. Yes, Your 

Honor. I think Justice Breyer's question, though, had 

to do with the procedure at the certification review 

stage. That is to be done by the district court sitting

without jury and that's because under the statute the 

Attorney General's certification has the legal effect of 

making the United States the defendant. The United 

States -- the action shall be deemed an action against 

the United States and the United States shall be 

substituted, and that is true unless and until the 

certification is overturned. And there is of course no 

Seventh Amendment right to jury trial against the United 

States.

the application of 1447(d)? You say that it does not 

apply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is 

improper?

not one of the remands authorized by 1447(c) --

was erroneous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And wouldn't that destroy 

the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this 

ping-pong?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor, I 

think not. And we have two arguments that both the 

issues, substitution and remand, are appealable. One is 

a very specific one and that is that Congress has 

categorically taken this kind of remand outside the 

court's authority under 1447(c) by specifically 

prohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that 

argument of course would not have relevance, I don't 

think, much beyond this case. And this Court has 

recognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of 

orders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without 

cross-referencing those provisions. In the Rice case, 

the Court said that that specific removal provision did 

not purport to impair or restrict the application of the 

then equivalents of 747(c) and (d). But clearly 

2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to 

remand by making the certification conclusive for 

purposes of removal. So with that as our narrowest 

argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the response to that is 

that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is

nonetheless governed by 1447(d). There are a lot of 

erroneous remands and this would just be, just be 

another one.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But when Congress 

specifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case 

under 2679(d)(2) it certainly did not mean to protect a 

court that ignored that mandate from review.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem, and 

maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here, 

but isn't the problem with your argument is that the 

statute didn't come out and say you can't remand. The 

statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification 

is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy 

that you and I were talking with before. A court can 

say look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction 

here, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because 

what you and I are calling here the pendent claim does 

not support any of the Government's theory. If that's 

the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of 

it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling. But if 

on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge 

said here, I am remanding because based on this 

analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge 

went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is 

conclusive. That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling,

and as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over 

again, however erroneous it may be, it is not 

reviewable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If I may, Your 

Honor? I think, two things: One, that there is a 

difference between Congress categorically prohibiting a 

certain kind of remand, and saying that a remand was 

simply erroneous. And secondly, that that argument 

would not go to our argument that under Waco, at the 

very least, the order on substitution is appealable, 

because it is separate and independent from remand.

Congress knows how to make an exception to section

Kircher, and by the Government in its brief, 

specifically referred, used the terms appeal and remand.

where the district court did not even purport to be 

relying on one of the grounds enumerated in section 

1447(c), namely lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In 

this case, of course, the district court explicitly 

cited both that statute and used the term subject matter 

jurisdiction, and the Government itself is, is not 

willing to go behind that. On the merits, the 

Government has argued this morning that the Westfall Act 

provides a Federal forum to assert a Federal defense of 

immunity. The Government has analogized this statute 

to section 1442(a), which allows the assertion of a 

colorable Federal defense, but the defense of, he didn't 

do it, it never happened, is not a Federal defense. It 

is not a defense of immunity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the defense of, 

I was on the job and everything I did on the job was 

within the scope of my employment?

 MR. GRANT: In certain cases, Your Honor, 

that could be a defense of immunity, but in a class of 

cases identified by Justice Breyer, there will be an 

admission. There has to be an admission under the facts 

and the law, that even if the alleged acts occurred, it 

was outside the scope of employment. In that case, the 

defense is purely a merits defense. And I think for 

this Court to say otherwise in this case would require

overruling, or being contradictory to over 20 years of 

official immunity jurisprudence, where the Court has 

consistently distinguished between immunity defenses and 

defenses on the merits, where certainly the lower courts 

have taken that conceptual distinction and said a 

defense that the alleged acts did not occur do not raise 

an immunity defense. And so, the assertion of a defense 

in that case on the merits is not the assertion of a 

Federal defense. It is not sufficient to confer Federal 

jurisdiction under article III. It does not meet the 

definition of a statute, of the statute, which uses the 

phrase "scope of employment" no fewer than seven times. 

There is no indication that Congress in the Westfall Act 

intended to change the normal rules that purely State 

law defenses such as he didn't do it were to be decided 

in a Federal forum.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're left with 

this question Justice Scalia raised. If it's ambiguous, 

an employee says I did everything within the scope of my 

employment, I did nothing improper. They allege I did 

something improper. I didn't. I was a faithful 

servant. The negligent employee will be allowed the 

Federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful 

employee has to be in the State court. Does that make 

any sense?

The employee who acts within the scope of his 

employment, whether or not he did the acts alleged, gets 

immunity. The employee who acts outside of the scope of 

employment --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is an employee who 

said I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my 

Federal employment.

 MR. GRANT: That's an employee who should 

win on the merits and will win on the merits. As 

Justice Kennedy recognized, there are certain 

applications that allow the State court to resolve even 

a Federal defense. We should trust that State courts 

will resolve State law defenses in a manner fair to
