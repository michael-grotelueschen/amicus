(10:04 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first in Will v. Hallock. 

Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

In enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act, 

Congress recognized that suits against Federal 

employees, based upon their official conduct, 

constituted a very real attack upon the morale of the 

Civil Service. Congress addressed that concern in two 

ways. First, it allowed plaintiffs to sue the United 

States directly, but secondly and importantly, it 

provided that a plaintiff who took up that opportunity, 

the judgment in the suit against the United States 

would constitute a complete bar to any action against 

the employee. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in enacting 

section 1291, Congress specified that only final 

decisions would be appealable. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, Your 

Honor, and this Court has adopted a practical rather

than technical construction of that statute. And the 

Court has recognized in -- in numerous cases that 

claims of official immunity are -- warrant immediate 

appellate review because they can only be effectively 

vindicated by review at the motion to dismiss stage. 

And -- and that is the kind of protection 

that section 2676 provides. It establishes that the 

judgment in the suit against the United States shall be 

a complete bar against any action against the employee. 

So it's the action itself that is precluded, and it is 

precluded completely. And that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can -- you can say 

the same thing of -- of res judicata, that there is a 

complete bar. I guess my concern here is that this 

seems to be, with respect to the employee, something 

much closer to a res judicata case than to an immunity 

per se case. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, 

the -- the Court recognized in the Digital Equipment 

case that even a claim of res judicata could correctly 

be characterized as a right to be free from suit, but 

it said that that wasn't enough. One had to look at 

the importance of the -- of the value protected, and 

the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Digital I remember.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And -- and the Court 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So do I. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I'm sure you do. 

And the Court has recognized in any number of 

cases that claims of official immunity are the kind 

that present sufficiently important public interests to 

warrant an exception to the -- the otherwise rule that 

appeals can only be had at the final judgment. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But in Digital Equipment, 

I think that we said that the collateral order doctrine 

is narrow, it should stay that way, and that we should 

give it -- we should be very reluctant to expand the 

practical construction of section 1291. And this 

certainly would be an expansion, would it not? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I don't think 

so, Your Honor, because this is like the other claims 

of immunity that the Court has recognized warrant 

collateral appeal in Mitchell v. Forsyth or Nixon v. 

Fitzgerald. It's a kind of official --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's certainly broader --

it's certainly broader than res judicata anyway, isn't 

it? Because if the Government -- suit against the 

Government is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, what

would be res judicata is only the jurisdictional 

question, and -- and this doesn't -- this goes beyond 

that, doesn't it? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, Your 

Honor. We point out any number of ways in which 

section 2676 confers an immunity on employees that is 

broader than the traditional common law rule of res 

judicata. For example, res judicata would not bar a 

suit against another party that could not have been 

joined in the first suit, but by its plain terms, 

section 2676 would bar such a claim. 

Likewise, common law res judicata would not 

bar a second suit to -- to recover a kind of damages 

that were unavailable in the first, but whereas 

punitive damages are unavailable in a suit against the 

United States, section 2676 would plainly bar a second 

suit against the employee to cover punitive damages. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm -- I'm assuming 

that it's not res judicata in -- in the narrow sense of 

the doctrine, but it's -- it's still a bar that depends 

upon a -- a prior judgment. And in that respect, it's 

sort of res judicata-like. Conversely, there is --

there is no immunity in the first instance conferred 

directly on the employee as such. And so that's --

that's why I -- it seems to me that there's an argument

that this is a lot closer to res judicata than it is to 

classic immunity. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, certainly 

there is no categorical rule that claims in the nature 

of claim preclusion are not eligible for immediate 

appeal under collateral order. In Abney v. United 

States, for example, the Court upheld immediate appeal 

of the denial of a -- of a double jeopardy claim, which 

likewise depends upon the existence of a prior action. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But a double jeopardy claim 

is -- is a claim in which there is an -- a -- an 

immunity textually conferred by the -- the 

Constitution, or at least, we -- we have thought it --

the guarantee does not make an awful lot of practical 

sense, unless you read it that way. You don't have 

that -- that situation here. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the 

Constitution does not use the word immunity, nor does 

the Westfall Act use the word immunity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is -- in fact, 

there's no immunity. That's what makes this different. 

Suppose the Bivens action had been brought 

first. The officers would not have been immune from 

suit. It's not like an officer who has qualified 

immunity and doesn't depend upon the suit order. Here,

there would have been no immunity at all if you'd sued 

the officers directly and not brought that Federal Tort 

Claims Act suit first. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. Like 

the claim of double jeopardy in Abney, the claim of 

immunity here depends upon the existence of a prior 

litigation, but as in Abney, the -- the interests that 

it protects are the interests to be free from the --

the cost burdens distraction of litigation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it 

Justice Ginsburg's point -- and it's my concern as well 

-- is that if the Bivens action is brought first, 

there's no protection of the Government against 

multiple actions. So -- so the policy that you're 

arguing for just is dependent on which suit happens to 

be brought first. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I'm not sure 

that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's not -- that's 

not a very strong policy interest to vindicate by 

expanding the collateral order doctrine. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, it -- it's --

it's not entirely clear that the United States would be 

subject to a second suit. It -- the -- the 

susceptibility of the United States to a further suit

would be governed by collateral --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it depends on -- it 

depends on -- on how the case was resolved. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's 

right. 

But -- but what's important here is that the 

interest protected is the interest of the employee 

against the -- the distraction -- against the attack on 

morale. That was the language that the Assistant 

Attorney General used. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's hard to accept that 

argument given that if the lawyer had sued in the 

reverse order, there would be the same morale. All the 

rest would follow. 

So here it's -- it's a question of the lawyer 

brought the wrong lawsuit first, and the attack on the 

morale -- there's no difference if a Bivens action had 

been brought and no other action. Is there any -- why 

is this morale changed by the Government having gotten 

the first case dismissed for lack of subject matter 

jurisdiction with no consideration of the merits at 

all? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, 

the -- the statute protects against the -- the cost of 

repetitive litigation, the harassment of the employee

of multiple suits. These are the exact same types of 

interest that the Court has recognized --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the harassment 

that this employee experienced in the -- in the FTCA 

claim that was dismissed? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- well, in this 

particular FTCA claim, there -- there was no discovery. 

But as we point out in -- in our brief, FTCA cases, 

even those dismissed on the basis of the 2680 

exceptions, are often resolved only after years of 

litigation, including often trial. So -- so the 

harassment is -- is the same. 

On -- on respondents' view, the judgment bar 

would not kick in. For example, in a case like Varig 

Airlines, where this Court upheld the Government's 

assertion of the -- the discretionary function 

exception only after 8 years of litigation when the 

case had been -- gone to the Ninth Circuit two times 

where there had been a trial and final judgment and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that -- did that 

involve the employee or it was just legal argument 

involving lawyers representing the United States? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It would certainly 

involve the employee. Any trial would -- would 

inevitably involve the employee in discovery, in -- in

appearing at trial as a witness. 

The -- the Government also is protected by 

section 2676, as the Assistant Attorney General said. 

The -- the burden on the Government, because the 

Government is often called upon to defend employees 

against suit -- and -- and the Government, having 

litigated once and obtained a judgment in the first 

FTCA suit, should not be forced to expend all those 

resources again in a second suit, this time styled as 

one against the employee. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, can I ask you sort 

of a basic question that I don't really think is 

adequately addressed in the briefs? You contend, as I 

understand it, that the exception in 2680(c) covers 

this case. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And 2680 -- the 

introductory language of 2680 is the provisions of this 

chapter shall not apply to such cases. And is it not 

true that 2676 is in this chapter, and does it not, 

therefore, follow that 2676 does not apply to this 

case? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: 2676 makes the --

the scope of its application turn on whether there has 

been a judgment and an action under section 1346(b).

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But my first question is 

how does 2676 apply if it's in the chapter that 2680 

says shall not apply to -- to things in the exception? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, 

the -- that view of the language, shall not apply, 

would be inconsistent with this Court's decisions both 

in United States v. Smith and in FDIC v. Meyer. 

In United States v. Smith, for example, the 

plaintiffs had made exactly that argument with respect 

to shall not apply. They said that -- that 1346 shall 

not apply to an action that arises in a foreign 

country. Therefore, section 1346 cannot provide the 

remedy to which we are supposed to be limited. And the 

Court rejected precisely that argument. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they held that the --

the action simply didn't apply in -- in that case. 

There was no -- there was no recovery under the --

basically it held the foreign -- foreign country 

exception precluded the statute from applying --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, what they --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- which is what also 

happens here. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, take another 

example why -- why you couldn't read the -- the shall 

not apply language in that way. The first exclusivity

provision of section 2679(a) with respect to sue and 

be sued agencies -- if you said that 1346(b) shall not 

apply to a suit against the Postal Service because the 

suits against the Postal Service regarding miscarriage 

of letters is excluded from 1346(b) by that same 

language, shall not apply, well, that would render the 

Postal Service exception meaningless and you would sue 

the -- the Postal Service pursuant to its sue and be 

sued authority instead of suing the United States under 

1346(b). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Go -- go through that again, 

would you? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- the --

2679(a) says that the authority of an agency to sue and 

be sued in its own name shall not extend to claims 

cognizable under section 1346(b). The argument might 

be made, with respect to a suit against the Postal 

Service for miscarriage of the mail, that -- that claim 

is not cognizable under section 1346(b) because section 

2680(b) says that 1346(b) shall not apply to claims 

relating to the miscarriage of mail. So by the same 

reading of shall not apply, one would come to the 

conclusion that -- that the claim relating to the 

miscarriage of mail is not cognizable under 1346(b), 

and therefore you sue the -- the Postal Service.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. It only says it shall 

not apply if it comes within the exception. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And -- and a -- a 

claim with respect to the miscarriage of mail is one 

that comes within the exception. And so that reading 

of shall not apply has been rejected by the Court in 

Smith v. United States, likewise is inconsistent with 

the Court's decision, FDIC v. Meyer, and would render 

it simply ridiculous with respect to claims against the 

Postal Service. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess it's true, is it --

I'm testing my own understanding of this -- that if, in 

fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter, 

if you had a State and that State gave a State law 

remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail 

or something, then that State law remedy would continue 

in existence because the thing in the law that sets 

aside that State court remedy is a different part of 

the same chapter --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- in 2679(b)? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Right. And -- and 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the whole point of the 

Westfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of

action. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Exactly, and in that 

sense, that reading of shall not apply is simply 

inconsistent with the Court's holding in United States 

v. Smith. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the language does seem 

to say it. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think what 

it -- what it means is that -- what it -- what it has 

been understood to mean is that the United States' 

waiver of sovereign immunity. It -- the United States 

has not subjected itself to liability on claims of the 

nature of those exceptions. And that's how the Court 

has described it in any number of cases, that the 

exceptions in 2680 mark the limits of the extent to 

which the United States --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then --

then to get to the main point here, if we are going to 

get to that, the question that I would have for you is 

-- is the following. If we accept your interpretation, 

it's pretty anomalous. I mean, someone who brings his 

Bivens action first, of course, can sue the individual 

employee, and you agree to that. But if he brings his 

Bivens action second, because he made a mistake and 

went into the wrong court or he brought the wrong

action or it was a borderline case, frankly, and he 

didn't know how it would end up, that person is out of 

luck. 

Now, there's nothing in this statute that 

says that the Government -- that the Congress wanted to 

achieve that result. What order you bring the suit in 

shouldn't really make any difference here. The Bivens 

action is totally different from all the other tort 

actions in that respect, and it's listed separately in 

2679 to make clear that it isn't -- it is different. 

So why? I mean, why read it your way? The 

burden that reading it their way would impose on the 

Government is minuscule. The number of such suits is 

tiny, I would imagine. 

All right. Now, what is wrong with my 

question? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, there --

JUSTICE BREYER: A lot of things. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- there are any 

number of things wrong in our view. 

First, Congress has, as Your Honor 

recognized, created an express exception for Bivens 

claims in 2679(b), but it has created no similar 

exception to -- to 2676 even though prior to passage of 

the Westfall Act, any number of courts of appeals had

construed 2676 to apply to Bivens claims. 

Further, as respondents recognize, 2676's 

application at this point is virtually limited because 

of the Westfall Act to a second case that raises a 

Bivens claim. So their --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the two claims have 

been brought together? This is -- if an employee is in 

an uncertain situation, doesn't know if the FTCA act 

applies, it certainly doesn't want to be without any 

defendant for conduct of the kind that -- that this 

complaint charges. Could such an employee say I want 

to bring my Tort Claims Act against the United States, 

but I'd like to have in that same lawsuit, in case the 

court says it comes under an exception, my Bivens 

claim? Would it be possible to bring those suits 

together? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, 

obviously that -- that issue is not presented here 

because here we have two separate litigation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm asking --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- does the Government 

have a position on that, whether you can combine a suit 

against the United States under the Tort Claims Act 

with a suit against the individual officers under

Bivens. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the -- the 

consistent view of the courts of appeals and district 

courts over 50 years has been that the judgment bar 

does have some application even when the claims are 

litigated simultaneously. For example, it's the 

universal rule among those courts of appeals that have 

decided the issue that if the plaintiff obtains a 

judgment against the United States, that that judgment 

immediately --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I want you to go back 

before we get to a judgment. Can such a suit be 

brought? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Can it be brought? 

It can be brought. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could this lawyer have 

brought the FTCA act complaint and pled in the 

alternative the Bivens claim? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- it can 

certainly be brought because the judgment bar only 

comes into effect when there's been a judgment. So it 

could be brought. 

But as I was saying, the -- the courts are 

unanimous in holding that if both of those claims were 

to proceed through litigation and to trial and there

were to be a judgment in the action under the FTCA 

against the United States, that that would immediately 

bar any recovery against the employee. And that's been 

the view, again, for some 50 years now. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if the 

first case against the Government were dismissed 

because of a finding that the employee was acting 

beyond the scope of his authority? Should that really 

bar a subsequent action against the employee in an 

individual capacity? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, in -- in a 

footnote --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read your --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- in our brief we 

suggest it might not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read footnote 5. 

You said it didn't. But I don't see how that's 

consistent with the language of the statute. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And -- and in fact, 

in -- in re-reading FDIC v. Meyer in preparation for 

oral argument, footnote 7 of that decision suggests 

that that would be a judgment in an action under 

1346(b). FDIC v. Meyer was saying that it would, 

nonetheless, be cognizable under 1346(b) because the 

allegation was that they were acting within the scope.

 So -- so perhaps we should not have conceded that. 

But it could still be that the -- the 

judgment bar wouldn't apply. It would be an action in 

-- under -- a judgment in an action under 1346(b), but 

the judgment bar protects an employee of the 

Government. And -- and that's a defined term and it's 

defined in the way that suggests the person acting 

within the scope of their employment, advancing the 

purposes of the agency. So there -- there might be a 

reason why the judgment bar itself would not apply to a 

claim where the determination was that the person was 

not acting within the scope of employment. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your theory would cover 

the case where the FTCA claim drops out because the 

employee didn't file the administrative claim within 

the -- what is it? 6 months? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- Your Honor, it 

would not, I think, cover a claim that -- where the 

dismissal was curable, where the person could go and 

exhaust their claim. But the test of whether --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But don't they have a 

short span where they have to bring that administrative 

claim? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: They have -- they 

have 2 years to bring the administrative claim. They

have 6 months to bring the suit in court after the 

administrative claim has been resolved. And the -- the 

reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the suit is tossed out 

because one of those deadlines was met. It would 

follow, I think, under your reasoning that there could 

be no subsequent Bivens claim. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. The 

-- the statute makes the test whether there has been a 

judgment in an action under 1346(b), and plainly, under 

any reading of that language, it means where there is a 

judgment that finally resolves the liability of the 

United States under section 1346(b), there has been a 

judgment in an action under 1346(b). And I don't think 

that the language is susceptible to any other reading. 

So if the claim, as Your Honor suggested, finally 

resolves whether the United States could be liable 

under section 1346(b), then the judgment bar applies. 

Unless there are no further questions --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'd like to pursue the 

question I asked you earlier because I really didn't 

fully understand your answer. It seems to me, as I 

read 2680, it simply says that if one of the exceptions 

applies, there's no waiver of sovereign immunity, 

basically. That's what -- what the scope of it is.

And therefore, none of the other provisions of -- of 

this chapter apply, and if none of the provisions of 

this chapter apply, clearly the judgment bar provision 

is one of those. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I think I'm 

going to borrow Justice Breyer's response because it's 

-- it's a little clearer than the -- than the point I 

was trying to make. And that -- by that same logic, 

that would mean that the provisions of 2679(b) would 

not apply to the claim, and that is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's correct. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- precisely the 

question that was addressed in -- in United States v. 

Smith, and the Court said that -- that it did apply. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It follows that 2679(b) 

does not apply, but you're just have -- working on a 

blank slate with no provision of the Federal Tort 

Claims Act affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity or 

imposing any kind of judgment bar. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But if 2679(b) did 

not apply, there would be no basis for substituting the 

United States and having the claim dismissed. And that 

was precisely the issue that was addressed in -- in 

United States v. Smith. So -- so plainly you cannot 

read it to mean that -- that all of the provisions of

the FTCA are simply a nullity or nugatory with respect 

to such a claim. That -- that -- rather, as Your Honor 

suggested, what it means is that the United States has 

not waived its sovereign immunity. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But in FDIC v. 

Meyer, the Court was very clear that the FTCA is the 

kind of case which defines jurisdiction by the scope of 

the waiver of immunity and to -- the claims to which 

the United States has rendered itself liable. So -- so 

all of those issues are interrelated, and -- and it 

reflects the substantive nature of those exclusions. 

It could not be --

JUSTICE BREYER: But you left out one word 

that I think is important there. To test it to see if 

I'm right about this is I thought 2679(b) was focusing 

in large part upon State tort suits. Is that right? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is true that --

JUSTICE BREYER: They wanted to get rid of 

the State tort suits --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- the --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- in part. Am I right 

about that or not? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: 2679(b) applies only 

to -- to State law causes of action.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, therefore, 

if in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean, 

Congress would have both removed the State lawsuits in 

2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the 

exceptions. But that would have the statute defeat 

itself, and therefore, that case that you're citing 

came to a correct result. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. 


JUSTICE BREYER: That's right? 


MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I --


JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Don't tell me it's 


right if it's not right is all I want --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- we -- we believe 

that United States v. Smith was right, and that shall 

not apply cannot have the meaning that Justice Stevens 

was trying to attribute to it for that reason. 

If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

please the Court: 

To begin with, the court of appeals did not 

have jurisdiction under the final judgment rule to 

review the district court's order. 

Petitioners do not contest that they could 

have been sued under Bivens initially or that the 

Hallocks could have filed simultaneous FTCA claims and 

Bivens claims. Petitioners' argument is that they 

cannot now be sued only because the Hallocks first 

filed a different suit against the United States. That 

situation, which hinges on the sequence of lawsuits, 

does not describe an immunity or a right not to stand 

trial. 

Petitioners try hard to paint the purpose of 

the judgment bar as the same as the purpose of 

qualified immunity, avoiding distraction and inhibition 

of Federal employees from their work. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what 

significance do you give to the word to complete, as to 

whether it's a complete bar? Doesn't that indicate 

that the -- the statute is -- is a bar to all -- all 

further actions after a judgment? 

MS. ZIEVE: I don't think complete bar means 

anything more than bar. Res judicata is a complete bar 

and a statute of limitations is a complete bar. And I

-- I think the statute would mean the same thing 

without that word. And there's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, not -- there --

there are exceptions to the statute of limitations. 

You could have tolling, and there are exceptions to a 

preclusion doctrine. So those doctrines aren't 

complete in the sense that they are without exceptions. 

MS. ZIEVE: That's right, but when -- when 

the bar applies, it's -- it's an absolute bar. I don't 

-- I agree that if the bar has been triggered, it is a 

-- it completely precludes any further action on any 

claims, but I don't think the word complete gives us 

much guidance about when the bar is triggered. 

And the purpose behind the bar generally is 

not the same as the purpose of qualified immunity 

because although the FTCA, in general, and the 

legislative history of the FTCA indicates that the act 

as a whole was intended to protect employee morale and 

distraction from employment, that's not the purpose 

behind the judgment bar. And the judgment bar would be 

a poor vehicle for accomplishing that purpose since it 

allows not only a Bivens suit as an initial matter and, 

when it was enacted, allowed -- still allowed employees 

to be sued for State torts, but also would allow two 

suits, as long as the Bivens suit were litigated

before. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that -- that --

see, that's what's -- I'm not at all certain about 

this, whether they have an appeal, whether they don't 

have an appeal. I'm testing it out. 

But it seems to me if we take your position, 

we're going to make things awfully complicated. That 

is, the -- the basic idea here is in the vast mine run 

of employee suits, go sue the Government, and you can't 

sue the employee at all. That's true of the State 

actions. That's true of ordinary tort actions. And so 

ordinarily, if you sued the -- the employee, whether 

you sued him first, second, or third, you're not 

supposed to and he ought to have an appeal right away 

to get you out of court. 

Now, there is an exception there with the 

Bivens because you can bring your suit first and then 

there's no problem. But if we make an exception in the 

appealability rule for that, people are going to get 

mixed up. It's a kind of curlicue, and even in the 

Bivens case, it has a basic objective of trying to 

prevent people from harassing the employee because the 

instances in which you bring a Bivens suit first, as a 

practical matter, are probably small. 

Now, what's the response to that? I'm just

nervous about making these collateral rules so 

complicated as to whether -- you'd have to do it 

whether it's a Bivens suit or some other kind of suit 

under this, and nobody is going to understand it. 

MS. ZIEVE: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So put in --

MS. ZIEVE: I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- put them in the whole bag. 

Say give the employee his appeal because most of the 

time it's totally to help him from being harassed. 

Now, what's the answer to that? And I'm not 

-- I'm putting it because I want to get your answer. 

MS. ZIEVE: Well, a couple things. First of 

all, the -- the bar to State law tort suits is in 

2679(b), which was passed in 1988, 42 years after the 

judgment bar and the -- and the bulk of FTCA. It was 

passed as an express effort to overturn this Court's 

decision in Westfall, which held that employees did not 

have immunity from State law -- certain State law 

torts. And in the findings that are incorporated into 

section 2 of the statute, Congress specifically called 

2679(b) an immunity provision, and this Court has since 

recognized that, for instance, in Gutierrez de 

Martinez. There is no comparable legislative history 

indicating immunity for -- for -- under 2676.

 So I -- I don't think it's that complicated 

to figure out now whether someone is proceeding --

whether the claim arises -- whether the claim to 

appealability, whether the defense arises under 2679(b) 

or under the judgment bar because they just really get 

at very different things. And the courts haven't shown 

-- there's not a lot of case law in either direction, 

but the -- the courts haven't exhibited much confusion 

about that. 

The other thing is that when you're -- when 

you're construing the scope of the judgment bar, it's 

important to remember that this was passed in 1946, and 

it was intended -- at that time some 25 years -- 35 

years before Bivens, what the -- what Congress was 

getting at was State law suits against the employees 

versus State law suits against the United States. And 

the effort was to shift the liability to the United 

States. That effort to shift liability, yes, was for 

morale, to protect employees from being distracted, but 

that -- that was, again, the purpose of the shift of 

liability, the waiver of sovereign immunity in general. 

The only real explanation of the judgment bar 

appears in the background of where the drafters 

explained that the bar is intended to -- as a bar to --

bar to further suit not only against the Government, as

would have been true under the prior bill. This is 

around page 14 of my brief, the quote from -- from the 

1945 report. Not -- a bar to liability not only 

against the Government, as would have been true under 

the prior version, but also against the employee. And 

there was no bar to suit in the prior version of the 

bill. So the drafters' explanation could only have 

been referring to the normal operation of res judicata. 

And this Court has used res judicata in Digital as 

sort of the quintessential example of a defense that is 

not subject to immediate appeal. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Your rule would be this. 

It's such a complicated area. I'm sorry. But if a 

plaintiff brings a lawsuit, tort suit, against a 

Government employee and the Westfall Act bars the 

lawsuit, period, you can't sue him at all because of --

of (b). He gets an immediate appeal if the district 

court doesn't agree. 

MS. ZIEVE: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if under the Westfall 

Act you could sue him, depending on the order, he 

doesn't get an appeal. 

MS. ZIEVE: That's right because defense is 

based on the order of suits. Those are preclusion 

defenses, and preclusion defenses are not immediately

appealable. And, you know, I think this follows from 

the Court's decision in -- in Irwin that -- that 

certain defenses that are available to private parties 

in litigation should also be available, treated the 

same way, have the same rules when the Government is 

being sued like a private party. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what's wrong 

with the Government's distinction of Digital that here 

you have a policy embodied in a statute as opposed to a 

private settlement agreement? 

MS. ZIEVE: The -- Digital explains that if 

you have a right not to stand trial that is set forth 

in a statute or constitutional provision, that the 

court isn't going to second-guess the importance of 

that right. It's -- it's unclear whether the 

importance prong of the collateral order test should be 

part of -- part of that effective reviewability or 

whether it's part of the second prong about separate 

from the merits of the case. 

But in any event, what Digital doesn't say is 

just because something is in a statute -- a right is in 

a statute -- it's -- it -- it is correct to 

characterize it as a right not to stand trial. To the 

contrary, Digital cautions that anything -- so many 

defenses could be called rights not to stand trial, and

so the court will look -- will apply the test very 

stringently. 

Statute of limitations, for instance, are in 

statutes and when the statute has expired, you could 

say that is a statutory bar to a right to stand trial. 

But statute of limitations, like the res judicata 

defense, are just not appealable under the collateral 

order doctrine. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I suppose if there 

was no appellate court jurisdiction, we're not going to 

resolve the merits of that question. 

MS. ZIEVE: That's right. If there's no 

appellate court jurisdiction, the Court doesn't have to 

go on to construe the scope of the judgment bar. But 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would at the end 

of the road. If -- if you go to the Bivens claim and 

if the plaintiffs prevail, you could still appeal from 

that and say that that suit was barred. It should 

never have gone forward. 

MS. ZIEVE: That's right, Justice Ginsburg, 

and that's exactly why this defense is effectively 

reviewable after final judgment as opposed to now. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's no question that 

it would be -- it doesn't die if you don't have an

interlocutory review. It's there but you've wasted a

the answer. 

MS. ZIEVE: That's true to this -- just as is 

true with defenses based on statute of limitations or 

res judicata or, you know, a whole host of defenses --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could the district court 

have certified the question? 

MS. ZIEVE: The district court could have

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there a request 

made to do that or --

that.

I'm not going to give you 1292(b) certification, but --

but there's Cohen against Beneficial out there. Why 

don't you try that route? It was the district judge 

who -- who mentioned that possibility, wasn't it? 

MS. ZIEVE: Well, actually the petitioners 

filed a notice of appeal before the 1292(b) motion had

been decided and then sought a 1292(b) certification. 

I think they were trying to protect themselves by doing 

it both ways --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think the district 

-- the district judge was aware of Cohen against 

Beneficial, and I think referred to it. Maybe I'm -- I 

don't remember correctly. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. I -- I thought -- I 

thought the district court said I'm going to deny the 

motion to certify because the issue is clear in my 

view, but if you think you have a collateral order 

doctrine, then go ahead and take your appeal. 

MS. ZIEVE: Well, I don't think he expressed 

any view about whether the case satisfied the Cohen 

doctrine. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but he mentioned that 

there was -- he mentioned Cohen. 

MS. ZIEVE: Yes, but he -- he didn't think 

the issue warranted an immediate appeal. He made that 

clear by denying the 1292(b) motion. And -- and I 

think that would have been the -- the appropriate way 

to appeal would have been 1292(b), and having been 

denied that route, petitioners should wait till the end 

of the case because, as you say, this issue will be 

effectively reviewable at the conclusion of the

litigation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it --

maybe this is an incorrect way to look at it, but there 

is a relationship between the merits and the 

interlocutory review decision. I would suppose if we 

agreed on the merits with the Government -- in other 

words, adopted a fairly clear and categorical rule --

the need for an interlocutory appeal would diminish 

because the district courts would almost always get it 

right. 

But if we adopt a standard for the 

application of this bar that, you know, depends on a 

lot of different things, then the appellate court is 

going to disagree with the district court in a greater 

number of circumstances, and maybe we should allow an 

interlocutory review of that. 

MS. ZIEVE: The Court's cases allowing and 

disallowing collateral order appeals don't turn on the 

-- the litigation efficiencies that will be obtained if 

the court goes forward, but rather on whether the issue 

or the defense that -- that the petitioner is seeking 

to appeal actually fits the stringent requirements of 

the Cohen doctrine. And the Court has, in its more 

recent cases, cautioned against broadening collateral 

order appeals and indicated that 1292(b) and the rule's

enabling act provisions 2092 that allows a court to 

identify categories of cases that are appropriate for 

interlocutory appeal as a categorical matter, but those 

are the preferred ways to go rather than stretching the 

final judgment rule really beyond the bounds of its 

language. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps you should go on 

now to the question, assuming that it is immediately 

appealable. 

MS. ZIEVE: If the Court reaches the second 

question, the res judicata foundation of the bar shows 

as well why the Second Circuit's decision on the 

substantive question should be affirmed. 

The -- the text -- the language of the text 

uses classic res judicata terminology, judgment and 

bar, and the historical context of the statute makes 

that reading by far the most reasonable. 

The -- when the act was passed in -- in 1946, 

until then, Federal employees had been sued for State 

law torts, the biggest category of cases involving auto 

accidents with postal workers. And Congress set about 

trying to waive sovereign immunity so that the 

Government could step in to defend the suits and be 

sued in their place, which it thought was fair and 

would help morale. And so that plaintiffs would no

longer have to seek private bills in Congress, which 

was considered a -- a burden. 

When the -- when the -- the FTCA allows the 

United States to stand in the shoes of the employee for 

purposes of a State law tort suit. And then the 

judgment bar extends to the employee the preclusion 

benefit of that suit so that the employee gets the same 

res judicata effect that he would have had absent the 

shift of -- of the defense to the Government. 

The -- again, the -- the one clear 

explanation in the background for why the judgment --

what the judgment bar does is that it -- it applies to 

the employee the same bar that would have applied to 

the Government under -- under prior bills which, again, 

was only the bar of res judicata. Because res --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you -- did you 

make the argument or the point that Justice Stevens 

articulated earlier about the -- the provisions of this 

chapter not applying and that including 2676? 

MS. ZIEVE: No, we didn't make it, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it sound good or 

bad to you now? 

(Laughter.) 

MS. ZIEVE: We did make a similar argument 

that 2680 states that 1346(b) shall not apply and

because the judgment bar only applies to actions under 

1346(b), it's something of a contradiction to say that 

an action that -- to which 1346(b) shall not apply at 

the same time an action under 1346(b). 

As for Justice Stevens' broader argument that 

-- that chapter -- chapter 171, which is the rest of 

the FTCA, other than -- than 1346(b), shall not --

shall not apply to claims arising from the exceptions, 

I don't think that Smith, which I think was Mr. 

Hallward-Driemeier's response -- Smith doesn't really 

provide a full answer to why that argument might be 

wrong because Smith really -- Smith did say that an 

action that -- an action to which the chapter does not 

apply at the same time can be one to which the 

exclusive remedy provision has been applied. 

But one difference is the -- the order in 

which those things happened. First, you would get the 

2679(b) exclusive remedy provision invoked before the 

question of whether 2680 applied would arise. 

And the other point is that Smith, which 

construed the exclusive remedy provision to apply even 

if the exceptions would then preclude a suit entirely, 

was based on the purpose of the exclusive remedy 

provision. The legislative history's relatively clear 

statements that it was intended to provide an immunity

from State law tort suits for Federal employees acting 

within the scope of their employment and looks to two 

other provisions of 2679, neither of which would come 

-- have any role here or were even adopted or enacted 

until 42 years after the judgment bar was enacted. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't 

understand. If we were to take that, wouldn't we have 

to overturn Smith? You think not. You just said not. 

But as I -- then as I understand Smith, we 

look to (b) and (b) says, plaintiff, you cannot bring 

an action under anything. Okay? You can't bring a 

State tort law action. You can't bring an action under 

Federal law against the employee, with certain 

exceptions where you can like Bivens and where there's 

a specific statute. 

Then we have over here the exceptions 

section. And over here in the exceptions section, it 

says there is no Federal action for, among other 

things, the case in front of us and, among other 

things, actions in a foreign country. And so the court 

says, one, this is in a foreign country, so you can't 

bring it under Federal Tort Claims Act, and now we'll 

go look to see whether this bar that you can't bring 

it, period, applies. They say it does apply. 

Now, Justice Stevens dissented, but he didn't

dissent on that ground. 

And -- and so -- so I don't see how we could 

reach the result with this other exception without 

overturning Smith because Smith said (b) does apply. 

And so if the fact that it falls within an exception 

means the whole thing doesn't apply, then they would 

have held (b) doesn't apply. But they said (b) does 

apply. So how do we get there given Smith? 

MS. ZIEVE: Well, like application of the 

judgment bar, one distinction would be that it turns on 

the order in which things occur, and in --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that -- that would 

be to overturn the reasoning of Smith. It would say --

MS. ZIEVE: But the reasoning --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. ZIEVE: Well, the reasoning of Smith is 

not based on the language of 2680. The reasoning of 

Smith is based on the statement of legislative purpose, 

the background under which 2679(b) was enacted, and 

based on 2679(b)(2), which has -- stating exceptions, 

and 2679(d)(4), which has procedures for the United 

States to certify and step into the shoes of the United 

States. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, in effect, they didn't 

-- the Court didn't consider this argument in Smith.

 MS. ZIEVE: Right. What the Court did in 

Smith -- and I think this applies to much of the 

Court's jurisprudence to construing the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The main holding in Smith 

was that the foreign country exception applied. That's 

all they held in Smith, wasn't it? 

MS. ZIEVE: Right. Smith held the foreign 

country exception applied even though the employee 

would -- the -- the plaintiff would have no remedy. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the -- and the -- I 

don't see how that is at all inconsistent with what 

I'm suggesting here. I really don't. 

MS. ZIEVE: Well, I don't think it's 

inconsistent. I think one thing that's important is 

that the Court -- both in that case and in Meyer and in 

Gutierrez de Martinez, the Court looked at provisions 

of the FTCA that are not models of clarity and 

attempted to give a sensible reading, given the -- the 

purposes that Congress was trying to achieve and the 

context and structure of the specific provisions. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, looking at it very 

broadly, it doesn't seem to me that if the United 

States did not waive sovereign immunity for a 

particular category of tort case, that a dismissal of 

such a tort case should bar an -- an action by an

individual against an individual defendant, just 

looking at it in -- in a global sense. And that's what 

the plain language of the statute also says. So I 

don't really see any tension. I -- maybe I'm missing 

something obvious here. 

MS. ZIEVE: I agree entirely. As the Court 

said in Meyer, the jurisdiction under the FTCA is 

defined by the scope of the waiver of sovereign 

immunity, and without question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- this case is 

about the interpretation of 2676, as we took it. And 

before your time runs out, if we can get to the nub of 

your difference, your reading and the Government's, you 

say judgment in 2676 means judgment on the merits, and 

the Government says it means any judgment. So to buy 

your interpretation, we would have to put a caret mark 

after judgment and put on the merits. But the statute 

doesn't say on the merits. 

MS. ZIEVE: No, the statute doesn't say what 

it means by judgment. And I -- and I don't think 

judgment has a clear meaning, and that's why it's 

appropriate to look to the context of the provision, 

what Congress was trying to achieve in the provision to 

interpret the scope of the bar and the meaning of -- of 

that word and all the words together.

 The -- the purpose of the statute is to shift 

suits from the employees to the Government, and the 

background of this specific provision, little as it is, 

and the comparison in a couple places to this provision 

discussing a parallel way to the administrative 

settlement provision -- we think the most sensible 

reading is that Congress was trying to extend the 

preclusion effect of the suit against the Government so 

that although the employee would no longer be sued and 

would get that benefit in the first instance, if the 

plaintiff chose to go against the Government first, the 

employee wouldn't have -- there would be no second suit 

against the employee for those same State law torts 

because in -- in 1946, the only torts Congress was 

considering were State law torts. Am I going to sue 

the Government for negligence or my mail carrier for 

negligence? 

And to -- both for efficiency reasons, to 

protect the Government, which was concerned about --

about the burden on it of having to go -- to litigate 

twice, the preclusion effect would be carried to the 

employee, so that once there was a resolution of the 

State law torts against the Government, that would be 

the end of the matter. I think the end of the matter 

is actually a phrase that the Assistant Attorney

General uses in the legislative history. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- as a 

practical matter, though, what is the great burden on 

the plaintiffs in requiring them to sue the individual 

defendants first if they're concerned about the 

judgment bar? 

MS. ZIEVE: In -- in many cases, if not most 

cases, an -- a plaintiff won't have both remedies 

available. So it's only a -- a small universe of cases 

anyway in which a plaintiff would want to sue in Bivens 

and sue under the FTCA. But at the beginning of the 

case, before discovery, when all you've done is file 

your administrative claim to which, in many cases as in 

this one, the Government has never even responded, the 

plaintiffs and the lawyers may have no idea that they 

actually have a Bivens claim. In this case, when they 

thought they had one, they filed it. 

Also, the Government's view in -- in other 

cases is not that your -- it doesn't help the 

plaintiffs to sue simultaneously because the 

Government's position in other cases has been -- and 

courts have largely agreed -- that once the judgment in 

the -- on the FTCA claim comes down, the Bivens suit is 

then precluded, in some cases even if the judgment in 

the Bivens suit has preceded the judgment in the FTCA

suit. So bringing them simultaneously, while in some 

cases might -- might be feasible and seem like a good 

idea, is not necessarily going to protect the 

plaintiffs, given the scope of the Government's 

arguments. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't --

you don't have to bring them simultaneously. You can 

bring the individual action first, separately. 

MS. ZIEVE: Bring the individual -- bring 

suit -- the Bivens suit first? If the -- if the 

statute of limitations work out, you could bring the 

Bivens suit first, but again, you'd have to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: A Bivens suit is pretty 

hard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of 

negligence. 

MS. ZIEVE: Yes. And since, either way, 

you're only going to get one satisfaction for your 

claim, it seems odd to adopt a construction that 

encourages plaintiffs to go first after the employees 

when the purpose of the FTCA was try to encourage 

plaintiffs to go after the Government instead. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And plaintiffs, generally, 

like to sue -- sue solvent defendants too I think. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. ZIEVE: Yes. And -- and if the

Government had responded in this case to the 

administrative claim in -- in a timely manner or at 

all, the plaintiffs would have had a better sense of 

where they stood on the FTCA claim before they filed 

suit. 

I'd like to mention, although the Government 

has sort of retracted it, that footnote 5 of their 

reply brief concedes that claims wholly outside the 

purview of the FTCA, to use their phrase -- that 

judgments based on claims wholly outside the purview of 

the FTCA do not trigger the judgment bar. Claims based 

on -- claims that arise under the exceptions of 2680 

are surely outside the purview of the FTA -- FTCA. The 

-- the 1945 committee report, which is the last one 

before the statute was enacted, actually describes the 

FTCA 2680 exceptions as excepting certain classes of 

torts from the grant of the right to sue. Not only 

does that make clear that they're outside the purview 

of the FTCA, but that they are matters of subject 

matter jurisdiction. As this Court has explained in 

cases like Scarborough and last month in Everhart, 

subject matter jurisdiction refers to classes of cases 

that the court has authority to adjudicate. The court 

-- the district court did not have authority to 

adjudicate the FTCA claim filed by the Hallocks because

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, you have 5-and-a-half 

minutes left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you, Your 

Honor. 

First, I think it's important to note that 

respondents concede that the Westfall Act confers a 

form of official immunity. That statute, like 2676, 

does not use the word immunity. Rather, it uses the 

word, any action related to the same subject matter is 

precluded. And that is virtually indistinguishable 

from the language of 2676 that -- that establishes a 

complete bar to any action by reason of the same 

subject matter. 

So there is no requirement that Congress 

invoked particular language to create an immunity. The 

question is what are the underlying concerns that are 

protected? And the respondents have admitted that 

2676, like the Westfall Act, was intended to protect 

employee morale against the threat of personal

liability when they were acting for the Government, as 

well as the distraction and cost of defending against 

suit. 

This Court, in fact, in Gilman --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The thing you haven't 

answered that I think is troubling everybody is why is 

-- why is that -- I mean, if you could come up with 

some explanation of why that concern for morale only 

arises after there has been a -- a judgment in the suit 

against the Government. Why -- if that were the 

concern and if the Government wanted total immunity, 

why wouldn't they have extended it to a -- a 1983 suit 

brought before the FTCA suit? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I 

-- I admit that Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Give me a good reason for 

that. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- Congress 

addressed the -- only part of -- of the problem. But 

as Justice Stevens recognized, plaintiffs would want to 

sue the solvent defendant, and that's why the -- making 

the Government itself subject to suit was part of the 

deal. And -- and Congress understood that plaintiffs 

were going to take up that option. And that's why, up 

until the -- this Court's adoption of Bivens, there

were virtually no decisions about 2676 because 

plaintiffs just didn't try. 

This Court in Gilman, an early case relating 

to 2676, recognizes that -- that the statutory 

provision was intended to address precisely these types 

of concerns, morale of employees, the same concerns 

that have led this Court and Congress in other contexts 

to recognize other forms of -- of official immunity. 

And this one is equally subject to immediate review. 

Respondents suggest, considering for a 

moment, what Congress would have expected in 1946 when 

it initially enacted this, and -- and I think that that 

is helpful. There is -- it is quite clear 2676 is 

explicit, that Congress did not expect the end of the 

litigation against the United States under the FTCA to 

mark the beginning of the litigation against the 

employee in his personal suit. 

And -- and respondents offer the example of 

the postal carrier as one of those quintessential cases 

that Congress meant to address. But, of course, the 

postal exception to the FTCA, another exception in 

2680, 2680(b), would bar many claims against the United 

States relating to a postal carrier's misdirection of 

the mail. Now, respondents would have the Court 

believe that if that suit was brought against the

United States and the United States was found not to be 

liable because of that exception, that the plaintiffs 

were free -- and Congress intended that the plaintiff 

be free -- to then go sue the poor mail carrier himself 

personally. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about 2679(b)(2) of 

the Westfall Act which says the Government doesn't get 

substituted for the employee in a Bivens claim? 

Westfall -- the Congress was -- was quite concerned, it 

seems, with preserving an action brought for violation 

of the Constitution of the United States. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: With respect to 

section 2676, Bivens claims today, after the enactment 

of the Westfall Act, stand in the same footing as 

common law claims stood prior to the enactment of the 

Westfall Act. In other words, prior to Westfall, you 

could bring a common law claim against an employee, but 

if you brought a suit against the United States, the 

judgment in that suit would bar the common law claim 

against the employee. In other words, the plaintiff 

had to make a choice. 

Likewise, when Congress enacted Westfall and 

said you no longer have a choice with respect to common 

law claims, those have to be brought against the United 

States, it left the plaintiffs with a choice with

respect to constitutional claims. They could choose to 

pursue a Bivens remedy, but if they sue the United 

States on those claims, the judgment and the action 

under 1346 would be a complete bar to any action 

against the employee. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if -- if they 

decided to pursue a Bivens claims -- a Bivens claim, 

doesn't the -- the Government often undertake the 

representation of the Government employees in those 

cases? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And 

an additional concern of Congress was that the 

Government would be forced to defend against the suit 

twice. In effect, the cost of litigation might be 

borne by the Government in both cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
