 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-526, Carcieri v. Kempthorne.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress squarely addressed and 

unambiguously answered the first question in this case 

when it enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. 

It authorized the Secretary to take land in trust for 

Indians, and it declared, as used in this Act, Indians 

were "members of any recognized Indian tribe now under 

Federal jurisdiction." The word "now" had the same 

meaning in 1934 as it does every morning in this Court 

when the Marshal announces that "The Court is now 

sitting."

 When Congress said "now under Federal 

jurisdiction," it did not mean "then under Federal 

jurisdiction," but that is what the Government contends. 

In fact, the word "then" is the antonym for "now." 

"Now" must be given its ordinary meaning, which the 

Government concedes on -- in its brief, is the date,

effective date of the statute.

 In this statute, the term "now" and synonyms 

are used repeatedly throughout the Indian Reorganization 

Act. The word "now" appears five times in the same 

sense throughout the Act. The word "hereafter" is also 

used. The word -- the term "now" or "hereafter" is used 

three times; "heretofore" is used three times. I 

mention these things because the Congress that read and 

enacted the statute had a keen sense of the temporal 

nature of the terms used in the Act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about a poster that 

says "Give blood now."

 MR. OLSON: Pardon me, Justice Breyer? I 

didn't hear you.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They put up a poster that 

says "Give blood now."

 MR. OLSON: Well, it is --

JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't mean when it was 

printed.

 MR. OLSON: Of course, of course, Justice 

Breyer. There are many contexts in which one could 

conceivably, but the context would tell you. In fact, 

the Government's -- one of the Government's examples is 

the use of the word "now" in a will. Of course, 

everyone knows the will speaks as of the date of the

passage of the individual. There's another reference in 

the statute where the Government refers to that, and the 

statute itself has a very clear, different meaning.

 My reference to the statute and the use of 

the word "now" in this statute is very, very clear. The 

legislation -- the statute refers to legislation "now 

pending." That had to mean 1934. It refers to 

boundaries "now existing or hereafter established." It 

refers to positions and Indian tribes "now or hereafter 

created." It refers to lawsuits "now pending or 

hereafter filed." It refers to tribes "now under 

Federal jurisdiction." All of those uses of the word 

"now" are consistent. If the Government was correct, 

the word "now" would have no meaning in that statute.

 I think it was interesting, if one takes the 

question presented as articulated by the Government, it 

says, "Whether the Indian Reorganization Act authorizes 

the Interior Secretary to take into trust on behalf of 

an Indian tribe that was not recognized" -- "a not 

recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction on 

June 18th, 1934," if you take that word "not" and strike 

it out of the question presented, you get the statute.

 So, what the Government is asking for is the 

exact opposite of what the statute clearly requires. 

And all one has to do is look at the question presenting

-- presented as --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

about the additional definition in section 19 of 

"tribe," which is not limited the way the first sentence 

is?

 MR. OLSON: But it says, Chief Justice 

Roberts, it says "Indian tribe." And the word "Indian," 

in that very section, at the very beginning of the 

section, says "the term 'Indian' as used in this Act," 

blah, blah, blah. So then, later in that same section, 

it refers to "Indian tribe."

 It's important to juxtapose section 5, which 

is codified as 465, and section 19, which is codified as 

479, to look at the statute. The first part of section 

5 authorizes the Secretary to take land for Indians. 

Now, the way the Government addresses that in the 

Government's brief, they took the word "tribe" at the --

towards the end of Section 465 and said the statute 

authorizes taking land for tribes. It actually says 

taking land for Indians, and then in the latter part of 

section 5, it says "title" -- "When property is taken 

for Indians, title may be vested in an individual Indian 

or in a tribe." Then when you get to section 19, 

Congress very carefully said, "As used in this Act, the 

term 'Indian' shall mean" what we've been talking about

here today, and that's an adjective that describes 

"tribe" later in the sentence.

 There's two things that the Government does 

in their brief which I find very interesting. First of 

all, the Government says the use of the word "Indian" 

doesn't necessarily mean Indians.

 But Title I, section 1, of the United States 

Code, the first sentence in the United States Code, 

says: "The word 'singular'" -- "The word 'singular' 

shall include the plural, and the plural shall include 

the word 'singular.'"

 So the United States is disregarding that 

maxim. Of course, the context can always indicate 

something different. But the Government asks you to 

ignore the singular or plural. And then the other thing 

that the Government does is to ask you to understand 

that the word "Indian" means something when it's a noun 

and something else when it's an adjective, violating 

another primary construct -- construction, statutory 

construction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't it have to be 

correct because in -- in section 19 it says that the 

term "Indian" means, among other things, all other 

persons of one-half or more Indian blood. Now, the use 

of "Indian" there can't be limited. It would be

circular if that definition applied to the use of that 

adjective there.

 MR. OLSON: The -- the -- yes. I understand 

that, Justice Alito, and -- and no statute, if you -- if 

you come along 70 years later, is it not possible to 

find something like that. But the fact is that the only 

consistent way to look at that term throughout the 

statute -- and I would say, first of all, it's the 

language of the statute. It's the context of the words 

in the statute where the word "Indian" has to mean 

certain things.

 It has to have some limitation. Otherwise, 

the Secretary can do anything, and -- and Congress 

certainly didn't intend that. It's not just the text of 

the statute. It's the purpose for the statute, which 

was to protect and remediate Indians and Indian tribes 

that have been harmed by the allotment policy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What sort of -- excuse me. 

What sort of tribes were not under Federal jurisdiction?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the use of the word 

"tribe" in that question is -- is causing me a problem 

momentarily.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me. What -- what 

-- yes, what members of tribes were not under Federal 

jurisdiction?

MR. OLSON: Well, there were all sorts of 

Indians who were not under Federal jurisdiction. What 

-- there is a -- there is a document that the Government 

produced in 19 -- in just this summer. There are four 

documents I urge the Court to look at that the 

Government suddenly discovered after 10 years of 

litigation and produced in August of this summer, all of 

which are Interior Department documents which support 

our position in this case, Justice Kennedy.

 What -- the fact is that there were many 

Indians throughout the United States that were not 

recognized -- recognized as a part of tribes. They 

weren't groups of individuals with whom the United 

States had made treaties. The United States had various 

different relationships with groups of Indians, 

including tribes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there, then -- were 

there persons of Indian descent who were not under 

Federal jurisdiction?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what kind of 

persons would those be, persons without a tribal 

affiliation?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. In fact, many -- many of 

the Indians throughout the United States were not

connected or -- or tied up into a formal tribe. The 

purpose for the Indian Allotment Act was to take a --

land out of reservations and out of the possession of 

Indian tribes and distribute that to -- to Indians in 

fee simple so that they could sell it to someone else. 

Congress decided, the United States decided, in the '30s 

that that policy had been -- ill-served the Indians and 

ill-served the United States. So the Indian 

Reorganization Act was intended to address and remediate 

that.

 At the same time the United States was 

concerned and the Congress was concerned that there had 

to be some limit. If there were Indians that had not 

been adversely affected by the Allotment Act, they were 

not intended to be, generally speaking, covered by the 

Indian Reorganization Act.

 So what I mean -- I was saying in response 

to Justice Alito's question -- it's not just the text of 

the statute. It's the purpose for the statute, which 

was to provide some benefits and some limitations on the 

damage done by the allotment policy. So it was natural, 

when it was necessary to come up with some restriction 

on who would be the potential beneficiaries of the 

statute, to look at the tribes that were under Federal 

jurisdiction in 1934 who had been harmed in some

fashion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding --

maybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as 

there is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and 

under Federal jurisdiction. So how -- how do you tell 

in 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?

 MR. OLSON: Well, what the Interior 

Department did was, in compliance with the statute --

was to set about and create a list. There was a list 

created in 1936, as I understand it, Chief Justice 

Roberts. There was subsequent legislation that has even 

a List Act.

 But the -- what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess the 

point is that, given the weight that you are placing on 

the word "now," you would think there was some clear way 

to say who was recognized before then and who was 

recognized after that. And I -- I just don't know what 

the test of recognition was in 1934.

 But if they were drawing -- if Congress were 

drawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a 

sharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there 

is no real sharp distinction.

 MR. OLSON: Well, there was a relatively 

sharp distinction. That is to say, it was Indians that

had treaties with the United States, or tribes that had 

treaties with the United States, or had been recognized 

in some fashion by the United States Government in terms 

of a relationship between the Government of the United 

States and the Indian tribes.

 Now, the Federal Register and Federal 

records in 1934 were not what they are today, and that's 

the reason why, when these words were used, the Interior 

Department set about to look through the history of the 

Interior Department and to come up with a list of tribes 

that would have been covered, would have been embraced, 

by that term now recognized in 1934.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that that 

-- that effort was ridden -- ridden with mistakes. So 

could you have, under your definition, a tribe that is 

recognized relatively recently, whether it is about 16, 

but that was, in fact, a tribe in 1934; that is, the --

although it wasn't formally recognized until later, it 

was, in fact, a tribe in 1934?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. In 

fact, to the extent that it's necessary to go back and 

-- and it happened on a few occasions subsequent to 1934 

that historical records were reviewed, relationships 

between the tribe and the Federal Government were 

reviewed. In fact, in the Government's brief, the

Government talks about three tribes for which land was 

taken into trust that didn't fit the definition of now 

recognized -- tribes recognized in 1934.

 We went back and looked at two of those 

three tribes where -- in fact did have treaties with the 

United States and would have been included. The other 

would have probably been included and could be included 

just exactly the way you suggested in your question.

 The other point that I think is very 

important to emphasize is that 15 times since the 

enactment of this statute Congress has acted 

specifically to apply the Indian Reorganization Act to 

an Indian tribe that had not been covered in 1934, 

evidencing some congressional understanding that it --

it took an act of Congress to bring a particular tribe 

under the Act. There is these --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I suppose if the 

phrase "now under the jurisdiction of the United States" 

did not have any clear meaning when the statute was 

enacted, it -- it wouldn't have any clear meaning for 

the future, either. So you don't -- you don't solve 

that problem by reading "now" to mean "then," right?

 MR. OLSON: Well, what -- what -- I think I 

understand your question. What the Government wants to 

do is just take the word "now" out of the statute

altogether.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I'm saying it doesn't 

help if you do what the Government suggests. That 

doesn't give any clearer content to the meaning of being 

under Federal jurisdiction. It is still going to have 

to be worked out somehow. The question is whether you 

work it out and apply it as of the time of the statute 

or work it out and apply it time by time.

 MR. OLSON: The only way the statute makes 

sense is to construe "now" to mean 19 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. No. 

That's not true, because now you have a very clear 

system. You are recognized if you are on the list. If 

you don't -- you know, maybe you shouldn't be on the 

list; maybe you should be. But you are recognized if 

you are on the list. That wasn't the case in 1934.

 MR. OLSON: Chief Justice Roberts, what --

it was intended -- members of Congress had to think the 

word "now" meant something. In fact, there is a 

colloquy between Senator Wheeler and Commissioner --

Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Collier that is 

referred to in the briefs where Senator Wheeler was 

saying: Well, there are some -- some groups out in --

in California that are no more Indian than you or I. 

What are we going to do about that?

And Commissioner Collier, who is the author 

of the Act, says: We will stick the words "now under 

Federal jurisdiction in there." And then he explains 

exactly what was meant by that: That would -- that it 

would cover tribes that existed in -- in 19 -- that 

would -- he says that would limit the Act to Indians now 

-- and he is speaking at the time the statute was being 

debated -- under Federal jurisdiction.

 Those documents that the Government suddenly 

discovered in August of this year, which were lodged 

with this Court in the latter part of August of this 

year, include a 1936 -- circular letter by Commissioner 

Collier to all of the superintendents throughout the 

United States. This is the author of the statute 

speaking in 1936, and he says "all persons of Indian 

descent who are members of any recognized tribe that was 

under Federal jurisdiction at the date of the Act."

 Now your point, Chief Justice Roberts, is 

that maybe it was unclear at the exact moment of -- of 

enactment which 198, or whatever number it might have 

been, tribes were under that, but that's the sort of 

information that can be discerned by looking at the 

history and the records so that a finite group could be 

identified. It isn't perfect, as Justice Ginsburg's 

question suggests, but it is a verifiable method of

limiting what Congress obviously intended to limit --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, can I ask you a 

kind of a -- maybe it's too obvious -- preliminary 

question? Is there a definition of the term "Indian 

tribe" in the statute?

 MR. OLSON: No. Not in -- it says "Indian 

tribe" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Section 19 defines the 

term "Indian," but there is no definition of what an 

Indian tribe is.

 MR. OLSON: It refers, in the second-to-last 

sentence of section 19 or 479, "The term 'tribe' 

wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to 

any Indian tribe." That's -- that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: See that -- that word 

isn't limited by time or date, is it?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the word "Indian" is, if 

you accept the word --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but the word 

"Indian" -- it says the word "Indian," in the last 

sentence, "'adult Indian' wherever used in this Act 

shall be construed to refer to Indians who have attained 

the age of 21 years."

 MR. OLSON: Well, that just simply, I 

submit, defines the word "adult."

are some changes --

confusion there. You're talking about -- I wish we

Justice Scalia, for the purposes of this, it is quite 

clear that if you were a member of Congress in 1934 

reading this statute and seeing the words "now or 

hereafter" meaning now or sometime afterwards and seeing 

the words "now pending," "now recognized," "now 

existing," and so forth, you would think that the word 

"now" meant 1934. In fact, when this Court in 1978 was

construing the statute --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, am I not 

correct that the membership in the tribe is just one 

category of persons who are included in the broader 

definition of the term "Indian"?

 MR. OLSON: There are three categories, 

Justice Stevens.

members of the tribe.

Indians who have attained the age of 21 years. The 

other other is -- let's see. "The term 'tribe' wherever 

used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any 

Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians 

residing on one reservation." Now, that reference to 

the term "tribe," as opposed to "Indian," doesn't have 

any limit on the time.

 MR. OLSON: Well, if you take the word 

"Indian" out, but the word -- the phrase is "Indian 

tribe." And Congress specifically said the word 

"Indian" wherever -- now that's where the Government 

says the word used as a noun doesn't mean the same as 

the word used as an adjective. That doesn't make any 

sense.

But Congress was clearly talking about --

when it made three categories at the beginning of that 

sentence, Justice Stevens, it made three categories 

basically to cover the tribes that were recognized and 

then under jurisdiction in 1934, and that's -- the 

author of the statute said that in 1936. He said that 

in an exchange with Senator Collier. In fact, the two 

other Justice Department -- Interior Department 

documents that were reproduced were documents from the 

Solicitor of the Interior Department to the Indian 

Affairs person saying the same thing in 1978, the same 

thing in 1980, and the same thing in 1994. And when 

this Court construed the statute in -- in an indirect 

way with respect to the Choctaw Tribe in 1978, in the 

case of U.S. versus John, the Court said members of any 

recognized bracket, in 1934, "tribe now under Federal 

jurisdiction."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think -- do you 

think the meaning of that -- the words specifically that 

were added were "now under Federal jurisdiction." The 

word "recognized" was already in the statute. So, it 

looks like the "now" applies to "under Federal 

jurisdiction."

 Now, my law clerks, in doing research on 

this, came up with a number of instances where the tribe

wasn't recognized until 1976. I think that was true of 

something called the Stillaquamish Tribe.

 MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's recognized in 

1976, but then they go back and they say, well, was it 

under Federal jurisdiction in 1934? And that seems a 

rather loose term that includes the fact that you are 

under Federal jurisdiction if, for example, the Federal 

Government has a treaty with you that requires the 

Federal Government to do something. Suppose that's the 

right reading of this. Then should we send this back?

 MR. OLSON: No. The meaning is quite clear. 

In fact, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying I'm 

agreeing with you on the meaning. The meaning is "now," 

but it's "now under Federal jurisdiction." So, there 

would be a question. This tribe wasn't --

MR. OLSON: There's no question that this 

tribe would not qualify --

JUSTICE BREYER: No.

 MR. OLSON: -- and there's no contention 

that it would. No matter how you define that and the --

weren't, in 1934, under Federal jurisdiction? Or 

either?

 MR. OLSON: Both, Justice Kennedy. They 

weren't either.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I suppose that 

what the Government wants us to do is put in two commas: 

The Indian as used in section -- a person of Indian 

descent, comma, who are members of any recognized Indian 

tribes, comma, now under Federal jurisdiction. That 

still might not help if they weren't under Federal 

jurisdiction in 1934.

 MR. OLSON: That's correct. It does not 

help --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if they were 

recognized later?

 MR. OLSON: They can be recognized later, 

Justice Kennedy. In fact, Congress specifically did 

that 15 times between -- for the first time, it was 

1936, and the last time it was 1994.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't agree that 

"recognized later" complies with this statute in your 

case.

said: In each one of those 15 cases, Congress said --

we are talking about here, "shall hereafter apply," 

"shall hereafter apply," "shall be hereby extended," 

"hereby," "hereby extended." So, Congress, on 15 

occasions, decided that it was necessary to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, let me just 

make sure I get this off my chest, and then I'll be 

quiet. The first sentence in section 19 defines the 

term "Indian." And that's the section you're talking 

about?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What section are we talking 

about -- 19? Or are we talking about some other number?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this Act. The 

second refers to -- the second sentence refers to 

Eskimos. The third sentence defines the term "tribe," 

the term "tribe" -- and in that definition there is no 

reference to time.

 MR. OLSON: No, but it says the word 

"Indian."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm talking about the 

third -- the first sentence defines the term "Indian"; 

the third sentence defines the term "tribe."

Stevens?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. OLSON: So, the word --

JUSTICE STEVENS: "Organized band, pueblo, 

or the Indians residing on one reservation."

 MR. OLSON: I submit that, for purposes of 

construction of the statute and using the word 

consistently, the word "Indian" modifies tribe, the word 

"Indian" as defined, that's consistent with the purpose, 

that's consistent with the legislative history. It's 

consistent with the construction --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The word "Indian" does not 

modify the word "tribe" as used in the third sentence. 

That's my point.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think you and I must be 

reading a different thing because the sentence that --

the sentence that defines the word "Indian" says "the 

term 'Indian' as used" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm saying for purposes of 

getting the meaning of the word "tribe," just look at 

the sentence defining that term, and that doesn't refer 

to any time limit.

"Indian," which does have a temporal limitation. If it

JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't limit it to 

Indian tribe. It says, shall include "any Indian tribe,

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think that the 

construction of the statute, including the way this 

Court read it in 1978, the history, the purpose that it 

was intended to accomplish, the use of those words 

throughout the statute which are consistent, all 

supports the proposition that it had meant Indian tribes 

recognized and under Federal jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that you think 

"Indian" modifies "organized band" and "pueblo" as well.

 MR. OLSON: Yes. And if I may, Mr. Chief 

Justice, reserve the remainder of my time.

supports the Secretary's action here for three 

independent reasons. First, section 5 authorizes the 

Secretary to take land into trust for any Indian tribe, 

and the Narragansett tribe is a tribe as that term is 

separately defined in the Act. Second, even if one 

looks to the definition of "Indian" in section 19, the 

best reading of "now" in the first definitional example 

is at the time that the Act is applied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the statute 

reads the same whether "now" is in there or not? You 

read it as saying any recognized Indian tribe under 

Federal jurisdiction.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. And I think 

that if you look at the legislative colloquy, it -- it 

only makes sense, the addition of "now under Federal 

jurisdiction," if what they meant by that was to use it 

at the time the Act is invoked. Senator Wheeler's 

concern, as Mr. Olson explained, was that there were 

Indians in California who were then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying the 

only way that makes sense is to read it as if it weren't 

there.

 MS. MAYNARD: Ironically, Your Honor, I 

think the Congress added the term "now under Federal 

jurisdiction" to the Act, yes, to make clear that it --

it was a contemporaneous application of the term. 

Senator Wheeler was concerned about Indians who were 

already under Federal jurisdiction, and he said sooner 

or later they must have come out from under the Act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure he was, 

because when I looked through that whole thing it seemed 

to me what they were worried about -- Senator Thomas was 

worried about remnants of tribes, and they were talking 

about an example of the Catawba Indians in South 

Carolina, and they had a discussion about that; and then 

it seemed everybody on the committee agreed that these 

Catawba Indians should not be included if they were only 

one quarter Indian. They should be included if they 

were half Indian. And that meant that they had to fall 

within the other phrase, not the phrase that we are 

talking about.

 So then they say how do we get this result? 

I mean, because they are a tribe. Because they are 

certainly a tribe and they are recognized, the Catawbas. 

And then the answer to that was -- what's his name --

the Collier -- Collier. Collier says: I'll tell you 

how: We add the words "now under Federal jurisdiction." 

And he thought what he was doing was ruling out the 

Catawbas and only allowing the half Indians to come in.

 Now, ironically, later on, in the '40s I

think, the government decides that the Catawba tribe is 

in fact under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because a 

treaty exists.

 Anyway, that's how I read it and the 

California Indians were quite secondary to what they 

were talking about. They didn't -- they didn't know 

whether they were under a tribe or not a tribe or 

anything.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the colloquy is 

certainly not clear, Justice Breyer. I'll grant you 

that. But I do think the best reading --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was fairly 

clear.

 MS. MAYNARD: I -- I think the best reading 

of it is that Commissioner Collier is addressing Senator 

Wheeler's concern, not the earlier concern about the 

Catawbas, because he says "Senator Wheeler" -- "Senator 

Wheeler, will this not address your concern?"

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they -- I mean, 

Senator Wheeler was worried about the Catawbas. Then 

Wheeler decides, okay, the half-Indian Catawbas fall in, 

but the quarter-Indian Catawbas don't.

 MS. MAYNARD: My memory of it --

different Senator who was concerned about the Catawbas.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where was this 

interesting conversation? Was it even on the floor of 

the Congress? It couldn't have been, because one of the 

members wasn't a Congressman, right?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think it was at a 

hearing, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was at a hearing, oh.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You learn a lot at 

hearings, actually.

 MS. MAYNARD: But if I could, going back to 

the text, Justice Scalia, the text of the Act 

independently support the Secretary's reading for three 

reasons, the third being that even if one reads "now" in 

the first definitional -- in the first definition to 

mean unambiguously June 18, 1934, the definition by its 

terms is expressly inclusive, setting forth the category 

of people that the Secretary must include but not 

limiting the Secretary to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He can include anybody 

else? He can include, for example, people who are only 

one quarter-Indian blood, even though, you know, they 

went to the trouble of defining it as 50 percent Indian 

blood?

more --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Very strange statute, just 

leaving it up to him to do whatever he wants.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think the proper way of 

reading, as this Court said, definitions that start with 

"shall include" is that they are illustrative examples 

of a general group.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so there is no 

limitations. It includes this and it also includes 

whatever else he wants. Is that it?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor; I think an 

illustrative example of a general class, it would be 

persons listed like the listed person. You example of 

the quarter blood would be more difficult, perhaps. But 

here what the Secretary has done is include within the 

meaning of "Indians" persons who are every bit as much 

an Indian as those who were members of recognized tribes 

under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a very 

strange reading of "shall include" when you're dealing 

with a word that does not itself have any solid content. 

When you're dealing with a word that's pretty much 

self-defining, yes, you can say "shall include this," 

because what in addition is included is -- is pretty 

clear.

But these words have virtually no -- no 

content; and if you say "shall include" means, you know, 

it has this, I'm still left with well, what else does it 

have? I can't believe that the statute was meant to be 

that expansive, to let the Secretary buy land for 

whomever he wanted.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, it doesn't do that, Your 

Honor. I think both -- both the definitions of -- of 

"tribe," for example as Justice Stevens points out, 

"tribe" is a separately defined term; and I don't think 

you can work the statute in the plain text way that 

Mr. Olson suggests. You can't take the word "Indian" 

everywhere it appears in the statute and plug in the 

definition of "Indian." And that's proven by looking at 

the definition of "Indian" itself, which uses the 

adjective "Indian" to define the term "Indian" four 

times. So you can't take --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, would you 

clarify one other thing for me? The sentence in 

question with the word "now" in it and so forth, does 

that have the meaning that it includes descendants who 

are less than a half-blood, quarter-blood, eighth-blood 

and so forth?

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. I think the 

straightforward reading of that would be any descendant

who meet the terms of that provision would be included.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that is an expansive 

definition of the term "Indian," right?

 MS. MAYNARD: The descendants. Yes, we 

interpret that to be descendants who were living on the 

reservation on June 1, 1934, but they wouldn't even have 

to be members of tribes, and there would be no blood 

quantum requirement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so you're 

applying now, when you're talking about who is of Indian 

descent --

MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Indian descent of 

those in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other 

words, you say the Indian descent as of when?

 MS. MAYNARD: Descendants who were on June 

1st, 1934. That's not using -- that's not applying the 

definition of the word "now." That's in fact using a 

very different phrase, the second phrase, where Congress 

used a date when it meant a date in 1934 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I see.

 MS. MAYNARD: -- rather than the definition 

now. In fact, if you look at the verbs in the 

definitional phrase, all of them are "are," "are," 

"are": "Are members of recognized Indian tribes," "are

half-bloods," "are descendants," except when they're 

talking about June 1st, 1934: "Who were on June 1, 

1934, residing on a reservation."

 And I think the best reading of "now" in 

context -- and Mr. Olson has pointed you to several 

places in the text where they use "now" in very 

different clauses: "now pending," "now or hereafter" --

and -- but in two places in the Act, and that's why I do 

think it's important to look at the Act itself, Justice 

Scalia, because this hasn't been codified into positive 

law. In two places in the Act, section 14 and section 

18, Congress used the phrase "at the time of passage of 

this Act."

 So it knew how to use that phrase. It 

didn't use that phrase in "now." And in fact when those

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, that's obviously dicta 

in the context of the decision, but I think in fact the 

addition of the brackets shows that it's ambiguous. If 

it were so clear, they wouldn't have needed to add the

how we resolved the ambiguity.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the Court wasn't

I do think if it had been so clear, the Court wouldn't 

have needed to add the phrase. The --

world's authority on Indian law, both write at the time: 

this means under Federal jurisdiction in 1934; and they 

write it and they rewrite it and they rewrite it. They 

say nothing to the contrary.

 I mean, they are the ones who did it, so I 

have to admit I'm pretty much moved by the fact that 

they thought that's what it meant.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, apart from the Collier 

memo, which I would like to address, the Secretary when 

administering this Act has uniformly, since the 

beginning, applied the definition that applies today.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I could only find one 

instance, which is that Biloxi tribe, where the --

something, you know, the ones in Louisiana -- aside from 

that instance, I have not found one other instance that 

is inconsistent with the words "now under Federal 

jurisdiction" meaning Federal jurisdiction in 1934.

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't know --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you want to list them, 

I'll look them up.

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't know that the 

Secretary has ever undertaken to make such a list. 

There was no list at the time. And the Act was a 

forward-looking act in its view of organized tribes and 

by its nature assumed that there would be no tribes.

But in the 1930s and 1940s, the Solicitor's opinions 

that we cite and discuss in our brief apply the question 

of whether a group is a tribe who can organize under 

section 16 or can have land taken into trust for them 

under section 5.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I believe that's organized 

or recognized, because what they did in several cases, I 

found, like the one, the Stillaquamish or whatever, they 

said, yes, we recognize them now. They weren't 

recognized in 1934, but they were under Federal 

jurisdiction in 1934 because there were treaties that 

applied between the Federal Government and the Indians 

which gave these Indians rights then. And that -- that 

seems consistent with what -- what Collier and the 

others say.

 MS. MAYNARD: My understanding is that the 

Secretary interprets "recognized" and "under Federal 

jurisdiction" to not have much difference with respect 

to tribes. I think the "under Federal jurisdiction," 

the Court of Appeals suggested this might have more 

content when you're talking about individuals, and that 

makes more sense --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That, seems to me, not to 

help you, because if they are the same, then that would 

apply to both.

Justice Breyer was suggesting, as I had 

earlier, that maybe you can make a distinction between 

those were under Federal jurisdiction then and 

recognized tribes now.

 MS. MAYNARD: And possibly you could. I 

don't know that that would help the Narragansett Tribe 

here. But the Secretary has always looked at whether --

whether a tribe could reorganize or have land taken into 

trust for them under section 16 and section 5, to which 

the same definitional -- definitions apply as to whether 

or not the tribe was a tribe at the time the Secretary 

was applying that decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is -- we are 

talking about an extraordinary assertion of power. The 

Secretary gets to take land and give it a whole 

different jurisdictional status apart from State law and 

all -- wouldn't you normally regard these types of 

definitions in a restrictive way to limit that power 

instead of saying whenever he wants to recognize it, 

then he gets the authority to say this is no longer 

under Rhode Island jurisdiction; it's now under my 

jurisdiction?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, there is -- there is a 

competing presumption there that I think is -- Chief 

Justice Roberts, which is that Indian statutes are

interpreted to the benefit of the Indian. And this was 

supposed to be a new deal for the Indians --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do we know 

which one of them benefits the Indian? I mean, have the 

Indians benefited from Federal jurisdiction in the last 

50 years?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the Indians are the ones 

who made the request to have the land taken into trust. 

And I assume they know -- that they believe it's in 

their interest to have the land taken into trust.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are the plans 

the Indians have of doing with the land once it's 

determined to be Indian land subject to trust of the 

Federal Government?

 MS. MAYNARD: The administrative record 

reveals that HUD loaned the -- or granted the tribe 

money to build housing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, of course, the 

use of that land would not be limited to housing, right? 

They could engage in other activities that Indian tribes 

can engage in, correct?

 MS. MAYNARD: According to the 

administrative record, there are some HUD restrictions 

on the land. If what you're concerned with is the 

specter of gaming, our interpretation of the Indian

unilaterally decide to game on this property were it 

taken into trust.

 But as to your point, the -- with respect to 

the clarity of these definitions, the terms "Indian 

tribe," "organized band," "Pueblo," they had been 

interpreted by this Court in 1934 several times. In --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice's 

question, and I was going to put the same question to 

Mr. Olson, is whether or not there is -- is some canon 

of construction, some principle of Federalism which 

makes us be very cautious before we take land out of the 

jurisdiction of the State. It sounds to me plausible. 

Is there any authority for the proposition I just 

stated? Have we said that in cases or --

MS. MAYNARD: Well, you've said --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or have we said the 

opposite, that there is no --

MS. MAYNARD: Here I think it's very clear 

that the purpose of section 5 was to allow the Secretary 

to take land into trust for Indians. And then --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But is there any 

overriding principles about which we must be most 

cautious before we interpret the statute as depriving 

the State of the ownership and jurisdiction of this

land? Is there anything in the cases either way on that 

point?

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't know -- I don't know 

standing here and, Petitioners haven't cited anything 

for that principle in their brief, although they suggest 

-- of that. There is a competing principle that Indian 

sovereignty is not lightly to be set aside.

 One important point I think is that the 

purpose of this statute -- that the Secretary's 

interpretation makes more sense. The -- the purpose of 

this statute was a forward-looking one. It was to 

revitalize and reorganization rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, your 

friend on the other side says the exact opposite. It 

was backward-looking. They had had the allotment 

policy, which they decided was not a good idea, and yet, 

that had resulted in Indian land being turned over to in 

fee simple, and this is a way to compensate for the 

discredited allotment policy.

 So, if you weren't recognized in 1934, you 

were not penalized by the allotment policy, so you 

didn't need the benefit. I think that backward-looking 

perspective seems to make perfect sense.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the historians brief, I 

think, makes a good case that that's not the right view

of history. But the text also debunks that view. The 

half-blood definition is in no way limited to whether or 

not you were an Indian who was a member of a tribe who 

was allotted.

 The inclusion of Pueblos also makes clear 

that that was not the purpose of the Act, because 

Pueblos never had their lands allotted. This was a new 

deal legislation for Indians to let them revitalize. It 

was the beginning of what now has consistently been, 

with the exception of the 1950s, the -- you know, 

Congress has set about to allow the Indians to govern 

themselves. The acquisition of land is extremely 

important to the ability to do that, to revive 

economically, to have self-governance.

 The line that Petitioners pose would create 

an entirely arbitrary result.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As you read the statute, 

Ms. Maynard, the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" 

could be deleted and the statute would mean the same 

thing that you're urging.

 So what do the words "now under Federal 

jurisdiction" add?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, as I was saying 

earlier, I think the colloquy was -- reveals that what 

they were trying to do was make the statute fluid so

that it would apply at the time of application 

contemporaneous move with the times. As I said earlier, 

I don't think there is much distinction between 

recognition and under Federal jurisdiction when one is 

speaking about tribes, but perhaps --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there may -- there 

may not be, but let me on that score, take you back to 

an answer that Mr. Olson gave.

 Assume for the moment, for the sake of the 

question, that we were to read this the way Justice 

Kennedy and Justice Breyer suggested, and that is to 

draw a distinction between the reference -- the now 

reference between recognition and jurisdiction and say 

that the now refers to jurisdiction and it refers to the 

time of passage. If that is the way we read it, should 

we remand this case to the circuit? Mr. Olson said no. 

There is no claim that, in fact, the tribe was, in fact, 

under jurisdiction at the time of passage. What is your 

answer?

 MS. MAYNARD: I'm not certain enough to say, 

Justice Souter. I'm not sure it was litigated on 

that -- on that premise.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, tell us what you want 

us to do.

is going to take that view of the statute, then I 

suppose a remand is preferable to let it be worked out. 

But the Secretary's preface.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In any case, you are not 

here to represent that, in fact, we may assume that 

there was no jurisdiction over the tribe at the time of 

the passage?

 MS. MAYNARD: You know, I just don't know 

that it's ever been looked into from that perspective, 

especially if one draws the difference --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it hasn't -- if it 

hasn't, then you're not in the position to make the 

representation that Mr. Olson -- I think Mr. Olson's 

answer suggested would be a correct one.

 MS. MAYNARD: I believe that the Secretary's 

interpretation from the beginning, as I suggested 

before, has -- has understood recognition and under 

Federal jurisdiction at least with respect to tribes to 

be one and the same. And the -- the -- if the Court 

were to draw a distinction and, you know -- from the 

beginning of the 1930s and '40s the opinions show that 

what the Secretary looked at was at the fact at the time 

as in 1964 there were published regulations interpreting 

Indians and tribe not limited by --

position to -- to draw or accept that conclusion here? 

I mean, that -- that wasn't worked out.  Shouldn't we 

remand and have that specifically addressed and 

specifically address the question of jurisdiction?

 MS. MAYNARD: Which wasn't worked out?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you were -- you were 

saying that the -- that a distinction simply had not 

been drawn at the BIA level, I guess, between 

jurisdiction and recognition. And I don't think -- I 

don't think we are in a position to say, yes, that's so 

or, no, that isn't so. So that would seem to me to 

argue for a remand in and of itself.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think there --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you agree?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, if the Court limits its 

view to the one definitional example in the IRA, then 

perhaps a remand is certainly preferable to a reversal. 

But there is no need to remand, because there are two 

separate reasons. For the Petitioner's to prevail here, 

the text has to unambiguously foreclose the possibility 

JUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't know that that's 

so, because the -- the question I ask myself on that is: 

Were I in Congress, is this the kind of thing I would 

have delegated to the Secretary to decide.

And it's very hard for me to think that 

Congress wanted to delegate the power to the Secretary 

to decide whether "now" happens to mean 1934 or "now" 

means any time in the future. Well, I mean that's 

something Congress would decide: They meant by "now" 

1934, or they meant by "now" any old time it's applied.

 Now -- now, you could argue that both ways, 

but why would you want to delegate? What human being 

would want to say: The meaning of the word "now" is 

something I'm leaving to the Secretary?

 MS. MAYNARD: Even if you think, Justice 

Breyer, that "now" unambiguously means June 18, 1934, 

there are two other --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not saying 

it unambiguously means it. That's not what I'm saying. 

I'm saying it's totally ambiguous, but what the 

Secretary has to say about it is enlightening only 

insofar as the Secretary knows more about it than I. 

That's fine. But not insofar as it delegates power to 

the Secretary to make up his own mind.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think that one -- if 

one can't tell from the text in Chevron and other 

principles, that you allow the Secretary, in light of 

his understanding of the purposes of the statute, the 

plight of the Indians, contemporaneous things, to decide

what the statute means. But there are two other 

provisions in the statute that, apart from that, the 

other side, for them to prevail, the statute has to 

unambiguously foreclose the taking of land in trust for 

tribes, setting apart the example of "Indian." And the 

definition of "tribe" is, as Justice Stevens pointed 

out, it's separately defined. That --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you a question? 

It seems to me that the limited definition of "the 

tribe" really is quite irrelevant to this -- to this 

case. The term "Indian" is defined to include two 

classes of persons: One who are members of a certain 

category of tribes and others who have more than half 

Indian blood. It seems to me that -- and then you get 

to the definition of "tribe" that comes later.

 It seems to me that when you're talking 

about the definition of "tribe," the statute would have 

exactly the same meaning if, instead of it limiting by 

time from 1934, it said tribes located west of the 

Mississippi. If they just limited it to that, that 

wouldn't have limited the definition of "Indian." I 

mean the definition of "tribe."

 It would have made the category of -- of 

persons of Indian dissent or eligible to be treated as 

Indians and whose eligibility is determined by tribal

membership, limited but the -- not to include all 

tribes. So you can limit it, as I say, to tribes west 

of the Mississippi.

 But then when you get down to defining the 

term "tribe," there is no such definition. So that I 

just think the fight about what "now" means is totally 

irrelevant to the meaning of the definition of "tribe."

 MS. MAYNARD: I agree. I agree 

wholeheartedly, and I think there might have been 

reasons that the Court of Appeals concluded they might 

have wanted to limit the definition of any of the 

benefits the Act allows individuals, but not limit the 

Act's coverage of tribes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm interested -- I'm 

interested in the Secretary's conclusion that recognized 

"tribe" and "tribe now under Federal jurisdiction" are 

one and the same; that the words are used redundantly.

 Does he know the rule that we usually don't 

-- I guess he doesn't because he interprets "now" to 

mean nothing. Does he understand that we usually do not 

interpret words to have no meaning? Why would they say 

both if they both mean the same thing?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think maybe I didn't

Federal jurisdiction," that, to me, means two different 

requirements.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think it can capture tribes 

that were previously recognized but that either disband 

or become -- become not -- not vibrant. But in terms of 

currently recognized tribes, tribes that the Secretary 

today recognizes as tribes that have always been tribes 

-- and that's all we are talking about here: Tribes 

that were tribes before European contact, have had a 

cohesive political entity since that time. And that's 

what the Narragansetts are.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I have difficulty with the 

"tribe" thing. I think it's a very difficult case. I 

have a hard time. But the difficulty with the word 

"tribe" is that either that tribe has some people in it 

who are Indians, or it doesn't, right? That has to be 

true.

 Now, if it has some people in it who are 

Indians, i.e., a person who falls within the definition 

of "Indian," then, of course, the Secretary can take 

land for that because the whole thing is for the purpose 

of giving land to Indians. But let's imagine a 

tribe that has no Indians in it within the definition of 

the Act. You are saying that this Act would give to the 

Secretary the power to take land for an entity that has

no members within the Act. Now, that is pretty hard for 

me to accept.

 MS. MAYNARD: Two points, Justice Breyer. 

There is nothing in the definitional section that 

requires the drafting of "Indian" on to the definition 

of "tribe."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is one thing. 

It says it's for the purpose. We -- we give the 

Secretary the power to take land for a tribe for the 

purpose of giving land to Indians.

 MS. MAYNARD: But in --

JUSTICE BREYER: And now we have assumed a 

tribe that has no such members because "Indian" has a 

special definition.

 MS. MAYNARD: But later on in Section 5 it 

says we can take land in trust on behalf of an Indian 

tribe or an individual Indian for whom the land is 

required.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

understand how you say that -- that the term "tribe" has 

no limitation to Indians. "The term 'tribe,' whenever 

used in this Act, shall be construed to refer to any 

Indian tribe, organized band or Pueblo, or the Indians 

residing on one reservation."

the last clause where -- Indians residing on a

Justice Scalia, because "Indian tribe" is used to define 

"Indian," as well. And the whole thing is circular, and 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- I mean 

circular definitions are nothing unusual in the 

legislation that Congress comes up with.

 MS. MAYNARD: But it -- that may be so but 

it doesn't unambiguously foreclose the Secretary's 

interpretation here. And that must mean they must show 

that it unambiguously forecloses --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What meaning -- what 

meaning do you think the sentence has when it says: 

"The term 'tribe' shall be construed to refer to any 

Indian tribe, organized band, Pueblo, or the Indians 

residing on one reservation"?

 MS. MAYNARD: This Court had interpreted --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you interpret that 

not to be limited to Indian tribes?

 MS. MAYNARD: In Montoya this Court had 

interpreted in an earlier statute the term "Indian 

tribe" and "organized band" to mean a distinctly Indian 

community that shared political, ethnic, and cultural 

attributes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: An Indian -- an 

Indian community. Now, if we are looking for a 

definition of "Indian," we go back to the first 

sentence.

 MS. MAYNARD: But the definition of "Indian" 

uses the adjective "Indian" to define it four times, 

Mr. Chief Justice. That can't be clear. You can't take 

their -- their plain-text argument where you just take 

the word anywhere.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it does it 

four times, you ought to give effect to it at least 

once. It says "Indian tribes now under Federal 

jurisdiction." It seems to me that that is the key 

restriction, and that it's not taken away by that last 

sentence, which again reiterates that it's "Indian 

tribe." And then in the last clause to which you refer, 

it's still "Indians residing on one reservation."

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a defined term.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, and I grant you that it 

may graft on to the last clause. But it doesn't graft 

on to "Indian tribe, organized band, or Pueblos."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It just describes the 

subcategory of Indian tribes who -- for whom members can 

qualify even though they don't have half blood. That's

the point. It picks up people who are less than half 

blood if they are members of of those tribes.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well -- but if you look 

broadly at the Act, Justice Stevens, there are 

provisions that are meant to address tribe issues and 

tribal issues. And -- and I think that the purpose of 

the Act -- it makes more sense to read "tribe" as -- as 

not limited by the date and the provisions that apply to 

"tribe," which is how the Secretary has always read it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then Collier, himself, 

would have been wrong. Because Collier in this great 

famous colloquy says, when he adds these four words, he 

says to the Committee: That would limit the Act to the 

Indians -- the Act would be limited to the Indians now 

under Federal jurisdiction except that other Indians of 

more than one-half Indian blood would get help.

 So what he is thinking in his mind is if you 

have any kind of entity or a person who is more than 

one-half Indian blood, fine. The Secretary can act. 

But suppose we have an entity that has only people who 

have less than one-half Indian blood. Then they are out 

of luck unless they are now under Federal jurisdiction.

 MS. MAYNARD: As we -- I discussed earlier, 

I don't agree with your reading of the colloquy. I do 

think it's ambiguous. I think, at a minimum, the

statute doesn't foreclose the secretary's interpretation 

of the provisions. And "Indian" used in Section 1 

clearly is not the "Indian" defined in Section 19. 

Because in Section 1 they talk about Indians who have 

entered into treaties. And that would have included 

both Indians who were and were not under section --

under -- would meet the definition of "Indian" in 

Section 19; nor would plugging that definition into 

Section 1 make very much sense.

 The -- if I could, just before time runs out 

-- if the Court gets to the second question, as we think 

you should, the -- the Settlement Act clearly does not 

repeal the Secretary's authority to take land into 

trust.

 And if the Court has any questions about 

that, it addresses jurisdiction in Rhode Island 

expressly and limits Rhode Island's jurisdiction to the 

settlement land. It contemplates that the Secretary may 

some day take land into trust on behalf of the tribe. 

Other acts, similar acts, do expressly address that 

question. Unlike the Rhode Island Act, they have 

similar extinguishment premises, and, yet, they -- they 

went on. I just -- the Rhode Island extinguishment 

provisions just don't have the meaning that -- that 

Petitioners say.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course if we just 

-- I'm sorry to jump back to the other provision, but if 

we disagree with your interpretation and Congress thinks 

we are wrong they can pass another one of these 15, 16 

provisions that they have that says this tribe is -- is 

recognized now.

 MS. MAYNARD: They could. If I could make 

one point in response to that? Congress has already 

acted on the presumption that the Secretary's reading is 

correct. In ILCA section 2019 there is an exception --

it's in the back of our brief on page 30 -- IGRA; sorry, 

IGRA -- page 35a that lands taken into trust as part of 

an initial reservation of any tribe acknowledged by the 

Secretary under the Federal acknowledgment process.

 In other words, Congress understands the 

Secretary to have the authority to take land in a trust 

for tribes that have been duly recognized under the 

Secretary's acknowledgment process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry to 

keep you there longer than you may want to be.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why else --

why would Congress then enact these 15 or 16 separate 

provisions if they think the -- if in this provision 

they think it's not necessary?

MS. MAYNARD: In the ones of which I'm aware 

I think just to make it clear beyond doubt that Section 

465 applies to bribes. Often the ones that I know of 

just have a list of statutes and say these are -- now 

apply to the -- to the tribe. In -- in other acts 

Congress has acted; in fact it's amended section 16 of 

the IRA in 1994. And there has been decades -- since 

1964 the Secretary has interpreted section 16 to apply 

to any recognized Indian tribe; and Congress amended it 

to add authority -- (f) and (g) -- instruct the 

Secretary to treat all recognized tribes the same.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Let me start with Justice Kennedy's 

question, and I think one other justice asked about 

other canon of construction, specifically with respect 

to sovereignty of States. This Court said in Vermont 

Agency in 2000 if Congress is to alter the 

constitutional balance between States and the Federal 

government, it must make its intention to do so 

unmistakably clear; and Justice Kennedy, I think you 

asked that question in the context of the relationship

between States and Indian tribes, and I would refer the 

Court to Seminole Tribe, in which the Court said the 

Congress must unequivocally express its intent to 

abrogate States' immunity.

 As the Chief Justice was pointing out, this 

is a very broad grant of authority, if it is what the 

government says it is. The Secretary can take property 

from the State, particularly a small State like Rhode 

Island, but it would be the same anywhere, and strip the 

State of jurisdiction and give jurisdiction to a dual 

sovereign operating within that State. We submit that 

the legislative history, the legislative language, the 

legislative purpose, the contemporary construction of 

the statute by the author of this statute, and 

everything stands for the proposition that there was 

some limitation intended here. I think the Government 

overlooks the fact and it somewhat misstates it by 

saying land may be taken for tribes. I've heard that 

several times not just in the brief but during oral 

argument.

 Section 5 which is the grant of authority 

says the Secretary is authorized to take land for the 

purposes of providing land for Indians and then section 

19 defines the term Indians.

 Now it may -- once it decides that it may

take title it may take land for Indians, it can then 

vest the title in -- as it says at the end of section 

5 -- in individual Indians, individual Indians or 

tribes. But it takes lands for Indians; they have to be 

Indians or land cannot be taken.

 The other canons of construction, besides 

the ones that must recognize State sovereignty, is that 

words must be given their ordinary meaning absent a 

contrary context. Words are not to be considered to be 

superfluous. There are several instances of efforts to 

repeal by implication in the Government's brief; and I 

could go on and on. There are several violations of 

various canons of construction.

 The colloquy is clear when it's put in 

context. It's exactly what I think you were getting at, 

Justice Breyer. There is a difference between you know, 

Indians under jurisdiction, which is what 

Mr. Commissioner Collier meant, and Indians that may 

have had some connection with the Federal Government. 

That whole colloquy is explained quite clearly in the --

in the document the Government discovered in August; and 

it's dated 1980; it's a memorandum by the assistant 

solicitor, and I explains -- it explains the context.

 Section -- the tribe was not -- this 

particular tribe I submit -- and we would describe this,

this question came up in a couple of the questions, was 

this tribe under Federal jurisdiction and should the 

case be remanded. I know of nothing that suggests that 

it was under Federal jurisdiction. I invite the Court 

to look at page 7 of our brief. The tribe was under 

State jurisdiction, under State control and there is a 

reference to that in an explanation in the joint 

appendix at pages 21a and 23a. I don't have time to 

elaborate on that, but that is answered there.

 U.S. versus --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did it get to be 

recognized? I thought the recognition reflects that 

it's had a history going way, way back?

 MR. OLSON: It had -- the -- the group of 

Indians called the Narragansetts, yes, have history that 

does go way back; but the are relationship with the 

Federal Government was what was being considered where 

-- the Indian Reorganization Act is -- and that 

relationship did not exist at that time. U.S. v John, 

the bracketed phrase doesn't mean that that phrase was 

unambiguous. The Court clearly understood that it meant 

1934, the same as Commissioner Collier meant, and the 

same as the statute indicated. It doesn't show that it 

was ambiguous. The Court was speaking in 1978, so it 

was quite natural -- instead of using the word "now" to

question of Indian blood which the Court finally got to 

in U.S. v John to -- because otherwise we wouldn't have 

needed to get to that question, if it had been otherwise 

answered as -- with respect to the meaning of section 

19.
