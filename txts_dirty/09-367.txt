CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v. 

United States. 

Ms. Karlan. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. KARLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes 

restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence 

for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a 

district court can meet its responsibilities. 

First, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes 

district courts to impose restitution when sentencing a 

defendant; that is, at the same time that they impose 

terms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like. 

Second, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final 

determination of the amount of restitution to occur 

during a period not to exceed 90 days. 

Once those periods and the general deadlines 

for correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a 

court's judgment is final, even if it fails to order 

restitution. In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution

Act is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions, 

and as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v. 

United States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory 

sentence, that error can be corrected only by following 

what this Court called the dispositive direction 

regarding sentencing errors. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Is your 

argument that if the district court -- for whatever 

reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the 

day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has 

to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can 

render a judgment --

MS. KARLAN: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that it's now barred 

from entering that judgment? 

MS. KARLAN: No. If I understand your 

question correctly, the district court has imposed 

sentence on day one announcing imprisonment. Any time 

during the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date 

and make final determination of the restitution amount. 

Once that 90-day period has run -- in this case, on 

October 28th, because the sentencing occurred on 

July 30th -- the district court loses the authority to 

impose restitution. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the sentence is not

final until then? 

MS. KARLAN: That's our position. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and what if -- what 

if the court does set a date for additional sentencing? 

Then it's not final until then, right? 

MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. It would 

be that once a court has started the sentencing process, 

it has 90 days within which to complete that process, if 

it announces at the initial sentencing that it intends 

to hold open the sentence for final determination of 

restitution. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm not sure I 

understood your response to my question. It must impose 

that restitution order, complete all its proceedings 

within the 90-day period? 

MS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it can't hold a 

hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day? 

MS. KARLAN: No, it cannot do that. And if 

it were to do that in a case where restitution were 

mandatory, the sentence would become final, the 

government would file an appeal, and that appeal would 

certainly succeed, because it's plain error not to have 

to imposed the restitution. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that if the

court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days, 

during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal? 

MS. KARLAN: If the court has announced at 

the initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then 

it cannot. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that dramatically 

contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled 

for a long time? There's a very short period of time 

for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal 

case, and you’re saying that that is dramatically 

extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later 

on or by the fact that the restitution order will be 

entered later? 

MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Alito. What I'm 

saying is that a defendant can only appeal from a final 

sentence, and until the restitutionary term is imposed 

within the time period allowed by the MVRA, there is not 

a final sentence. Then he has from the time that 

restitution is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I understand that. But 

you’re saying the defendant is -- the defendant is 

incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to 

prison. The defendant wants to take a quick appeal. 

The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal. And 

you’re saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days

before you can file your notice of appeal? 

MS. KARLAN: I believe that's correct, 

because he has to have a final judgment before he can 

appeal. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what do you 

do about the further provision that at any time later, 

if the government -- or the victim finds additional 

basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it, 

within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the 

court and ask for restitution? What does that do? 

Does that --

MS. KARLAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, doesn't that 

necessarily mean that there are indeed two final 

judgments? That -- that one has to be -- has to go up 

on its own, doesn't it? 

MS. KARLAN: That's correct, but section 

3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution 

amount constitutes a final judgment, even though there 

can be amendment after it's been entered. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? 

MS. KARLAN: In our brief, it's on page --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Oh -- “a sentence that 

imposes an order” --

MS. KARLAN: It's on page --

MS. KARLAN: Yes, petition appendix 60a. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Got you. 

MS. KARLAN: So that's why that has to be in 

there, because otherwise the defendant really would be 

in the position that Justice Alito --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any circuit 

court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is 

timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has 

not been entered at the initial sentencing? 

MS. KARLAN: Not in precisely that way. 

There are a couple of cases that are -- that kind of 

circle around that. 

So for example, Kapelushnik, which we cite 

in our petition for certiorari and in our brief as the 

wisest way of thinking about this, held that once the 

90 days has lapsed, the judgment is final by operation 

of law. 

There’s an opinion by Judge Posner in the 

Seventh Circuit that’s not on restitution but on a 

related issue, which says that if you have several 

components to the sentence, until that last component is 

entered, the time for filing an appeal under F.R.A.P. 4 

does not begin to run. And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In this -- when the 

judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you 

object to that? 

MS. KARLAN: We were not required to do so, 

so we did not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why not? It 

seems that that's when the violation occurred. The 

statute said the court shall set a date if they’re not 

ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do 

that. 

MS. KARLAN: Well, that's correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he 

has to set the date. The statute simply says the date 

has to be set so that final restitution will occur 

during the period -- and here I quote again from the 

statute -- "not to exceed 90 days." So he can set that 

date once he gets the information from --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it 

says -- maybe I am misreading it. It says the court --

this is at sentencing. When sentencing -- you look at 

the previous provision -- what is it? 3663A(a)(1) --

MS. KARLAN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- talks about what 

you do when sentencing it. 

MS. KARLAN: Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the statute 

says, “the court shall set a date for the final 

determination” … “not to exceed 90 days.” And he didn't. 

MS. KARLAN: That's correct, he did not set 

it. But the statute -- I'm now looking at petition 

appendix 55a, which is where section 3664(d)(5) of the 

Act is set out. It says, "The court shall set a date 

for the final determination of the victim's losses, not 

to exceed 90 days after sentencing." 

The 90 days modifies the final 

determination. It doesn't modify the setting of the 

date. So within that 90-day period, I think 

that what was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I think that's 

right. I -- I agree with you that. 

MS. KARLAN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 

final determination -- the date for the -- the final 

determination can't exceed 90 days --

MS. KARLAN: Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but that doesn't 

mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date 

can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that. 

MS. KARLAN: No, I think it would be very 

unwise for a district court to do that, but the court

can't really set the date until it receives the 

information that it hopes to receive from the probation 

office or from the victim. So that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It can say 90 days. It 

can say 90 days. 

MS. KARLAN: It -- it could, yes. Or it 

could say, as the district court did here, I'm going to 

hold open the date. But it can only hold open that date 

until the point at which it actually imposes the 

restitution, within the 90 days. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a -- this is, in 

one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it 

not? Because it's true that this defendant, from the 

probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what 

restitution was going to be recommended. 

MS. KARLAN: Yes. He knew within the 

90 days what the government's claim was going to be, but 

the court did not hold the hearing and did not impose 

the judgment. And so the August 8th judgment became 

final by operation of law on October 28th, because that 

was 90 days after the July 30th sentencing. 

At that point, the government could have 

filed an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they 

would have won. As it was --

JUSTICE ALITO: How is your position -- how 

is your position consistent with the thrust of the 

victims’ rights legislation that Congress has enacted in 

recent years, including the statute that’s before us 

here? 

Now, in this case, the victim -- the 

victim's medical bills were paid by the United States. 

But that isn't always going to be the case, and 

sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost 

income. So you have the victim, like the victim here, 

who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a 

substantial amount of future income as a result, and you 

say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad 

for the victim. The victim gets nothing because the 

judge waited too long. 

MS. KARLAN: No, I don't --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that’s what 

Congress had in mind? 

MS. KARLAN: I don't say that, and I don't 

think that's what Congress had in mind. First, what 

Congress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck 

in this statute, which was to give victims the right to 

receive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as 

long as it was done within 90 days of sentencing. 

Second, the government can appeal if a court

doesn't follow the rules. 

Third --

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't 

the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that 

up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not 

sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests 

of victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial 

thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure 

they knew about court proceedings, and so forth. 

And you’re saying, well, if the court makes 

a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its 

responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who 

gets victimized again. 

MS. KARLAN: No, that's not what I'm saying. 

What I'm saying is Congress struck a balance. They 

wanted to give restitution to victims. They also wanted 

final sentencing for defendants. Congress struck that 

balance by giving a 90-day extension. It didn't provide --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you’re not 

really -- you’re not really answering Justice Alito's 

question. He says he understands that, as I understand 

the question. We understand that argument. 

But it doesn't address the fact that the net 

result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and 

(b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the

Victims Act. 

MS. KARLAN: It’s --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you, it seems to me, 

have to say: So be it; the technical rule prevails. 

That's too bad. 

I mean, that's your argument, it seems 

to me. 

MS. KARLAN: No, my argument is Congress 

struck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the same thing 

would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law 

which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so 

that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he 

escapes any -- any criminal punishment. It happens all 

the time. The judge makes a mistake; society pays for 

it. 

MS. KARLAN: That's correct, and Congress 

here has said 90 days. And they meant it. If they had 

meant to say, at any time, a victim can receive 

restitution, they would have said that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But Congress says -- to 

paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the 

Department of Transportation shall enact a rule 

governing tire safety within 9 months from the 

effective date of this legislation. And the Department

of Transportation fails to do that. It doesn't 

promulgate its law for 18 months. Is that law invalid? 

The rule? 

MS. KARLAN: No, generally, under this --

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it isn't. 

MS. KARLAN: Because that’s --

JUSTICE BREYER: So how is this different? 

MS. KARLAN: Well, this is a criminal 

sentencing statute which is different than a civil 

agency action. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that point. 

I'm just asking what’s a relevant difference? 

MS. KARLAN: That is the incredibly relevant 

difference, for the following reason --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 

MS. KARLAN: -- that finality in sentencing 

is important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even 

appeal his conviction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't he? 

MS. KARLAN: Because he --

JUSTICE BREYER: You just read us the 

provision. 

MS. KARLAN: It's not a final --

JUSTICE BREYER: The judge enters a -- an 

order, a final order. And that final judgment, as was

true here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet. He 

can appeal. Then what it says is when you get around to 

the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you’ll 

appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of 

the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice 

Scalia was referring to. That's a possible 

interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate 

Procedure. I don't see, you know, the appeals thing. I 

don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the 

language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of 

anything that’s contrary. 

MS. KARLAN: What’s contrary to that is 

that the Federal courts of appeals only have 

jurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal 

cases, on final judgment or under the collateral order. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. 

MS. KARLAN: This is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's a final judgment, and 

because there is another provision that says an order of 

restitution is itself a final judgment. 

MS. KARLAN: No. With all respect, 

Justice Breyer, there is no provision that says an order 

of restitution --

JUSTICE BREYER: You read it to us. I mean 

the one you read to us.

MS. KARLAN: No. That says --

JUSTICE BREYER: What? 

MS. KARLAN: -- that a sentence that 

includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment, 

even though that 60-day provision to which 

Justice Scalia pointed is on the books. 

But you can't have a final judgment in a 

criminal case that involves several different components 

of a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have 

actually been imposed. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't the --

MS. KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I believe, was 

referring to the 60-day provision. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, the same problem. 

MS. KARLAN: The 60-day provision is 

specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by 

section 3664(o) of the statute. The 90-day provision is 

not. So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps 

I could use a slightly different example, which is: 

Suppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a 

fine, a mandatory fine --

JUTICE BREYER: I see. 

MS. KARLAN: -- and a mandatory prison sentence. 

If you sentence him to the mandatory prison sentence and 

say I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no

final judgment. He cannot appeal that sentence. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't there a difference 

between those two situations? A fine is a criminal 

penalty. It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in 

the same of the sovereign. The fine goes to the 

sovereign. It's a traditional criminal penalty. 

Restitution is not a traditional criminal 

penalty. It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a 

civil case. It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a 

benefit for the victim. It is not something that inures 

to the benefit of the sovereign. 

And so why doesn't it make sense to view 

that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, 

just as the award of an attorney’s fees is a separate 

final appealable order in a civil case? 

MS. KARLAN: Well, because this judgment of 

restitution is not a civil judgment. It is part of the 

defendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is 

not like attorneys' fees, something that’s separate. 

As we point out in our reply brief, in order 

to calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to 

calculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing 

provisions -- and I should note that section 3664(a) 

appears in Title 18 in the section under miscellaneous 

sentencing provisions, not civil provisions. All of

those things interact. And so you can't calculate one 

of those without knowing all of them. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, functionally, isn't 

it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a 

crime might have? Wasn't what Congress was trying to do 

was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the 

defendant and having his kind of civil restitution 

tacked onto the criminal proceeding? 

MS. KARLAN: That’s certainly Congress's 

purpose, but they did it within the context of 

sentencing. So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this 

really were a civil penalty, defendants would not be 

entitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the 

amount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would 

not apply. The dates for filing an appeal would be 

different. There would be a jurisdictional bar that 

doesn't exist in criminal cases. 

This Court said several times that 

restitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in 

Hughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly 

v. Robinson -- is a penal statute. Justice Sotomayor in 

her opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this 

is a penal statute. 

So there is no question here that this is a 

substitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a

civil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment. And 

Congress has said that you have to order it at 

sentencing or within 90 days, or else it is error that 

can be corrected through Rule 35 or by appeal, but not 

otherwise. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what -- what can the 

defendant do within that 90 days? He has to wait 

90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been 

given; is that right? 

MS. KARLAN: That's correct. There is not a 

final judgment in his case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's 3 months that --

that he has to sit on his hands. 

MS. KARLAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? 

MS. KARLAN: Well, the final judgment rule 

says that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is a court-made 

rule of what counts as a final judgment. 

MS. KARLAN: Right. And -- and --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there 

anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting 

that rule? I mean, you could have collateral orders. You 

could have all kinds of things. And doesn't it boil down 

to the same question?

I mean, I agree with you that if Congress 

wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do 

it, and you can't restitute thereafter. All right. 

That's one thing. But if they didn't, why didn't they 

equally intend the judgment without the restitution 

order to be a final judgment? 

MS. KARLAN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then later on, just as 

in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, 

then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different 

judgment. Is there -- what in the law prevents the --

that interpretation? 

MS. KARLAN: I think two things prevent that 

interpretation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. KARLAN: One is this Court's precedent, 

and let me talk about that. And two is a proper reading 

of section 3664(o). So I’ll turn first to the 

precedent and then to 3664(o). 

JUSTICE BREYER: So you have precedent. 

MS. KARLAN: So the precedent is, for 

example, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which 

is cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other 

places, that “a judgment or decision is final for purpose 

of appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the

parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to 

be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.” 

Until restitution has been determined, a 

case does not fit within Parr. Parr is, I believe, an 

interpretation of 1291, 28 U.S.C. 1291, which is the 

provision that gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can -- under 

your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to 

the point at which you have to set the restitution. The 

judge says: I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and 

I'm going to figure out the restitution. 

He looks, and the restitution turns out to 

be a lot more than he thought. So he says: Well, I'm 

only going to give you 2 years. Or it's less, and he 

says: I'm going to give you 4 years. 

Because the judgment is still open, he can 

do that? 

MS. KARLAN: I believe, Your Honor, that he 

can. And the reason for that is the sentencing statute 

itself -- 18 U.S.C. section 3553, I believe it is --

talks about how a court, in sentencing a defendant, is 

supposed to be considering all of these penalties and 

how they interact with one another. 

So if a defendant can make restitution to a 

victim by, for example, being put on community release

or probation rather than serving time in prison, a court 

can take that into account in setting the sentence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Must take it into account --

MS. KARLAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you read 3553 the way 

it's written. 

MS. KARLAN: Yes, I think they must take it 

into account. Now, whether -- how they’ll actually 

strike that balance is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there no -- is there 

no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make 

this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, 

I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can 

appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence. So 

this order is final, and 3 months later, I’ll take up 

the question of restitution when all the information is 

in. The court is prevented from doing that? 

MS. KARLAN: I’m unaware of any criminal 

rules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because 

in general, as I understand the way this Court's 

precedents have worked, there have been what might look 

like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they’ve 

always involved collateral issues. 

And the problem here, for the reason that 

Justice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the

amount of imprisonment are not collateral to one 

another; that is, they may interact. And a fine 

certainly isn't, because the statute itself says you 

can't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair 

restitution. So if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the judge -- but the 

judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that 

they need time for more information: I'm going to 

defer the whole sentencing. So, Defendant, you’ll have to 

wait 3 months to find out how much time you’re going to 

serve. That would be all right. You could use the 

90-day period to extend the time for imposing the 

sentence. 

Well, in effect, you’re saying the sentence 

isn't final, so she could change it any time within the 

90 days? 

MS. KARLAN: There's a slight complication 

there, but I think the answer to your question is yes; 

that is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing 

under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. 

Look, we’re not saying that you couldn't 

get restitution in a case like this. We’re simply 

saying that you have to follow the rules. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, what about 

that as a possible answer? If we accept -- the -- the judge,

of course, could say to the defendant: I'm not going to 

sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm 

not going to sentence you at all --

MS. KARLAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- for 100 days. 

MS. KARLAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And your remedy, then, 

might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a 

period? 

MS. KARLAN: It -- it might be. I --

JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and -- so why 

wouldn't that be similar here? If the judge is going to 

go after the 90 days, he’d have the power to do it, 

but it would be like a continuance, and he’d have to 

exercise that reasonably. 

MS. KARLAN: Because you have to follow the 

rules as laid down. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know. You’re 

interpreting it literally, and --

MS. KARLAN: Yes. Yes.

unreasonable continuance?

remainder --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one 

question? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I have a question going 

just to that. It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said 

-- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the 

sentencing court to consider the totality of the 

sentence it’s imposing, including the restitution, 

that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence 

before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to 

wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to 

impose the incarceration part of the sentence. No? 

MS. KARLAN: I think the way that the 

statute is written contemplates that the judge will do 

the regular sentencing at which he imposes these other 

terms, but may keep it open for 90 days. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

before you sit down? Are you aware -- maybe you cite 

them in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases 

in which the courts -- a court of appeals has 

dismissed an appeal because it was taken before the --

the civil remedy had been imposed? 

MS. KARLAN: I'm not aware of a case that 

does that directly under the Mandatory Victims 

Restitution Act.

Mr. Heytens. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. HEYTENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

To begin by addressing the question just 

raised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we 

are not aware of any cases that directly confront this 

finality question. There are, however, at least four 

cases in the courts of appeals where one of two things 

happened: Either the defendant took an appeal from the 

original term of his imprisonment, then later took an 

appeal from the order of restitution and the appeals 

were consolidated. That happened, among other things, 

in the Cheal case, which is the First Circuit decision 

cited in our brief. There are at least two other 

circuit court cases that do that as well. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it within the 90 days? 

MR. HEYTENS: No. It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The restitution sentence 

was after the 90 days? 

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, 

Justice Scalia. Now --

that case, or any of those four cases, did they discuss 

the problem of whether there was -- both appeals were 

proper? 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I’m not 

aware of any case that squarely --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They just went ahead and 

consolidated? 

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, Justice 

Stevens. I'm not aware of any case that directly 

confronts this issue. Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your view of 

things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying 

conviction was still in the appeal process, because 

there is no statute of limitations under your reading. 

A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years 

later and say: I'm entitled to restitution. 

MR. HEYTENS: The statute --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And absent prejudice to 

the defendant, that would be okay? 

MR. HEYTENS: Absent prejudice or some sort 

of double jeopardy problem, that's correct. The 

statute, by its terms, says as long as the victim comes 

forward within 60 days of the discovery of his losses, 

(d)(5) expressly says that the victim can do that. So I 

think this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, that's 

60 days after the restitution order has been issued. Am 

I --

MR. HEYTENS: I believe that's incorrect, 

Your Honor. The provision that we’re referring to, 

subsection (d)(5), is reproduced on page 6A of the 

appendix to the government's brief. It's the, I 

believe, second sentence of (d)(5) that we’re 

discussing right now that states: "If the victim 

subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall 

have 60 days after the discovery of those losses in 

which to petition the court for an amended restitution 

order." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That 60 days says after 

there has been an -- a restitution order. I'm positing 

the situation where the victim comes 10 years later. 

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That says there’s no 

restitution order. It's the initial action. And 

you’re saying that's okay? It's an endless statute? 

MR. HEYTENS: It is -- it is certainly not 

okay, Your Honor. Congress has directed that this 

determination must be made and that it must be made 

within 90 days. And Federal district courts are 

required to comply with that obligation.

But what Congress has not done is to specify 

a consequence that occurs in the situation where the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it -- it's sort 

of a ridiculous consequence that 5 years later, and 

the judge who tried the original case is dead. 

I think it's bad enough to have the issue of 

whether this victim suffered $100,000 damages 

decided by the judge, if that's what you’re going to be 

sentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the 

judge who tried the case. And under your proposal, it 

can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just 

pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has 

been deceased. That doesn't seem to me to make any 

sense at all. 

MR. HEYTENS: Your Honor, I don't think it 

is our proposal. Congress has not specified -- Congress 

has certainly required this to be done within 90 days. 

That meant Congress wanted it to be done within 90 days. 

But Congress has not specified a consequence for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 

consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts 

make errors, which is to appeal.

comply with a mandatory time limitation for doing 

something that the court is required to do, the remedy 

is -- unless Congress provides otherwise, such as it 

does in the Speedy Trial Act, the remedy is not a loss 

of the power on the part of the court to act. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the statute 

establish time limits for filing an appeal? 

MR. HEYTENS: The statute does, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it state a 

remedy for it? I don't think so. But if you don't 

comply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't 

file the appeal. 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Same thing here. 

MR. HEYTENS: There’s a critical difference 

between a statute of limitations for filing a notice of 

appeal and what’s happening here that’s illustrated by 

the example given by Judge Gorsuch in his opinion for 

the courts of appeals. 

There can be two kinds of time limits. The 

first kind can say, if you want to do something -- you’re 

not required to do it -- but if you want to do it, 

you have to do it within a certain time. That's what a 

statute of limitations is. 

The second kind of time limit is to say you

must do something and you must do it within a second --

within a certain amount of time. This case is the 

second category, just as the statute at issue in 

Montalvo-Murillo was in the second category of cases, and 

just as --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that that was a 

bail question, where there's not issues of finality at 

play, and bail is a question that repeats itself 

throughout the proceedings. Defendants are denied bail 

and then make a different showing of other 

resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out. 

And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in. 

That's it. There are no finality questions there. 

What do you do in this situation when you’re 

dealing with a criminal sentence where there are 

finality rules? 

And I'm going to tie that back to my starting 

point, which is I’m looking in your brief for the 

precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution 

as not part of the final judgment in this criminal 

action. What -- what other examples do we have in the 

criminal context? 

MR. HEYTENS: We cited the things we cite in 

our brief. There is, however, also a statute; I 

apologize to the Court, it is not cited in our brief,

but it is section 18 U.S.C. section 3582(b). That 

provision is captioned Imposition of a Sentence of 

Imprisonment. Subsection (b) -- subsection (b) of that 

provision says Effect of Finality of the Judgment. It 

then says, “Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence of 

imprisonment can subsequently be” modified or altered in 

certain ways, and then this is the critical language: "a 

judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence 

constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes." 

In this case there was a judgment of 

conviction. It was entered on July 3, 2007. And that 

judgment of conviction imposed a sentence of 

imprisonment on Mr. Dolan. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, now suppose -- now 

we’re getting to exactly the point where I thought your 

co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I 

wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what 

happens now in -- on day -- we’re finished the 

trial. The sentencing is over. They got the 

presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he 

entered a judgment but didn't say anything about 

restitution, because he says: I’d like to give you a 

chance to appeal this. And I'm not going to deal with 

restitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all 

within the 90 days.

Can the defendant appeal that piece of 

paper? 

MR. HEYTENS: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is because of 

this provision? 

MR. HEYTENS: We think because of that 

provision and because of general principles of law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Whoa, whoa. What about 

what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted, 

forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that 

a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final 

judgment until all the parts that are there, and the 

restitution is part of it. And so until it's final, you 

can't appeal it. That's what -- that's what the case 

Parr, which it quoted. What is -- what is your response 

to that? 

MR. HEYTENS: That certainly establishes the 

general rule that this Court has said repeatedly --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. HEYTENS: -- that the jurisdiction of the 

Federal courts is established by Congress.

MR. HEYTENS: The defendant in our view is 

required to appeal --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Must? 

MR. HEYTENS: Once the district court enters 

a judgment that imposes a sentence of imprisonment, if 

the defendant wishes to appeal that sentence of 

imprisonment he has 14 days to do so following the entry 

of the judgment, yes, which is the normal rule in 

Federal criminal cases. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he misses --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though -- even though 

he says the restitution shall be held in abeyance 

pending receipt of information? 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, to the extent that he 

has an objection to the district court's -- it depends 

on the precise circumstances of the case, Justice 

Kennedy. To the extent what he says is, I think the 

district court needs to, when it imposes the sentence of 

restitution, take into account the other aspects of the 

sentence, at that time the issues become interrelated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me see if I understand 

this. He has 14 days to appeal that. And if he doesn't 

do that, then later within the 90 days or even after the 

90 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can --

he can appeal that sentence of restitution, right?

MR. HEYTENS: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: On the same grounds on 

which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of 

imprisonment, right? 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, it -- to the extent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if it's an error in 

the trial, he claims: I was innocent. 

MR. HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

MR. HEYTENS: To the -- his time for 

appealing from the judgment of conviction runs from the 

entry of the judgment of conviction, which is 

contemporaneous with the imposition of the sentence of 

imprisonment. If he wants to appeal that, he needs to do 

that like any other --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suppose it's no -- no 

imprisonment; it's supervised release. Now what 

happens? 

MR. HEYTENS: If it’s -- if the judge imposes a 

sentence of supervised release, I am not aware if there 

is a specific statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean, what's 

bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you’re 

quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I 

hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is

inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are 

very important. 

So unless I have in my own mind how -- how 

this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide 

this case. I don't want to say something in here that’s 

going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a 

criminal case. 

Now, what you’ve told me is I'm supposed to say 

that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment, 

he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release, 

he doesn't, or I'm not sure. 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, first and 

foremost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about 

any of these issues. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? 

MR. HEYTENS: For one very simple reason: 

The only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to 

appeal at any point is the order of restitution. He 

never attempted to appeal from his guilty plea. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if -- but I have 

to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have 

to respond to the argument of the other side, which is 

that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended 

this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you 

don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal. Now,

explain to me why that isn't so. 

MR. HEYTENS: A couple of reasons, Your 

Honor: First of all, I think it's actually one of the 

strongest arguments against their position, because it 

creates the unlikely scenario where it will be 

routinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these 

determinations to be made up to 90 days after the 

imposition of sentence. So their rule would create the 

situation where it would be completely consistent with 

Congress's intent to routinely create a situation where 

a Federal criminal defendant has to wait 3 months after 

sentencing until he can appeal. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which is just what you say 

he has to do if the sentence is supervised release. 

MR. HEYTENS: What I'm saying, Justice 

Breyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that 

governs imprisonment. I believe there is a similar 

statute that governs a sentence of probation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What was that statute on 

imprisonment? 

MR. HEYTENS: 18 U.S.C. 3582(b), Justice 

Scalia. I know there is a statute that governs that. 

We also know there is a statute governing a term of 

restitution itself. That's the provision cited, 3664(o), 

which is reproduced at 11a of the appendix to our

brief --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I've got it. 

MR. HEYTENS: -- which is the rules 

governing finality with regard to an order imposing 

restitution. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, one problem 

with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that 

that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the 

defendant misses that deadline, no appeal. And we’re 

leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, 

within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction 

and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the 

restitution. 

The defendant has to know at that point, 

must I appeal that first judgment? Because if I don't, 

I'll never be able to appeal it. 

But on your reading, the defendant can't 

wait. When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant 

must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the 

sentence. 

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. In our view, the defendant -- when 

the judgment of conviction was imposed on this case, 

which imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Mr. Dolan, 

the time for appealing the judgment of conviction and

the term of imprisonment began to run. 

If I could go back to Justice Breyer's 

question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that would 

mean even if the judge says, I’m going to impose the 

restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time 

clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time 

the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when 

restitution is --

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. He files a 

notice of appeal when the judgment of conviction 

is entered, and then 10 days later he can file a second 

notice of appeal, and courts of appeal can consolidate 

that case in the ordinary course. 

You don't -- to answer Justice Breyer's very 

specific question about the supervised released, I have 

been advised that a district court cannot impose a term 

of supervised release unless it also imposes a sentence 

of imprisonment. So that particular hypothetical that 

Justice Breyer raised wouldn't arise. The court 

can't just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, let's --

let's suppose there’s no 3664(d)(5), and we’re back to 

just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant, 

the court shall order restitution. What if the

judge doesn't -- is that mandatory? It has to be when 

sentencing the defendant? 

MR. HEYTENS: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

I think what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think even 

without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say: I know it says 

when I'm sentencing I’ve got to order restitution. 

But 2 months later, he can do it? 

MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, let me 

amend my answer slightly. He -- the judge is required 

to do it when sentencing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but nothing 

happens if he doesn't. Is that --

MR. HEYTENS: Well, the question then 

becomes one of a remedy. The court is required to do it, 

and the question becomes what is the remedy when the 

court does not. And what the Court said in 

Montalvo-Murillo is that we presume that Federal 

district courts will comply with the law, and that it is 

inappropriate in situations where Congress doesn't 

specify a remedy for courts to impose their own remedy. 

That was exactly the situation in Montalvo-Murillo. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't we go back to my 

hypothetical --

MR. HEYTENS: Sure.

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and just substitute the 

word "fine" for "supervised release." 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I’m -- I’m fairly 

certain there is a statute that addresses the finality 

when it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a 

fine, which is similar to the statute that addresses 

finality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only 

a term of imprisonment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not an 

expert in this area, as you can see. And -- and I need 

to have a place to go to look so that I can see that 

these things, in your view, all work out, and you’re 

not creating some odd appellate system. Do you have any 

suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and 

look at that would help me? 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, to address 

your very specific fine question, there is in fact a 

statute that addresses that as well. That is 18 U.S.C. 

3572(c). It's structured very similarly to the -- the 

section regarding judgments of imprisonment that I 

quoted to the Court earlier, and Congress has addressed 

that. It says: "Notwithstanding the fact that a 

sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be altered in 

various respects, a judgment that includes such a 

sentence is a final judgment for all other" --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can the (o) -- you 

remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)? 

MR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Can that be 

read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of 

restitution as well as an amended judgment? 

MR. HEYTENS: Absolutely, Justice Breyer. 

That's exactly what the First Circuit said in the Cheal 

case, which is cited in our brief. The First Circuit in 

that case addressed an initial judgment that said, 

similarly, somewhat, to the judgment in this one -- the 

original judgment, if you recall, in this case says the 

Mandatory Victims Restitution Act is applicable; 

however, the court does not have sufficient information 

to calculate restitution at this time. What the First 

Circuit reasoned in Cheal is that that can be 

interpreted as a judgment imposing a restitution 

obligation, which is thus final under subsection (o). 

If you conclude that, you don't need to look at any 

other statute to resolve --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though there’s no 

amount given? 

MR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Scalia. Because 

the one thing we know for certain is that even if it had 

stated an amount, the fact that the amount can be amended

later doesn't deprive the judgment of finality. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Simply because when you 

state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that 

leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an 

amount? Do you do the same thing for imprisonment? You 

say: I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how 

many years, but I'm going to send you to prison. Is 

that appealable right away? 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Scalia, the 

district court is not permitted to do any of this. 

Congress has required the district court to set the 

amount --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but 

district courts don't always do what they are supposed 

to. And it seems to me a very strange result that 

you're --

MR. HEYTENS: It's true that, regrettably, 

district courts sometimes don't do what they are 

supposed to. What this Court has said, most notably in 

Montalvo-Murillo, is that we should assume that they 

will, and that it’s inappropriate for courts to craft 

legal rules that are based on the presumption that they 

are going to violate their legal obligations.

hypothetical? Supposing the defendant fails to appeal 

when he's sentenced, and then 90 days later, they impose 

a restitution order and he appeals from that. May he 

raise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in 

the trial in that appeal? 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, just to make 

sure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand 

the hypothetical -- it's that the district court 

sentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then 

90 days later imposes an order of restitution? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. 

MR. HEYTENS: Okay. In that situation, no. 

It is the government's view that he has -- the time for 

appealing the judgment of conviction and the sentence of 

imprisonment has run. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But he -- he can appeal 

just the restitution order. 

MR. HEYTENS: Just the restitution order, in 

that situation, yes. Now, if he has appealed them both, 

they can be consolidated, which has been done in several 

cases in the courts --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that.

appeals.

to the fact that in this case the judge said: I shall 

order restitution? It's the same as if he said nothing 

at all about restitution, so far as you are concerned? 

MR. HEYTENS: We think this makes it an 

easier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no 

conceivable prejudice to Mr. Dolan as a result of the 

delay in this case. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this 

question: If we conclude there’s a hole in the statute 

that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that 

Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if 

we rule against you? It's pretty clear, the answer to 

that, isn't it? 

MR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Stevens. I think 

Montalvo-Murillo supplies the answer to that. 

Montalvo-Murillo says, where Congress does not supply a 

remedy for violation of a statutory time obligation, it 

is inappropriate for courts to invent their own in order 

to coerce district courts into complying --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So this then becomes a 

goal, not a time line -- a deadline? 

MR. HEYTENS: I think -- at some point, it 

becomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg. 

I think it is a deadline. I think Congress intended for 

district courts to do this. I think district courts who

have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws 

of the United States are required to do it. 

The question is: What is the remedy in the 

rare, regrettable situation where they do not do it? And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a -- a defendant 

who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, 

that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then 

finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a 

million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, 

right? 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, that would be -- yes. 

That would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice. Now, what I 

would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court 

doesn't need to resolve any of this. But, second of all, 

one of the reasons is there is another way the Court 

could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the 

Court took in its decision in Corey v. United States, 

which is cited in the blue brief. 

Now, Corey involved a statute. It's 

presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines. 

It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the 

sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more 

information to decide how long to send the defendant to 

jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion 

of the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to

6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were 

PSRs; and then make a determination then. 

The Court in Corey faced the question: When 

the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to 

give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in 

6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when 

does the defendant have to appeal? That was the 

question before the Court in Corey. 

What the Court said in Corey is that the 

defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed 

to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time 

the district court imposes the final sentence. The 

reason the Court said that -- this is the language 

that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it 

would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal 

defendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in 

order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of 

conviction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Look, you straightened me 

out, from your point of view. But now you've mixed me 

up again.

Justice Breyer.

that the defendant is just out of luck. But, previously, 

you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you 

were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is 

immediately appealable and must be appealed within 

14 days because of that 3582. 

MR. HEYTENS: That's our --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then you said (o) 

applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an 

order of restitution is a final judgment. So if (o) 

applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, 

that restitution is made final and embodied in another 

judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be 

appealed. 

So if you’re right about (o) applying, then 

the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of 

luck. Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to 

be on your side in this question. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. HEYTENS: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: I’ve got to figure this 

out. 

MR. HEYTENS: I apologize, Justice Breyer. 

The government's position is that at the time the 

judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment 

are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has

to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal. Later, when 

the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when 

he appeals that. 

What I was suggesting is that, to the extent 

the Court has any concern about that, the alternative 

way of resolving this issue would be the same way the 

Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say 

that the defendant could appeal at either time. 

Now, we think that would be incorrect, but 

it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave 

the issue open in order to resolve this case. Because 

as I said before, this defendant never attempted to 

appeal his judgment of conviction or his original term 

of imprisonment. So it's not, in this case, necessary 

to decide what exactly would have happened had he 

attempted to do so. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: This criminal judgment of 

restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the 

victim suffered so much money? 

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does he find that beyond a 

reasonable doubt? 

MR. HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia. The 

burden --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just more likely than not? 

MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's a criminal --

it's a criminal judgment? 

MR. HEYTENS: That's what Congress has 

provided. And in this Court's decision in Oregon v. 

Ice, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that 

restitution determinations are a category of 

determinations that have been historically made by the 

court, not by the jury. And regardless of what anyone 

thinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly 

not within the question presented. It has not been 

raised at any point by the Petitioner in this case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that an answer to 

the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and 

-- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal 

defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is 

preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil 

-- civil liability, and they take their chances. 

But that -- that points up a difference 

between this case and Montalvo-Murillo. In this case, 

finality is central to the system, and that wasn't --

that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo. 

MR. HEYTENS: That's certainly correct, 

Justice Kennedy. That was by its terms a bail

determination, which by its nature is not a final 

determination in the sense that a criminal statute is, 

though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that 

that would make any difference. And I would say that 

some of the other cases in this same line of cases, 

including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did 

raise finality concerns. There was a very strong 

finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case. There 

were finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress 

had said this needs to be done, and once it’s done, it 

needs to be done. And so, there are -- some of the 

cases in this same line have also involved finality, 

admittedly not in the criminal context. 

But I think the -- the most important thing 

that the Court said in -- the two most important things 

that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant 

here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a 

remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in 

this case -- it’s inappropriate for courts to impose 

their own. 

The second thing that the Court said is that 

we should presume that Federal district courts are going 

to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make 

rules based on the assumption that they won't. 

And third is that when courts do impose

remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where 

there’s a profound lack of fit between the violation that 

occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking 

them to impose. 

Let me give you an example on that. The 

general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the 

Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence 

without unnecessary delay. Now, say the district court 

violates that obligation. It takes too long to impose a 

sentence. I think it would be extraordinary to suggest 

that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay 

in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should 

get off scot-free. 

The remedy is to tell the district court you 

have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the 

sentence forthwith. 

The same thing is true here. Congress has 

told the district court you need to impose restitution 

in every case where the defendant is convicted of a 

crime of violence. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument is 

“not to exceed 90 days” means the same thing as “without 

undue delay”? 

MR. HEYTENS: We don't think it means the 

same thing, Mr. Chief Justice. What we think it means

is the violation should have the same consequences. The 

violation is to say if you don't do what you are 

supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately. The 

remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore. 

If there are no further questions, the 

government urges that the judgment of the court below be 

affirmed. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. KARLAN: I have three points -- excuse 

me -- to make: The first goes to what the remedy is 

here and what the error is here. The error here 

occurred when the district court did not impose 

restitution. The government should have filed a timely 

appeal under Rule 4. They had 30 days to do so. The 

government did not appeal the failure to make 

restitution. 

That error is not before this Court now. 

What’s before this Court is a second judgment. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They couldn't do that 

until the end of the 90 days. If the judge has 90 days 

to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument. 

MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Sotomayor, because

had the -- had the government on October 28 looked and 

said, there’s no restitution order in this case, they 

could have filed an appeal then under Rule 4, and they 

would have won. They didn't do so. 

Second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that’s rather 

theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge 

surely would have acted before he could process an 

appeal. 

MS. KARLAN: Well, he lacks actually the --

the power to do that. Once the appeal is taken, he 

can't do that. And may I just say that here I think the 

critical rule to understand is one sentence, one appeal. 

So turning first --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not true. I 

don't know if you’ve had time to look at 3582 or 35 --

MS. KARLAN: Yes, I have. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those do appear to say 

that once there’s a term of imprisonment, that that 

constitutes a final judgment. 

MS. KARLAN: But they do so in the context 

of Section 3553(a), which is cited on page 6 of the 

yellow brief, which says “the court shall impose a 

sentence.” 

Now, the different components can each be

added together. But there is one sentence in a criminal 

case on a particular charge, and that sentence can 

include restitution, it can include a fine, it can 

include imprisonment. That doesn't make it three 

sentences. And only when all of those have been imposed 

is there a final judgment. Until then, the judgment --

JUSTICE ALITO: It can also include 

forfeiture. What’s -- what is the rule for forfeiture? 

MS. KARLAN: I don't know the rule for 

forfeiture. I do know the rule for all of the other criminal 

proceedings, which is 3582(b), to which the government 

refers; 3572(c) for fines; 3562(b) for community 

release; and 3664(o) for restitution. All of those have 

to make one sentence, and then there is one appeal. 

Under our rule, which I think comports with 

the plain language of the statute, we know when an 

appeal takes place, and there will be one appeal. Under 

the government's rule --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference -- in 

response to the last argument that your opponent made, 

what is the difference between the provision here and 

Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must 

impose sentence without unnecessary delay? 

MS. KARLAN: There, the question is, did it 

do it without unnecessary delay? Here the question is,

did it do it within 90 days? When it didn't, the 

government had to appeal. The government did not do 

that. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So if the -- I didn't 

understand the answer. If the sentence is not imposed 

without unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there 

can be no sentence? 

MS. KARLAN: No. This Court has never 

decided what the rule means there. But this is a 

statute. And if I could turn to the question of what 

the statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, tell me 

what the government appeal would consist of. The 90 days 

has expired --

MS. KARLAN: And the judgment of August 8th 

became final. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you tell 

me the court -- the court has no ability to impose 

restitution after 90 days. 

MS. KARLAN: That’s right. The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the use of appealing? 

MS. KARLAN: Because on appeal you say the 

court erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the appellate court says 

too bad --

MS. KARLAN: No --

JUSTICE SCALIA -- 90 days are up. 

MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. In the 

same way that if a court failed to impose a mandatory minimum 

sentence and there was a final judgment, the government 

could appeal. And the fact that the initial sentence 

didn't do that doesn't mean anything at that point. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no time limit on 

the mandatory minimum. 

MS. KARLAN: But the -- but -- but, Your 

Honor, if the government appeals an illegal sentence, 

that sentence can be corrected and the new mandate from 

the court of appeals saying you erred in not imposing 

mandatory restitution starts the 90-day clock again. 

Now, this is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Could you go back to --

could you go back to Justice Alito's question, 

because --

MS. KARLAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that was exactly the 

same thing. I think what he may be saying, though, is 

it makes more sense to read these statutes as saying 

imprisonment or community -- or community service, a 

form of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know 

about forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final

judgments, because then you don't have to wait for 

90 days. 

MS. KARLAN: No. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And if you read it that 

way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to 

worry about the restitution appeal because of (o). 

Now, what blocks the reading -- what blocks 

the reading I just gave? 

MS. KARLAN: The principle that there must 

be one sentence that determines each of the punishments 

for a particular crime.
