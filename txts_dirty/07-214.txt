 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

today in Case 07-214, Allison Engine Company versus 

United States ex rel. Sanders and Thacker.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The False Claims Act addresses and redresses 

fraud on the government, not on every recipient of 

government funds. The liability-imposing provisions of 

the False Claims Act refer ten times in a single 

sentence to a submission to the government, getting a 

claim paid or approved by the government, or defrauding 

the government. Liability is to the government and it's 

based upon the amount of damages that the government 

sustains.

 20 years ago, construing an even broader 

statute, this Court unanimously determined that 

defrauding the government in any manner for any purpose 

does not include defrauding recipients of Federal funds. 

That's the Tanner case. The United States made the same 

arguments in the Tanner case in 1987 that it's making

today in connection with the False Claims Act, and this 

Court unanimously decided that case that defrauding the 

government did not include defrauding grantees or 

recipients of Federal funds.

 There is no evidence in this case that false 

or fraudulent claims were submitted to the United 

States. Indeed, we don't know from the record what was 

submitted to the United States, when it was submitted to 

the United States, what it contained.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

certificates of conformance with specifications of? I 

believe they were the Navy's specifications and Allison 

submitted to someone those certificates of conformance.

 MR. OLSON: The district court very 

carefully analyzed that evidence, as well as all the 

other evidence in the case, Justice Ginsburg, and found 

that an inference could not be drawn with respect to 

what had happened or when it happened because there is a 

time lag to drawing an inference from certificates of 

performance when you don't know when those certificates 

were made, when they were submitted to the government, 

what they said.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the government have 

asked -- could the Navy have asked for them?

 MR. OLSON: The Navy, you mean in connection

with the litigation or in connection --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. In connection -- the 

Navy -- the engines are being supplied for Navy 

destroyers and the Navy obviously has an interest in 

making sure that the -- they measure up to the 

specifications. So my question is whether in this 

procedure for dealing with subcontractors there is any 

kind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the 

certificates of conformance for those engines or other 

documents relating to them.

 MR. OLSON: The answer to your question as I 

understand it, Justice Ginsburg, is yes, the Navy had 

the right to test the equipment, look at the -- look at 

the specifications, examine the specifications, ask for 

corrections if they were unsatisfied, to test the 

products. The Navy had the right to do all of those 

things.

 And one -- fundamental to this case is we 

don't know whether they did, whether they were satisfied 

with the generators as ultimately delivered to them, 

whether there were corrections, if there were 

deficiencies or deviations from the specifications when 

they were first submitted to the shipyards, whether 

those were corrected, whether those deviations were 

immaterial. Because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Navy have the 

right to audit the subcontractor's books?

 MR. OLSON: It's my understanding -- I'm not 

100 percent sure of that, Justice Kennedy, but it's my 

understanding that the government did have the right to 

follow the process all the way through. There's no 

evidence that they did so.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose they audit the 

subcontractor's books and they don't discover a fraud 

and leave. Would there be liability then under your 

view?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think it would depend 

upon what was in the books and whether there was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The books show that X 

dollars were spent for certain parts and that was far 

too much. That was an inflated figure. It fools the 

government. The government then paid the 

subcontractor -- pays the contractor; the contractor 

pays the subcontractor.

 MR. OLSON: It -- that might be, 

Justice Kennedy. Regarding the terms of the statute, 

whether you might interpret that as providing under 

(a)(2), providing a record or document to the government 

with the intention that the government pay or approve a 

claim, I think you'd have to examine the evidence in

that context.

 What we don't have here, we don't know what 

was submitted to the government. What the lawyers 

representing the claimants in this case -- and this is 

from page 5a of the appendix to the cert petition, 

footnote 3. We -- this is what the -- when they were 

asked about this issue: We haven't shown you the ship 

yard's invoices to the United States and we're not going 

to show you those. Because they are totally irrelevant 

under the False Claims Act.

 Now, that could not be more wrong, it seems 

to us. You can't determine -- if there's going to be a 

fraud, a claim of fraud against the United States, you 

have to know what the United States received to see 

whether it's fraudulent, to see whether any deviation 

from the facts were material, whether the deviation from 

the specifications where maybe the product was better, 

maybe it deviated in an insubstantial way or an 

immaterial way, maybe the government had an opportunity 

to fix it.

 We don't know whether there was reliance by 

the government. We don't know whether there was a loss 

by the government. And we don't know, if there was a 

loss by the government, the quantification for the loss.

something here. Tell me what I'm missing. What about 

the definition of "claim"? It says a claim includes a 

request under a contract for money or property, and the 

request is made to the contractor if the United States 

provides any -- any of the money.

 Is there an issue here as to whether some of 

the money provided -- are you saying there was no money 

provided by the United States or maybe there was no 

money provided?

 MR. OLSON: No. The way the record -- the 

record is a little confusing with respect to that, 

Justice Breyer, but I think that one of the witnesses --

I don't know how he knew --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. OLSON: But one of the witnesses said, 

yes, the money that we received was money that came from 

the United States.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- so why doesn't that 

end it? Why doesn't -- how do you win, then, given the 

language I just read?

 MR. OLSON: Well, that's the definition of 

the word "claim."

 JUSTICE BREYER: "Claim." And there has to 

be a claim.

 MR. OLSON: There has to be a claim. But

then section -- you're reading subsection (c).

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right, that's right.

 MR. OLSON: Subsection (a) provides the 

standard for liability. So you can have a claim, but 

you're not liable for a false claim unless it's 

submitted to the government, unless it's knowingly made 

to get a fraudulent claim paid or approved by the 

government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say (a), but 

we're talking about (a)(2) --

MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in connection with (c).

 MR. OLSON: Yes. I -- I'm looking at the 

statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you were quoting from 

(a)(1).

 MR. OLSON: No, I quoted from both (a)(1) 

and (a)(2). (A)(2) --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that, but doesn't 

(a)(2) stand by itself, especially as -- as (c) is 

written, (c) and (2), (c) and (a)(2) make perfect 

grammatical sense without any presentation to the 

government.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it reads out the words "by 

the government" from that section, which is what the

statute looked like until it was specifically amended.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the words "by the 

government" are in (a)(2).

 MR. OLSON: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The words "by the 

government" are in (a)(2).

 MR. OLSON: They are in (a)(2), but the way 

Justice -- the way Justice Kennedy was reading it, I 

respectfully submit, would read out those "by the 

government." What (a)(2) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying, in addition 

to being a claim, that's not enough reliability? It has 

to be a claim that's presented to the government?

 MR. OLSON: It's presented to the government 

and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And all that (c) does is 

tell you what a claim is. So that, even if it's not a 

claim against the government but just a claim against a 

subcontractor, that still can be the basis for liability 

so long as it's presented to the government.

 MR. OLSON: It's presented to the government 

or, under (a)(2), knowingly made to get --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But (a)(2) says it has to 

be paid or approved by the government.

 MR. OLSON: It has to be made or used to get

a claim paid or approved.  In other words, it has to be 

something that's created, then given to the government, 

so in order to get a claim paid or approved by the 

government. What I am --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you said given to the 

government. It's "paid or approved by the government."

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think a reasonable 

reading of the statute is -- and this is essentially 

what this Court unanimously decided 20 years ago in the 

Tanner case, that these cases about defrauding the 

government must involve something that causes the 

government to suffer a loss, some something that impacts 

the government. Even -- even the government today is 

making the same statement that there has to be a loss.

 What I'm saying with -- it's important, 

Justice Kennedy, that -- that if you are going to want 

to get something paid or approved by the government, you 

have to do something that gets it to the government in 

some fashion.

 And reading (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) and 

the Tanner decision and the history of this statute from 

1863 all suggest very strongly, I submit, the plain 

language of the statute is that it's -- involves fraud 

against the government.

 Now, you may submit something to a prime --

you may be a subcontractor that submits something to the 

prime contractor, and this very -- this case is a very 

good example of it, and this case is very much like the 

Tanner case. What did the prime contractor do with it? 

If it was false or deficient or out of specifications, 

the prime contractor had a right to say: Wait a minute, 

tighten those bolts up a little bit more, or we're going 

to deduct it, a little price from that, and we're going 

to tell the government that there's a deviation from the 

specifications.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it's disguised, 

how would the -- how would the prime contractor know?

 MR. OLSON: Well, that's just the point, 

Justice Ginsburg. We don't no one way or the other 

unless the evidence is submitted. We don't know what 

the government received, so we don't know whether the 

government was deceived. So, if I submit that it might 

well be in this case -- we don't know how much time 

elapsed between the submission of the invoices or the 

other materials from the subcontractor to the prime 

contractor. What happened then between then and when 

the ships were delivered to the Navy? Lot of things 

could have happened. We don't know.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there wasn't any 

trial, was there?

MR. OLSON: There was a trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was?

 MR. OLSON: And there was a motion at the 

close of the evidence of the plaintiff's case. And at 

that -- it's at that point that counsel said: We are 

not going to show you the invoices to the United States. 

We're not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, how could -- they 

would have at a minimum, even if your theory is not 

correct -- they would have to prove loss to the 

government. Otherwise they would have no claim.

 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. And that's my point.

 If you can't -- if you don't know what went 

to the government, you don't know whether a claim or a 

document or a statement, to use the words of the 

statute, went to the government, you don't know whether 

what the government got was false; you don't 

know whether they --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the other side concede 

that point, that you have to prove loss to the 

government? I don't think they do, do they?

 MR. OLSON: I'm not sure. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they do.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the government 

certainly has that in its brief.

 MR. OLSON: What the statute says is that it 

is liability to the government for the damage the 

government sustains. Now, it may well be -- there's 

penalties even if there isn't damage to the government. 

I would concede that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say that the 

missed funds which are in the hands of subcontract -- of 

contractors, harms the government, even though it 

doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because 

those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if 

that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed. 

That would work, without saying that the government has 

lost any money.

 MR. OLSON: Well, you could say that, but 

you don't know whether the government got what it 

wanted. You don't know whether the -- if something 

deviates from specifications in a contract, it might 

deviate on the plus side of something, it might deviate 

in an immaterial way.

 The contractor, the prime shipyards here, 

and the government had the right to correct any 

deficiencies.

government gives money for building schools, okay, to a 

State and a fraudulent claim is submitted as -- in 

connection with the construction of the school.

 The government has been cheated in that the 

money it gave for a school is not going to the school; 

some of it is going into the hands of the fraudulent 

contractor.

 MR. OLSON: Well, what you've done with your 

question, Justice Scalia, is left out the link. What 

happened -- what -- the government may have made 

-- given money to the schools. Subcontractors might 

have submitted something false. The prime contractor 

might have discovered it and said: Correct this or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but 

that's a different point.

 MR. OLSON: No, it isn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I am talking now about the 

point of whether the government itself has to suffer any 

harm other than the fact that the money it gave was not 

used for the purpose for which it gave it. That alone, 

it seems to me, could be harm.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it -- it might under some 

circumstances be harm. It might not under other 

circumstances be harm. It might be misleading in an 

immaterial way. It might -- there might have been no

reliance by the government. There might have -- the 

government might have said -- the contract between the 

prime contractor and the subcontractor might have 

different requirements than what the government wants. 

None of those --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Olson, it seems to me 

you're fighting a hypothetical. Let's say they built a 

lousy school, sub-spec. The roof is falling in; the 

plumbing leaks. It's a fraud, but they've given the 

money, the feds have given the money to the States and 

the States have let this slip by. Justice Scalia's 

point was the Federal Government has been injured.

 MR. OLSON: The Federal Government may have 

been injured. The question is what does this statute 

redress? There are other statutes. There's a major 

fraud provision of Title 18 that has major penalties for 

fraud by subcontractors against contractors in 

connection with public projects just as the one -- like 

the ones you're describing.

 But if this Court's Tanner decision is 

correct -- and it was only 20 years ago; it was 

unanimous -- it defined the term "defrauding the 

government" and it said "defrauding the government" 

means defrauding the government, not filing a false 

claim --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's why the 

definition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why 

I'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly 

ambiguous, the language of "knowingly makes a false 

statement to get a false claim paid."

 Now, the "false claim" is the claim that 

they made to the contractor, because that's the 

definition. And you are saying: Well, they made this 

statement to get a false claim paid by the government. 

Now, you could read those words "paid by the government" 

to say "and there has to be a causal connection," which 

is what you're saying, that you have to make the false 

statement, make the claim, and that led the government 

to pay.

 But you could also say it's paid by the 

government when the money to pay it comes out of 

government funds, because it was paid by the government 

even though the government gave the money to build the 

school 100 years ago. But it's there in the bank 

account, and then the contractor took the money from the 

bank account that the government put in and paid it. In 

such a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by 

the government.

 MR. OLSON: It has to be a false claim paid 

by the government.

JUSTICE BREYER: It was a false claim. 

That's there.

 MR. OLSON: What -- Justice Breyer, what is 

missing from your hypothetical is what went to the 

government. Suppose the prime contractor decided that 

the paint was off-white instead of white, and that was 

satisfactory.

 Suppose the subcontractor said to the 

government: This is a major project; this is 

a billion-dollar project; there are all these little 

things that are out of specifications and could be 

called false or fraudulent or misleading; we're going to 

disclose all of these things to the government. The 

government has a complete opportunity to test them, look 

at them, and decide whether it's satisfied. Then the 

government isn't deceived.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't say that. 

It says it was a false claim, which it was. It's false, 

and it is a claim to the general. And was it paid by 

the government? Yes. It was paid by the government, 

even though everything you said is true, because the 

money to pay it came from government funds. So that's 

why I'm having a problem. I can read those words "paid 

by the government" either way.

words and isolating them.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true.

 MR. OLSON: It is knowingly making a false 

record or a false statement to get a false claim paid. 

If the government didn't pay a false claim, then (a)(2) 

doesn't provide for liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's not strictly 

correct. I mean, it "paid or approved."

 MR. OLSON: Yes, I should have said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- which means there is a 

third way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub 

makes the false statement to the general contractor in 

order ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the 

ultimate contractor's claim for conforming work, 

approved or this particular claim approved by the 

government when the government makes the ultimate 

decision to pay the general contractor, that would be 

covered by (2).

 MR. OLSON: Well, if -- I should have said 

the word "approved" because I -- I was shortening it up. 

But it does say "paid or approved." But what has to be 

done is that the government has to -- what has to be 

submitted is something to cause the government to pay or 

to approve a false claim to the government.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that can simply be done

by the false claim to the general contractor, who either 

accepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly 

understands that it is false, and ultimately submits the 

same claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for 

the whole project.

 MR. OLSON: Well, what I might say in 

addition to what I have said, Justice Souter, is that 

there is no stopping point for that theory. The 

government says as long as the project involved Federal 

money, as long as the project used Federal funds, as 

long as the project might endanger the Federal fisc, as 

long as the program is financed in part by Federal 

money, there would be liability under this statute.

 Given the tens of thousands of government 

contracts, government funds, government financing of 

States, localities, universities, and so forth, there is 

no limiting point. And what --

JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect, I think there 

is a limiting point. You are certainly right when you 

talk about the thousands of contracts that the 

government ultimately makes or finances for the benefit 

of lower units of government. But it does not follow 

from the government's theory that if the United States 

makes grants to a sub-unit of government, not for the 

purpose of a given contract or a given project, it

simply makes grants, revenue-sharing sorts of things, it 

doesn't follow from the government's position that when 

one of those sub-units of government then makes a 

contract spending part of that money, that it's covered 

by this statute.

 This statute would cover the myriad of 

grants made for particular contracts. It would not 

cover every subset of funds in a lower government unit, 

some of which had been contributed by the national 

government.

 MR. OLSON: I don't -- I don't think, with 

respect, that that's a fair reading of what the 

government said either in the Tanner case, think making 

essentially the same arguments which were rejected 

unanimously by this Court, or what it says in its brief 

to the Court today.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, perhaps we should 

ask the government to explain what its position is. But 

one of the points that has been raised in opposition to 

your argument is that your interpretation would cut out 

claims that today are regarded as properly presented 

under the False Claims Act.

 And the one that was featured was false 

claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, because 

those are presented not to the government but to an

intermediary.

 MR. OLSON: In -- with respect to that, the 

government filed a brief in a case called Atkins versus 

McInteer in the Eleventh circuit, and I have the brief 

here -- it is not part of the material that is before 

you -- in which the government said that even if the 

District -- D.C. Circuit decision that's involved in 

this case, the Totten case, was correctly decided, those 

Medicare-Medicaid cases would be substantially covered 

under the statute even under that construction because 

the provider's claim is passed on by the insurer to the 

Medicare agency or entity.

 Now, I don't know, Justice Ginsburg, the 

facts of that case or the facts of all of those 

circumstances. But the fact is that if you take this 

statute as it was enacted in 1863, all of this used to 

be a part of one section that talked in the first case, 

the first instance, one sentence which discussed in the 

first instance a presentation of a claim to the 

government and which was the liability to be imposed 

upon the claimant.

 The second part of the sentence said -- it 

was intended to cover the people aiding the fraud, those 

people that provided with records or statements in order 

to get the payment made.

And then the third provision was the 

conspiracy provision.

 Those were broken out into the subsections 

you see today. In 1982, Congress specifically said: We 

are simply codifying the statute; we're not changing the 

statute. We are making no substantive changes in the 

statute.

 If you read that provision in the context of 

the Marcus versus Hess case, which was in the early 

'40s, in which the government -- in which the Court 

specifically said there's liability for an intermediary 

causing a -- Federal Government to pay the claim. But 

in that case, the invoices were passed on, and the --

and the government entity in that case, the Public Works 

Administration, had the opportunity to review and 

approve --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the whole 

difference -- the whole difference, then, is if the --

the invoices are passed on, as opposed to the government 

having the right, if it so chooses, to inspect the books 

and records?

 MR. OLSON: I think I may not have heard 

your question. In the --

government gets the invoices from the contractor, then

there's a claim under the False Claims Act. But if, 

instead, the subcontractor is required to make its books 

and records available on request to the government, 

that's not enough?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I -- I think -- it's 

certainly not this case, because the -- although the 

government had an opportunity to do these things, we 

don't know what happened.

forgive me for doing this, but it's important -- given 

the immense variety of ways the Federal Government 

provides Federal financial assistance, always 

accompanied by some restrictions or conditions on its 

use, the inability of the substantial supervision 

language which the government was advancing then, which 

it's sort of advancing now, does not provide any test

that Justice Breyer is putting to you.

 MR. OLSON: Yes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This statute that we're 

looking at, in effect, defines what a fraud against the 

government is.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, but it -- but when it 

was -- when it added that section, it specifically added 

in the words "by the government," which those words were 

added after the legislative history that both the 

Respondents and the government cite. And it did not 

change, Justice Kennedy, the definition of "liability." 

It simply defined "claim." If the Court --

without the claim definition, the statute would not 

cover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to 

the contractor which is known to be passed on to the 

government ultimately?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Without that definition, 

the claim would be made against the contractor, not 

against the government.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I'd like to begin with the same point that 

Mr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims 

Act -- is the False Claims Act directed solely at 

schemes to defraud the government or does it encompass 

schemes to defraud people who receive Federal money? 

And we're in agreement with Petitioners that the False 

Claims Act is directed at schemes to defraud the Federal 

Government.

 Our theory in this case is not that the 

subcontractors are potentially liable because they may

have attempted to defraud the prime contractors. Our 

theory is that the subcontractors are potentially liable 

because they are alleged to have used false 

representations made to the prime contractors but with 

the ultimate purpose of defrauding the United States.

 And I think if you imagine what would have 

happened if the allegations in this case are true and if 

the fraudulent scheme had been carried to completion, 

it's very clear that the government, rather than the 

prime contractors, would have been the injured party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart, I don't 

understand that point. Let's say Allison Engine is 

defrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of 

people, boats, whatever they make. Allison Engine is 

defrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this 

way and, in fact, they don't.

 It doesn't know Bath is going to use some of 

them in a government ship as opposed to a private ship. 

So you're saying in that context, since there's no 

intent to defraud the government, there's no liability?

 MR. STEWART: Well, we would say certainly 

in the context where Allison knows that the engines are 

to be used for private work, that the False Claims 

Act would not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just sells them

engines. It doesn't know what Bath is going to do with 

them. They are going to put some in private boats and 

some in the government boats.

 MR. STEWART: I think you could still have a 

FCA claim, if in fact the work was being done for the 

government contract. But whatever the correct answer to 

that question in the circumstance where the 

subcontractor really doesn't know what the ultimate 

project is for, that's not the case here. The 

subcontractor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I have another question. 

Suppose the subcontractor -- the fraud consists of 

inflating the hours spent in a cost-plus contract. So 

the subcontractor submits and receives payment for 

$10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved. All 

right?

 But that all comes out of the hide of the 

contractor. The contractor gets the same amount of 

money from the Federal Government and the fraud only 

harms the contractor.

 MR. STEWART: Our view is that that would 

not be covered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would not be --

MR. STEWART: That would not be covered. It 

would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

 MR. STEWART: Because the statute -- if you 

look at page 2 of the blue brief, that reproduces the 

relevant provisions of the statute. And the one that 

we're principally -- the two that we're relying on here 

are subsection 2, which says: "Knowingly makes, uses or 

causes to be made or used a false record or statement to 

get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the 

government."

 And we would say that the reference to false 

or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government 

should be taken as limited to a claim that is false as 

to the government. That is, it's false in a respect 

that the government cares about.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- injured by it because 

it, in effect, gets less than it paid for?

 MR. STEWART: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If it were a cost-plus 

contract, the government would pay an extra 10,000 and 

it would lose.

 MR. STEWART: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If they -- if they simply 

supplied defective parts, the government would get less 

of a machine than it paid for. But in the -- in 

Justice Scalia's example, the government ultimately ends

up with exactly what it bargained for, and the person 

who's out is the person who paid for too much labor, 

which is general -- is that your --

MR. STEWART: That's correct. And in that 

circumstance, I think the scheme could fairly be 

characterized as one to defraud the prime contractor, 

because the prime contractor would bear the loss 

associated with the scheme. And we would agree that 

that's not covered. Here --

JUSTICE BREYER: What you are saying is 

covered, I take it -- and this is -- I want to know how 

this has worked out -- what is covered is -- imagine 

government grant programs. And suppose there are vast 

numbers of grant programs now that go to all kinds of 

entities throughout the country, and a large portion of 

which are just grants. They're paid and the government 

is not going to get a penny back.

 Now, there are instances of frauds in such 

situations of subs against the person who gets the 

grant. And in -- I can't imagine a case -- maybe 

imagine, but it would be imaginary -- where the 

Government couldn't say: But we got less than the grant 

was supposed to pay for.

 And you're saying all those are covered. Is 

that right?

provided by the Federal Government to be diverted to 

purposes --

supposed to get.

 MR. STEWART: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: And so this is what 

surprises me on your side. It's 20 years later. And if 

all those things are covered, given the vast extent of 

government grant programs in the United States, has your 

interpretation worked to bring within this statute, and 

lots of qui tam cases against municipal frauds of all 

kinds, things that they just never thought of at the 

time of the Civil War? Do you see what the question is?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think -- I think it 

has basically worked. I don't think it has worked 

perfectly. But I don't think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have there been a lot of 

such cases?

 MR. STEWART: I think there are a lot of 

cases -- I mean, Medicare and Medicaid fraud is an 

example that we would deal with differently textually, 

but those are programs in which the Federal Government 

provides money. Persons other than Federal officials

decide whether the claims should be paid, but ultimately 

there's reimbursement by the Federal Government. Now, 

our answer to the question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson said on the 

Medicare that the providers, that the intermediary does 

present the --

MR. STEWART: And our view is that those 

would be covered even if there is a presentment 

requirement, because subsection (a)(1) of the statute 

refers to a person who knowingly causes a false claim to 

be presented to a Federal official.

 So because there's the reimbursement 

mechanism we think that would be covered. But a big 

part of our argument here is that the applicability of 

the FCA should not depend on these sorts of quirks of 

timing. That is, to take the school hypothetical that 

was discussed in the first part of the argument, you 

have provision of government money for -- Federal money 

for construction of a school, and the contractors who 

deal with the State agency defraud the State agency and 

they produce a shoddy product.

 Now, if the way that the funding program 

works is that the State agency pays first and then 

presents a claim for reimbursement to the Federal 

Government, that would be covered even with the

presentment requirement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how far down 

the line? I mean, let's take that hypothetical. The 

government gives money to the State to build a school. 

The school has to be painted as part of that, so the 

school contractor, the prime contractor, takes some of 

the money from the Federal Government and pays the 

painter. The painter needs to buy paint. So the 

painter takes some of the Federal money and pays the 

paint company. The paint company has to get the 

chemicals from somebody. So the paint company takes 

some of the money and pays the chemical company. And at 

that point, the chemical companies fraudulently added, 

you know, a dollar on to the cost of the chemicals. So 

that dollar goes all the way through. So the Government 

ends up paying a dollar more because of the fraud five, 

six, seven times down the line.

 Can an uninterested person bring a qui tam 

action against the chemical manufacturer because of that 

fraud?

 MR. STEWART: I think our answer would 

probably be yes. A court might read a de minimis 

limitation into the statute, but part of our point would 

be that be that that --

can.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STEWART: Well, the answer to that 

hypothetical -- and the answer to that hypothetical 

really has nothing to do with whether the statute 

imposes a presentment requirement, because the 

hypothetical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not a 

presentment requirement. That's in (a)(1. It's that 

the claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the 

government. And what you're saying is when the 

government pays the State, that pays the school, that 

pays the contractor, that pays the paint -- blah, blah, 

blah -- that that is payment by the government of a 

false claim because the chemical manufacturer six or 

seven steps down the line commits fraud.

 MR. STEWART: It could be an (a)(2) 

question, but my point was that the same type of issue 

could arise even with the presentment requirement, 

because if the chemical manufacturer presents his own 

bill to the paint company, who presents his bill to the 

contractor who does the painting work, who presents his 

bill, et cetera, et cetera --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He has to know that. He 

has to know that his bill is going to be sent up the

line to the government. "Knowingly makes, uses or 

causes to be made or used a false record to get a false 

or fraudulent --

MR. STEWART: I guess I would say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And if he knows it, serve 

him right. But this other guy thinks he's just honestly 

cheating the guy who's buying the chemicals.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STEWART: Again, whatever -- whatever 

the answer -- the point I was trying to make about the 

timing is -- again assume away these issues about how 

much might be de minimis. You have substantial fraud by 

the contractor directed at the State agency. If the 

State -- if the way the funding program works is that 

the State agency then presents its own bill to the 

Federal Government, we're going to have a good (a)(1) 

case regardless of whether presentment is required, 

because we're going to say the subcontractor, the person 

who did the work, caused the State agency to submit a 

false claim to the Federal Government and we can recover 

on that theory.

 MR. STEWART: But -- but if the government 

provides the money up front, gives it to the State 

agency and says, use it for the defined purposes, you'll 

still have presentment of a claim by the State agency,

namely the request for funding, but there will be no way 

to say that that difference --

JUSTICE BREYER: The difference is that 

government money today is in everything. So if it's in 

everything, then everything is going to become subject 

to this False Claims Act. And of course I exaggerate by 

using the word "everything," but only a little.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STEWART: But the point about timing --

but the point about timing is if the State's claim is 

submitted to the Federal Government at a time when the 

fraud has not yet occurred, the State's claim can't be 

denominated false, assuming that the State intends it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know that that 

accords with the definition of "claim" in (c).

"claim" in (c) says it's a request or a demand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It says the government 

will reimburse.

portion of the money or property which is requested or 

demanded, or if the government will reimburse." And so

has provided it already.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And my -- my 

point is the definition of "claim" indicates that 

Congress didn't want liability to turn on this quirk of 

timing, whether the fraud occurs before the claim is 

submitted to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your own school 

hypothetical, there's liability.

 MR. STEWART: There's liability if the 

Federal Government reimburses a claim for expenses that 

have already been incurred, but under Petitioner's 

theory, if the Federal Government pays the money up 

front, the State has submitted a claim but it's not a 

false claim. And then if the contractor defrauds the 

school -- the State, by producing a shoddy school, the 

contractor can't be charged with having caused a false 

claim to be submitted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't shock me. I 

don't know. It doesn't shock me at all. If indeed the 

object of this is to prevent fraud upon the government 

and if the government has not been deceived at all, get 

yourself a new statute.

 MR. STEWART: But our point is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This statute doesn't have 

to cover every ill in the world.

MR. STEWART: That's correct. But fraud --

fraud against the government can occur whether -- the 

whole point of the definition of (c) is that fraud 

against the government can occur if Federal money is 

diverted away from its intended purposes, whether the 

deceit is practiced directly upon a Federal official or 

a contractor or a grantee.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before you 

finish, the major objection is the one that Justice 

Breyer just voiced, that your position is vastly 

overbroad and every time there's government money there 

will be -- one of these qui tam people can come in. 

What are the limiting principles that you say attach to 

this statute?

 MR. STEWART: There are two principal 

limiting principles. The first is that the bill has to 

be submitted to the contractor or grantee in his 

capacity as such. That is, there has to be a nexus 

between the provision of Federal funds and the request 

that's made. So if a subcontractor defrauds Boeing on 

work that Boeing is doing for a private airline, there's 

no FCA violation. Even though Boeing literally is a 

government contractor, it's not being defrauded in its 

capacity as such.

 And the second is that the fraud has to be

of a nature that if successfully carried to completion 

could be expected to injure the Federal Government. So 

in the hypothetical of the cost-plus contract between 

the prime contractor and the sub and the sub presents an 

inflated bill, if the loss false on the prime contractor 

and is not passed along to the government, the claim 

would not lie under the FCA

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if injuring the Federal 

Government would -- it would suffice to injure the 

Federal Government that the schools are shoddy and the 

roofs are leaking? That would be enough?

 MR. STEWART: That would be enough.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the Federal 

Government is not out of pocket any more, but the 

program that it -- that it was desirous of encouraging 

is simply not as good as it would have been otherwise.

 MR. STEWART: That's -- that's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you would still -- your 

theory would still cover the case of the -- of the 

agency that gets 10 percent of its budget by -- through 

a general grant from the United States, no matter what 

it spent its money on, regardless of the fact that the 

United States has no connection with particular 

contracts. If in fact a fraudulent claim was presented 

to that agency, it would fall within the qui tam

 MR. STEWART: We would still be asking was 

the -- whether the fraud was of a sort that the Federal 

Government cared about. That is, if the Federal 

Government made a grant with no strings attached, use it 

as you want.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, no strings attached.

 MR. STEWART: Then there would be no FCA 

liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't there be?

 MR. STEWART: Because the fraud would not --

in that -- in that hypothetical, you would have 

something akin to a fraudulent car repair bill passed 

along, given to me. I happen to be a Department of 

Justice employee and I might use my Federal salary to 

pay the fraudulent claim. But we wouldn't say that's an 

FCA violation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but when your salary is 

paid, in effect the government's interest stops when it 

pays for your labor. In the -- in the hypothetical in 

which the government funds 10 percent of a sub-agency's 

operating budget, presumably its intent generalized goes 

to everything that agency does.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. HELMER, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. HELMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please this Court:

 Electricity is the critical component in a 

modern warship that allows it to fight, to defend 

itself, and to carry out its mission. Because of that, 

the Navy imposed rigid requirements on all who work on 

its generator sets in manufacturing those generator 

sets.

 Those rigid requirements were passed down 

from the Navy to Bath. Bath was ordered by the Navy to 

pass those down in writing to each of its subcontractors 

who were going to work on these Gen-Sets, and Bath did 

that. Each of the subcontractors in this case knew they 

were working on the DDG-51 project, which is the Arleigh 

Burke-class destroyers. They knew that military 

requirements were called out in their paperwork that had

to be met; and they did not satisfy those military 

requirements and yet submitted both claims for payment 

and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, certificates 

of compliance.

 If you look at the Sixth Circuit's joint 

appendix at page 620, you're going to see, at paragraph 

6.1 in the contract between Bath Iron Works and Allison, 

the subcontractor, that Allison was required, when it 

delivered the Gen-Sets to the shipyard to give a 

certificate of conformance that all of these rigid 

requirements had been satisfied, and that certificate of 

conformance had to be given to the United States Navy.

 And third, until that certificate of 

conformance was given to the United States Navy, no 

money; no money was going to be paid to Allison.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whose certificate is it? 

Is it the contractor's certificate that everything that 

the subs have done or the certificate of conformance 

that Allison provided, that SOFCO provided?

 MR. HELMER: Yes, ma'am. There are two 

certificates of conformance, you're absolutely correct. 

What I'm speaking of is the certificate of conformance 

from the defendant in this case. They have to take and 

give that to the shipyard that says: We have met all 

the requirements, the Navy requirements; and we have to

give that to the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy then takes 

that certificate and releases the Gen-Set. It's under 

lock and key. It releases the Gen-Set --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought --

MR. HELMER: -- to be installed in the ship.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was not 

established that anything from this defendant got to the 

Navy.

 MR. HELMER: You were told that earlier this 

morning, Your Honor. I don't believe that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, where in the record 

is there some indication that some -- some paper from --

with a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?

 MR. HELMER: If you'll look at the joint 

appendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix, at page 620; 

it's clause 6.1 -- talks about the certificates. The 

certificates are in the record starting at joint 

appendix, Sixth Circuit joint appendix 515 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I know what 

certificates are, I mean, you know, their general 

content. But was there anything in the record that a 

certificate from Allison went to the Navy with Allison's 

signature on it?

 MR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor. The contract 

with Bath required the Navy to receive that for Allison

to be paid. There was evidence in this case that 

Allison was, in fact, paid for delivering these 

Gen-Sets. That's circumstantial evidence that they did 

submit their certificates of conformance --

JUSTICE ALITO: What about the statement 

that Mr. Olson quoted during his argument, when counsel 

for plaintiffs said to the jury: You haven't seen 

anything that was submitted to the Navy and you're not 

going to see anything that was submitted to the Navy?

 MR. HELMER: No, Your Honor. That -- I made 

that statement, and that was not my statement.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what was your 

statement?

 MR. HELMER: My statement was: You are not 

going to see the invoices from Allison -- the invoices, 

not the certificates of conformance, not the invoices 

from Bath to the Navy. You're not going to see those. 

But the invoices from Allison to Bath were all admitted 

into the record in this case. They're all summarized.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then there's less to 

this case than we had thought. My goodness, even under 

the Petitioner's theory, you win. If indeed a 

fraudulent document was given to Bath and Bath passed 

that on, I think the Petitioners would have conceded --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that there's a cause of 

action. What is all this fuss about, then?

 MR. HELMER: This case is not a outlier on 

the ends of this statute. It is squarely in the middle 

of (a)(2).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you had said that in 

your brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot 

of reading.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HELMER: Your Honor, anything that I can 

do to help the Court. I apologize if I didn't write the 

brief better than I could have.

 But I do have another point that I -- that I 

would like to make in addition to what's in the record 

in this case. If you go back and look at the 1863 

version of the False Claims Act, which continues on in 

1943, the statute talks about in the second clause --

and the second clause is what is now known as (a)(2) --

it talks about a false record or statement being made 

for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain 

payment. It does not say, and it never said, that there 

has to actually be payment, there has to actually be 

payment.

 Now the statute reads today "to get a false 

or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government."

My point is -- and the Rainwater case, Justice Scalia, 

that I think you may have been referring to says that --

the government does not have to have a monetary loss for 

there to be a False Claims Act violation. However, for 

there to be a violation of (a)(2), the false record or 

statement that's presented, the false record or 

statement that's made, has to be made with the purpose 

of reaching Federal funds. That's what the statute 

originally said. That language was taken out in 1982. 

We all seem to agree that the '82 recodification did not 

change any of the meaning or purpose of the statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument --

your understanding of the scope of the statute is 

exactly the same if the words "by the government" were 

replaced by "with Federal funds"? You think those 

are -- you think the statute is exactly the same if it 

said "with Federal funds" instead of "by the 

government"?

 MR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor. I think 

that's correct. I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when the 

government -- when the phrase "by the government" was 

added -- was it in '86?

 MR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor.

statutes that said "with Federal funds," right?

 MR. HELMER: There were.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why did the 

Congress add the phrase "by the government" instead of 

"with Federal funds" if it meant the same thing?

 MR. HELMER: The legislative history is dark 

on that subject. But I have two answers for you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. First, if you look at the '82 

version of the statute, there were six liability 

provisions set out. A seventh was added in '86, (a)(7). 

But of the first six that were added in '82, when they 

broke this long sentence down into parts, every one of 

those provisions except for (a)(2} dealt with either "by 

the government" or "defrauding the government." (A)(7) 

likewise has such similar language.

 My first point to you is that I believe that 

when Congress amended this statute in '86 it wanted all 

provisions to be consistent with each other in that 

sense that we're talking about fraud on the government, 

not fraud against private parties, fraud on the 

government.

 The second response I would make to you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is that we don't read "by the 

government" as meaning presented to the government or 

even paid by the government. We read "by the

government" as indicating that this is a limitation on 

(a)(2), because without that language on (a)(2), if you 

read the definition of "claim," then any claim or 

private funds could be -- could have been covered by 

(a)(2). By adding the words "by the government," the 

Congress has limited this to directing to Federal funds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So I guess I 

get back -- you read "by the government" as if it said 

"with Federal funds"?

 MR. HELMER: I do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- you just said to 

Justice Scalia -- if you have one minute; I rather 

missed that -- that your point was if you lose on that 

point you just made and it isn't "with Federal funds" 

and it is that the government has to pay the claim, you 

still win. That was your point to Justice Scalia, I 

guess.

 MR. HELMER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what was that 

argument? Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and 

what is it? How do you still win?

 MR. HELMER: Well, I believe they -- that 

was the first point that I was making to Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

(a)(2) covers making a false record or statement to get 

a false claim paid or approved by the government.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. HELMER: In this case, they were 

required -- Allison was required by its contract with 

Bath and the Navy to submit a certificate of conformance 

to Bath and the Navy to release the Gen-Set for 

installation into the destroyer. Without that 

certificate of conformance -- and we spent 5 weeks in 

front of a jury talking about why they were false, why 

each of those were false -- without that certificate of 

conformance, the Gen-Set could not have been released to 

be installed in the ship and Allison could not have been 

paid. That's what section 6.1 of the contract provides.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The the certificate of 

performance made its way to the Navy. That was required 

by contract. Why did you not introduce direct evidence 

of that in your case?

 MR. HELMER: We did put all the certificates 

of conformance that were given to Bath in the record of 

this case.

 And all of those by the terms of Allison's 

contract with Bath had to be shown to the U.S. Navy 

employee on site at the shipyard. And that contract was 

also admitted into evidence.

witness who testified that this certificate was given to 

Ensign So-and-So. But --

required this? It's a strange provision to be in the 

contract between Allison and Bath.

Honor. It was the contract between Bath and Allison 

that I'm speaking about now that flowed -- that also 

flowed down the U.S. Navy's requirements that these 

Gen-Sets be -- be built rigidly to the specifications 

set out by the Navy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that contract between 

Allison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison 

had to be presented to the Navy?

 MR. HELMER: Yes, Your Honor. It had -- it 

had to be shown to the Navy. If you want to get paid, 

you have to show it to the Navy, and then the Navy will 

release the Gen-Set. See they build these ships around

them on a destroyer; you build the destroyer up around 

it. So before you can release those to the shipyard for 

construction, you had to have the certificates of 

conformance.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In the contract between the 

Navy and Bath, was there a provision that Allison's 

invoices would be shown to the Navy? In other words, 

was the parallel provision in the contract with the --

with the general the same as the provision between the 

general and the sub?

 MR. HELMER: Justice Souter, it was 

different. There is a provision I believe 

Justice Ginsburg was referring to. You will find it at 

page 415 of the Sixth Circuit's joint appendix. That 

provision required that when Allison made a certificate 

to get paid to the Navy -- I'm sorry, strike that --

when Bath made a certificate to the Navy to get paid, it 

had to have available for the U.S. Navy all of the 

underlying documentation. All of the bills, the 

invoices, and certifications had to be available to show 

the Navy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Available but not 

necessarily transmitted.

invoice and given to the Navy, but they had to be

give them to the Navy. It was specific in saying they 

go -- your invoices, your -- your certificates, go to 

the Navy?

 MR. HELMER: It was specific in saying your 

certificate of conformance goes to the Navy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. HELMER: It did not say in the provision 

that I have cited to the Court, your invoice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that.

 MR. HELMER: And that was why I said, 

Justice Alito, to the trial court, not to the jury, that 

the invoices are irrelevant. And I -- I didn't make 

that up. That comes out of the Bornstein opinion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And Bath would have been in 

breach of its contract with Allison unless it passed 

these things on to the Navy? That's why I say it's a 

strange provision to be in the contract between Bath and 

Allison.

 MR. HELMER: The certificate was required.

be available --

not passing the certificate on to the Navy?

 MR. HELMER: Well, I believe the way it 

reads, Allison is supposed to hand the certificate to 

the Navy employee at the shipyard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if in fact, as 

you suggest, Allison submitted the certificate to the 

Navy person at the shipyard, then the question presented 

in this case is not in fact presented here? Because the 

question presented assumes that there had not been a 

submission to the Federal Government of the false --

false claim.

 MR. HELMER: I think that's fair to say,

cert on other grounds. I did not cite the Court to the

to the Court's attention additional information that was 

in the joint appendix below. And that was what I was 

attempting to do in response to Justice Ginsburg's 

initial question that started the presentation today.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There has been a 

statement, in opposition to your position, that the way 

you read (a)(2) would render (a)(1) useless, That 

everything would fall within (a)(2).

 Is there a distinction between what comes 

under (a)(1) and (a)(2), in your view?

out in the solicitor's brief at pages 18 and 19, the 

silver brief, the distinction between (a)(1) and (a)(2). 

(A)(1) can be a claim that just says, pay me; there's 

nothing false on its face, but it is impliedly false 

because it -- it's not entitled to be paid because the 

requirements haven't been met.

 (A)(2) would require a specific false 

statement in that record or statement that's used.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Helmer.

 MR. HELMER: Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, Mr. Olson, four 

minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Let me address the -- what seems to be a 

controversy as to what was submitted to the Navy.

 In the first place, the invoices were not 

submitted to the Navy. We know that. That's the 

provision that I quoted before.

 The Plaintiffs in this case did not call a 

single Navy witness. They did not call the prime 

contractor as a witness. So we don't know what the Navy 

received, or what the Navy did not receive.

 With respect to the so-called certification, 

that is addressed on pages 57a through 59a of the cert 

petition appendix. This is a district court decision, 

three pages of discussion.

 This was an argument that the relators came 

up with relatively late when they couldn't explain why 

they didn't have the invoices or what actually went to 

the Navy, and they argued that Bath submitted a false 

implied certification.

 Then the district court goes through the 

evidence on pages 57a to 59a and concludes at the top of 

59a there is no evidence of a requiring -- of a 

required, continuing certification with respect to

quality, which is the issue tried in this case.

 I don't have time to go through all of that 

or all of the evidence, but that is backing and filling.

 There -- and the question presented is a 

correct question presented. As the relators put it to 

the -- to the district court, we don't have to do that. 

We are not going to show you --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this 

question: Suppose they had submitted the qualification 

certificate, but not a claim? Would they have had a 

case, under your view?

 MR. OLSON: If it was -- if the 

qualification -- if a -- if a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What I am really asking 

is: Do they still need a claim?

 MR. OLSON: I -- they -- there has to be --

no. Under (a)(2), Justice Stevens, you could submit a 

statement intending to get a false claim approved or 

paid by the government.

 Now, the government can't approve anything 

if it's not actually submitted to it, or not intended to 

be submitted to it. That's in the same section of -- of 

the statute.

 Let me -- let me turn to the -- this is a 

penal statute. There is a punitive statute, as you

pointed out, in the Vermont versus Stevens case.

 There is no meaningful limitation on what 

the government and the Respondents want in this case. 

The government has now come up with this limitation: 

Well, it must be really a government project.

 Well, that isn't in the statute. That's 

basically the same thing you unanimously rejected in the 

Tanner case.

 The government said in its brief if the 

government is the ultimate source of the funds. That 

goes back to the example that the Chief Justice was 

making. There might be 15 different layers, the way 

this government works. Money is fungible. It's 

impossible to trace.

 This statute is intended to address claims 

made, or statements made in connection with claims made, 

to -- to commit to defraud the government, and defraud 

the government irrespective of the definition of 

"claim," which could have been put in section (a), but 

was not put in section (a), the liability section.

 The Congress knows how to put those words in 

statutes. They were in the major fraud statute, the --

the case that this Court distinguished in Dixon, in --

in Tanner. The Dixon case was money given -- paid to or 

on behalf of the government. There is language like

that throughout the congressional statutes.

 We don't know in this case whether the 

government was defrauded, or was intended to be 

defrauded, because there is this big space between what 

went on between the subcontractors and the shipbuilders 

and what went on between the shipbuilders and the 

government.

 There could have been all kinds of dialogue. 

There could have been disclosures. There might be 

deviations from the specifications in any kind of 

government contract. But this statute has to have a 

limitation point.

 And if you look at it from 1863 up to the 

present, it is intended just as the Tanner case said. 

And in Marcus versus Hess you said that the criminal 

false claim statutes have to be construed identically 

with the civil false claims provisions if they contain 

identical language. 371 has the same language as the 

False Claims Act's, and the Tanner case is dispositive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Olson.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
