 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 07-219, Exxon Shipping Company 

versus Baker, et al.

 Mr. Dellinger.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DELLINGER: Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince 

William Sound on March 24, 1989, the resulting spill of 

11 million gallons of oil was one of the worst 

environmental tragedies in U.S. maritime history.

 The only remaining aspect -- the only aspect 

of the litigation over the Valdez disaster that is 

before the Court today concerns almost entirely lost 

revenues by the commercial fishing industry. Exxon long 

ago paid $400 million in compensation for that lost 

revenue. At issue here is whether an additional warrant 

to the commercial fishing class of $2.5 billion dollars 

in punitive damages is permissible under Federal 

Maritime Law.

 The first of the three reasons that the 

decision below should be reversed is that the Ninth

Circuit erred in overturning a maritime law rule that 

has been settled for 200 years. Although a shipowner 

is, of course, liable to fully compensate for all of the 

damages caused by the wrongful acts of a captain in 

compensation, it is liable for punitive damages under 

the long-settled rule only if the shipowner directed, 

ratified, or participated in the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, how was 

that rule settled? You go in that story and The Amiable 

Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive 

or exemplary damages in those cases. So what is the 

long-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime 

law that you are relying on?

 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, The 

Amiable Nancy is the only maritime case, but this Court 

in Lake Shore in 1893 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was on land on the 

railroad.

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, but this Court's 

unanimous opinion by Justice Gray in Lake Shore cites 

with approval The Amiable Nancy decision and the 

maritime context. Three times this Court has considered 

the question of whether there should be respondeat 

superior liability in punitive damages for the wrongful 

action.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are talking about 

maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy. And my 

only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided. 

So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a 

long line of settled decisions in maritime law.

 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, the issue 

has been so well settled, and Courts of Appeals have so 

long recognized, that punitive damages are not available 

in vicarious liability in maritime cases that the issue, 

understandably, doesn't -- doesn't come up. It's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we thought so in 

Prentice.

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. In Lake Shore versus 

Prentice, this Court did in 1818 and 1893 and 1999 

address this question, once in the maritime context, 

once in the context of Federal common law, and once in 

the particular statutory context of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the Lake Shore 

case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial 

employee. It involved a conductor on a train.

 MR. DELLINGER: That's -- that's correct. 

But it -- but the rule is clear from Lake Shore versus 

Prentice that it is the same rule as The Amiable Nancy 

rule. There is not respondeat superior liability in the 

absence of some action on the part of the shipowner.

Now, the reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the shipowner is, 

I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of 

thousands of shareholders, right? So you have to have a 

shareholder driving the boat before you can assess 

liability?

 MR. DELLINGER: No. The company acts 

through its policymaking officers or through its 

policies; so that if a reckless judgment is made by 

someone who had authority to set policy for the company, 

either the president of Exxon Shipping -- I mean if the 

Plaintiffs were correct that the jury actually, 

necessarily --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not quite 

correct to say only the owner. In other words, it is a 

certain level of employee, because corporations only act 

through individuals. It is a certain level of employee 

in the company.

 Now, where do you draw the line between the 

CEO and the cabin boy? How do you do that? And I would 

suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one 

of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than 

the cabin boy.

 MR. DELLINGER: The one thing that, 

traditionally, if you look at all the Courts of Appeals

cases and all of the tradition and maritime law, is that 

the captain or the pilot, anyone on board the ship, does 

not implicate in punitive damages the company, or the 

shipowner.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the captain --

MR. DELLINGER: -- or the ship owner.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is not a managerial 

officer for any purpose? Suppose he decides that he's 

going to leave despite an adverse weather report? Is he 

not a managerial agent at least for that?

 MR. DELLINGER: I think the tradition is 

clear, Justice Kennedy, that if it's a -- that the 

maritime tradition is that, while you are liable for all 

of the harms caused by that, the decisions made on the 

ship do not implicate in punitive damages.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm asking 

about the concept of the managerial officer in general. 

And I think that we can explore in this argument, 

whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely 

about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the 

first instance.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me a large 

part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer 

is and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer

for any purpose at all?

 MR. DELLINGER: You know, I can't rule out 

the possibility that someone in that position might be, 

but he did not set company policy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that you're 

talking about a different level. I think we ought to be 

clear on this. I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood 

was, indeed, a "managerial agent" as that term is used 

in the Restatement of Torts, right?

 So you are talking about it's not good 

enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in 

a higher echelon in the company. That's your position?

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. There has 

-- one has to be someone with authority to set relevant 

policy who has some responsibility over that area of the 

company's operations that would not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should that be? I 

mean, why should there be a different rule? Let's 

assume -- I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument 

that The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue 

absolutely.

 Why, then, should the -- and it doesn't, it 

seems to me, settle this distinction at all. So why 

should there be a distinction between corporations 

generally and maritime corporations?

MR. DELLINGER: Well, there are two 

responses to that question.

 The first is that there is -- this has 

worked in the context of maritime law for 200 years, and 

-- and because of the -- there has been a long tradition 

of needing to foster and promote maritime commerce, and 

the fact that it's thought to be particularly risky and 

dangerous to conduct maritime commerce. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't part 

of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's 

a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in 

The Amiable Nancy? And that is in those days, when a 

ship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world 

by itself. And the -- the contact with the shipowner 

was simply gone until the thing came back into port 

again.

 That is certainly not the case today, and we 

know it's not the case in the circumstances here.

 So if the -- if the relationship to the 

corporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of 

a vessel is not in any way different from the 

relationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a 

corporation, I don't see why that distinction should 

hold today.

 MR. DELLINGER: There is no question,

Justice Souter, but that communications have -- have 

improved. There is a -- there is much of the tradition 

of maritime law that still obtains. Maritime commerce, 

because it takes place on the high seas, is an 

inherently and continuously more risky endeavor than 

most other occupations, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be an argument for 

no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an 

argument for distinguishing between maritime 

corporations and others. I mean, other -- other kinds 

of enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too. And I'm 

missing the distinction there.

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, to the extent that one 

doesn't see that the tradition of -- of what's worked in 

maritime law in its own system of law for 200 years 

should be different, it is not at all clear why the 

maritime law rule ought not be the rule on land. There 

are eight States --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I had not understood 

you to concede that -- that the land rule was different 

from the maritime rule. I gather that in many States 

it's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to 

be.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And it is 

the rule that this Court adopted in Lake Shore versus

Prentice, and it is -- it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which was a land case.

 MR. DELLINGER: And the policy behind it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are right, and I 

want to make -- let me just make clear one other point. 

You are drawing a distinction, as I understood you to 

say to Justice Ginsburg, between the Restatement 

position and your position.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. DELLINGER: -- although there are some 

States that have the Restatement position that may read 

"managerial employee" in the way that maritime law does, 

and that is a person who is in a position to set 

relevant policy for the company and not just the branch 

manager at a -- at a Wal-Mart.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there aren't many 

States that follow the Restatement position.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And -- but 

my point is not that -- my point is simply that there 

are good reasons for the maritime law rule, and they 

have been accepted in other cases.

 When Justice Gray embraced that rule in the 

Lake Shore case, he did so because he thought it 

inappropriate to impose punitive elements on someone who

was not actually the wrongdoer. And when Justice 

O'Connor wrote in Kolstad, she spoke of the important 

principle underlying common law limitations on vicarious 

liability for punitive damages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right, Mr. 

Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was 

dealing with the concept of respondeat superior? It 

didn't make any distinction between regular employees 

and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not 

dealing with a managerial employee.

 MR. DELLINGER: It was dealing with someone 

who was at the level of a conductor, I think, exactly on 

par with the captain.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't recall that 

they made anything about managerial. They were just 

talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Now, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't think the 

conductor is on a par with a captain. The captain has 

this huge vessel. He can decide when it leaves. He 

decides the course. And I think that "managerial 

officer" might be a divisible concept.

 Obviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing 

its tax returns or to decide whether there's a 

deduction. But you are saying he binds Exxon for no

purpose at all, ever.

 MR. DELLINGER: For punitive damages. Of 

course, they are bound to pay for all of the harm 

caused. But that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, we are talking 

about punitive damages but at the concept of a 

"managerial officer." And I haven't heard why he isn't 

a managerial officer at least as to some things.

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, for two reasons:

 One, he was unable to set policy for any of 

these issues. And think of the larger context. The 

reason we want to hold someone, an entity or a person, 

liable in punitive damages is because they make a 

decision that is malicious or profit-seeking, or 

whatever.

 When you are advancing the policies of the 

company and are empowered to advance those policies, and 

you do so in a way that is either malicious or driven by 

profit motives or hope to conceal it, when all of those 

things happen, it is appropriate to visit upon those 

persons the extra punishment of punitive damages.

 And that's why it's not the importance of 

the job. It's the fact that when someone acts contrary 

to the interest -- contrary to the interest of a company 

and its shareholders, why in that instance should

not authorized to make policy, do so?

 So if the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, 

Mr. Dellinger?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In some punitive-damages 

cases, the liability attaches because the person has 

hired someone who is obviously incompetent.

 Supposing that the -- a crew member was --

an obviously incompetent crew member was hired by the 

captain of the ship. Would that be sufficient to 

justify punitive damages?

 MR. DELLINGER: Not against the company that 

owned the ship. Only if someone --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if he was hired by a 

shore-based personnel, then, would that be the 

difference for you?

 MR. DELLINGER: The -- only if the company 

at a policymaking level is implicated would the company 

JUSTICE STEVENS: The one -- the company 

says the captain hires the crew members who could cause 

all sorts of damage. And another company says somebody

on shore can do it. You have a different rule between 

those two?

 MR. DELLINGER: Oh, well, I think if the 

case arises in a maritime context, there would not be --

there would not be a different rule, whether a decision 

was made on shore or not. If you are talking about a 

maritime law case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would there be vicarious 

liability or not in the case: Negligence in hiring an 

incompetent crew member?

 MR. DELLINGER: Not unless the decision was 

made by someone at a policymaking level.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has the authority 

to decide who to hire. Is that policymaking?

 MR. DELLINGER: No. That's the 

implementation of -- that's the implementation of a 

policy. So I think what -- if you keep in mind the 

purposes of punitive damages, as to whether conduct 

should be deterred and whether it should be punished, 

and when you are talking about going against the 

shareholders of the company, not -- of course, they have 

to pay for all the compensatory harms. We don't doubt 

that.

 But for punishment the notion is that it is 

the -- that-- that at least eight States have and it is

in the maritime law rule that you need to show that 

there is -- that there is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Recklessness in hiring the 

employee who caused the damage can be a --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes, absolutely. We have 

not disputed the fact that if the jury actually did have 

to conclude that Exxon was reckless in the supervision 

or the hiring or the placement of Hazelwood, that that 

would be a grounds for imputing punitive-damages 

liability.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In hiring the third mate 

here, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore, 

there would be liability? But if he was negligently 

hired by the captain, there would be no liability?

 MR. DELLINGER: No. I think it has to do 

with the level at which the -- at which the hiring 

decision was made. It has to be a decision -- and I 

think the way the case was tried it makes sense that if 

senior officials for Exxon were informed and if the jury 

decided on the basis that at a high level at Exxon 

Shipping that they knew that this person was -- should 

not be put in command of a ship, and, nonetheless, it 

did so, that would implicate them. If I could --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was -- there was 

sufficient evidence of that. I mean --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The jury could have found 

that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol 

problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after 

voyage and did nothing about it.

 So the jury could have found: Never mind 

the captain. Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer 

because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a 

captain who was certainly not fit.

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, and I want to be clear 

about that. The answer to that question is: Yes, the 

jury could have found that Exxon was reckless in 

allowing Hazelwood to command the ship and that that 

recklessness would implicate the company for punitive 

damages.

 But they need not have done so. They need 

not even have reached the issue, and the court of 

appeals said -- it is at page 88 and 89. The Ninth 

Circuit said that the jury could also, in the 

alternative, have found that Exxon followed a reasonable 

policy of fostering reporting and treatment by alcohol 

abusers, knew that Hazelwood had obtained treatment, and 

did not know that he was taking command of the 

ship drunk.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a jury question.

There was evidence both ways. So, on this issue, am I 

right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get 

is a new trial?

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.

around the jury would get a special verdict and be 

asked: Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this 

captain to stay on the ship?

rule is that to make the corporation liable for 

punitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the

 So they are distinguishing among levels of 

corporate officials. Now that seems to be the Federal 

rule, right?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what 

happens to that Federal rule? One thing we know 

happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins 

came along; and most of the relevant cases left the 

Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under 

State law.

 Was there anything left in the Federal 

system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might 

apply; and, if so, what happened to it?

 MR. DELLINGER: The only place it would 

remain is in statutory settings where the court has to 

supply the answer to a question of whether punitive 

damages are an available remedy in a Title VII case. 

And that's -- that's the only --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what happened? And 

the reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems

to me it makes a difference from the point of view of 

stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule, 

has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has 

eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining 

only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine 

outlier.

 And I don't know what the history is.

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, the -- of course, with 

the -- with the replacement of the Arrowsmith versus 

Tyson by Erie against Thompkins, it was no longer a 

broad area.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. That's beside the 

point to my question.

 MR. DELLINGER: In the lower courts the rule 

has continued as a maritime rule law. It has worked 

within the context of a maritime law rule. Maritime is 

its own system of law. The fact that West Virginia --

West Virginia has a different law than this Court's 

maritime law --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt. To 

what extent is present maritime law informed by State 

common law throughout the country?

 MR. DELLINGER: It is in the absence of a --

in the absence of a Federal rule, but here the -- there 

are -- there's not uniformity among the States.

To turn to the second question of whether --

which would actually preclude the need even to resolve 

The Amiable Nancy issue as to whether there should be as 

a matter of judge-made maritime law a punitive-damages 

remedy for unintentional oil spills. Now, the starting 

point to think about that, I believe, is this Court's 

decision in Milwaukee versus Illinois in 1981.

 This is the standard the Court set: Federal 

courts create common law only as a necessary expedient 

when problems requiring Federal answers are not 

addressed by Federal statutory law. That precisely 

describes this case.

 The Court looking out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the City of 

Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory 

law of Federal common law. Your case involves the 

displacement of Federal maritime law by Federal 

statutory law.

 Federal maritime law is routine. Federal 

courts do that all the time. Federal common law is 

unusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to 

simply by necessity.

 Doesn't that suggest that whatever the 

Federal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a 

harder showing on your part to conclude that it's

displaced by the statutory process?

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, the reason I think 

that's not -- not the case is twofold.

 First of all, the era in which this Court 

created lots of admiralty law has receded itself because 

Congress has become active, and then there's no longer 

a -- as necessary, a role for this Court.

 Justice O'Connor, for example, said that in 

-- that we sail -- the courts sail -- now sail in 

occupied waters in making maritime law because of the 

amount of Federal statutory law.

 And, secondly, the assumption that there was 

a well developed punitive damages remedy in maritime 

law, and that we have a harder road to show that the 

existence of a series of Federal statutes eliminates the 

need for that, is just not established.

 This Court itself has never affirmed an 

award of punitive damages under maritime law. It has 

never held that punitive damages are available for 

unintentional conduct in maritime law. It has never 

held that they were available for oil spills.

 There were only four cases of Federal 

maritime punitive damage awards in the history of the 

country before the Clean Water Act was passed.

the term "punitive damages" or "exemplary," or anything 

else; but, at most, that would be 12. We think the 

answer is four.

 So that -- and, in fact, the largest award 

ever -- ever made was for $500,000. So there was no --

and that was after the Clean Water Act. So there's no 

established tradition of -- of punitive damages.

 This Court would be making a major step to 

affirm an award, to play a role, in an unintentional 

case of punitive damages in maritime law for oil spills. 

Because what Congress has done here is to obviate the 

need for a remedy by passing a comprehensive and 

carefully calibrated statute.

 But the hallmark of the Clean Water Act is 

the obvious effort to balance --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Dellinger, 

before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean 

Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after 

the jury verdict. And the trial court, who had very 

carefully managed this case -- and it was a humongous 

case -- would never list it as an issue in the case. 

And so he said: I won't hear it 13 months after the 

verdict.

 Why shouldn't we instruct the court of 

appeals that when a district judge does a diligent job

like that one did to try to get at all the issues --

says you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after 

the verdict and argue a point of law that would have 

overtaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking 

for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.

 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, that sort 

of concern has much more force if you are talking about 

issues that go to the substantiality of the evidence. 

But here the court of appeals --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Well, what did you 

make -- you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water 

Act as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made 

that motion 13 months after the jury verdict.

 MR. DELLINGER: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is the basis in 

the Federal rules for that motion?

 MR. DELLINGER: The motion was made before 

the entry of judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 13 months after the 

verdict.

 MR. DELLINGER: That -- the motion was 

not on -- on -- the court of appeals held -- not only 

did the court of appeals press -- not only was the issue 

pressed and passed upon by the court of appeals, the 

court of appeals held that the district court was wrong

in assuming that it was waived. The district court was 

told by the plaintiffs that this was the same motion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- that's not my 

question. My question is: Under what Federal rules did 

you move to bring up this issue 13 months after the 

verdict?

 MR. DELLINGER: It was under rule 59, under 

rule 49.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 49 is on special 

verdicts. What did this have to do with special 

verdicts?

 MR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry. It was a rule 50 

-- it was a rule 50 motion. It was not untimely, and 

the court of appeals --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 50 is pretty strict, 

isn't it? I mean, rule 50 -- if you want to use rule 

50, you have to first move before the case goes to the 

jury. And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it. Then 

you move again after the jury. And if you don't, it's 

got very tight timelines.

 And you are arguing to a court that has held 

that these limitations in the Federal rules must be 

strictly observed. And I don't know of any time limit 

in the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that 

involve 50(b).

MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, there are 

several answers to the waiver question. First of all, 

this Court has the authority to based upon it because 

the court appeal based upon it. Secondly, the court of 

appeals correctly said that as the -- the plaintiffs had 

told the judge, that motion, he need not rule on because 

it is the same motion that the -- that had been made 

earlier. Now the earlier motion was based upon the 

TAPAA Act, as -- that it features it as a reason why the 

court need not create or recognize a punitive damages 

remedy. The second motion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't appeal on 

that. You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you 

didn't appeal on TAPAA.

 MR. DELLINGER: That would be the case if we 

hadn't raised it all. We raised it both times, the 

court said it was the same motion. Here's what the 

court of appeals said. The court of appeals said that 

Exxon clearly and consistently argued statutory 

preemption as one of the theories --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Statutory. But the 

statute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. But the 

essential argument, the court of appeals is the same, 

and if the issue were not raised -- even if the issue

had not been raised at all in the trial court, even if 

the had not been put before the district court, the 

court of appeals still could have agreed to hear the 

question of whether a punitive damages remedy is 

obviated by the panoply of Federal statutes that are out 

there. That -- that there is -- there was an exercise 

of the court of appeals. The decision is now the law in 

the Ninth Circuit and this Court has full authority to 

review it, because as the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: As you know, there were 

or at least some strong amici briefs in this case that 

have asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's 

no way to operate vis-a-vis district courts.

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, the -- even Professor 

Miller recognizes that this is not jurisdictional and 

that the court has the power to do it, the power to hear 

this case. And it is before it. And -- and even if the 

matter had not been raised in the district court, the 

court of appeals had authority to consider it. And 

there's --

MR. DELLINGER: Oh, uh -- yes, indeed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.

 MR. DELLINGER: The -- the Clean Water Act, 

the reason it's an important issue, is that the one 

thing that Congress has not done, whether it's in TAPAA, 

in the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act, is they 

have not provided for punitive damages but moreover, 

they have never had any remedy that is uncalibrated, 

that is limitless, that is not carefully measured so 

that it respects the need to protect the interests to be 

protective by those laws, by the interest in clean 

water, with a decision not to overdeter.

 The problem with having a punitive damages 

remedy in an area where punitive damages has played no 

significant role, that is judge-made, is that it simply 

obliterates the balance that Congress has struck. If 

you look at the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about 

tradition. It has never been the tradition for criminal 

statutes to have open-ended penalties. So that -- that 

explains why the CWA has specific limits.

 MR. DELLINGER: Even on civil fines, even on 

other aspects of it, there is -- there is a careful 

calibration. And once Congress has decided that the 

limits of liability are twice the measurable pecuniary

loss, to add to that careful set of remedies that 

Congress has adopted another remedy that is however many 

billions of dollars the jury might choose totally 

unsettled the scheme when Congress has addressed the 

very issue. When you ask the question: Are punitive 

damages available for oil spills, and you look at the 

Clean Water Act, which covers so much of the territory 

of this act, it is hard to make out the case that --

that there's a need for a judicially created remedy, 

particularly when the judicially created remedy, unlike 

something that was done by Congress comes without caps, 

without structure, without guidance.

 If Congress were to decide that a 

punitive-damages remedy, it's likely that they would 

place some kind of structural limits or caps on it and 

not have this limitless, free-floating --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps that's a 

segue to point No. 3. I don't wish to --

MR. DELLINGER: No. That's a -- I think 

that --

question?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My only question is this: 

Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to 

Exxon under maritime law in in case. We have read in 

the briefs about the limits that should be imposed on 

these punitive damages. And those are from our 

due-process cases.

 If we are deciding this case as a matter of 

our authority to determine Federal maritime law, are 

there factors that we should include in a 

punitive-damages framework that do not -- that do not 

appear in our due-process cases? And, if so, what are 

those factors?

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, I think surely that's 

right. And the -- your question recognizes, as have 

individual Justices, that -- that here you are like a 

State court in the sense that, as Justice Scalia said, 

State courts have ample authority to eliminate 

unfairness and to set their own rules in this area, as 

you do here.

 Now, the first --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You would say one of those 

factors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

pre-emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors 

that you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it, under that, 

you would point to the double -- the provision for a 

fine double the amount of the damages? That would be a 

factor?

 MR. DELLINGER: The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if we're looking 

for guidelines --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes. A double --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- double general damages 

is a factor that we could -- that we could follow in the 

maritime framework?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, but you would look to 

what the criminal penalty is that's actually imposed. 

The Court has said civil fines are a better guide. And 

the civil fine, the maximum civil fine here for both the 

State of Alaska and the United States, would be $80 

million.

 If you look to what the responsible law 

enforcement authorities and public officials of both the 

United States and Alaska thought was the proper amount, 

they imposed a criminal fine of $150 million, which was 

reduced to $25 million because of the cleanup efforts

and the fact that Exxon prepaid $300 million of the 

losses in advance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about looking at 

what this Court said in TXO was proper in a 

punitive-damages case? That is, this spill was 

horrendous, but it could have been far worse.

 And so, under TXO, you look at what was the 

-- could be the maximum damage that could have been 

caused by this occurrence, and that could be many 

times --

MR. DELLINGER: Well, there was -- first of 

all, it would be different to look at potential harm if 

the potential harm were attempted by the defendant, and 

the defendant had been unable to carry out the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't --

MR. DELLINGER: -- the planned harm.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a factor here. I 

mean, wasn't the example that the captain was trying to 

maneuver the ship after the disaster in such a way that 

would have made it much worse?

 MR. DELLINGER: That was not even the basis 

of liability that was put before the jury. And if you 

-- and -- nor was it shown that that -- that that would 

have caused harm.

the first thing you would start with, Justice Kennedy, 

is to ask whether it is necessary for punishment and 

deterrence.

 And when you start with payments that have 

reached $3.4 billion in terms of compensation, fines, 

remediation, restitution, that clearly obviates the need 

for deterrence.

 And if you look to -- if you look to 

punishment -- if you look to punishment, here the one 

thing that is clear is that this was not an intentional 

act. It was not malicious. The company did not stand 

to make one dollar of profit. There was no effort to 

enhance the profits of the company, nor was there any 

possibility of concealment.

 And what the -- what the Plaintiffs put 

before this Court, the Respondents in this case, are a 

number of issues that were never put before the jury, 

not part of the case, by people who were not even 

plaintiffs; matters that were outside of the record and 

contrary to the instructions. So that the jury was told 

compensation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the 

formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any 

added amount would not deter, and how do we know that? 

How do you formulate this rule?

MR. DELLINGER: Well, it is absolutely 

essential to formulate some kind of rule. The best 

guide is to look, I think, at civil penalties, which 

gets to -- to $80 million, but to look to what the Court 

said in your opinion in State Farm, where -- where 

compensatories are so substantial it may eliminate any 

need for additional punitive-damages remedy. There's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to your 

civil-penalty point?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem with the 

civil-penalty argument is -- that the civil penalties 

were calibrated for environmental damage, and what we 

are dealing with here is individual economic damage? So 

we've got an apples and oranges comparison, haven't we?

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, two responses:

 First of all, the $150 million penalty did 

-- the purpose of the Clean Water Act also includes 

protection of property. So it's not just for the 

environment. And, indeed, part of the reason for 

cutting the $150 million award was the compensation that 

had been paid.

 But, secondly, if you --

JUSTICE SOUTER: To the -- for lost trade or 

something?

MR. DELLINGER: Right. It -- even if you 

took that as calibrated to the environmental damage, the 

environmental damage was twice what the compensation --

the total compensation paid was $500 million. The 

company paid nearly a billion dollars for natural 

resources harm.

 If $150 million was the right amount for the 

environmental damage, then the right amount for the half 

of that that constitutes the lost wages would be $75 

million, which is itself close to the $80 million.

 But here I think that it is incumbent upon 

the Plaintiffs to show why you need deterrence when 

there was no profit motive, and you've had to pay $3.4 

million dollars. And when if you look to punishment, 

that can't be a black hole into which all the limits on 

punitive damages disappear.

 It's whether that -- if this Court can't set 

standards that would limit an award of this kind, that 

is a reason for believing that this ought to be done by 

Congress if there are going to be punitive damages.

 I'd like to reserve --

JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- I mean, the 

obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard 

would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of 

the officer of the corporation, including the captain,

if you lost on that.

 And where we said roughly before zero to 10 

-- and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of 

money -- you'd say zero to five, up to five times. I 

mean that would be rough and ready. But the idea would 

be to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms 

involved in your industry that you are representing not 

to make certain the officers on the ship behave in a 

reprehensible way.

 It's crude, but I mean that's the kind of 

thing that we said in the due-process cases.

 MR. DELLINGER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then why wouldn't you --

MR. DELLINGER: Keep in --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't you --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're going to say --

you're going to hear in two seconds -- they're going to 

say this is the company that makes the most amazing 

profit, et cetera. And so you're trying to deter them. 

So we know what, you know -- so, what do you say to 

that?

the amount is enough to deter anybody for anything when 

it is $3.4 billion. And it's hard to know how you could 

have a punitive rationale for something which was 

unintentional, not designed to make a profit, and could 

not have been concealed.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Each of the three rulings at issue here 

rests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law. 

And there is no reason in maritime jurisprudence to 

depart from those rules.

 I want to start with the first question 

presented, what Exxon calls the vicarious liability 

issue. And I think it's important to frame the 

discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction 

that's at issue in this case. It's at Pet. App. 301a.

 It says that a managerial agent is someone 

who supervises other employees and has responsibility 

for, and authority over, particular aspects of a 

corporation's business.

And, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has 

never disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this 

definition. As its own internal documents explain, 

Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a 

business unit of Exxon Shipping. He was in charge of 

hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of 

product; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel 

with respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of 

safety. He was the person who decided on behalf of 

Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March 

23, 1989.

 Now, it is our submission that it is 

perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to 

punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an 

individual.

 In doing so, it does not, as Exxon would 

contend, impose vicarious liability. Rather, what it 

does is it exposes a corporation to liability based on 

its own culpability.

 The very point of the restatement test, as 

opposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed 

by the majority of the States, is that it requires some 

complicity on the part of the corporation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's the 

lookout posted -- I don't know if they have one -- but

the lookout posted in the front of the ship, and he is 

drunk, and doesn't see the reef or something? Is the 

corporation liable in that case?

 MR. FISHER: Not for punitive damages, 

Mr. Chief Justice. And the reason why is because the 

lookout does not run a business unit of Exxon Shipping.

 What is happening here -- and I want to 

focus on this for a moment because Mr. Dellinger --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you regard the 

ship as a business unit?

 MR. FISHER: That's what Exxon regarded the 

ship as, and so that's what the record says. And the 

idea is that you had --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's different if 

they say that it's -- depending on how they categorize 

the different units tells whether they are liable or 

not?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to rest 

primarily on labels. The idea is function. And I 

think, going back to the instruction, what the 

instruction is asking the jury to determine is: Is this 

a person who has authority over an aspect of a 

corporation's business? I think a shorthand for that is 

in Exxon's own documents that it is --

janitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation. 

I mean, surely, that can't be the test.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the authority --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume the test is the 

person has to be high enough that it justifies holding 

the entire corporation. And I doubt whether a captain 

is -- is high enough. How many of these units does 

Exxon have?

 MR. FISHER: There are about 20 vessels like 

the Valdez.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty vessels.

 MR. FISHER: Now, I think Mr. Chief Justice 

had it right when he said it's no answer to say it can't 

be the master; it has to be the corporation. The 

corporation can only act through people. So there has 

to be a line drawing that takes place.

 Now, this notion of the idea that the master 

isn't good enough because he had to be a policymaker is 

new to us.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was a question 

that I asked, not a statement.

 Well, how do you draw the line? I mean, is 

the second in command on the boat a man responsible for 

policy?

 MR. FISHER: He may not be. I don't think

the question is whether he's responsible for policy. 

Again, it's whether he's the person in charge.

 What Exxon during instruction to the 

district court asked the jury to be required to find is 

that there was a shore-based supervisory official of the 

Exxon defendants who made the decision. So Exxon itself 

recognized that you have to draw the line somewhere.

 We think the best place to draw the line, 

and the conservative place to law, the line is the 

managerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement.

 Now, Mr. Dellinger says there are eight 

States that follow a different rule. And it's important 

to understand that that's not the case. Even among the 

States that follow the Lake Shore formulation in 

general, you still have to have a way to implement it. 

It's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be 

complicit, you still have to tell the jury which human 

beings they can look to for that complicity.

 So at page 33 of our red brief --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the Lake Shore --

well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it 

is principle was that a captain ain't one of those. The 

captain doesn't -- doesn't do the job.

 MR. FISHER: There was no captain at issue 

in Amiable Nancy. And, Of course, there wasn't a

captain at issue in Lake Shore, because it was a 

land-based case.

 But on page 33 of our red brief we've given 

you seven -- several States that say we follow the 

complicity test, and here's how you do it. You require 

the jury to find that the person is at least a 

managerial agent.

 Exxon itself in its reply brief on page --

page 11, footnote 5, cites several States. And I gather 

these are the States to which Mr. Dellinger is referring 

when he says there are eight States that follow our 

rule.

 Well, we did some research after getting the 

reply brief, and I want to give you a few cites, because 

it illustrates the principle yet again. Several of 

those States say we follow the Lake Shore complicity 

idea. And, therefore, the way we do it is we require a 

jury to find at least a managerial agent. So Kansas is 

a State that Exxon cites.

 In the Flint Hills case at 941 P.2d 374, 

Kansas says the way in modern times you implement Lake 

Shore is you require a managerial agent. In 

Connecticut, the Stoltz case 867 A.2d 860, and in the 

D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, they quote one of your 

opinions. If you look at D.C. law, the D.C. Court of

Appeals itself and a D.C. circuit in another case have 

said -- and this is the Arthur Young case, 631 A.2d 354, 

and the GMAC case at 273 F.2d 92 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do any of those cases say 

the managerial agent is liable if he violated express 

instructions from an employer?

 MR. FISHER: No State tort case that we're 

aware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts -- I think what you're 

referring to is the Kolstad policy exception.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because that's what the 

last part of your instruction 33 says. And it does seem 

to me that this captain may be managerial for some 

purposes and not others. I think that's the way it's 

going to have to come out. Maybe not. But certainly he 

was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that 

you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think I want to say two 

things. The first is that, as I understand it, Exxon 

has conceded across the board that Captain Hazelwood is 

a managerial agent. And in this case -- in this Court's 

own Kolstad case, if you look at it again, it says 

Amiable Nancy, Lake Shore and the way you implement 

that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they have not conceded 

the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33. And

that's because he was not entitled to set aside the 

policy on intoxication.

 MR. FISHER: Well, if you were to adopt a 

rule that no other State has adopted, which is to say 

there was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which 

unlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge 

of the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue 

in this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was -- Exxon 

had every opportunity to argue policy. In its closing 

argument to the jury, the only policy it mentioned was 

the policy of two officers on the bridge while 

transporting --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Your instruction says 

if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable 

to the corporation. That's it.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy. 

We think that's the proper rule of law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the corporation's 

responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply 

not relevant under your theory of the case, even though 

that's what you talk about in your brief.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to act like 

a dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the 

idea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you 

have to ask which people. And what happened in this

Court's own decision in Kolstad said in implementing 

Lake Shore that you look to the managerial agents. And 

that's what --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's why I'm 

interested in the same question I asked on the other 

side. As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first 

reading of it that it picked up this distinction that 

Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could 

impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation 

where its managerial official is the one who causes --

who behaves recklessly. But wait, we don't mean quite 

that. We mean some managerial officials.

 And they seem to refer in the admiralty 

case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's 

captain. He's not in that category. And then in this 

other case, they say -- they talk about a superintending 

agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the 

conductor.

 And they give that as an example of a 

managerial official where there would not be exemplary 

damages assessed against the corporation in light of his 

conduct.

 So when I read that, I thought that this 

Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and 

that's the Federal law. And you've given the examples

where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you 

are right. You read the cases very well.

 But is there an example where I could say 

that the Federal law has changed, too? And you started 

down that track, but the reason this is of probably more 

than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case 

in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into 

stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it 

is.

 So what would you say to someone who has 

accepted certain legal principles that we have had in 

prior cases? And you want to say nonetheless you win. 

Okay. Why?

 MR. FISHER: Three reasons, Justice Breyer. 

The first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not 

involve the wrongdoing of the captain. It involved the 

wrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so 

it's -- there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals 

with captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect 

that comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains.

 The second thing is there are some more 

recent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore 

managerial agent idea. We've cited them in our -- in 

our red brief along through -- I'm flipping now -- but 

there are RICO cases; there are other cases, and

Mr. Dellinger said, where statutory case -- statutory 

regimes need to be implemented. And we have cited 

several lower court decisions that look to the 

managerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court.

 The third thing is to understand, as you 

talked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick 

somebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and 

way down low is not okay. Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on 

corporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make 

sense today, you have to understand that when you're 

dealing with humongous corporations, you have to look 

not just to the president or vice president -- and this 

is what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well 

-- is that when you deal with multinational corporations 

with tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you 

look to -- you look a little bit lower down than those 

top job titles to managers.

 And so again this is what Professor 

Schoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court 

dealing with that from a maritime perspective.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, you --

your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite 

one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious 

liability for punitive damages. Is this the first one?

 MR. FISHER: No, it would not be, Mr. Chief

Justice. What we did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best 

case?

 MR. FISHER: What we did our reply brief --

I'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to 

Professor Robertson's article in saying that he 

collected the cases, and which he did; and so our best 

cases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and 

Ralston against States Rights is very close. There's a 

distinction in Ralston versus exemplary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's take --

take the Ludlow. Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where 

the court found that the owner is not vicariously 

liable.

 MR. FISHER: We don't think that's the right 

reading of the case. We submit -- we have a footnote in 

our own brief that says that there are only two cases 

that they cite in which a captain's conduct is not 

imputed to the ship's owner. They are both more than 

100 years old, and neither of them deal with 

corporations.

 So I think it is entirely fair to say that 

you have more or less an open issue before you today. 

What I think I want to be sure the Court understands, 

though, is that there is not a stare decisis problem

that this Court has to confront with respect to the 

first question. You have a spattering of a few old 

cases that lean in different directions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so it differs from 

Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?

 MR. FISHER: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE BREYER: It differs from Sand? You 

say it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark. In 

the Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it, 

public policy was on the other side. But -- but we had 

several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like 

two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one 

very clearly, you know -- you see the point there.

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say there is no 

stare decisis problem?

 MR. FISHER: Well, because neither Amiable 

Nancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two 

cases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent. 

The more recent cases from this Court, Hydrolevel and 

Kolstad -- Hydrolevel says any agent for treble damages 

for antitrust, and Kolstad follows the managerial agent 

principle, following in the natural evolution of Amiable 

Nancy and Lake Shore.

 So I don't think this Court has ever

considered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if 

all of the lower courts were lined up against it, which 

is far from the -- far from the case here. What you 

have is a just few lower courts in either correction. I 

gather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided 

to grant certiorari in this case, because there's some 

dispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this 

principle works in maritime law.

 But again, we don't think there's any 

problem with this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That, and $3.5 billion.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FISHER: I said one of the reasons, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's some confusion, 

Mr. Fisher, about this Kolstad. I take your -- it has 

entered this case at two levels. One is this business 

about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a 

policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a 

tanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently 

enforced policy. So you don't have any problem with 

Kolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a 

managerial --

MR. FISHER: Kolstad starts from the 

proposition of managerial agent is the proper way to

implement a complicity rule.

 There's a second part of Kolstad that says 

we have to change what we think is the ordinary common 

law rule, the proper Federal common law rule. We have 

to change it in the context of Title VII because of the 

unusual situation in which employers can be held liable 

based on the subjective knowledge of the wrongdoer; and 

tort law is exactly the opposite. It is an objective 

test. And so there's no worry in imposing punitive 

damages here, that you're going to -- that you're going 

to dissuade an employer from training its employees.

 Now, on the facts, even if you were to agree 

with me on that legal argument, you're exactly right on 

the facts, Justice Ginsburg. Exxon had a paper alcohol 

policy that prohibited drinking aboard ship, just like 

the Coast Guard has a policy to that effect. But the 

evidence in this case was that Exxon didn't enforce it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your theory of the 

case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood 

don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable? 

That's your theory of the case under instruction 33?

 MR. FISHER: On the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or the last part of the 

instruction 36, I think.

in phase one that was our -- that was the legal theory, 

Justice -- you're right, Justice Kennedy. But in phase 

three of the trial when a jury decided whether to award 

punitive damages, the instructions told it, among other 

things -- this is instruction 30 in phase three -- it 

told among other things to consider whether or not the 

wrongdoers were violating company policy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that 

goes to measures, not to liability.

 MR. FISHER: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was the first phase. 

And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you 

have to explain.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I accept that, and I 

think I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary 

tort case from the situation in Title VII. I think it's 

instructive for this Court, and we agree with Exxon that 

when this Court sits as a maritime court, it looks for 

guidance to what other State courts have done. And we 

think it's instructive that not one single State court, 

either before or after Kolstad, has adopted a policy 

defense for defendants. There's simply no such decision 

on the books outside of discrimination cases.

position of how to look at the case if you have a 

managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate 

policy? Is the corporation still exposed to punitive 

damages?

 MR. FISHER: In a tort case, Your Honor?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a case like this.

 MR. FISHER: Yes. We think -- and that's --

and that's what instruction Justice Kennedy --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what can a 

corporation do to protect itself against punitive 

damages awards such as this?

 MR. FISHER: Well, it can hire fit and 

competent people who it decides --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and assume it 

has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?

 MR. FISHER: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying --

that's the question I'm asking. What if there is a 

breach of the corporate policy? I don't see what more a 

corporation can do. I mean, your --- other than --

other than what? I mean it has to say that the policy 

is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're 

liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case 

shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the 

individual is liable for punitive and other awards.

But what more can the corporation do other 

than say here is our policies? And try to implement 

them.

 MR. FISHER: Apart from adopting a policy, 

they need to implement it soundly. And the argument 

you're making, if I understand it correctly, would 

obtain just as easily if the vice president of Exxon 

Corporation or the president of Exxon Shipping, whom 

Mr. Dellinger says would put Exxon on the hook, had made 

the decision to put Joe Hazelwood in command of this 

ship. And so you always have the problem --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At that level -- at 

that level, the president, I think you would have an 

argument that the policy was being changed. It's not 

clear that that argument works when you're dealing with 

someone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.

 MR. FISHER: Well, in some -- I think in 

some respects we're back to the argument of where you 

draw the line. But let's look at the conduct in this 

case. Who made the decision that it was safe to depart 

port that night on behalf of Exxon Corporation? Captain 

Hazelwood. The record unequivocally says that Captain 

Hazelwood is the one who made that policy decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me throw this thought 

on the table. If the policy is made by the board of

directors, can the president unilaterally change the 

policy? The Chief seems to be suggesting he could?

 MR. FISHER: I don't think so.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me we have 

this problem, the president of the company is the same 

as the vice president.

 MR. FISHER: I think that's the point that I 

was trying to make.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that would 

go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is 

enforced. If the president of the company isn't 

following the policy it's not going to be taken very 

seriously. That's different than saying you have a 

situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm 

company policy is breached, the individual is breaching 

the policy.

 MR. FISHER: Well, if we're to the point 

where the question is whether or not the policy was 

enforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this 

case, because that was what we tried to the jury: That 

there was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced.

 We showed 33 instances in the record of 

Exxon employees drinking with Hazelwood or learning that 

he drank. Up and down the corporation, as the district 

judge explained, for three years, upper management was

 Now, its policy, Mr. Chief Justice, was that 

that was not allowed. But over a three-year span, as 

the district judge found again and again and again, they 

were told there was a problem.

would like you to address at some point at your 

convenience what should the standards be if, in fact, 

the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions, 

for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to 

be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for 

punitives.

 Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of 

my mind is: This is a very dramatic accident. It 

involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of 

trouble. But there are accidents every day, and ships 

are filled with accidents like automobiles in other 

places. And there are all kinds of things that go 

wrong.

 And if, in fact, it has not been normal in 

admiralty until now to assess punitives against the 

corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the 

ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will 

be a new world for the shipping industry and for those 

who work on the ships.

 What happens when a sailor slips and is 

hurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera? 

What principles do you have to suggest, if any, for 

creating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think this is the 

perfect segue from the first and third questions. As I

transfer there, I want to point out that I think the 

only reason that we heard in the first -- the first 

portion of the argument for absolving Exxon of 

responsibility in the situation is because of the 

dangerousness of captaining vessels like this.

 This Court has already addressed that 

concern in its collision doctrine, and tort law 

generally addresses the problem of dangerous activities 

and split-second decisions. And the answer to that is 

they are simply not reckless when somebody makes a 

good-faith decision in a crisis in the midst of 

dangerous activity. So we don't think there's any 

special rule that is necessary with respect to the first 

question presented.

 Now, you asked me how do deal with it in 

terms of the size of the award. We think -- first of 

all, I think that if I can beg to differ slightly with 

the way you framed it, as Professor Robertson explained, 

punitive damages are -- have always been firmly 

established in maritime law.

 And then just because there haven't been 

that many cases doesn't tell you that they've been 

frowned upon. It just means that we haven't had that 

many cases that have resulted in reported decisions.

 Now, in looking to guidance, this Court

isn't sitting as a maritime court. So it -- it's siting 

as a common-law-type court. We think the best place to 

start is with the common-law tradition, which is that 

cases are tried to juries; juries make the first 

decision; and then the trial court reviews for passion 

and prejudice and for substantial evidence, as our trial 

court did here. And then the court of appeals reviews 

that for abuse of discretion.

 If there's anything more that's necessary in 

maritime law, we submit Congress has already stepped 

into the breach with the Limitation of Liability Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me if I'm wrong. 

You've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says 

that the appellate court has to examine de novo to 

determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award 

to deter.

 MR. FISHER: I think that's a constitutional 

holding. What this Court said in Cooper was if --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, a fortiori, it 

gives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting 

as a common-law-type court.

 MR. FISHER: Yes. I'm not going to fight 

you on that, Justice Kennedy. There was an earlier 

sentence in Cooper that says if no constitutional issue 

is raised, the only thing an appellate court should do

is review for abuse of discretion. But I think that 

ultimately you end up in the same place, which is that 

there's a de novo review of the excessive -- of whether 

the award is excessive based on the facts that have been 

-- that have been tried.

 And if this Court is going to adopt a set of 

guideposts for maritime law, we think the proper place 

to look is the due- process cases this Court has already 

decided.

 This Court has already -- in its due-process 

cases, the Court looked to the common law. That's 

where, I gather, the guideposts this Court adopted came 

from: Reprehensibility, in particular, which this Court 

said was the most important indicia, as well as a 

reasonable relationship, what's commonly referred to as 

the "ratio test."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- what about 

looking to the Clean Water Act? And I wanted to ask you 

this question about the Act. Assuming we agree with you 

that -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water 

Act as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why 

was it too late in the appellate court to raise the 

Clean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law 

should not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and, 

in part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages

of the amount at issue here should not be allowed?

 It seems to me there it's not a new 

argument. It's just an additional factor for arguments 

that have already been made.

 MR. FISHER: I think I accept what you said, 

Justice Scalia. The third -- with respect to the size 

of the award, we never contested Exxon's ability to 

argue that the Clean Water Act is one place you can 

look.

 So, if you were to look to the Clean Water 

Act, you initially have the problem that Justice Souter 

mentioned. You have the apples and oranges problem. 

The Clean Water Act sets a fine cording to the 

environmental harm. Now, the State of Alaska had that 

estimated in its -- and this is in its brief -- and that 

came out to be -- I believe the number is about 

$2.6 billion.

 So, if you were to look -- if you were to 

put aside the apples and oranges problem and look to the 

Clean Water Act, then you get almost the number that 

we're standing here with today.

 If you look at the harm a different way, you 

still get an extremely large number. You get $500 

million of compensation to the Plaintiffs. And then on 

top of that, we think in light of the way this Court has

addressed ratio analysis in its other cases, you need to 

take account of the fact that there are vast injuries 

that have not resulted in any compensation.

 So to do any kind of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's part 3. What 

about part 2? Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the 

argument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the 

court of appeals? Okay, we agree that the Clean Water 

Act does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages 

here, but one of the factors that we ought to take into 

account in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this 

situation permits punitive damages is the existence of 

the Clean Water Act. That's not a pre-emption thing. 

Is that also waived, do you think?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it would be 

because that's -- they never made that argument in the 

district court, and they didn't make that argument to 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to make 

every tiny little argument. I mean, you can think of 

additional points on appeal so long as it's under the 

same major heading. And the major heading here is not 

the Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the 

major heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not 

permit. And, you know, they had made other arguments

about prior cases; they had talked about State law; and 

this is just another argument: By the way, here's 

another one. There's the Clean Water Act.

 MR. FISHER: Well, they didn't make that 

argument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up 

being any different than their pre-emption argument 

because -- remember their pre-emption argument isn't a 

pure pre-emption argument. They're not here today 

saying the Plaintiffs can't recover compensatory 

damages, as was the case in the Milwaukee and Illinois 

case, for example. What they're saying is that the 

Clean Water Act displaces our ability to recover 

punitive damages.

 And there, by making the argument that I 

gather you've sketched out, it looks very much like the 

same argument that they didn't properly make.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's close.

 MR. FISHER: But it doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't really say 

pre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to 

consider when you decide what the evolving law of 

admiralty requires.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a statute that 

was raised in the district court. And the district 

court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that

was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why 

there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was 

one of the things the court of appeals said under the 

head of waiver. They're substituting one federal 

statute for another.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 

And at page 103 of the joint appendix, the district 

court ruled on that motion and held that TAPAA was the 

statute that was controlling with respect to spills of 

trans-Alaska oil and that the savings clause of TAPAA 

expressly preserved our ability to seek punitive 

damages.

 That's a ruling that, as you noted, Exxon 

never appealed, and so it is the law of the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A while ago you were 

about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability 

Act.

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little while ago, 

you were about to make a point on the Limitation of 

Liability Act.

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

point. In other words, if we're looking to guidance,

you look to Federal law. And whether it's directly 

applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act 

reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting 

liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was 

intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy. 

And why isn't that something we should look to, at least 

under question three?

 MR. FISHER: Well, as I said, I agree you 

should look to it, but you should do it in a way this 

Court's Miles decision instructs. It says that Congress 

doesn't just enact general policies. By enacting a 

statute that gives some protection, Congress indicates 

not just a general policy, but more importantly, the 

sphere into which that policy is to be given effect.

 And so the notion that Congress did step in 

and give shipowners some protection but left out 

shipowners like Exxon that behave in the manner at issue 

in this case, we think is a strong --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that means 

they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection 

that the limitation of liability gives. It doesn't mean 

that we should ignore the reflection of that policy 

outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think -- I think you 

should look to it and understand that Congress has

declined to give the protection. In OPA 90, which was 

passed right after the spill in direct response to the 

spill, Congress made explicit that the Limitation Act 

should never apply to spills of Trans-Alaska oil. And 

the TAPAA did the same thing in the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The argument is not 

that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply. It's 

that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has 

radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one 

area, that we as a matter of development of Federal 

common law, Federal maritime law should allow 

dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area 

of shipowning liability.

 MR. FISHER: Well, we don't think we're 

asking for any kind of expansion of liability. All 

we're asking is for the traditional admiralty rule which 

has been recognized by Justice Story early on and all 

through the cases that in cases of reckless indifference 

a shipowner can be held liable for punitive damages. 

The only thing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, the problem I 

have -- maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question 

that that argument raises is this:

 We know something now that Justice Story did 

not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more

experience with punitive damages practice. And we've 

spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with 

the problem of how to set constitutional limits for 

awards which sort of by most people's standards verged 

on the excessive.

 The problem that we've had -- we've had two 

problems in coming up with those constitutional 

standards:

 One is we can't simply substitute ourselves 

as lawmakers for the State. We're talking about 

constitutional limits, not optimum standards.

 And number two, given those limits on us, we 

have not been able to come up with anything that could 

be called determinant standards. We've never, for 

example, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to 

put an absolute ratio kind of limit on it.

 But here, as you were pointing out earlier, 

we're sitting as a kind of common-law court. We are in 

the position of the States here.

 Why shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of 

trying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've 

proven in the constitutional context and say, therefore, 

we've simply got to come up with a number, because no 

other way is going to give us any kind of an 

administrable standard; and our number -- and I'm not

saying this should be it -- but our number is going to 

be double the compensatory damages? That's the limit.

 Would that be an illegitimate thing for us 

to do or an unwise thing for us to do?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it would -- I'll 

stick with unwise, Justice Souter.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FISHER: And I think the reason why is 

because we agree with that. You should -- you should 

look to the experience of the States. Not one single 

State, as a matter of common law authority, has set a 

bright-line ratio. The only place --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the United 

States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571, 

has exactly that number. It's -- for -- it's double the 

pecuniary loss for a criminal act.

 And it seems to me, if when we're looking 

for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated 

we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference 

to the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very 

valuable instruction.

 MR. FISHER: We think that's one place this 

Court can look. But again, a common-law court, we 

believe, sets standards, not a bright-line rule. If you 

were to adopt some sort of bright-line statute, you'd

have to deal with any number of legislative problems 

that the several States have dealt with and Congress, 

when it has passed these kinds of limits.

 First, you have to decide the ratio number. 

You have to pull something out there. Then you have to 

decide is it on a per capita basis in terms of -- what 

several States have done is they've set a limit, that a 

ratio only kicks in at a certain dollar amount. In this 

case, it's worth remembering that the plaintiffs are 

only standing to recover $75,000 a piece in punitive 

damages.

 Now, most States that even have caps, or 

several of the States at least, say they don't apply if 

the awards are under a $100,000 per capita.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? What's even the 

theory of that? Because the theory of punitives is that 

the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one 

penny's worth?

 MR. FISHER: But the theory --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that really the money 

ought to go to the people generally in the State or it 

ought to go to other people, rather than those people 

who have already been compensated. That's the theory of 

it.

 MR. FISHER: I think that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: That exhibits the 

difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.

 MR. FISHER: I think the theory of the 

States, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and 

lots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt 

one or two. And so if you have, as in this case, 

destroyed an entire regional economy, that it would be 

inappropriate to give some sort of credit for that by a 

lower ratio just because you've harmed more people.

 Now, there's also --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't the measure what 

is necessary to deter? Isn't that what we've asked 

first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think you've looked at 

punishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy.

 And if I could finish the last thing I want 

to say about looking at a ratio, several States that 

even have ratios carve out drunk driving cases and cases 

involving intoxication from any other otherwise 

applicable limits. And that's -- I think one reason 

why, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence. And so, I think 

let's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that 

discussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said 

that deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to 

punishment.

Now, I think Exxon's primary argument on 

deterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out 

of our pocket already as a result of this spill, and 

that's a lot of money. The reality is, once they get 

their tax credit and insurance benefits for that money, 

the number is really under 2 billion. But it's still a 

lot of money.

 And so I think it's important to look at the 

district court proceedings involving the Clean Water 

Act, involving the criminal prosecution here, and ask 

whether it makes sense to have Exxon pay additional 

money in punitive damages. We think it is.

 The first thing to understand is that the 

same district judge that saw the criminal proceedings in 

this case sat over our trial. He understood what the 

criminal case was about, and what it was about was the 

environment. That was only thing on the table in the 

criminal case. And so, when we tried to argue --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was a different 

jury. And the jury is the one that set the amount of 

punitive damages.

 MR. FISHER: There was no jury, of course, 

in the criminal case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

case. The district judge reviewed that and said, after 

being instructed in instruction number 36 in our case --

and this is something that we tried -- the chairman of 

Exxon took the stand in trial and gave the jury a chart 

of all the money that Exxon had paid out of its pocket 

and told the jury: We've been deterred enough, so you 

shouldn't award any punitive damages. And the jury, of 

course, rejected that argument that Exxon made.

 And the district judge reviewing that 

decision -- and this is around page 240 to 245 of the 

petition appendix -- the district judge said: I think 

the jury had ample reason to do so. And remember to the 

tune of $5 billion. And so why did the district judge 

think that? Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is the same 

judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's 

negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to 

Exxon, right?

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he was operating 

that under understanding of the law.

 MR. FISHER: Well, not when he was reviewing 

the size of the award, Mr. Chief Justice.

 In the criminal case, the statement of facts 

supporting the guilty plea in the criminal case -- and

remember, we're only talking about environment in the 

criminal case -- and in terms of punishment, the only 

money for punishment in the criminal case is $25 

million. All the rest of the money is, as the district 

court said, to clean up Exxon's mess or to put money 

into the environment.

 Now, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in 

the criminal case, the district judge explained -- or 

I'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement 

that the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis 

for this is that the captain and the third mate were 

negligent. That was the only thing even there.

 It wasn't until our trial and our discovery 

that it was brought out that the complicity of the 

organization ran far deeper. And so at our -- phase 

three of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's 

conduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's 

conduct -- in phase three of our trial we started out 

the closing argument by saying here's the relevant 

evidence for the jury.

 And we played something for the jury called 

Trial Compilation 9. Now, that appears at appears at 

page 1295 of the joint appendix, and we actually 

submitted a videotape that we have submitted to the 

Clerk's office, and it is sitting in the Clerk's office.

There are 50 segments in Trial Compilation 

9, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management 

receiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it 

a gross error to put him in command and so forth, all 

there.

 So it wasn't until the trial in our case 

that it came out how deep the complicity ran in the 

organization and how reprehensible the conduct was.

 And in reviewing the award the district 

judge said: Now, with that level of complicity and 

reprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided 

that Exxon should be punished for this --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the relevance?

 MR. FISHER: -- occurrence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the relevance of the 

leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain, 

did bad things?

 MR. FISHER: We submit that --

JUSTICE BREYER: You seem to be now talking 

about the evidence that they did bad things. But that's 

the leg that they did --

MR. FISHER: The district judge said that 

this is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the 

punitive award.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, doesn't that show,

then, that there had to be a finding that they did the 

bad thing?

 MR. FISHER: No. If you accept our argument 

in the first that to get in the door, all we had to show 

was that a managerial agent was reckless and that 

Captain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial 

agent. When you are reviewing the size of the award --

and I think we're talking about the third question 

presented, the size of the award -- all the -- all the 

evidentiary questions are resolved in favor of us, and 

certainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de 

novo reviews, a lower court understood and told this 

Court what the record was. And it is all about the 

three years that they knew Captain Hazelwood was 

drinking.

 But I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's 

question about deterrence, because even if this Court 

looks at the payments Exxon has made from a perspective 

of deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has 

clearly not been deterred. The first is that Exxon's 

own executives testified to Congress shortly after the 

spill that the results of the spill were, quote, "pretty 

much as we envisioned."

 Now, it was also common knowledge in the 

organization, and this came out at trial, that the idea

of putting a drunken master in charge of a supertanker 

was a potential for disaster and incalculably raised the 

chances of a disaster and a catastrophic spill 

occurring. Knowing all this; knowing what could happen; 

knowing that the industry did not have sufficient 

cleanup equipment to contain a big spill; knowing that 

tens of thousands of Alaskans that depended on Exxon 

taking proactive action, the kind of action that 

Congress had demanded in passing the TAPAA; Exxon 

nonetheless left Captain Hazelwood in command over a 

three-year span. So it wasn't deterred by knowing what 

would happen if the tanker ran aground.

 Even if you look at it from the perspective 

of having paid the money out of its pocket, what did it 

do? It still hadn't been deterred. In the wake of the 

spill, and this is part of Trial Compilation 9, and this 

was part of the argument to the jury, Exxon fired one 

person -- Captain Hazelwood. They reassigned the third 

mate. Everybody else up -- further up the chain of 

command who allowed this to happen received bonuses and 

raises. They have taken no action inside the company to 

express in any meaningful way that they've been deterred 

by what happened in this incident --

they've had to pay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your time is running 

out. And this there's one question I'd like you to 

address, and that is are there other cases against Exxon 

seeking compensation and punitive damages based on this 

oil spill that are still awaiting trial or decision? Or 

is this it?

 MR. FISHER: By definition, 

Justice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so 

this is the one and only time Exxon will face the 

respect of punitive damages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you don't have the 

problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and 

than B, C and D all wanting to --

MR. FISHER: Right. One of the many ways in 

which this case is the mirror image of the due process 

cases that Justice Souter was referring to that caused 

this Court to have such great concern about the uptick 

in punitive damages, here you have a single case. You 

have a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the 

harm that was shown in this case.

 You have -- in contrast to State Farm, in 

the most recent -- second most recent case this case 

had -- in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood 

before this Court having received $500,000 each in

compensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18

going to be paid. What you have today are 32,000 

plaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have 

received only $15,000 for having their lives and

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. DELLINGER: Let me begin by noting that 

it's -- I do not think the Court will find in the record 

that Exxon said this was expected and approved the --

you can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for 

yourself what was -- what was meant by that.

 With respect, it is difficult to decide what 

level of employee should implicate a company; but it is 

divisible I think, as Justice Kennedy suggested. It is 

based on whether that employee has authority over the 

policy, and even a ship captain may have authority over

some policies; he did not here. At the end of the day 

what the Ninth Circuit held was that Exxon was liable --

could be liable for 2.5 billion, simply because against 

its policies, Hazelwood left the deck. That's all that 

we need to be found.

 Now with respect to the -- with respect to 

the amount of punitive damages here, where you are --

punitive damages cases generally look to for the need to 

deter the activity where someone acts out of malice and 

hostility, intending to harm, which is not true here; or 

when a corporation acts out of a profit motive and hopes 

perhaps it will be concealed or that it will make enough 

money off of it. That is not true here. Exxon gains 

nothing by what went wrong in this case, and paid dearly 

for it.

 In the criminal case, the U.S. and Alaska 

agreed that the amount of the penalty was quote, 

"sufficient to provide punishment and deterrence for the 

conduct in question."

 Now if you talk about the -- the amount 

where you have that kind of deterrent, for an 

unintentional act that -- of the amount that's already 

paid, I heard no response to what one would say to 

Justice Kennedy's opinion in State Farm as an outer, 

outer limit. In State Farm the Court said where

compensatory damages are substantial, then perhaps --

this is the constitutional context -- perhaps an amount 

equal to compensatories would be the most.

 What was substantial there was 1 million 

dollars. The compensatories here were 400 or 500 times 

the -- what the Ninth Circuit found -- 504 million 

dollars. Yes?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just as a class, if you 

take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher 

say 15,000 something?

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, from the stand --

first of all, from the stand point of a company it 

doesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million 

dollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms 

of punishment and deterrence.

 But also it is the case that -- that with 

regard to the first plaintiff who had been fully 

compensated, the argument would have been that in light 

of all that happened, there is no need for punishment 

and deterrence even in the first case, and certainly 

cumulatively, when the amount ad reached, say the amount 

of the civil fines of 80 million, one would have said no 

more punitives, because the purpose of punitive damages 

is a public purpose. It is not to compensate the 

individual.

Here we're at 500 times what was considered 

substantial in State Farm. I don't see -- and what is 

that -- that part of State Farm is to be considered a 

dead letter, how one could not see that this is the 

case. But that -- that amount of compensatories is an 

outer limit, because if you look to what the civil 

penalties would be that responsible officials have 

obtained, it is 80.2 million dollars; and when you look 

to the fact that this is a case where, as Justice Breyer 

notes, with the First Circuit opinion, outside the 

fishing context there would have been no compensatories 

paid at all, or owing, because it's consequential 

damages and in most States, the great majority of the 

States, that is not even a compensable -- a compensable 

injury. But it is a special rule for -- for fishing.

 So these are awards -- that would not have 

been done in any case. This was a tragic and terrible 

event, and one for which the company has paid dearly, 

and the -- at the end of the day, the question will be 

whether this Court without any guidance should assume 

that there should a punitive damages remedy in areas 

where Congress has already acted, and whether, if so, 

the plaintiffs have made out any case of an additional 

need for punishment and deterrence beyond what public 

authorities have agreed to.
