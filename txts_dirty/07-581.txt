 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett.

 Mr. Salvatore.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SALVATORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 There are three reasons why this Court 

should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on 

collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum 

selection clauses.

 First, the Second Circuit ignored section 

(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which 

Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their 

employees over anything germane to the working 

environment, including methods of workplace dispute 

resolution.

 The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard 

falls squarely in that authority. Indeed, forbidding 

unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an 

arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the 

labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and 

deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's

national labor policy.

 Second, the Second Circuit failed to 

consider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace 

arbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301.

 Third, the Second Circuit erroneously and 

exclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver. 

Gardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not 

about enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory 

claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salvatore, you take the 

position that the only thing that is at stake here is 

simply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum.

 What do you -- what do you say to the 

argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the 

collective bargaining agreement the employee is subject 

not merely to the right of the union to choose the 

arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim 

at all? What -- what is your answer to that?

 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, in -- in our 

collective bargaining agreement, the collective 

bargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the 

employee tenders the claim to the union. And in the 

majority of cases the -- the employee and the union's 

interests will be aligned, and the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here it wasn't.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. What -- what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here we are dealing with 

claims that the union said: Sorry, we are not going to 

process these claims because we have some tension since 

the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent 

them.

 So you are proposing, as far as I understand 

it, a situation where these workers would have no 

individual right at all if the union says: We -- we 

won't represent you.

 MR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor. The -- the 

clause requires all claims to be arbitrated, and "all 

claims" means that the individuals then have to go to 

arbitration with their private counsel in this case and 

-- and have their claims heard in the arbitral forum. 

So that no one is denying --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does -- where does 

the contract say anything about the -- the individual 

succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the 

union and the employer?

 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, I'm looking at 

the petition appendix.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that only --

only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an 

individual.

MR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor. That's --

that's not the -- the way the contract reads. I'm 

looking at the petition appendix page 48a, which is the 

"no discrimination" clause.

 And just -- just as a quick prelude to --

before I -- I go through that language, I just want to 

-- to note that this argument that these employees were 

not bound to go individually to arbitration was never 

raised below.

 The Second Circuit did not consider it. 

Indeed, the Second Circuit found that the clause covered 

these employees, and -- and this only came up in the 

Respondents' brief in this Court after cert was granted, 

the red brief.

 So that this -- this argument is one that 

the factual premises for were never considered below in 

the district court or in -- in the court of appeals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I'm clear --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't -- I don't wish to 

delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the 

decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the 

background the consideration of the -- that the -- the 

potentiality that the union might do just what it did 

here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our 

decision on the question that you are presenting.

Now, whether or not it's properly raised 

here, I do agree with you it comes rather late. But 

isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?

 MR. SALVATORE: Yes, Your Honor. And --

and, indeed, the collective bargaining agreements --and 

we'll look at the language in one second -- are -- are, 

as this Court has recognized, a little more complicated 

to understand than -- than average contracts. You have 

to look at the practice and the custom.

 The practice here for this union has been to 

turn over claims to the individuals. We've had this 

clause in place for nine years. The New York courts 

have enforced it repeatedly and -- and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this included in the 

question presented anyway?

 MR. SALVATORE: It was -- it was not, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have anything to do 

with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?

 MR. SALVATORE: It does not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Second Circuit simply 

said you could not deprive an individual of the right to 

a court trial.

 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue is whether --

now, if -- if we held that you can require the 

individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we 

could confront the question of whether, if the union is 

in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the 

individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal, 

that would invalidate it.

 But it has nothing to do with the question 

presented: Is an arbitration clause which clearly and 

unmistakably waives the union member's right to a 

judicial forum enforceable.

 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 

That is my argument with respect to why this does not 

need to be taken up now.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I hate to get into 

this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the 

union and -- and the employees.

 MR. SALVATORE: There is no factual record, 

Your Honor, for it in the record at all. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there is at least 

some. The collective bargaining agreement is in here. 

And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to 

decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit 

was correct.

 The question is posed in generalities, but 

we are not going to decide the general question in total

ignorance of this case. And in this case we've got the 

particular collective bargaining agreement in front of 

us, and you started to answer the question that -- that 

I and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the "no 

discrimination" clause.

 MR. SALVATORE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And will -- will you go on 

to that?

 MR. SALVATORE: I will. The clause is -- I 

am looking at petition appendix 48a, the "no 

discrimination" clause. This is the -- the clause at 

issue in this case. It covers any present or future 

employee. It goes on to state the -- the types of 

protected characteristics that are covered by this 

clause as well as the -- the relevant statutes 

incorporating statutory law, public law, in the -- in 

the clause.

 And then in the second-to-last sentence five 

lines up from the bottom it states: "All such claims 

shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration 

procedure, Articles 5 and 6, as the sole and exclusive 

remedy for violations."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean? Does 

that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the 

union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so

insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?

 MR. SALVATORE: What this means, Justice 

Scalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court. 

They have to go either through the union, as has been 

the practice here, or the union will turn the claim over 

to them and let them go by themselves.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where did we get this 

phrase -- where do we get the language "or the union 

will turn over to them"? The only thing that I can see 

in here that addresses that is on page 46a. And the --

the clause there reads: "All union claims are brought 

by the union alone, and no individual shall have the 

right to compromise or settle any claim without the 

written permission of the union."

 There is -- there is a lot of gray area in 

that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the 

union has total control over any claim, including an 

arbitration claim.

 And that seems to lend some substance to the 

-- to the point made by the other side that if we accept 

your position here, we are accepting a position not 

nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural 

designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in 

fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory 

Federal right is also being ceded. Now, why doesn't

that language from section 46 support that?

 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, it does not 

support it for the -- for the following reason. The --

the section 30 clause on page 48a. The "no 

discrimination" clause, was added in 1999. It was added 

after the Court's decision in Wright. It was added to 

comply with Wright. That's an undisputed fact.

 It -- it was added as a separate section 

with a separate arbitration promise because "all claims" 

is broader than "union claims." "Union claims" was 

something that goes back for 75 years, but before we put 

in section 30 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, "all such 

claims" -- "such claims" refers among other things to 

the statutory right.

 MR. SALVATORE: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the statutory right 

is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement 

and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration 

agreement, then it follows that the union has got 

ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory 

right.

 MR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor, not unless 

-- not if the union turns that over. The employee's 

reading --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where -- where is the 

guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want 

to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has 

the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to 

sue? Where do you find that?

 MR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, that -- that 

right is -- is described from this language, "all such 

claims." There is another route. What Articles 4, 5, 

and 6 describe is that -- that the -- you must go to the 

office of the contract arbitrator, and it doesn't 

specify whether you go with the union or you go by 

yourself.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Has any court decided this 

issue of the interpretation of the collective bargaining 

agreement in this particular.

 MR. SALVATORE: No court has decided this 

very issue like this, Justice Alito. But what the New 

York courts have said is in interpreting this clause 

over the last nine years, that they compel the 

individual union member to go to arbitration when they 

have brought claims in court in violation of this 

clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salvatore, I -- I 

didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the 

specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this

particular contract, which is not an issue of national 

importance. Why -- why must we decide the case here?

 Could we not simply decide that the Second 

Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would 

be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you 

cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining 

agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of 

Title VII claims? Why couldn't we just decide that?

 And then if there is any issue of whether 

such concession to the union deprives an individual of 

even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be 

decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?

 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Second Circuit 

could look into all of these details.

 MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And inquire into the New 

York law that you're talking about now and that I don't 

recall being in any of the briefing.

 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Scalia, as cited in 

our briefing, there is a long footnote listing the 

cases. But -- but you're right, the -- the issue here 

really is can the union agree to this? And that goes to 

Congress's giving the union the power under section 9(a) 

of the National Labor Relations Act to be the exclusive

bargaining representative --

JUSTICE BREYER: I ask you -- let me ask you 

a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a 

misunderstanding. But my understanding is that suppose 

you are -- you are an employee. You believe your 

employer discriminated against you, say, on gender 

grounds. You have to go to the EEOC.

 Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often 

what they do is they don't really resolve it. They just 

give you a letter that gives you a right to sue.

 So here Congress was so worried about this 

kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you 

know, won't be the bottom line. People will go there 

and then they have a right to sue later.

 Now, that's how Congress felt about this 

particular statute. Why would they want the union to be 

the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself 

hasn't agreed? I mean, the employee might agree in the 

first place. He might say I'm going to take that 

letter, I'm not going to bring my suit. That's up to 

him or her. But here the employee wants to bring her 

suit, just like the EEOC letter.

 MR. SALVATORE: Well, Justice Breyer, the 

ADEA provides not only a right to go to court after 

you've gotten your right-to-sue letter or waited 60

days, but -- but it also provides multiple, as this 

court recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that 

Congress wants to use: Conciliation, persuasion, 

conference --

JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. That's my point, 

is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable 

effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass 

and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to 

court probably can do it. It's not definite. The EEOC 

doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right 

to sue, but probably can do it.

 And if that's a situation where you have 

this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is 

a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the 

union and the employer together to be able to cut that 

right to sue off, at least not very easily.

 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Breyer, you have 

competing policies here because you have the policies of 

the labor laws which say that unions should have a -- a 

broad portfolio of -- of topics to bargain about. This 

Court has said that anything germane to the working 

environment, dispute resolution mechanisms --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the union could not 

bargain about these anti-discrimination rights. These 

are rights given to individuals by Congress. The union

couldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about 

collective rights, the way it bargains about wages and 

hours and -- and other things. This is, this is not a 

bargainable right. This is a right Congress says you as 

an individual have a right not to be discriminated 

against. This is nothing that the union can bargain 

about.

 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Ginsburg, I agree to 

the degree we're talking about -- you're talking about 

substantive rights. What we are talking about here is a 

procedural switch. As this Court has approved in 

Gilmer, what we are talking about is moving the forum 

from the judicial one to the -- to the arbitral one. 

And here in the -- the scheme of a collective bargaining 

agreement where arbitration is the preferred remedy and 

has been used for many, many years very successfully in 

the -- in the -- by those parties.

 It's -- it's taking employment arbitration 

and putting it in the collective bargaining context. 

And -- and there is, unions do this in many different 

ways. Unions bargain about substantive rights. We are 

not talking about substantive rights here, though. We 

are talking about procedural rights. And the policies 

of the labor laws are served and the policies of the 

ADEA and the anti-discrimination statutes are not

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salvatore, would you --

would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that 

says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union 

arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate 

it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on 

his own?

 MR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's the 

practice under this agreement, Your Honor. We would --

we would wholeheartedly endorse that -- that rule 

because, that's the practice here. And there is -- when 

you're talking about statutory rights, why would the 

union want to interfere with the ability of the employee 

to get a forum if their interests are not aligned? This 

goes to the tension that this Court has -- has 

recognized in its prior cases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that means 

that if there is z totally frivolous claim and the 

employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going 

to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to 

then proceed? The employer hasn't gotten very much.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He has got an arbitration 

instead of a lawsuit.

would answer the question. The employer hasn't gotten

 MR. SALVATORE: Justice Kennedy, the

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the hard cases.

 MR. SALVATORE: Well, in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it hasn't got the 

ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous 

claims.

 MR. SALVATORE: Well that's true. The 

union -- the union wouldn't play that function, except 

that we have in this industry, the real estate industry 

in New York City, a longstanding relationship that --

that goes back decades. And -- and -- so it's a mature 

collective bargaining arrange -- arrangement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm 

not sure that employers nationwide would -- would --

would accept -- would accept that view.

 MR. SALVATORE: Well, I think that --

that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case.

figure out is what the scope of their collective 

bargaining arrangement should be. That's one of the 

hallmarks of the NRLA. So, yes, some collective 

bargaining parties may make that choice, Justice 

Kennedy; others may make a different choice.

 What is the alternative here? The 

alternative is that employers can bypass the union. 

They can just go around the union and -- and have 

individual Gilmer agreements signed up. That's what the 

D.C. Circuit said en banc in -- in -- in the ALPA Pilots 

case.

 And indeed, the -- the union in that case 

was arguing the position that we are arguing here, that 

this is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and this is 

right in the union's portfolio of -- of what they should 

be using to -- to bargain with the employer because it's 

a procedural right and there are no substantive outcomes 

that are diminished in any way whatsoever.

 Unions are deemed trustworthy enough to 

bring lawsuits in the federal courts on behalf of their 

members. Under principles of associational standing, 

associational standing, the members are bound by 

their -- their union's actions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And nonmembers, too? 

What about the people who -- who are not members of the

union, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the 

union's services in collective bargaining? They would 

be bound as well? They couldn't --

MR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice 

Ginsburg. The -- the -- the -- and this type of service 

is one of the core functions that an agency payer would 

have to pay for. The LM2 that 32B, the local, filed 

here on behalf of 80,000 employees has two agency fee 

payers out of 80,000. So it's not really an issue in 

this case.

 But that's what unions are for. When 

Congress makes them the exclusive bargaining 

representative you're -- you're in for it one way or the 

other. You're -- you're -- either you're in or you're 

out. And if you're in, then you have to go along with 

the -- the -- the entire collective bargaining deal that 

is made --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- the -- fine.

 I -- I grasp your answer to that. But you 

said that the employee would have the absolute right if 

the union says, "sorry, for whatever reason we can't 

represent you," absolute right to that arbitral forum. 

What -- who pays then?

 I mean, if the union is in it, then the 

union and the employer are going to split -- split the

cost. But what happens when the union drops out and you 

have the individual and the employer in this arbitral 

forum?

 MR. SALVATORE: In -- in this situation the 

employer pays. That's the only -- the Office of the 

Contract Arbitrator is an -- essentially a mini-

American Arbitration Association that these parties have 

set up, and the -- the RAB, which is the multi- employer 

organization that represents all the real estate 

employers in -- in New York, they pay for the 

arbitration, because the union in this case has said we 

are not going to pay.

 As you point out rightly, if the union is 

not involved, they -- they shouldn't pay. So there is 

no cost to the employee for that arbitration and -- and 

as Justice Edwards said in the D.C. Circuit Kohl case, 

that -- that that procedure is -- is a fair one, to have 

the employer pick up the -- the costs given -- given the 

-- the balance between the -- the two of them.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salvatore, are you 

going to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver 

before you're all through?

 MR. SALVATORE: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, 

Justice Stevens. Gardner-Denver is -- is a case, as 

this Court has described, that -- that didn't involve

the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate. The 

Gardner-Denver line of cases, McDonald and Barrentine 

and Gardner-Denver, had the quite different issue as 

this Court said in Gilmer, of whether a contract-based 

claim precludes subsequent judicial resolution of a 

statutory claim; and so that distinguishes the rule. 

But factually these cases are very different as -- as 

well.

 Mr. Alexander in Alexander v. 

Gardner-Denver, the contract there, the collective 

bargaining agreement, had a plain vanilla arbitration 

clause. It didn't have a clause like the one we looked 

at page, petition appendix 48a, that incorporated all 

the -- the statutes and gave the arbitrator the power to 

sit and -- and to apply those statutes and apply the law 

under those statutes and apply the remedies that derive 

from those statutes. In that case, the arbitrator sat 

as the proctor of the bargain between the collective 

bargaining parties, and didn't have that broad 

authority, as this Court has -- has recognized.

 And -- and we agree that arbitration that --

that resolves just a collective bargaining agreement 

claim should not be dispositive of a statutory claim. 

They're fish and fowl. So that Gardner-Denver is 

correctly decided. Gardner-Denver puts out the rule for

-- for that situation. This is a different situation 

that we are talking about.

 And -- and here, unlike in Gardner-Denver, 

where Mr. Alexander would have had no access to the --

to have his Title VII claim heard if this Court had 

affirmed the Tenth Circuit, he -- the door to the 

courthouse would have been shut in that case for 

Mr. Alexander -- here we are trying to move to compel 

arbitration so that there is a forum, and -- and that 

these individuals -- these employees --

 MR. SALVATORE: An arbitral forum, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salvatore, would you 

just clarify something for me? I thought that the union 

ceded its rights to the employees and said that they 

could use this collective bargaining agreement's 

arbitral regime so long as they paid for it. But you 

tell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer 

pays everything.

 MR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's correct. 

That's the union counsel's affidavit. He was saying he 

doesn't -- the union doesn't want to pick up the costs, 

Justice Ginsburg, but the collective bargaining

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Second Circuit's judgment should be 

affirmed for three reasons. First, a collective 

bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control 

over workers' grievances. Second, unions have inherent 

conflicts of interest with respect to individual 

statutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions 

lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual 

workers' substantive ADEA rights.

 With respect to the first point, a 

collective bargaining agreement generally gives the 

union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances 

on behalf of workers and how such grievances are 

pursued. In such circumstances -- which is this case, 

the workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to

arbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to 

satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively 

vindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination 

rights.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Under your first point, are 

you saying it's impossible for there to be a collective 

bargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore 

reads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective 

bargaining agreement which says that the union's -- that 

the grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done 

either by the union, or if the union declines to pursue 

it, by the individual employee?

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, I've looked 

comprehensively through the cases. We've never found a 

collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of 

interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case. 

Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective 

bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the 

rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to 

vindicate that? I would acknowledge it's theoretically 

possible, but it has to be done within the confines of 

whether there is actual consent by the individual to the 

arbitration, whether the individual has control over the 

mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the 

structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates

the individual's substantive rights.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But there is nothing in 

Federal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of 

a collective bargaining agreement like that.

 MR. FREDERICK: Nothing except this Court's 

case in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may 

not bargain away an individual's rights where there 

would be a conflict between the union's interests and 

the individual's. Here, because this is a 

discrimination claim, unions are often brought as 

defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances 

as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that 

gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by 

these workers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even in a case in which you 

don't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of 

argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or 

the conflict issue. I understood you elsewhere to be 

arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing, 

intelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose 

a collective bargaining agreement will never include. 

So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of 

your argument that in any -- in any case in which 

arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a 

right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer --

there would have to be, not merely the collective 

bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the 

employee to -- to go ahead and do that. Is that right?

 MR. FREDERICK: That -- that's correct. And 

that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential 

here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito. Because in 

Gilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be 

such individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself, 

and knowing and individual waiver is necessary before 

the person can waive the substantive ADEA rights. That 

would need to be part of the hypothetical collective 

bargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice 

Alito.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would that mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Go ahead.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would that mean that the 

employer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration 

requirement on employees?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think that would follow, 

as that would be a condition of employment that could 

not be imposed. The airline --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't be 

unilaterally imposing, right? He would say if you're 

going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that

could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual 

employee. And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole 

benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't 

happen. You say, well, the employer has a lot of 

leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would 

not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the 

individual and the company.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but there are two different points at which the 

condition of employment arose. I understood the 

questions on this side to be after the agreement had 

taken place and the worker was already on the work site. 

Under your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance 

to the work force and is asked, "will you sign this," 

there is individual consent in that circumstance. That 

is the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the one thing that's 

uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective 

bargaining agreement alone can never subject the 

employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?

 MR. FREDERICK: That's -- that's how we read 

this Court's statutory --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is also true -- is that 

also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of 

suit?

machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate 

notice or so forth. Is your view the same there?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that those 

category of cases do stand in a different position 

because there is less of an inherent conflict of 

interest. The union there --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the union is not going 

to be the Defendant typically in a tort case where the 

employer is responsible.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't this allow 

discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination 

by the employer?

 MR. FREDERICK: It refers to discrimination, 

and as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are 

provisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are 

specifically directed at union discrimination. The 

legislative history of these statutes indicates that 

discrimination by unions was one of the concerns 

animating Congress --

particularly; it just talks about discrimination.

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. In fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So you think 

sometimes unions do discriminate?

 MR. FREDERICK: And that's why --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And sometimes 

unions also would rather have the more effective machine 

or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to 

read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can 

replicate anything you might think. We can think of 

tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and 

employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of 

discrimination suits. Most unions don't want 

discrimination. I mean, most of the time. And most 

unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time.

 So if I decide for you in this case, am I 

also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort 

suits or contract suits or just whether or not the 

workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites? 

I mean, you know?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think, Justice Breyer, 

that the discrimination cases do stand in a different 

category because of the inherent conflict of the --

Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason 

why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that 

I see no more reason today why a union would like 

discrimination, then I can see a reason why they would 

like a dangerous machine?

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think Congress --

JUSTICE BREYER: If I think that, then I 

should decide against you?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, because there are 

two other reasons: The exclusive control over the 

machinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper.

 I'm not aware of tort suits being subjects 

of collective bargaining, Justice Breyer. Nor am I 

aware of cases in which the unions have given up 

individuals' tort claims in situations, principally 

because unions are not the persons against whom such 

tort suits are brought.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but those -- I'm 

sorry.

 Those examples are examples. You're getting 

down to individual cases. I thought you drew the global 

line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's 

question by saying the -- in the cases that we're

a specific individual right and that individual right 

cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in 

violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the 

global line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at 

the individual situation rather than draw a categorical 

line.

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, you would, but the 

principles this Court has applied in looking at that 

broad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be 

situations in which those principles, where the union is 

serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person 

to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context, 

to be not --

getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to 

have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has 

in effect a tort claim which is subject to an

question because what I'm thinking is simply that there 

are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims 

that people go to arbitration over. And what I'm 

wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of 

such claims that I have now said that a union, through a 

collective bargaining contract, can force the employee 

against his will to go to arbitration over? I don't 

have a feeling for that from the briefs. I don't have a 

feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims 

are special in that regard, that there's no line in that 

regard, or that there's some other line.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Breyer, I 

think that your question really is getting at the theory 

behind collective bargaining agreements and what extent 

the union can exercise control over the individual 

rights and circumstances of employment. That question 

is a very complex question over which many, many --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can you give me a 

hint as to the principle?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREDERICK: I -- well, I think that 

there are limits, of course, on the union's authority 

that have been recognized in this Court's decisions, and 

I don't think that ruling in the workers' favor in this 

circumstance opens up any kind of Pandora's box at all,

because all we are arguing for is that the 

Gardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court 

unanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of 

the land, as the Court has reaffirmed --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if a collective 

bargaining agreement requires the arbitration of 

discrimination claims that are not based on Federal law? 

Maybe they are based on -- they are based on State law 

that goes further than Federal law, or maybe they are 

based on a type of discrimination that's prohibited 

neither by Federal or State law. Maybe it's 

discrimination against young people under 40. Could 

those be -- those would still be discrimination claims 

with the same potential for -- with a potential for a 

conflict of interest. Could they be subjected to 

mandatory arbitration?

 MR. FREDERICK: I -- I think that is a 

harder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer 

under this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points 

the way here, in footnote 19 of the decision. Where the 

union controls that process and where the union is a 

potential defendant in that circumstance, the workers' 

individual rights cannot be subordinated --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --

MR. FREDERICK: -- to the union's control.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if it's not a 

statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge? One 

practical problem is so often these are overlapping 

claims. You can say, "I was discriminated against 

before because of my age. I was arbitrarily 

discriminated against. It was a wrongful discharge. It 

was a discharge without just cause." Usually, there's 

multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would 

be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I 

mean if it was just a question of the worker says, "I 

was discharged without just cause," no Title 7 or 

anything else, that would come under the arbitration 

clause, wouldn't it?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, and I think that there 

have been conditions of employment and discharge that 

have been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a --

an issue there where -- except where that intersection 

with the statutory discrimination rights occurs. And 

Congress has made a different policy judgment with 

respect to individual waivers of such rights in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why has it? Why has it? I 

mean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is 

that he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two 

months. Now, you can't take away my right to that 

unless I voluntarily waived it. What is sacrosanct

about the fact that my grievance here has some 

discrimination attached to it?

 Your briefing talks as though it is 

something totally apart from a mere economic right. 

Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about 

economics. "I was fired because of discrimination." "I 

wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore 

I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of 

money."

 Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the 

employee would have to go through the union-prescribed 

arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the 

last three months but does not have to do it for an 

economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I'm not sure actually 

in answering your hypothetical that they would 

necessarily have to go through the union on the 

nonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case. 

This Court in Barrentine said that, where an FSLA claim 

is at issue, the worker does not -- is not confined or 

precluded after arbitrating at the union grievance 

process from bringing an FLSA suit in court.

 So I want to reserve, accepting all of your

in the discrimination context, you're talking about more 

than just money. Here my clients are older workers who 

are forced into more physically strenuous positions that 

they had gotten away from by virtue of their growth in 

seniority at the building.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that 

kind of conflict always present whenever you have 

collective action? I mean, you may be a particularly 

good worker and could demand a higher wage than the 

union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the 

collective bargaining agreement. That happens in every 

situation where you have collective action.

 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but where Congress has made a choice that 

individual claims for individual anti-discrimination 

rights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and 

where this Court's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't 

have to be vindicated in particular ways. The 

individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and 

they would be -- the arbitration would be binding.

 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but there is 

individual consent in that circumstance. I would like 

to make a couple of other points before closing. 

One is that on pages 4 to 5 in the brief in opposition

to cert we specifically raise the issue that the union 

controls the arbitration, and there is no opportunity 

for individual arbitration under this collective 

bargaining agreement.

 There is nothing in the provision set out in 

the petition appendix that gives individual rights, the 

individuals the right to arbitrate under this collective 

bargaining agreement. The payment provision calls for 

50 percent by the employer and 50 percent by the 

employee with the employer having the sole right to 

terminate the arbitrator for any or no reason at all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You did raise that issue, 

but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue 

was that you win. You said the consequence of the fact 

that that issue was involved in this case was a good 

reason not to -- for us to accept cert. And we didn't 

take your advice on that.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's a totally 

different issue whether because of that question you --

you should -- you should win the case.

 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, the 

interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is 

fairly included within the question presented. And as 

this Court found in Wright in a situation where it

granted certiorari on the very same question here but 

then looked at the specific provisions of the collective 

bargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under 

the facts there a different rule applied for a clear and 

unambiguous waiver.

 All we are saying here is that under this 

provision there is no opportunity for the individual to 

arbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to 

the one that is in Wright. We think that is fairly 

included within the question presented, and that the 

Court can affirm on that basis, certainly where the 

Second Circuit had relied on precedent that said that 

where the individual doesn't have a right, that it is 

union control of arbitration. That is consistent with 

Gardner-Denver.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be 

within the question presented. You -- you can sustain 

the judgment below on any ground.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The only question is 

whether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire 

into new ground. That's all.

 MR. FREDERICK: My only point is that this 

is one of these fuzzy areas where we are not making 

independent, alternate ground of affirmance. I think

our argument is fairly included within the question 

presented and can be affirmed on the basis of that 

argument.

 If the court has no further questions --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument 

that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting 

the employee to a worse situation because the employer 

will simply say: Fine, I don't have to bargain anything 

with the union. If you want to work in this workplace, 

you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no 

access to the court, and you have to -- just like in 

Gilmer, just like in Circuit City.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

guess I would answer that question by saying we will pay 

our money and take our chances in the sense that the 

unions here are supporting the workers where the unions 

are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of 

interest, and the question of whether or not imposing 

arbitration on the individual workers would be a 

condition of employment. That is a question that you 

can safely leave for another day.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they may go 

the other way. They may say: Look, we don't like to 

arbitrate. In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit 

to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these

claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees.

 Most of them like the idea that the union is 

going to stand up for them and take it to management, 

but they could say: Look, we don't want it. If -- if 

you are discriminated against, you know, sue us.

 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, in fact, 

empirically that is not correct. There is a study that 

is cited in a footnote in one of the amicus briefs that 

arbitration is more expensive than bringing civil 

litigation. And it is because the -- under -- under 

their provision if you pay 50 percent of the 

arbitrator's costs, you can run up quite a big tab that 

you would not have to pay --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under my 

scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for 

arbitration. There would be -- there would be no 

arbitration at all.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, under your scenario, I 

think where the employer would control the arbitral 

process, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his 

bread.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There is no 

arbitration. The employer says: Look, I don't think I 

discriminate. I've got a good record. I'm not going to 

agree to arbitrate claims. I'm going to make people go

to court because there will be fewer claims brought.

 MR. FREDERICK: And -- and that has been the 

law for 30 years, and we think it should continue to be 

the law, Mr. Chief Justice.

 If the marketplace is going to help weed out 

those claims, that's certainly the province of lawyers 

taking these cases and clients deciding whether or not 

to tell everybody to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is 

there are benefits to employees from arbitration as 

well.

 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The employer may not 

agree to it. If he doesn't have any protection, if it 

doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to 

court, what's the -- what's the point?

 MR. FREDERICK: That's why this Court has 

always said that individual consent and agreement is a 

fundamental precept of arbitration. Where that 

agreement is absent, a worker should not be forced. 

Thank you.

Mr. Frederick.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: Respondents' fundamental right to a 

workplace free of invidious, class-based discrimination 

is something their union has no power to barter away in 

collective bargaining, and the union --

JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I just want to be sure 

that at some point you answer this question, if you can.

 I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, 

as I see it, is just what you said: When can a union 

require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a 

court case in an instance where the union member has not 

signed a special waiver? That's the question, right? 

Okay.

 And what I think some of us were struggling 

for here is: If we say yes to you they can force them, 

or no to you they can't, what's the principle?

 Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend 

to think they can force the worker into arbitration is 

where the right grows out of the collective bargaining 

agreement, period.

 Then we have what we were talking about with 

Justice Souter, a common law tort claim. Then we might

have a State law giving a claim. Then we might have a 

Federal law like this one giving a claim.

 And we just heard -- I would assume if 

Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response 

was, which was the FSLA: Oh, well, maybe we can't, you 

know, force the worker to give that one up either.

 So what is the line here that we are drawing 

with this case? Is it a line that says discrimination 

laws, Federal or special? Federal laws are special? 

State laws are special? Common law is special? 

Collective bargaining, too? What is the principle?

 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Breyer. This 

Court's cases have not yet described a specific law, and 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I am asking you 

for the principle.

 MR. GANNON: I think that the -- the best 

line that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver 

and Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are 

related to collective activity, and especially economic 

activity, are the kinds of things that are normally 

delegated to the union. Those are the sorts of things 

that the union can actually engage in collective 

bargaining about. And when the union negotiates the 

underlying right, then it makes perfect sense that the

labor arbitration framework that's set forth here would 

continue to resolve disputes that are arising under --

out of that specific right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why doesn't this 

come within that?

 MR. GANNON: Because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't many of these 

cases, if not most of them, come within that? The union 

negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the 

person says: I should be at this level. The only 

reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated 

against.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think, Justice 

Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you call it a 

non-economic theory. Phooey, it's an economic case.

 MR. GANNON: But I think what's important, 

Justice Scalia, is -- is, though -- is the line that the 

Court stated in Barrentine: That if a statute is 

designed to give specific, minimum protection to 

individual workers, then that's the sort of thing that 

the union doesn't have the power to engage in collective 

bargaining over.

 And so your salary may well be something 

that the union can normally bargain about. But if you

want to assert that the -- that the employer or the 

union -- because both are the types -- the types of 

entities that can be charged with discrimination under 

Title VII or the ADA or these other statutes -- the 

reason that they gave you a lower salary was on the 

basis of something for which you had a Federal statutory 

protection, then -- then you have an independent 

statutory right that the union's majoritarian 

decisionmaking processes should not be in the process of 

controlling --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not taking away the 

right. The -- the union is not taking away the right. 

It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to 

arbitration instead of to the courts.

 MR. GANNON: Yes. And the difference is 

that the union is making the decision about where the 

claim will be vindicated. And in this case in 

particular, the union is going to control whether the 

claim will actually be able to be officially vindicated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -- you have 

focused on the fact that Congress has given individual 

rights. But for the many matters that you say are the 

subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a 

statute. I don't need a statute to negotiate with 

someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour

for a particular job. And, yet, that is something that 

you give up when you join the union, and you are subject 

to collective bargaining.

 MR. GANNON: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't it 

-- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights? 

Why aren't they subject to collective bargaining as 

well?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- even the employer 

here is not claiming that the underlying statutory right 

is subject to collective bargaining. They are just 

saying --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I am --

the -- the forum for asserting the right.

 MR. GANNON: Well, in this instance Congress 

gave individual employees the right to bring a civil 

action in a judicial forum as a means of enforcing their 

antidiscrimination claims. And although arbitration may 

always provide an alternative forum for that, this Court 

has repeatedly made clear that arbitration is always a 

matter of contract. And it does not impose on the 

employer any more than on the employee a requirement 

that they arbitrate a claim when they --

employer want to agree to arbitration under this system?

He gets nothing from it. You said you get the ben -- to 

arbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.

 MR. GANNON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

don't think that that's true. Since 1974, this has been 

the law of the land, and it's been even after Gilmer in 

every circuit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just begs the 

question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is 

correct.

 MR. GANNON: Well, it -- it is the 

prevailing interpretation in every circuit that has 

considered the question since Gilmer except the Fourth 

Circuit. And if you look at the empirical data that's 

mentioned in some of amicus briefs, including the 

particular amicus brief of the National Academy of 

Arbitrators, it is true that even when there is just a 

labor arbitration machinery that was invalid under the 

terms of Gardner-Denver and would not be binding on the 

employee if the employee happens to lose in that 

arbitration, in most of those cases when the employee 

loses that arbitration, he does not go on to file an 

independent case in federal court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position -- so 

their position is going to hurt most employees, because 

assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union

gets something in return for agreeing to that. I don't 

know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree 

to arbitrate all these claims. Well, you don't get that 

anymore, because and employer is not going to agree to 

arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to 

arbitrate.

 MR. GANNON: Well, we don't think that there 

is any reason why the employees will not be able to make 

a grievance with the employers, as was made possible in 

Gilmer. And so that the point is that it just can't be 

a vicarious agreement to arbitration on behalf of the 

individual.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the employees 

have no -- no leverage. I mean, if the -- if the 

employer wants to say, look, if you want to work here, 

look, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees 

don't have bargaining leverage. That's the whole reason 

you have a union.

 MR. GANNON: Well, there was an argument in 

Gilmer that they didn't have leverage, either. And the 

Court stressed that as long as the employee has actually 

agreed to it, that -- and -- and as long as the arbitral 

forum is going to be adequate to provide for effective 

vindication of the underlying statutory rights, then --

then the arbitral forum would be adequate.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the employer did 

have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it 

tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration 

form, could the union in its collective bargaining 

negotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and 

that you shall not impose this obligation?

 MR. GANNON: Well, that's -- as 

Mr. Frederick mentioned and is as discussed in several 

of the briefs, that's an undecided question of labor 

law. The National Labor Relations Board --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking in your view if 

it came up to it, how would that be decided --

MR. GANNON: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I'm concerned it's 

the same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just 

don't think the employer is going to get very much under 

this interpretation. And that may, ultimately, hurt the 

employee.

 MR. GANNON: We think that as long as the 

employee have been -- have been able to indicate exactly 

the same level of individual agreements that was upheld 

in Gilmer and that the arbitral forum itself is going to 

be adequate, that that takes care of that half of the 

question.

has -- which would be entitled to deference on this 

question and which has never spoken to the labor law 

question of what role the unions might be able to play 

in helping facilitate the agreements negotiated between 

the employers and the individual employees, it could 

come out in at least three different ways.

 One of them is the arrangement outlined in 

the Abbott D.C. Circuit decision that -- that 

Petitioners rely upon. But, of course, that's an 

instance where there were two completely separate 

agreements that the employment arbitration was agreed to 

by the employees before they are even represented by the 

union. It was at the outset of the establishment of the 

employment relationship, which Mr. Frederick discusses.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't it boil down --

doesn't your argument really boil down to this: That 

the only case in which it's really going to matter is 

the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a 

clause that gives the union plenary authority over the 

disposition of the claim? And I say that for this 

reason. If -- if this is outside the subject of 

mandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it; 

in effect, as a matter of individual contract.

 If it's within the subject of mandatory 

bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee

also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he 

is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only 

case in which it's going to make any difference as to 

whether you win or he wins is the case in which the 

agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union 

plenary authority to dispose of the claim.

 Isn't that correct?

 MR. GANNON: Well, not necessarily, Justice 

Souter, because there are all sorts of other attributes 

of the arbitral forum that might -- might well be 

relevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to 

effectively been -- rights. In Gilmer itself, the Court 

specifically considered whether the employee, 

Mr. Gilmer, would have an opportunity to play a role in 

selecting the arbitrator.

 In this instance, even under Petitioner's 

view of the CBA, which we don't think is supported by 

the text of the CBA, this -- these employees are still 

stuck with an arbitrator who has been chosen by the 

employer and by the union. And those are the two 

entities that have already decided that their claim is 

meritless.

Souter's question, if those variables are satisfied,

collective interest of the union and the individual 

interests of the employees, especially in 

anti-discrimination statutes.

 MR. SALVATORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief

straighten out this business it seems about who pays? 

Mr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid 

by the employee. If the union bows out and there is 

just the employer and the employee in the arbitration, 

that employee would have to pick up 50 percent. I think 

I understood him to say that.

determined that these costs be shared is that if -- if 

the union is not involved in a case, the employer pays. 

And -- and so, that's -- I mean, that's right from the

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that written down 

somewhere?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear?

 MR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's the -- the 

agreement between the collective bargaining parties. 

It's not -- it's not written down beyond that -- that --

that place. The office -- that place in the contract. 

The office of the contract arbitrator is -- is -- is a 

place. It's an arbitration forum. It's like going to 

the American Arbitration Association.

 It has hearing rooms. It -- it -- there --

it has administrators who assign the arbitrators. The 

arbitrators aren't picked out of -- you know, by one 

side or the other. Yes, they are put on the panel by --

by the bargaining parties, but they are picked by a case 

administrator.

 There's 700 arbitrations that go on in this 

industry every year and that's why instead of going to 

the American Arbitration Association, these parties a 

long time ago set up their own. A couple --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the -- if the idea is 

that the union sees this right to the worker, then 

doesn't have to -- doesn't the burden go with the right

as well? I mean, the -- if the union would pay, you're 

saying that the employer will just accept that the 

employer picks up the entire tab?

 MR. SALVATORE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And 

there are -- are several points. First, there is no 

conflict here in this case. The union did the right 

thing. It turned the claim over to the individual 

employees with their private counsel and let them go 

arbitrate it themselves. They refused. This isn't a 

Magnavox situation. The union is not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, they didn't turn it 

over, did they, until the action had been brought in the 

Federal court? I mean, they didn't -- maybe I'm wrong 

in this, but I didn't think that on day one they -- they 

said, oh, well, because the union doesn't want to 

proceed with this, you're welcome to chug ahead by 

yourself.

 MR. SALVATORE: Let me explain that time 

frame, Justice Souter. What happened here was the claim 

was originally tendered by these employees to the union 

to bring an arbitration. The union decided after the 

first hearing day with the arbitrator that they couldn't 

go forward for whatever reasons -- it's not in the 

record -- and then they, several months went by, these 

employees filed with their counsel at the EEOC under

Waffle House, we did nothing and waited and the --

representing the employers, and then the -- the lawsuit 

was filed.

 At that point the record is clear that 

demand was made on -- on the employee's counsel, 

Mr. Kreisberg -- it's in his affidavit -- that -- that 

he returned to Arbitrator Pfeiffer to the pending 

arbitration and continue in that forum, and he refused 

to. That was the basis of the motion to compel.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 MR. SALVATORE: Thank you.

 (Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
