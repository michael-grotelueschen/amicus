3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-1231, Sebelius v. Auburn 

Regional Medical Center. 

6  Mr. Kneedler. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Under Part A of the Medicare program, the 

12 Federal government pays out more than $230 billion 

13 annually to more than 30,000 institutional providers, 

14 including more than 6,000 hospitals. The total amount 

to which each of these providers is entitled is 

16 determined by a fiscal intermediary on the basis of a 

17 cost report. 

18  The statute provides that a provider may 

19 obtain a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement 

Review Board, only if he appeals the intermediary's 

21 determination with -- within 180 days. 

22  For the almost 40 years of the existence of 

23 the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, the Secretary, 

24 pursuant to her broad rulemaking authority, has 

prohibited the board from extending that period, and 

3

Official 

1 instead required dismissal of the appeal, except as 


2 specifically provided in the Secretary's own 


3 regulations. 


4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, 


there's a little bit of at least facial incongruity in 

6 your position. 

7  Congress sets in place the 180-day limit. 

8 Then you say, oh, well, that, we can go beyond that. 

9 The Secretary puts in the 3-year limit, and you say 

that's it -- you know, that's the dead drop-off. I 

11 would have thought what Congress says is entitled to 

12 greater weight than what the Secretary says. 

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the 180-day limitation 

14 here is not a limitation applied to suits filed in 

court, in which the court is the relevant tribunal, and 

16 the court has -- has itself construed the statute's 

17 regulating access to the courts or the appellate courts 

18 as a matter -- a matter of internal judicial 

19 administration. 

This deadline governs an appeal within the 

21 Department of Health and Human Services, and that is 

22 something that Congress has delegated the responsibility 

23 to the Secretary to construe the relevant statutes and 

24 to adopt the relevant regulations pursuant to her broad 

rulemaking authority.

1  So in -- in this setting, it is the board 

2 that is the relevant tribunal, and the rules governing 

3 the board's jurisdiction are established --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't mention Union 

7 Pacific in your brief. How can you be calling what 

8 you're doing setting your jurisdictional limits? Didn't 

9 we say, in Union Pacific, that agencies can't do that? 

You can't define your own jurisdiction. 

11  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, you may or may not 

13 be able to establish claim processing rules. That, I 

14 think, is a totally different question. But why do you 

continue to use it as jurisdictional language? 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I was responding to --

17 first of all, the -- the Secretary's regulations have, 

18 from the outset, referred to these limitations as 

19 limitations on the board's jurisdiction. This is --

this is set forth in the -- in the regulations 

21 promulgated --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in that respect, I 

23 think the amici is right. You can't -- if they're 

24 jurisdictional, we've clearly said that equitable 

tolling doesn't apply under any circumstances.

Official 

1  MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And we -- and we 

2 clearly believe that equitable tolling does not apply. 

3 That would be fundamentally inconsistent. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is good cause, 

if not some form of equitable tolling? 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: There is nothing incompatible 

7 between a good cause -- a limited good cause extension 

8 and a jurisdictional rule. 

9  For example, in -- in the several cases that 

this Court has considered finding provisions to be 

11 jurisdictional, the time for taking an appeal and the 

12 time for petitioning for certiorari are both 

13 jurisdictional, but both allow extensions for good 

14 cause. In fact, this Court's decision in Bowles 

involved the extension for good cause. 

16  So the question here for the Secretary --

17 and, again, this is just a narrow question of good 

18 cause. It in no way suggests that equitable tolling 

19 would be -- would be permitted. 

The narrow question is whether the Secretary 

21 permissibly construed the statute to allow a comparable 

22 good cause exception, where -- where something akin to 

23 an act of God would prevent the provider from actually 

24 appealing within the requisite period of time, just like 

the district court can extend the appeal period.

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Court's 

2 decision in Henderson against Shinseki, that also 

3 involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet, we said that 

4 equitable tolling was permissible. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I mean, there are a 

6 number of differences there. I think, technically, it 

7 was not intra-agency. It was an appeal from 

8 the Board of Veterans Appeals to the Court of Veterans 

9 Appeals, which is a separate body. It is not something 

under the jurisdiction of the VA. 

11  The VA was not given rulemaking authority 

12 over that, unlike here, where the board is under the 

13 Secretary's jurisdiction, and, in fact, she has adopted 

14 regulations that have been in place for 40 years, which 

have expressly barred any extensions and treated that 

16 limitation as jurisdictional. 

17  Also, very much unlike Henderson, this 

18 statute is not one comparable to a statute regulating 

19 benefits for veterans, to which there has always been a 

solicitude by Congress and the courts --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Kneedler, do you 

22 think you could do the same thing in the veterans' 

23 benefits context? Because in Henderson, of course, we 

24 dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding 

whether equitable tolling was available. All we were 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 saying was that this was a claims processing rule and 

2 not a jurisdictional rule. 

3  Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then 

4 go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but 

still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we 

6 want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like 

7 the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3 

8 years? Could you do that in Henderson? 

9  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think, in Henderson, 

there would have been the problem that the rule, as I 

11 understand it, was a rule to -- for appealing to the 

12 Court, which was outside the -- the Secretary's 

13 rulemaking authority; whereas, here, this is a body 

14 within HHS over which the Secretary has rulemaking 

authority. 

16  But, yes, we -- we think that the Secretary 

17 clearly had -- and she has very broad legislative 

18 rulemaking authority under this statute -- has the 

19 authority to adopt strict limitations, as she has done 

on that --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could she -- could she 

22 have adopted equitable tolling? 

23  MR. KNEEDLER: I -- we don't think that she 

24 could have. We think that, as we say in our brief, 

quite aside from the Secretary's regulation, we believe 

8

25

Official 

1 the sort of open-ended equitable tolling that the court 

2 of appeals has imposed on this program for the first 

3 time in 40 years is fundamentally inconsistent with a 

4 need for repose, especially given the sophisticated 

nature of these providers, as this Court noted in the 

6 Your Home nursing home case --

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess the question I was 

8 trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a 

9 general principle of administrative law that, when there 

is a claims processing rule that -- that relates only to 

11 internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide 

12 how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow? 

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We -- we certainly do 

14 believe that. 

For -- for -- in the first place, most 

16 agency time limits are established by the agency itself, 

17 pursuant to regulation. So if there had been no 

18 statutory 180-day limitation period here and the 

19 Secretary had adopted a regulation imposing that, then 

whether -- and the extent to which that provision would 

21 be open to extensions for good cause, for some degree of 

22 equitable tolling, whatever the factors, would be up to 

23 the Secretary in construing her own regulation --

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Now, you refer to these --

to the providers as sophisticated, and that certainly is 

9

1 true. But are they really in a position to double-check 

2 the calculation when -- if it were true -- and I know 

3 you don't agree with this -- if it were true that 

4 information needed to make the calculation was 

intentionally withheld, concealed? 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as you say, we do 

7 not -- we do not agree with that. And the findings by 

8 the district court in this case, which was the same 

9 district judge who sat in the Baystate case, disagreed 

with that -- with that conclusion. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that. 

12 But if that were the case, would their sophistication 

13 allow them to double-check this? Or is this just 

14 something that is dependent on data that they cannot 

access? 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it -- it may be more 

17 difficult. This was a situation which required the 

18 matching of data between CMS and the Social Security 

19 administrative -- massive data files of 11 million 

Medicare claims, I think 6 million SSI claims. 

21  And when you have two agencies matching 

22 something, there will be errors. And the -- the 

23 providers did not know --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume for the sake of 

your answer that the error was intentional. Don't try 

10

1 to go to the facts, but assume the error was 

2 intentional. Now, answer Justice Alito's question. 

3  MR. KNEEDLER: There -- it --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There -- that might be a 

contradiction in terms. 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: There may be -- there may be 

7 situations in which the provider would not know that, 

8 but the need -- but the need for finality under this 

9 program, we think, requires an across-the-board rule. 

Otherwise, a provider could come in -- as this Court 

11 suggested in the Your Home case, circumstances --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If this is a claim 

13 processing rule, under what theory could you shield 

14 yourself against fraudulent conduct -- fraudulent 

concealment? Under what theory of law would an agency's 

16 rule be fair and -- and non-arbitrary --

17  MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that shielded it from 

19 fraudulent acts. 

MR. KNEEDLER: First of all, we do not 

21 believe this is an ordinary claims processing rule. We 

22 believe that this is a jurisdictional limitation imposed 

23 by the -- by Congress, interpreted by the Court to allow 

24 this narrow exception. So we do not believe that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do you keep fighting 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 the -- the question? 

2  MR. KNEEDLER: But with -- yes, we do 

3 believe that the Secretary, in the interest of -- of 

4 finality, can impose that sort of limitation. There's a 

presumption of regularity in the -- in the operation 

6 of -- administration of Federal programs. There are 

7 criminal sanctions. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep fighting the 

9 hypotheticals. There is an intent to save money and an 

intent not to use the figures that are specified by 

11 statute, and that is concealed. In that set of 

12 circumstances, if this were a claim processing rule, 

13 would you be authorized to treat -- not to -- not to 

14 permit the action? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We -- we believe the 

16 Secretary would be -- would be required to, and we think 

17 may well be compelled to. But let me point out, if 

18 there was that sort of extraordinary circumstance, then 

19 either Congress or the Secretary could provide a special 

remedy in that situation. 

21  If there was an inspector general's report 

22 that showed widespread fraud in something, I think 

23 Congress or the Secretary could be expected to respond 

24 to that in an appropriate way. The question is whether 

the hard and fast rules that have been adopted should 

12

Official 

1 be -- should be open to general equitable tolling 

2 principles. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, you -- what I 

4 find incompatible in your argument is you -- you assert 

that this is a jurisdictional limitation. 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: Insofar as the board is 

7 concerned. The board has said and the Secretary has 

8 said that the board -- this is jurisdictional, and the 

9 board has no equitable powers to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you think of any other 

11 instance in which we have found something to be a 

12 jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or 

13 agency, subject to that limitation, to extend it? I --

14 I had always thought that once you say it's 

jurisdictional, it means you have to abide by it. 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: As I said, in -- in Bowles, 

17 the Court was dealing with the jurisdictional time limit 

18 for an appeal, but there was a comparable -- there is a 

19 comparable statutory provision for the Court to extend 

that period for good cause. It remains jurisdictional. 

21 That was the point in Bowles. It was -- there was a 

22 question of whether the --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if there is another 

24 statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory 

extension is part of the jurisdictional limitation. 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 That's fine. 

2  But when you just have a jurisdictional 180 

3 days, without any statutory provision for extension, if 

4 it's jurisdictional, I thought that's the end of the 

game. 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And -- and the -- the 

7 question is -- some time limitations have been 

8 understood to contain explicit -- excuse me, explicit or 

9 implicit authorizations for the tribunal concerned. And 

this --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Undoubtedly. But have any 

12 jurisdictional time limitations? 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, you don't need that 

14 label, do you, Mr. Kneedler? You could do just as well 

with a claims processing label. Maybe you could do 

16 better, as Justice Scalia is suggesting, with a claims 

17 processing label, as long as, with that label, comes the 

18 general rule that the agency gets to determine the 

19 extent of discretion as to late filings. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. This is a 

21 mandatory -- this is a mandatory -- even if 

22 nonjurisdictional, it is a mandatory limitation. And 

23 the question is whether the statute contains an implicit 

24 authorization, whether the Secretary could permissibly 

construe it to allow for this narrow good cause 

14

25

Official 

1 exception comparable to the one for extending the 

2 time --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem with taking 

4 that approach, of course -- and I assume why you assert 

that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long 


6 history of both the board and the Secretary regarding 


7 this as jurisdictional. 


8  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that is --


9  JUSTICE SCALIA: They have said it. 


MR. KNEEDLER: -- that is -- that is 

11 correct. But we -- but I think it's also important to 

12 recognize that the -- that this statute was enacted, the 

13 regulations were adopted before this Court's recent 

14 jurisprudence identifying some things as jurisdictional, 

some things as claim processing, primarily focusing on 

16 the judicial situation. 

17  Here, we have a statute governing procedures 

18 in an administrative agency and regulations adopted at a 

19 time before that -- that bifurcated way of looking at 

things arose. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But that --

22 that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle 

23 is. I mean, I would have thought -- but I'm not sure 

24 what you think, that -- that the way to look at these 

cases is, using ordinary principles of statutory 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 interpretation, would a reasonable legislator, having 

2 enacted these words, intend to give the agency a degree 

3 of leeway in interpreting the statute? 

4  Now, if that's the basic question, it helps, 

but isn't determinative whether you classify this as a 

6 claims processing rule or a jurisdictional rule. Those 

7 are conclusions. But, really, it's the question of 

8 leeway that the Congress intended to -- to delegate to 

9 the agency that is determinative. 

If the answer to that question is yes, your 

11 rule stands, regardless of label, and if the answer to 

12 the question is no, it fails regardless of label. 

13  MR. KNEEDLER: That's --- that's correct. 

14 And I want to make clear that under, whatever the answer 

to that precise question, the Respondents in this case 

16 lose because whether -- if it's an absolute rule to 

17 which there can be no exception or the Secretary's 

18 regulation allowing a limited exception is valid, in no 

19 case would the sort of open-ended tolling regime that 

the court of appeals imposed be permissible. 

21  If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of 

22 my time. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

Official 

1  COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE 

2  MR. MANNING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

3 please the Court: 

4  Congress in two ways signaled its intention 

to treat the time limitation prescribed by Subsection 

6 (a)(3) as absolute; that is, as not subject to waiver 

7 and not subject to equitable tolling. 

8  First, Congress chose to locate that 

9 provision in the very part of the statute that defines 

the board's jurisdiction, that is to say, in the part 

11 that determines the class --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It didn't talk about the 

13 board. It talks about what a party can do, not what the 

14 board can or cannot do. 

MR. MANNING: You're entirely -- entirely 

16 right, Justice Sotomayor. It talks about the -- the 

17 right of the provider to get a hearing in the provision 

18 of the statute that -- that determines the class of 

19 cases that the provider may hear. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not the 

21 prototypical limitation that -- that Congress uses when 

22 it intends a jurisdictional limit on a court. 

23  MR. MANNING: No, it's not, Your Honor. But 

24 in several cases, this Court has held that similar 

statutes that are framed in terms of the party's right 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 to invoke the power of the tribunal, that those are 

2 jurisdictional statutes. The Court has never addressed 

3 the question whether they can be -- they must be framed 

4 in terms of the power of the board or in terms of the 

right of the party to invoke the power of the board. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have talked about 

7 what the -- the fact that there almost is a presumption 

8 of a claims processing rule, rather than jurisdictional, 

9 unless Congress is clear about that. 

What policy supports an argument that we 

11 should be reading limitations of this kind as 

12 jurisdictional, particularly when, on the same day the 

13 statute was passed, the agency, invoking its regulatory 

14 powers, treated it like a claim processing? Whatever 

your colleague argues, a good cause exception, the 

16 3-year exception, everything else is -- is really 

17 treating it like a claim processing rule, not as 

18 jurisdictional. 

19  MR. MANNING: Justice Sotomayor, you're 

entirely right, that the test that this Court has 

21 prescribed in this area of law is focused on 

22 congressional intent. In Arbaugh, this Court said that 

23 the touchstone is congressional intent, that -- that the 

24 design of this Court's rules is to put the ball in 

Congress' court. 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1  This Court has put a thumb on the scale 

2 against jurisdiction because of the hard consequences 

3 that follow from deeming a procedure jurisdictional. In 

4 this case, the agency's regulation, no matter how old it 

is, is invalid because Congress signaled a clear 

6 intention to treat this as jurisdictional in two ways: 

7 One, by putting it in the -- in the provision of the 

8 statute that defines the board's jurisdiction. But, 

9 secondly, Congress, in this statute, created two 

different kinds of deadlines, one for providers and one 

11 for beneficiaries. 

12  Both set almost identical deadlines for 

13 administrative appeals. It's 6 months for 

14 beneficiaries, 180 days for providers. But there is a 

fundamental difference in the way Congress treated these 

16 two sets of deadlines, and the fundamental difference is 

17 that Congress explicitly gave the Secretary authority --

18 discretion, to extend the deadline for beneficiaries. 

19 It gave no such discretion to extend the -- the deadline 

for providers. 

21  And the same story plays out in the 60-day 

22 limits that govern judicial review. Discretion --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this agency not 

24 more than 3 years extension, that was adopted after 

notice and comment, and Congress amended this statute 

19
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 several times thereafter, but it left this -- this 

2 3-year outside limit intact. So if Congress really 

3 wanted there to be no leeway at all, then it should have 

4 done something about that regulation. 

MR. MANNING: Justice Ginsburg, you're 

6 entirely right. Congress has amended the statute, in 

7 fact, eight times since the Secretary promulgated her 

8 regulation establishing a good cause requirement. But 

9 this Court has, in recent years, been more careful about 

finding acquiescence than it did at one time. 

11  In the Solid Waste Authority of Northern 

12 Cook County, what this Court said is that before it will 

13 find that Congress has acquiesced, there must be 

14 evidence that Congress was aware of the regulation and a 

clear signal that Congress meant to embrace or put in 

16 place this regulation. 

17  And this is a sound policy because Congress 

18 leaves regulations in place for all sorts of reasons 

19 because somebody is using a parliamentary tactic, 

because Congress doesn't have one opinion or the other 

21 about whether the -- the regulation is right, because 

22 Congress didn't think of the problem. 

23  So, in recent years, this Court has insisted 

24 upon a high degree of proof before it will find 

acquiescence, and that degree is not present here.

1 There is no evidence that Congress was aware of this 

2 regulation, much less that it approved of it. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but you have three --

4 the point that you make is right, that -- that you have 

specific language in the beneficiary part and not here; 

6 but you have the other way, the point that Justice 

7 Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is --

8 is -- doesn't say file within 180 days. It says, you 

9 may have a hearing if you file within 180 days. It 

doesn't say what happens if you don't. It's open, the 

11 language. 

12  And the -- the subject matter is not a 

13 court. The subject matter is a rather technical agency 

14 review board. And normally, I would think, you would 

think, and members of Congress would think that the 

16 agency knows best as to how to run its own operation 

17 and -- and don't interfere too much in details, and this 

18 is a sort of detail. 

19  So those are the things against you, it 

seems to me, though the thing you cite is certainly for 

21 you. 

22  MR. MANNING: Quite -- quite right, Your 

23 Honor. And -- and typically, an agency has discretion 

24 to set its own procedures, as the government argues. 

And -- and the government is quite right to cite Vermont

1 Yankee. And I would add Chevron, that -- that the 

2 government promulgated its regulation in a 

3 Chevron-eligible format. But Chevron only applies if 

4 the statute is not clear, and here, we say that Congress 

addressed the precise question in issue. 

6  It's very difficult when one reads the 

7 beneficiary provisions and provider provisions, which 

8 are quite different. One provides discretion, and one 

9 doesn't. And what Respondents would have --

JUSTICE BREYER: One was passed long, long 

11 ago and was part of the Social Security Act or 

12 something, the one you're talking about, and was passed 

13 many years before the second one was passed. 

14  And when they're sitting in Congress 

writing -- you know, they don't know everything that was 

16 passed in history. 

17  MR. MANNING: You're exactly right, Justice 

18 Breyer. But Congress, in Section 299O of the 1972 Act, 

19 that enacted -- that created the PRRB, amended and 

reenacted the provision from the 1965 legislation that 

21 prescribed the -- the beneficiary review provisions. It 

22 incorporated, by reference, provisions that gave the 

23 Secretary express discretion to extend those deadlines. 

24  And so, in the same statute, what Congress 

did was it set up two systems, one for beneficiaries and 

22

1 one for providers. One prescribed discretion, one 

2 didn't. 

3  What the Respondents are asking this Court 

4 to do is to read these two sets of provisions, which are 

worded very differently, to mean the same thing, to mean 

6 that the Secretary has discretion whether Congress gives 

7 it or doesn't. 

8  And I submit that that's a good reason to 

9 treat this as a step one case. The Secretary does not 

merit deference in this case because the statute is 

11 clear. And to return to Justice Sotomayor's question 

12 about the phrase -- and your question about the 

13 phraseology of Subsection (a), this Court held in Bowles 

14 v. Russell that Section 2107 is jurisdiction 

notwithstanding that it --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was, in part, the 

17 point I raised earlier, which is we look at what the 

18 history is to help inform our use of labels. The 

19 history here -- you can't ignore it -- is that, from its 

inception, whether it's trying to disclaim it now or 

21 not, the agency has not treated it as jurisdictional. 

22  It's used the word --

23  MR. MANNING: Well --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but it's treated it 

as a claim processing rule by creating these exceptions.

Official 

1  MR. MANNING: Well, you're right, 

2 Justice Sotomayor. But my question -- the question that 

3 that raises is this: From the very beginning, this 

4 agency has -- all three of the agencies -- the 

Secretary, CMS, and the board -- have all described this 

6 provision as jurisdictional and non-waivable. At the 

7 same time, they have tried to create this exception. 

8  In the -- in the 2008 regulations that 

9 narrowed the good cause exception, the Secretary 

acknowledged that there was a question about whether the 

11 good cause exception was consistent with the 

12 characterization of the time limitation as 

13 jurisdictional, acknowledged that there was a split of 

14 authority on that, and suggested that the courts would 

have to resolve it. This is not --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is -- there is a 

17 lot of discussion and confusion between jurisdiction, 

18 mandatory claim processing rules, nonmandatory claim 

19 processing rules. I could go on and on about the 

labels. 

21  But let's go back to the point Justice Kagan 

22 made earlier, which is, assuming we were to treat this 

23 as a mandatory claim processing rule, where does that 

24 get you? 

Now, the agency says that means no equitable 

24

1 tolling. Assuming I'm willing to accept that, is 


2 equitable tolling the same as fraudulent concealment, 


3 which has been treated in the law, not as a -- as a 


4 necessary part of equitable tolling, which has to do 


with what the plaintiff could have done or not done, but 

6 with what a defendant has done or not done? 

7  MR. MANNING: Justice Sotomayor, this Court 

8 has said that, if a time limitation is jurisdictional, 

9 that limitation is absolute. That includes no equitable 

tolling. 

11  In Irwin, this Court included among the 

12 grounds for equitable tolling the intentional 

13 concealment of information that was necessary to --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you -- why 

don't you take another minute to finish your answer? 

16  MR. MANNING: Certainly. 

17  So if it's jurisdictional, 

18 Justice Sotomayor, then even if the -- even if the CMS 

19 intentionally withheld this information, the time limit 

would be absolute and would not be extendable. 

21  On the other hand, I believe that if the --

22 the statute is not jurisdictional, it's subject to 

23 equitable tolling; under Irwin, the presumption of 

24 equitable tolling applies. And, it's very difficult to 

see how the Secretary is warranted in narrowing

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. ROTH 


7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 


8  MR. ROTH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


9 please the Court. 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you agree with that 

11 last statement? 

12  MR. ROTH: Well, I --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think an agency 

14 is not permitted to have mandatory claim processing 

rules? 

16  MR. ROTH: Excuse me, Your Honor? 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you believe an agency 

18 is not capable of having mandatory claim processing 

19 rules, that it limits the application of equitable 

principles? 

21  MR. ROTH: The -- the agency could have 

22 mandatory claims processing rules to the extent -- with 

23 the leeway that was provided by Congress. 

24  Here, the leeway ends when you have -- when 

you have issues, like Your Honor was talking about, with

Official 

1 intentional concealment, when you have actions by the 

2 Secretary, misconduct by the Secretary, that caused the 

3 statute of limitations time to be missed. 

4  One would have to assume that the -- that 

the Congress has -- has delegated to the fox to 

6 determine who is in charge of the henhouse. So there is 

7 a limitation, Your Honor, on how far the agency can go, 

8 and it cannot go as far as to shield itself from 

9 judicial review of its own misconduct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would our review be an 

11 APA review, whether the -- the rule is arbitrary or 

12 capricious? 

13  MR. ROTH: Well, I think that -- that the 

14 APA review would start under -- under step one. And we 

believe that the statute is clear on this point, that 

16 under step one of Chevron, that this has not been 

17 delegated to the agency to determine what the judicial 

18 review should be available in the context of agency 

19 misconduct, Your Honor. 

And, in fact, Your Honor, there is -- 1395oo 

21 provides no support for the government's proposition 

22 that Congress intends undetectable and undisclosed 

23 agency misconduct to deprive hospitals of the payments 

24 Congress promised --

1 intends that when they -- when they adopt an absolute 


2 rule. I mean, you -- you can create a horrible with 


3 respect to any absolute jurisdictional rule. That's 


4 easy to do. So the mere fact that -- that a horrible 


could occur does -- does not at all persuade me that --

6 that a rule is not absolute. 

7  MR. ROTH: Well, the horrible that we're 

8 talking about here, Your Honor, is agency misconduct. 

9 And it's been a longstanding principle of law that 

defendants should not benefit from their own misconduct. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why -- why do you say 

12 that? I mean, the record that we have says that the CMS 

13 failed to use the best available data. It doesn't say 

14 anything about deliberate concealment. 

MR. ROTH: Your Honor, the -- this case 

16 arises on -- comes to this Court after a motion to 

17 dismiss was granted, and so that the -- that the -- the 

18 Court would have to take as true the allegations in the 

19 complaint. 

And the allegations in our complaint in 

21 paragraph -- in paragraph 30 -- 38, Your Honor, raise 

22 this question. And that can be found -- let's see -- do 

23 you have -- in the Joint Appendix --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, in -- in any event, 

the Baystate case, which is what revealed all of this, 

28

Official 

1 in -- in that case, the district judge there didn't 

2 say -- he said they didn't use the best available data. 

3 He didn't find any deliberate concealment. 

4  MR. ROTH: That's correct, Your Honor, and 

because the -- that issue was not before the court and 

6 it was not necessary for the court to make that finding 

7 for purposes of addressing that case. 

8  I'm at the Joint Appendix at 2829, which is 

9 paragraph 38 of our complaint. And paragraph 38 in our 

complaint presented one aspect of this concealment, 

11 which was a misleading aspect of the agency's actions 

12 here, where the agency said that matching on the basis 

13 of Social Security numbers was the best way to deal with 

14 this -- this matching of the data that my colleague from 

the government was -- was discussing. 

16  And it ends up that the -- that it turns out 

17 years later that, in fact, the Secretary didn't match on 

18 the basis of Social Security numbers. And that made an 

19 enormous difference with respect to how that -- how the 

disproportionate share hospital benefit would be 

21 calculated. 

22  So -- so the reason the district court in 

23 the Baystate case didn't have to make findings about 

24 fraud or similar fault or delve that much into the 

agency action was because that case came to the court 

29

1 through the traditional appeals process without 

2 having -- and so a finding as to the actions of the 

3 Secretary and -- and characterizing those actions, as 

4 whether they're misconduct or not was, not necessary to 

addressing the case as it was before the district court 

6 in that -- at that time. 

7  The -- but -- but we are talking -- while we 

8 are talking about the disproportionate share hospital 

9 payment, Your Honor, let me simply -- let me simply 

mention that what we are talking about here are safety 

11 net hospitals. We are talking about those hospitals 

12 that provide services to -- to a high percentage of poor 

13 people, and -- and Congress had found that those 

14 patients are more expensive to treat. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Roth, on -- on the 

16 legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right, 

17 that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we 

18 read this statute. If you -- one response to reading 

19 the briefs in this case is that you and Mr. Manning 

present opposite views of the statute, and -- and both 

21 of you say the statute is clear as to your opposite 

22 view. 

23  In other words, Mr. Manning says the statute 

24 clearly prohibits equitable tolling, and you say the 

statute clearly requires equitable tolling. And both of 

30

1 you have kind of decent arguments. 

2  And one response to that might be to say, 

3 Mr. Kneedler is right, that the statute is just 

4 ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different 

ways, and both of you have presented good arguments, but 

6 in the end, it really all goes to show that there is a 

7 lack of clarity here, and then it's up to the agency to 

8 decide. 

9  MR. ROTH: Well, of course, Your Honor, 

the -- the statute is clear and equitable tolling is 

11 permitted. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course -- of course, one 

13 can always make an argument on the other side, and the 

14 mere fact that an argument is made on the other side 

does not prove that it's not clear. That's what lawyers 

16 do. They make arguments on the other side. 

17  MR. ROTH: But here, Your Honor, the -- when 

18 you look at the factors that underpin the government's 

19 position here that somehow the government can decide 

that it can preclude this Court from reviewing agency 

21 misconduct -- you heard the government talk about the 

22 need for finality. Well, the need for finality is not 

23 something that's articulated in the -- in the Medicare 

24 Act except to the extent in a statute that's protective 

of providers. There is not a --

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Are there examples? I 

2 mean, it seems to me that, even if you lose this -- I 

3 mean, I mentioned the three arguments against you, the 

4 other -- the ambiguity of the language and so forth. So 

if it ends up, even though it's not just a lawyer's 

6 argument, it isn't really that clear, and they do have 

7 some authority, you then have the second string, which 

8 is you say their rule is unreasonable because it has an 

9 absolute 3-year cutoff, instead of a little flexibility 

there for fraudulent concealment. 

11  So -- so do you have statutes, are there 

12 statutes that say 3 -- or are there cases that say 3 

13 years is not enough, that -- that you have to have more 

14 than 3 years? I thought 3 years is a pretty long time. 

I mean, I guess they can't go back to fraudulent 

16 concealment pre-Civil War -- you know, I mean, there's 

17 some period that must be reasonable to cut everything 

18 off, and what is that period? What do the cases say? 

19 If it isn't 3 years, what is it? 

MR. ROTH: Well, Your Honor, the Secretary 

21 has addressed this question in the context of -- of 

22 fraud or similar fault by providers, and they said there 

23 should be no time limit at all. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: That's their view there, 

and their view here, which is a different kind of thing, 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 is that 3 years is enough. The question is, is that 


2 reasonable? And do you have any authority that says 


3 it's unreasonable? 


4  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the 3 years 


provision applied only to the Secretary, that she gives 

6 herself 3 years to go back and sort things out, but only 

7 gives you 180 days; is that right? 

8  MR. ROTH: The Secretary -- well, depends 

9 what sort -- if the "sort it out" means recovering 

overpayments, the Secretary has an unlimited amount of 

11 time to recover overpayments that are the fault or 

12 similar -- fraud or similar fault on a provider. 

13  If it is not fraud or similar fault on a 

14 provider, the reason the Secretary can't go back more 

than 3-plus years is because the statute permits it. 42 

16 U.S. Code 1395gg, which is not cited in the government's 

17 brief, that says that, at the end of the third year 

18 after payment, that the payment becomes final, as long 

19 as the provider and the beneficiary was without fault 

with respect to the payment. 

21  So that 3-year limitation that the 

22 government touts in 1885 was not a subject of an 

23 administrative determination that they made. That was 

24 simply they were -- they were following a statute. And 

when you look in the Medicare Act for evidence of a

25

Official 

1 statute that -- that should limit -- impose finality in 

2 some way, that statute is the only one, and it's 

3 protective of providers. 

4  And what the Secretary has done here is it 

enacted -- it promulgated a regulation, and the 


6 regulation provides for an unlimited time period to 


7 recover in the face of --


8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Justice Scalia was 


9 not correct in what he just said. The 3 years is for 


the provider. The 3 -- under the Secretary's 

11 regulations, the provider gets an additional 3 years, 

12 but no more; isn't that right? 

13  MR. ROTH: Well, the 3-year is both -- it --

14 it goes both ways, Your Honor, that -- that, under the 

reopening rule, that providers have up to 3 years to 

16 come in to ask for relief. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But it's not 180 

18 days for them. It's 180 days, plus an extension up to 3 

19 years. 

MR. ROTH: It's -- well, but after the --

21 after the 180-day period there is no right to judicial 

22 review. With the reopening -- if there would be a 

23 denial of the reopening request, that denial of the 

24 reopening request, as this Court said in Your Home, 

would not be subject to judicial review.

1  So the extension of time there, Your Honor, 

2 it would -- would be available, but would not have 

3 recourse; and without recourse to judicial review, when 

4 you have an issue here like secretarial misconduct, that 

means there will be no review at all, because --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you challenging -- I 

7 mean, there is a rule that says that -- there is a 

8 regulation that, for fraud, it's -- the time is 

9 unlimited. But that -- that regulation, the government 

says, applies only to the provider, not to the -- the 

11 government. 

12  Are you challenging the agency's reading of 

13 the word "party" in that regulation? 

14  MR. ROTH: Well, we -- again, this came to 

the Court on a motion to dismiss, but we think that 

16 the -- the Secretary's interpretation of that ruling has 

17 changed from when it was -- when it was promulgated in 

18 1974, when during the rulemaking process, they 

19 specifically changed that rule to get -- to eliminate 

the reference only to a provider, and it's to any party. 

21  And so that rule ought to be applied in a 

22 way that provides equilibrium, that it would apply both 

23 against secretarial misconduct --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you -- did you make 

that argument in this case? I wasn't aware that you had

3  MR. ROTH: We -- we speak at some length in 

4 the brief, under this -- under this rubric of the 

one-way ratchet. This is the one-way ratchet that we 

6 were talking about, Your Honor, in that, with respect to 

7 the reopening rule, the -- the Secretary has provided an 

8 unlimited amount of time. So finality is not an issue 

9 with respect to correcting -- correcting these payments 

that arise from the fraud -- fraud or similar fault of 

11 the provider. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm about 5

much to chide the Solicitor General for not citing it 

6 when nobody cited it. 

7  MR. ROTH: That is true, Your Honor, and 

8 that -- that is correct. But in citing 405.1885 and the 

9 reason that we're bringing it up, Your Honor, for the 

first time on rebuttal is that in the -- in the 

11 government's reply brief, they went out of their way to 

12 try to characterize the reasonableness of the Secretary, 

13 you can trust the Secretary here because the Secretary 

14 has said, look, after 3 years, we consider there to be 

finality, and we don't go back after the -- after the --

16 after the providers -- you know, except for fraud or 

17 similar fault, as if this had been a gift, an 

18 interpretation from the Secretary. 

19  It wasn't, Your Honor. That's why we are 

raising it here, Your Honor, because, under the 1395gg 

21 provision, they can't go back, and that's why they have 

22 their reopening regulation and that reopening regulation 

23 is an order from Congress. 

24  And what we have here, Your Honor, is that 

you have this concept at least arising from Congress;

1 when you look at the 1395gg, you look at the appeals 

2 statute in 1395oo, is that you have an expectation from 

3 Congress that the providers within their 180 days will 

4 be able to know exactly what happened and why they were 

underpaid. And here, of course, that underpayment was 

6 concealed. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that reopening -- is 

8 that reopening provision, the mysterious gg, is -- is 

9 that subject to equitable tolling, too? 

MR. ROTH: The -- well, the --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: And if not, why not? 

12  MR. ROTH: Well, 1395gg simply says that 

13 a -- that a -- that a provider and a beneficiary will 

14 not be subject to overpayment recoveries, if they were 

without fault. 

16  And what we -- and whether it would be 

17 susceptible for equitable tolling is not before the 

18 Court at this point, but that rule at least is applied 

19 equally on both sides. 

In other words, if -- if the -- if a 

21 provider was underpaid because of its own fault, this 

22 case isn't about any -- any relaxation of that rule. 

23 Providers are on the hook for that. 

24  On the other hand, where a provider is 

underpaid because of the secretive conduct, the

Remember, the trigger point in 1395oo is 

6 notice. That is -- and, again, that goes against this 

7 concept that it is jurisdictional. It's a claims 

8 processing statute. And here, Your Honor, the notice 

9 was defective. When they issued --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Roth, I'm not certain 

11 about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me 

12 try something. 

13  Now, are you saying that any time Congress 

14 passes a statute saying -- you know, there is 30 days to 

do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency 

16 context now, as to administrative process, that Congress 

17 necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and 

18 that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling? 

19  MR. ROTH: Yes, Your Honor, that, if the 

issue is the -- is the agency's own misconduct, that 

21 Congress would -- to -- to read that Congress intended 

22 in a situation under the -- like this under the Medicare 

23 Act, where we're talking about a procedural right to 

24 that -- to enforce a substantive right. 

In other words, we have here providers who 

39

Official 

1 have provided services. And under their agreement with 

2 the Secretary, they provide services, and they get paid 

3 for those services. 

4  If there were an attempt to limit that 

payment, to cut off that payment because of agency 

6 misconduct, because of the expiration of a -- of a 

7 statute of limitations, we don't believe Congress ever 

8 intended that its payments would be cut off because of 

9 agency misconduct that caused a provider to miss -- to 

miss a deadline that caused the expiration of a statute 

11 of limitations. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure how we can 

13 limit this to agency misconduct. Suppose there is a 

14 computer glitch in a program, completely good faith, and 

the computer just spits out the -- the wrong 

16 information, and nobody knows about it. That's not 

17 misconduct. 

18  MR. ROTH: That's not misconduct. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- but --

MR. ROTH: We would agree, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you would say no 

22 equitable tolling in that case? 

23  MR. ROTH: Well, that's not -- that -- this 

24 case -- that -- that is a mistake. That's an error. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that would be good

3  MR. ROTH: That has never been good cause 

4 under Secretary's ruling, but -- potentially. But that 

is not what -- that would be the level -- that would not 

6 be misconduct. That would not trigger equitable 

7 tolling, as opposed to the facts of this case. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know -- I 

9 don't know why it wouldn't. 

MR. ROTH: What's that? 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean to say that if 

12 that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary 

13 would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3 

14 years? 

MR. ROTH: For -- excuse me? For 

16 recovering -- for the --

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

18  MR. ROTH: -- for a provider to make an 

19 appeal? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

21  MR. ROTH: Well, they don't have to extend 

22 the time, Your Honor. They can simply provide by 

23 administrative payment to -- to fix the problem. They 

24 don't have to circle it through -- through an appeals 

process, if the government found out. And, in fact,

2 unfortunately --


3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I just find it 


4 hard -- hard to see why this is -- you're saying that 


the equitable tolling rule -- the agency does have the 


6 3-year rule. 


7  MR. ROTH: Right. 


8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is limited to 


9 misconduct? 


MR. ROTH: Yes, Your Honor. But the facts 

11 that you're talking about --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're arguing for --

13 in a way, for a narrower rule than what the 

14 government --

MR. ROTH: Well, Your Honor, let me say that 

16 the facts that you're talking about are addressed 

17 explicitly in 42 CFR 405.980. And what the government 

18 has said in that regulation is that, when there has been 

19 clerical error, claims can be reopened indefinitely. 

That's another indefinite time period. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose it's just 

22 what the Baystate court said it is. It isn't deliberate 

23 concealment, but it is failure to use the best available 

24 data. 

And I take it the argument you just presented 

42

1 is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct. So just 

2 failure to use the best available data, not deliberate 

3 concealment, wouldn't make it. 

4  MR. ROTH: Well, in this case, Your Honor --

well, simply, if it was knowing use of bad data, in 

6 other words, if the government, as in this case, was 

7 aware that there was better data to be had, that would 

8 rise to the level of the kind of conduct that could be 

9 subject to equitable tolling; whereas, simple mistakes 

are already addressed for the Secretary's 

11 regulations --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what -- what 

13 circumstances trigger equitable tolling, in your view? 

14  MR. ROTH: Well, equitable tolling is 

certainly triggered under the circumstances of this 

16 case, Your Honor, because --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but suppose that the 

18 fact-finding turns out that the -- that there is no 

19 deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to 

use the best available data. 

21  MR. ROTH: Well, if we don't -- if we don't 

22 have that extra level of -- of that -- of that level of 

23 concealment, Your Honor, I don't think that we would 

24 have the misconduct that this Court has cited in the --

in the Bowen case, and before that, in -- in Irwin and

3 would apply. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would have to 

prove that before we know whether there is equitable 

6 tolling. 

7  MR. ROTH: We -- we -- well, we've made that 

8 allegation in our complaint, Your Honor. And we believe 

9 that -- that assuming those allegations to be true for 

purposes of this hearing, which --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm asking you, 

12 if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't 

13 know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried 

14 out the question of the character of --

MR. ROTH: Absolutely, Your Honor. If we --

16 if we get past this -- this -- this -- and there would 

17 be a remand, it would -- the burden then would be on the 

18 hospitals at that time to, in fact, show that equitable 

19 tolling could apply. 

The issue in this Court is whether it should 

21 foreclose permanently the availability of equitable 

22 tolling, even in the face of allegations of agency 

23 misconduct -- excuse me --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I'm not sure I

1 of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable 

2 tolling, when we talk about equitable tolling, we are 

3 only talking about misconduct or fraud cases -- you 

4 know, as opposed to the case where it's just a person 

cannot possibly know the -- the information that would 

6 back up a claim and that we regard that as a good 

7 excuse? 

8  MR. ROTH: No, Your Honor. Whether it was 

9 Henderson or -- or other cases, those cases recognize --

those cases have focused on what happened to the 

11 claimant, and the claimant missed a deadline. Holland, 

12 it was a deadline that was missed. There wasn't 

13 misconduct on the other side. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. 

MR. ROTH: And those were subject to 

16 equitable tolling. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well because I thought that 

18 most of your argument was built on the presumption in 

19 favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in 

those cases --

21  MR. ROTH: Correct. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and whether it applied to 

23 the agency context. But now, you're saying that in the 

24 agency context, it's -- it's a different kind of 

equitable tolling that we are talking about, a more

1 limited kind? 

2  MR. ROTH: Well, the -- what -- the 

3 equitable tolling rule that the Court has found in those 

4 other cases would certainly come into play. This case 

goes farther. This case even goes farther than Bowen v. 

6 City of New York because it has affirmative misconduct 

7 by the Secretary. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: So what about -- then let's 

9 get back to the question I really meant to ask before --

you know, assuming they have some authority here to 

11 write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is 

12 not reasonable in this situation. So what is? 

13  MR. ROTH: Well --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you want to go back 

to the Civil War? I mean, let's imagine you really have 

16 the strongest possible case. All the records burned up, 

17 and it took 5 years for scientists to reproduce the 

18 records by putting charred pieces of paper together. 

19 Okay? So you couldn't possibly bring your claim until 

they finished. That's a pretty equitable claim. 5 

21 years okay? 10? What is the -- 100? I mean, what? 

22  MR. ROTH: Well, Your Honor, in this 

23 instance, the -- the question of how to limit a 

24 circumstance where a provider is not getting paid --

gotten paid the amount promised by Congress, one way

1 to -- to limit that is by time. 

2  But recall here, Your Honor, that the 

3 Secretary could eliminate this issue entirely by simply 

4 being more transparent. This issue arises --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what I hear you saying 

6 is go back to the Revolutionary War. If it took 100 

7 years to put the papers together, you're saying no time 

8 limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution 

9 because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases 

or misconduct cases. You've got to have some exception 

11 in there forever. 

12  MR. ROTH: Well, if --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? If that is 

14 your position, I just want to know. 

MR. ROTH: That is -- that is the position 

16 because, in order to -- to prevail in equitable tolling, 

17 we would have to show that the providers here were 

18 diligent, and that's a self-limiting factor. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And by the way, do 

we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give 

21 the agency's own determination some weight? 

22  MR. ROTH: The agency's own determination? 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They'll come in and 

24 say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause 

here because we weren't that awful. And now, does the

2  MR. ROTH: If the Secretary here decided to 

3 attack head-on this concept of equitable tolling and 

4 deal with this question of finality straight up and 

say -- you know, here -- here is how we think that --

6 that finality should be -- should be handled, even in 

7 the -- even in the context of secretarial misconduct, 

8 by, for example, saying within the 3-year period any 

9 provider who feels that we've misrepresented data, come 

in, you can come in and look at our data, but after 3 

11 years, the time limit is over, I think that's a rule 

12 that could exist, Your Honor. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, subject to 

14 arbitrary and capricious review under Chevron? 

MR. ROTH: It -- subject, of course, to 

16 arbitrary and capricious review on that. But the 

17 point --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why in your case, even 

19 assuming that there might be equitable tolling, here, is 

it -- is it 10 years later? And there was this Baystate 

21 case going on. You -- you didn't file immediately after 

22 that litigation was instituted. You waited until those 

23 plaintiffs won their case. 

24  You waited till there was a decision of the 

lower court. So it seems to me you -- you said there's 

48
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 a requirement of diligence.  Why -- why didn't you have 

2 to file when you were first on notice, which you would 

3 have been from the complaint filed in the Baystate case? 

4  MR. ROTH: Well, the complaint was filed, 

Your Honor, in Baystate after we brought our 

6 administrative appeal. We brought our administrative 

7 appeal soon after the board -- the administrative board 

8 rendered its decision. That was the first public 

9 pronouncement that there were flaws with the data. 

There were some providers who had an inkling 

11 that some days might have been missed here or there, but 

12 there was no sense in the provider community that that 

13 arose from a systematic effort by the government to 

14 miscount and then fail to disclose that it, in fact, 

miscounted and had misrepresented how it had counted the 

16 days. 

17  So, Your Honor, diligence, of course, will 

18 be an issue if we -- on remand if we get -- if we get 

19 that opportunity. But this -- but the -- but the case 

here arose after the board issued its decision in the 

21 Baystate -- in the Baystate case. 

22  And there was a -- and there was a 

23 discussion earlier about whether the board has viewed 

24 its own jurisdiction as limited in some way. And the --

the fact of the matter is that -- that the board here --

49
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 and I focus on the Bradford case in particular. In the 

2 Bradford case, the board itself made a determination 

3 that equitable tolling should apply in another time 

4 limit within the -- within the Medicare Act. 

That case then goes up to appeal in the 

6 Western District of Pennsylvania, and the -- and the 

7 court says, you know what, we think equitable tolling 

8 should apply, reversing the Secretary, who had reversed 

9 the board's finding that equitable tolling should apply. 

And in that case, the -- the Secretary didn't leave it 

11 there. 

12  They petitioned for -- for the court to 

13 revisit its determination, which the court did and 

14 affirmed its decision with respect to the application of 

equitable tolling. 

16  At that point, the Secretary abandoned -- it 

17 didn't seek an appeal. It allowed the case to go back 

18 to the board, and it -- and it -- and it allowed the 

19 case to go forward, with that deadline having been 

equitable tolled. So when the government portrays this 

21 as somehow some kind of consistent view, it's not. 

22  This board has engaged in equitable 

23 determinations going back for those 37 years that the 

24 good cause regulation has been in place because it is 

that good cause regulation that -- that forced the --

1 the board to have to deal with these equitable questions 

2 about whether -- whether or not the -- whether or not 

3 the -- the claim should be considered timely, even 

4 though the deadline had to be -- had to be extended. 

The -- the facts that we have here, Your 

6 Honor, is that this is really an unprecedented case. 

7 This is an unprecedented case in Medicare, that we have 

8 the agency that says it was doing one thing in a Federal 

9 Register document and actually did something different, 

that then spent years trying to avoid, as was laid out 

11 in the Southwest Consulting amicus brief, avoid having 

12 those facts come to -- come to -- come to the attention 

13 of the providers. 

14  There will not be floodgates that result 

from this, either at the board or at the Federal court 

16 level, because there are -- there will always be, in 

17 Medicare, a lead case. This is what we saw in the Cape 

18 Cod case. There, you had a case that resulted in what 

19 looked to be billions of dollars of payments to every 

single hospital in the country as a result of one 

21 district court decision and one court of appeals 

22 decision. 

23  So allowing equitable tolling to address the 

24 misconduct of the Secretary in this kind of case will 

not -- will not -- will not flood the judiciary or the

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how many 

4 cases are there like this pending, either at the agency 

level or in court now? 

6  MR. ROTH: Well, I think that, when the 

7 government says there are 80 cases that are pending 

8 involving 4,000 cost years and 450 hospitals, those 

9 probably mostly, if not entirely, or for the most part 

relate to -- to this case. And depending on how this 

11 case unfolds, those cases will all presumably fall into 

12 line, just as in the Cape Cod case. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Is the 

14 miscalculation still going on? I mean, this involved --

MR. ROTH: Well, there was a change --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- claims 12 years ago. 

17  MR. ROTH: Right. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But did they continue 

19 from that time forward to the present? 

MR. ROTH: Well, there was a change in the 

21 law in 2004 that now give providers access to the data, 

22 so they can look at the underlying access to the data 

23 instead of -- instead of the government presenting --

24 preventing them from being able to get access.

3  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, just for 

7 point of clarification, the 3-year good cause extension 

8 that's permitted under the government's regulations, 

9 would that include -- would good cause -- or could a 

claim be raised that fraud by the agency is the good 

11 cause? 

12  MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think that's unclear 

13 under the current regulation. The current regulation is 

14 written in terms of good cause for something that 

prevents the actual filing of the appeal, like a fire or 

16 destruction of records or something. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That’s what I thought. So 

18 it's not as if the government is saying --

19  MR. KNEEDLER: No, no. But that hasn't been 

tested as to whether it could. But that's not the only 

21 avenue. In fact, the predominant avenue for raising 

22 claims of -- of new and material evidence, which at 

23 bottom this is, evidence that -- that there was not the 

24 best evidence used in this match, is the reopening 

regulation, and that's the regulation that was addressed 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1 by this Court in the Your Home case. There, the Court 

2 made clear that it was a matter of grace, not statutory 

3 compulsion, that the Secretary allowed for any reopening 

4 at all of past cost reports. 

This sort of claim of new evidence, for 

6 whatever reason it wasn't available, could be raised 

7 under that. But this Court held in -- in Your Home, 

8 that a denial of a reopening was not even appealable to 

9 the board at all or subject to judicial review for 

reasons of finality and certainty, that, at some point, 

11 the cost years have to be closed. 

12  And the Court specifically pointed out that 

13 to allow administrative and judicial review of a denial 

14 of reopening would circumvent the very 180-day 

limitation that we have at issue here. 

16  What Respondents are trying to do is to come 

17 up with another way of circumventing that 180-day 

18 limitation by superimposing, for the first time in 40 

19 years, an open-ended equitable tolling regime in this 

situation. The Respondents here are seeking to 

21 recalculate payment years back to 1987. The only reason 

22 it goes back no further is that's when the DSH payments 

23 began. 

24  DSH payments, by the way, go to 80 percent 

of hospitals. It's not some limited category. And what 

54
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 is being claimed here is -- is a mismatch of a 


2 legislative type. It's not some concealment from an 


3 individual provider. 


4  With respect to the allegations in the 


complaint, I'm not in a position to spend time refuting 

6 them here. We have a footnote in our reply brief that 

7 refers to the government's summary judgment motion in 

8 which the allegations of misconduct are -- are 

9 addressed. 

I would like to say that -- that whatever 

11 label one attaches, jurisdiction, claims processing, 

12 mandating, it's absolutely clear that, from the outset 

13 of this program, the Secretary understood and 

14 implemented the 180-day time limit as limiting the 

board's authority. It says an appeal shall be dismissed 

16 if it's not filed within 180 days. No extension shall 

17 be granted if requested after -- after 3 years. 

18  That 3 years -- Respondent has conceded a 

19 regulation that provides for coming in within 3 years to 

address matters of fraud or anything else would be 

21 valid. That's what this regulation does. And we think 

22 there is no plausible argument at this late date in the 

23 Medicare program to suggest that a 3-year limitation 

24 on -- on revisiting of closed cost reports is arbitrary 

and capricious under -- under this Court's decisions. 

55

Official 

1  And if we're wrong, as I said, about the 


2 validity of the Secretary's narrow good cause 


3 regulation, which simply parallels what's in 


4 jurisdictional provisions -- for example, notices of 


appeal -- if the Secretary has no authority to do even 

6 that, then the result is the same, there is no broad 

7 equitable tolling. 

8  Just one side comment on this Bradford 

9 opinion, that did not involve the 180-day limitation. 

That involved a regulatory provision. The Secretary's 

11 consistent position has been, as we cite in the brief, 

12 that the 180-day limitation is not subject to any 

13 equitable extensions at all because the board is not an 

14 equitable body. And the Medicare program, like the tax 

program in Brockamp, is not one in which equities are 

16 taken into account. You need absolute rules. 

17  Allegations of fraud or concealment are easy 

18 to make, but they can -- they can lead to widespread 

19 delayed litigation, as the Baystate litigation shows, 

requiring calling of witnesses -- in this case, 20 years 

21 ago -- what happened 15 or 20 years ago. You would have 

22 a hospital-by-hospital determination of when did the 

23 hospital know or have reason to know what happened. 

24  And we think that that's -- could be chaotic 

in a program like this.
