 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1119, Milavetz, 

Gallop & Milavetz v. United States and United 

States v. Milavetz.

 Mr. Brunstad.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &

 MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 526(a)(4) is unconstitutional 

because it proscribes truthful information about 

entirely lawful activity, it whipsaws the attorneys who 

are trying to apply it, it creates an impossible 

situation for them, and it harms the client.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were confined to 

unlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede 

that such a statute would be constitutional?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but 

the real challenge is to actually do that narrowing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say "perhaps." Yes or 

no? Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately 

drawn narrow statute, prohibit attorneys from advising,

A, criminal conduct in reference to a bankruptcy; or, B, 

civil conduct -- conduct that is improper under the 

civil code because it's a fraud on creditors?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy, if it 

were narrowly drawn to apply to criminal activity or 

fraudulent activity, yes. Those terms have 

well-established meanings. We know how to apply them. 

This statute, of course, does not do that.

 Now, the government does not defend the 

statute as written. The government seeks to rewrite it, 

but the manner in which the government seeks to rewrite 

the statute really doesn't work under the statutory 

terms. We do not have that guidance.

 The government in its brief proposes three 

different formulations of how it might be narrowed. 

None of those work, even if we -- we were to accept any 

of those formulations. We don't know what "abusive 

conduct" means. The government simply would trade a 

First Amendment problem for a vagueness problem. We do 

not have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's already in 

the statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer 

who signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does 

not constitute an abuse. This is 707(b).

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the words are 

something like "does not constitute an abuse." So 

apparently it has meaning there. Why doesn't -- why 

don't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also 

means in 5, whatever it is.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Two reasons, Justice 

Ginsburg. First, the 707(b) abuse standard is a 

completely different context. It involves gatekeeping 

to the access to bankruptcy relief.

 The second reason is that Congress -- there 

is no indication whatsoever, in the legislative history 

or elsewhere, that Congress intended to import the abuse 

standard under Section 707 into the 526(a)(4) context.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again in the 

hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a 

statute what it requires in the attestation clause?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Kennedy, because 

the abuse standard is too nebulous to satisfy, I think, 

scrutiny under the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think the attestation 

clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It can be the basis for 

sanctioning an attorney --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, how can that be if 

it's too vague.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

that the gateway to the bankruptcy procedures or 

basically provisions, like section 707 or in the Chapter 

11 context, basically are equitable inquiry that looks 

into the totality of the circumstances, whether what the 

lawyer has done or what the debtor has done -- and 

really it looks to what the debtor has done -- would be 

such that it would deny access to bankruptcy relief. 

Has the debtor engaged in inequitable conduct, engaged 

in inequitable conduct in some way that would basically 

shut the door to bankruptcy relief?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The attestation clause is 

designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an 

ethical and proper way, I take it.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: In a sense.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that one of its 

purposes?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think it goes more towards 

the attorney checking the information that the debtor 

has basically provided in the petition and elsewhere to 

make sure that the information that's provided is 

accurate and that the bankruptcy petition is not being 

proposed in essence for an abusive purpose.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I won't take up too much 

more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that

you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute 

that does the same thing. I don't understand the 

principle for that. You say it's a gateway and it's 

designed to facilitate the bankruptcy process. Well, 

the government could say the same thing about its 

statute.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Except, I think, Your Honor, 

that whereas for the purposes of getting into bankruptcy 

or staying in bankruptcy is one standard that courts 

apply basically on an equitable basis, that analysis --

what Congress did there, it didn't have in mind First 

Amendment concerns. It didn't have in mind trying to 

narrowly tailor the statutory regime so that lawyers 

basically can understand what they are doing in a way 

and communicate it to their client.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Congress often 

forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's true, Your Honor, and 

that's the heart of the problem here. The problem here 

is that when Congress basically -- first of all, 

Congress didn't import the 707(b) standard into 

526(a)(4).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the words in 

707(b)? I mean, they are both in the statute. What the 

lawyer has to attest to is required by statute.

MR. BRUNSTAD: That is true, Justice 

Ginsburg. But there is no evidence that Congress, in 

the legislative history or otherwise, that Congress 

intended the 707{b} standard to be the standard that 

governs what the lawyer can tell the client under 

section 526 (a)(4).

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there another 

problem? Even if Congress didn't think of the problem, 

don't we have the duty to construe the statute to avoid 

constitutional problems if there is any reasonable basis 

for doing so?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens, but 

this statute is not reasonable susceptible to the 

government's interpretation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That is an entirely 

different argument from the fact that Congress didn't 

think of this problem.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Justice 

Stevens. But the problem here is that what the 

government has tried to do is tease out a standard from 

the "in contemplation of" language in 526(a)(4), and the 

problem is that -- two problems: One, the "in 

contemplation of" language only modifies half the 

statute, so the "or pay the attorney" prong is not even 

addressed by the government's construction. They kind

of ignore that.

 The second problem is that the "in 

contemplation of" language cannot bear the weight the 

government would have it bear.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you think that 

means? What do you think "in contemplation of 

bankruptcy" means?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think it means what the 

Court said it meant in the Pender case interpreting 

section 60(d) of the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898. 

That is, whether bankruptcy is likely or imminent; in 

contemplation of bankruptcy, taking some action where a 

bankruptcy case is imminent or likely.

 Now, it appears --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say someone goes 

to the lawyer and they discuss the person's debt 

situation and the decision is made that a bankruptcy 

petition is going to be filed at some future date. Do 

you think that everything that that person does after 

that point is done in contemplation of bankruptcy?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not necessarily, Justice 

Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well then, why not? The 

person drives home in contemplation of bankruptcy, the 

person has lunch in contemplation of bankruptcy.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think that would --

JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't it mean -- "in 

contemplation of bankruptcy" means because of the 

expectation of filing a bankruptcy petition later?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think that that would 

assume that the filing of the bankruptcy petition looms 

entirely in the consciousness of the debtor when the 

debtor does everything. But I do -- I do think that the 

"in contemplation of" clause, which is also used in 

section 529, is a neutral phrase. "In contemplation of" 

means nothing more than is the bankruptcy filing likely? 

It doesn't have any nefarious, it doesn't have any 

abusive context to it at all.

 For example, section 329 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. It doesn't mean is 

it likely. "In contemplation of" means that the reason 

you are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy. You 

don't see any causal connection in that phrase?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I do see a causal connection, 

but there is no element of doing something improper in 

the language "in contemplation of."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. That 

may be true enough. But -- but the act must be taken 

because you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia. But the

government relies and hinges its argument on the abusive 

connotation to the "in contemplation of."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different 

question.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That doesn't exist. So what 

the government is trying to do is rewrite the statute by 

importing meaning into a phrase that has never been 

there and doesn't exist there.

 Every time we see the "in contemplation of" 

phrase appearing either under the current law or under a 

prior law, if there was some element of abuse coupled 

with it that was separately stated, and of course there 

is no separate statement here.

 Now, again I go back to the fact that this 

-- the practical effect of section 526(a)(4) is to make 

an impossible situation for attorneys. We have two 

regimes: One under applicable normal ethical State bar 

rules which say you have to give unfettered candid 

advice to your client; and this provision which gives 

you must give truncated advice; there are thing you 

cannot say. But whether you are in one regime or 

another depends upon whether the debtor is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a -- is there a 

difference between unethical and illegal advice?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As an attorney can you 

under -- give unethical advice?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, I think so, Justice 

Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the State rules 

you can give unethical advice as a lawyer?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: You cannot, no. That is 

proscribed by the State rules.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if you are not 

permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would 

otherwise give you that right? I mean, this is a 

commercial transaction of sorts. It's a fiduciary duty, 

but it's a commercial transaction. They are coming to 

you and they are paying you for certain advice, so why 

would the person then protect your right to give 

unethical advice.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It wouldn't protect your 

right to give unethical advice. The problem is that the 

statute sweeps within it's scope perfectly truthful 

advice about lawful activity.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are assuming that 

it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive 

conduct.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. But just as --

into the statute or is viewed as part of "in 

contemplation of bankruptcy," what in the First 

Amendment would make that be?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The First Amendment would not 

protect unethical advice. The problem, though, is that 

the term "abusive" which the government wants to 

interlineate into the statute is itself inherently 

vague, unlike "fraudulent conduct --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which doesn't explain 

why.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because "abusive," it's like 

"seditious utterances." It's not something which a 

normal person who just looks at it would be able to 

understand what it means.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't understand 

what it means as a lawyer?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I have some ideas about what 

means. But because of the onerous sanctions that 

section 526(c) imposes, if I'm wrong I can be basically 

subject to a whole panoply of remedies, some very 

serious remedies and very serious punishments for making 

a mistake. And that's one of the problems under the 

First Amendment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if you leave "abusive" 

out. Let's accept your point that "abusive" is not

there and the government is reading in out of nowhere. 

What's -- what's the matter with the statute then?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I'll give you -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA: It just prohibits giving 

advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody 

incur more debt. What's unlawful about that?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I'll give you -- I'll 

give you a perfect example. Suppose the debtor's 

problem is that he lives in a house that is too 

expensive for him. He comes to the lawyer: I'm in 

financial distress. The lawyer suggests -- the lawyer 

would logically suggest: Why don't you sell your house 

and rent an apartment? But the signing of the lease is 

incurring debt, the lease obligation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not in 

contemplation of bankruptcy.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It would be, Justice Scalia, 

if the debtor comes to you in financial distress, is 

thinking about filing for bankruptcy, and wants the 

advice in that context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the only reason the 

lawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this --

that this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he 

says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better 

sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no

good. Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why 

it's -- why it's unconstitutional.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because it's perfectly 

legitimate advice about perfectly lawful activity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's a stupid law.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, what happens is that 

basically it interferes with the lawyer's ability 

through speech to communicate full and candid advice to 

the client.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And that's why 

it's a stupid law.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: And ultimately under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, where is the 

prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, I think the 

problem here is that this stupid law does not pass 

either strict scrutiny and it is substantially 

overbroad.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much of your 

case depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if 

you accept the idea that "in contemplation of" means 

abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends 

upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that 

it's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer

sort of has to stop and think at every turn: Well, 

could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is 

this just construed as telling clients what they can and 

can't do? And in some areas it's a gray area, and what 

should you do when it's a gray area?

 Is that -- does your case depend upon that, 

which is, I guess, just an issue with the limiting 

construction proposed by the Solicitor General?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It doesn't turn on that, but 

that demonstrates the chilling effect. The effect of 

the statute has been to drive conscientious bankruptcy 

counsel from the practice. Why? Because it's not just 

difficult to apply; it's often impossible to apply. The 

whole statute turns on whether the debtor, the client or 

prospective client, is an assisted person, which depends 

on the relative wealth of the client, which is something 

very, very difficult to determine at any particular 

given point in time.

 So the lawyer doesn't know: Am I restricted 

in my speech under 526(a)(4) because that applies or 

does 526(a)(4) not apply at all because I am not dealing 

with an assisted person, such that I am under normal 

State bar rules which requires me to give unfettered 

advice?

 And since that is impossible to know without

detailed, careful analysis of the relative wealth of the 

client, the statute is basically impossible to apply.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if we assume a 

proper limited construction -- I know you disagree with 

that, but if we assume that we can limit the statute 

properly so that it applies just to unethical conduct, 

then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact 

that assisted persons is a subclass of that is 

irrelevant.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That would be true, Justice 

Kennedy, if in fact we could tease out from the abusive 

conduct, if people could actually understand what 

"abusive" meant. Does that proscribe -- what does it 

proscribe? It's too vague.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but that doesn't go 

to your other point that there's a problem in 

determining the class of persons. If it's unethical, 

you can't give it to anybody. And the fact that the 

class of persons is difficult to understand 

is irrelevant.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy, but 

that assumes that we can do the narrowing construction, 

I think as Your Honor points out. And that, again, is a 

fundamental problem because the standard the government 

would like to impose or interlineate in the statute is

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You want to -- I mean, 

your first point is -- and we never get to that question 

because lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all. 

They shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our 

point on the statutory construction piece is that the 

statute is ambiguous and that to avoid the 

constitutional questions -- actually, avoid two 

constitutional questions here, the constitutional 

question under 526(a)(4) and then a separate 

constitutional question under 528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's only lawyers who are 

protected against vague criminal statutes?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly not, Justice 

Scalia, which is why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So then -- so then there is 

no reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just 

to make it constitutional.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, our argument there, 

Justice Scalia, is that the statute does not 

unambiguously embrace attorneys. "Attorney" is not 

mentioned in the definition of "debt relief agency" in 

101(12)(a) where you think it would be, because wherever 

Congress has otherwise intended to regulate attorneys in

connection with bankruptcy practice, it has used the 

word "attorney" specifically.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. If you -- if 

you are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a 

fine argument. But don't -- don't bring in the fact 

that, well then, moreover, if it's applied to attorneys, 

it's unconstitutional, because if it's applied to 

anybody it's unconstitutional according to your 

argument.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That is also true, Justice 

Scalia, because we do make a substantial overbreadth 

argument. The statute is substantially overbroad.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, but when you say it 

isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to. It 

says "The term 'debt relief agency' means 'any person 

who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted 

person." And the term "bankruptcy assistance" is 

defined to include "appearing in a case or proceeding on 

behalf of another or providing legal representation with 

respect to a case or proceeding."

 Doesn't a lawyer provide legal 

representation?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: A lawyer does, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So doesn't the

term "provide legal representation" include a lawyer?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, Justice Breyer, 

is that I think when Your Honor was quoting from section 

101(4A), Your Honor took out a whole lot of information 

that goes between the word "bankruptcy assistance" and 

"legal representation."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes; they include other 

people besides lawyers.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not only that, but I think 

that that language is inherently ambiguous. What is 

Congress getting at there?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. What is it 

getting at with "providing legal representation with 

respect to a case"?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That would seem to be with 

respect to lawyers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It would seem to be a 

lawyer.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But it's precluded -- it's 

preceded by language, "any goods or services sold or 

otherwise provided to an assisted person with the 

express or implied purpose of providing information, et 

cetera, about legal representation."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Those are other 

people who are covered.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, not just other people, 

but what it looks like, is it looks like what Congress 

was getting at was people who provide things like what 

attorneys provide.

 Now, there are a whole host of problems with 

including attorneys within the definition of "debt 

relief agency." I mean, it's counter -- it's contrary 

to the purpose of what Congress seemed to be getting at. 

It leads to anomalous results. It does various things.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it any different 

from including lawyers within the category "debt 

collectors," which lawyers objected to in this Court 

unsuccessfully?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But 

there it was interesting. There, there -- in the Heintz 

case, that was a situation where lawyers had been 

expressly excluded from the statutory regime, then 

Congress repealed the exclusion, so a clear signal to 

include attorneys.

 Here, we have the opposite. We have a very 

ambiguous legislative history, where in the initial 

version of this legislation the House report 

accompanying it said lawyers were included and the 

language was "debt relief counseling agency." Then 

Congress amended the statute -- Congress amended the

proposed legislation in 1999, and thereafter in the 

2001, 2003, and 2005 House reports deleted all reference 

to attorneys -- a very, very strange tale, which seems 

to signal exactly the opposite of the Heintz case.

 So we have a very ambiguous legislative 

history that seems to give us a contrary signal. That 

in part is part of the ambiguity behind this statute, 

which I think is one of the reasons why it's perfectly 

-- the statute is readily susceptible to an 

interpretation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that in the 

legislative history there were examples of lawyers 

overreaching, that the conduct that Congress was aiming 

at was engaged in by lawyers, as well as others.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: There are some references in 

the legislative history to that, Justice Ginsburg. 

There are a few scattered references in the legislative 

history.

 But again, the legislative history is very 

ambiguous. It seems to go in lots of different 

directions. Now, recall, Justice Ginsburg --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have heard of referring 

to legislative history when the statute is ambiguous. I 

haven't heard of referring to legislative history to 

make the statute ambiguous.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I 

think the statute is ambiguous for a whole host of 

reasons, and the legislative history does not clear up 

the ambiguity; it actually deepens it. So the 

legislative history reinforces the other indicators, the 

textual indicators, of in fact ambiguity here.

 But I think -- I think it is also important 

to underscore not only would the constitutional 

avoidance, application of that canon here, by excluding 

attorneys from debt relief agencies solve the problem 

under section 526(a)(4), but also under section 

528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B). 528 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before you go on on 528, 

could you clarify for me: What is your challenge to 

528? Is it a normal --

MR. BRUNSTAD: 528, Justice Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 528.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it a normal facial 

invalidity? Is it an overbreadth invalidity? Is it an 

as-applied challenge? What exactly are you claiming 

with respect to that --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Does Your Honor mean 526 or 

528?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me how you 

have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what 

ad is at issue?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. I think 

it's the same as the Cincinnati case, where in fact 

there was no obligation that the handbills that were 

being distributed were any way deceptive or misleading. 

That's the same situation here. The district court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I have scoured the 

record for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- by you that I could 

look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's 

not misleading. So where is it in the record?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The ads are not in the 

record. But, as the district court found, there is no 

evidence suggesting that bankruptcy assistance 

advertisements that -- that Petitioners' bankruptcy 

advertisements are deceptive in any regard. The 

government never alleged that Petitioners engaged in any

deceptive advertising. That's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I truly have never 

heard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what 

it is being applied to. But putting that aside, so you 

have an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial 

challenge or an overbreadth challenge?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: With respect to the 

advertisements with the commercial speech?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR. Yes, the 528.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, it's not a -- it's not a 

facial challenge; it's an as-applied challenge. But 

here -- here's the point on the evidentiary point. The 

government never sought to introduce that evidence 

because it's not at issue. There is no dispute that 

Petitioners' advertisement is not -- is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the government bring 

this lawsuit below?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: We brought this lawsuit as a 

declaratory judgment action.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what, were they 

supposed to scour your advertisements to find the 

violation? Was that it?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, unless there was an 

allegation that in some way Petitioners' advertisements 

were misleading. It's not. It's not a disputed

question. It's not a disputed factual question.

 There is no dispute, and the district court 

basically found that there is no allegation that 

Petitioners' advertising is deceptive or untruthful in 

any way. So Petitioners' advertising is not of the kind 

that Congress was trying to target.

 Now, the problem and the burden that 528 

imposes is that it requires counterfactual, misleading 

statements that interfere with legitimate advertising 

messages. That's the problem. The statute is not 

narrowly tailored under Central Hudson to address the 

"make debts disappear" problem the government identifies 

as animating this particular statute.

 Let me give a simple illustration to sort of 

illustrate my point. Suppose I sell bread and the 

government required me to say -- disclose: I am a bread 

supply agency; I sell products that contain wheat. 

Well, what if the bread I sell does not contain wheat, 

it's wheat-free? Forcing me to make that statement is 

counterfactual and misleading. That's what this statute 

does. If I also sell milk, it requires me to make the 

statement: I am the bread relief -- the bread supply 

agency --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you 

something? When you are an attorney advertising as an

attorney who gives advice on bankruptcy, why aren't you 

a debt release -- relief advisor?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, Justice 

Sotomayor, is that that statement inherently is 

misleading. When lawyers -- when clients look for 

lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers or just lawyers in general, 

they don't want to see someone called a debt relief 

agency. It conveys no meaningful information. In fact, 

it's misleading. What does that mean?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They don't want to be --

lawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either, 

and in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says 

that -- that communication must say the communication is 

from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are 

not -- you don't have to identify. It seems to me that 

that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do, 

to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt 

collector, than I am a debt relief agency.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, but the debt collection 

statute doesn't require that in advertising. It 

requires that in letters and things like that that go to 

other parties where you are actually trying to help 

collect the debt. So it's a communication that the 

lawyer is making, for example, and a disclosure that's 

required.

Here putting in your advertising "I'm a debt 

relief agency" conveys no meaningful information to the 

public. In fact, it is misleading.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, A, I suppose you 

don't have to advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in 

your bread hypo: Under the Federal law we have bread, 

but our bread is -- I don't know -- gluten-free or 

whatever. You can use --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can always add -- add 

in order to make it non-misleading.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But that would require a 

statement in our advertising that is actually -- to make 

it fundamentally dissimilar to the statement that's 

being actually imposed on us, we have to say -- we have 

to put in the advertising something like "This product 

contains wheat." Then we also have to say, but my 

product doesn't.

 So, for the consumer who is looking at the 

information, it's inherently misleading because the two 

conflict.

commercial transaction, right? You are trying to get a 

consumer to hire you. And the First Amendment standards

been more -- more lenient than other First Amendment 

contexts.

 We -- we -- we regulate the content of 

advertising all the time.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia, but this 

statute is odd because it requires counterfactual 

information, it's not narrowly drawn to address the 

problem the government identifies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know --

JUSTICE ALITO: If a law firm -- if a law 

firm provides representation for debtors in bankruptcy, 

what is misleading about requiring them to say: We help 

people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy 

Code?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the scope of 

528(b)(2)(B) is so broad. If I am advertising mortgage 

foreclosure services having nothing to do with 

bankruptcy, I still must make this counterfactual 

statement. 528 -- for example, in my bread 

hypothetical, if I am also selling milk, and the 

government says when I am selling milk through my milk 

advertisement I have to say I am a bread supply agency, 

I sell products that contain wheat, that is misleading 

and irrelevant to the milk advertisement.

 But this statute does the same thing. If I

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to begin with the threshold 

statutory question if I may. I have only a few points 

on that.

 A debt relief agency is any person who 

provides specified services to specified clients for 

pay. An attorney is a person, a defined term under the 

Bankruptcy Code, and the Petitioners have affirmatively 

alleged in their complaint that they provide bankruptcy 

assistance to assisted persons. We think that is all 

that is required to determine that they are debt relief 

agencies under the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the provision 

that says the directors, employees, are not included?

 MR. JAY: As I understand Petitioners' 

argument about that provision, it is that Congress would 

surely have made an exception for partners as well had 

it intended to include attorneys. We think that that is 

a multi-step chain of reasoning that breaks down at each 

step.

 Congress made an exception from the 

definition of "debt relief agencies" for officers and 

employees of the business that is itself a debt relief 

agency. Partnerships, of course, have employees as 

well, and a run-of-the-mill employee of a partnership 

who doesn't provided the bankruptcy assistance services 

himself is not himself a debt relief agency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about an associate?

 MR. JAY: I think, Justice Ginsburg, an 

associate is an employee, so if the associate in a law 

firm provides -- doesn't provide the bankruptcy 

assistance herself, then she is not a debt relief 

agency. It's the -- because any person is defined under 

the Bankruptcy Code to include individual partnership or 

corporation. That is Section 101(41). It's the law 

firm that provides the services, is a person who 

provides the services and therefore a debt relief

agency. I suppose an individual who provides the 

services himself or herself might be an agency, a debt 

relief agency, as well.

 But we don't think that the absence of a 

specific exception for partners of a partnership tells 

us anything that would derogate from the plain meaning 

of the defined terms in the statute. The fact that 

partners are liable for actions of the partnership is a 

commonplace of partnership law. And it's also not the 

case that all attorneys practice in partnerships. The 

Petitioner law firm is a professional corporation and 

one of the individual Petitioners is a director of 

that -- of that professional corporation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What he -- what I think his 

argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the 

definition of "bankruptcy assistance," you will see 

there are seven different things that a person could do 

and fall within that definition. And all of those seven 

things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies 

you see advertised on television, which say: We will 

help you with your debts. And they probably aren't 

lawyers.

 And, so, if you look at the six of the seven 

things, it's clear that all of those are provided by 

those television companies. And the seventh is simply

added in, namely the providing legal representation, to 

be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies 

actually does something that is legal representation, 

even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.

 So he is saying, read the whole paragraph 

and then you will see they are after the companies that 

appear on television and they're not after lawyers. And 

then he says that's the history of the bill, and so 

forth and so on. Okay.

 Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't --

can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you 

did.

 MR. JAY: Well, I -- I am happy to respond 

to it in further detail. I think that the -- first, the 

reference to appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf 

of another, that can only refer to lawyers. Even if as 

you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, there could 

not only be lawyers. I mean, there are numerous 

proceedings where your brother, your mother, your 

cousin, your friend appears for you. They say: Bring a 

friend, bring one of us.

way.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. JAY: That's right, Justice Breyer, and 

I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have relatives who 

aren't, and you can bring one of them.

 MR. JAY: But appearing -- appearing in a 

case or proceeding under this title, Your Honor, means 

entering an appearance in court. I think that's --

that's the natural reading of that phrase. And 

Petitioners have suggested that this is an attempt to 

catch the unauthorized practice of law. But certainly 

neither the plain meaning nor the legislative record 

suggests that people who are not lawyers were actually 

engaging in conduct so brazen as to show up in Federal 

Bankruptcy Court, enter -- file a notice of appearance 

and purport to be a lawyer. That is not what this 

statute is intended to catch.

 At any rate, the legislative history I think 

amply supports our view. Page 21 of our brief collects 

a number of citations to the legislative record 

specifically referring to attorneys.

 As for the point Mr. Brunstad made about the 

change in the drafting history of this bill from "debt 

relief counseling agency" to "debt relief agency," that

change was made in 1999. And in the House report 

accompanying the 1999 version of the bill, which had 

changed from "debt relief counseling agency" to "debt 

relief agency," the House report said, "It applies to 

attorneys, as well as to non-attorneys, such as petition 

preparers. That is page 120 of House Report 106-123.

 So I think that amply refutes the point 

about the drafting history.

 But in any event, if the Court were to look 

at legislative history, we think that the provisions of 

the 2005 House report accompanying the bill that 

actually was enacted are the most probative, and we've 

cited two references on page 21 of our brief that we 

think amply demonstrate that attorneys are included.

 If the Court has no further questions about 

the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if -- if -- if 

lawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your 

limiting construction works. If a client comes into a 

lawyer and says, look, I know we are thinking of filing 

bankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it; 

can I do it? And the lawyer says: Oh, the law says I 

can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy; 

the Solicitor General says that means I can't give you 

advice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of

assets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.

 MR. JAY: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has that 

person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?

 MR. JAY: I don't think so, Your Honor. The 

statute prohibits only advice to incur more debt in 

contemplation of bankruptcy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the person has 

asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti? And the lawyer, 

although giving perfectly truthful advice, has 

effectively conveyed to his client that if he does he 

would be depriving debtors of assets they might 

otherwise get.

 MR. JAY: But the lawyer in your 

hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, has not advised the 

client to take the trip; it has not advised the client 

to do that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He has communicated 

to the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will 

have a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using 

assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the 

debtors.

 MR. JAY: I suppose that, you know, there 

might be a fact question about whether a particular wink 

and nod communication between an attorney and client

were in fact advice to engage in the transaction, that's 

prohibited under the Bankruptcy Code, the fraudulent or 

abusive transaction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if 

the lawyer said: I can't give you advice in 

contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor 

General's brief, read that.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And a reasonable --

my point is a reasonable person reading the brief would 

say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because 

that might cause me to do something that would defraud 

the debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.

 MR. JAY: Well, if -- if that debtor reads 

our brief, that debtor will also see that there are 

serious consequences for the debtor himself, which is 

precisely why Congress passed this statute providing for 

relief for the debtor against the attorney who provides 

this unethical or abusive advice.

 An attorney -- sorry. A client who incurs 

additional debt intending to defraud the creditor may 

not be able to obtain a discharge of that debt and 

indeed may not be able to obtain a discharge in 

bankruptcy at all.

the things I'm concerned about your limiting 

construction, "intending to defraud the debtor." What 

if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November? 

They've always done it. They are not intending to 

defraud the debtor. They are just doing what they have 

always done. So an attorney that gives that advice, 

would be -- that would be okay?

 MR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think 

the Culver case, a -- a disciplinary case that we 

referred to in our brief, is a good illustration of 

this. Fraud turns on the defrauder's intent as a -- as 

a general matter. And when someone --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if -- so if the 

lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in 

contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that 

fraud turns on the debtor's intent?

 MR. JAY: Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

-- I don't think that that would be advice to incur the 

additional debt. And I don't think that the -- that a 

debtor who read our brief or who informed himself with 

these hints that you're positing the attorney giving, I 

don't think that the debtor would take the step of -- of 

incurring the additional debt, precisely because there 

are consequences for the debtor, and it's -- it's a 

grave risk. That's precisely why Congress prohibited --

prohibited this form of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the whole 

point is that the attorney could be providing advice 

that would steer the debtor away from doing anything 

wrong. And yet the other -- the government would say, 

oh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay 

to take the trip to Tahiti. If he says you can take the 

trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud 

the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as 

telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be 

read as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink 

and a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to 

do? And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation, 

not to defraud the debtors.

 MR. JAY: I think, Your Honor, subject to 

some kind of situations of willful blindness, that the 

attorney in that situation would not be read by any 

factfinder to have advised a -- to have advised her 

client to incur additional debt in contemplation of 

bankruptcy.

 And it is -- it is that that is the 

statutory touchstone.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take some of 

the examples that were in the amicus brief. One of them 

was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a

serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and 

she is at the end of the line on resources. She has her 

trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but 

then she won't be able to carry on her business. And 

she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt --

since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's 

incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of 

bankruptcy.

 Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell 

your -- the lawyer could say: Sell your equipment. 

That wouldn't be a problem. But could the lawyer say, 

incur the debt?

 MR. JAY: I think the lawyer under a number 

of circumstances could say incur the debt. Precisely --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, take this 

circumstance. There is no other -- the person is on a 

brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by 

selling assets or by borrowing.

 MR. JAY: Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, 

the hypothetical doesn't state how she's going to borrow 

the money. So for example, if she has an open home 

equity line of credit and she borrows against that home 

equity line of credit, it's a secured loan that is not 

going to be discharged in a Chapter 7 proceeding, I 

think that that's unobjectionable under our reading of

the statute. It's not -- it's not abusive, because it's 

not an abuse of the bankruptcy system.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose she doesn't have 

a home equity loan.  Suppose she's a renter?

 MR. JAY: Well, the two -- the two scenarios 

that our view -- that in our view are covered by the 

statute are taking on debt in an attempt to abuse the 

bankruptcy system or to defraud the creditor. And even 

-- even someone without -- without a home equity loan, a 

home equity line of credit, can take on additional debt 

without intending to defraud the creditor simply by --

by intending to repay it.

 And that is illustrated in the Culver case, 

in which the attorney had advised the client to take on 

additional debt, to -- indeed, he gave her a credit card 

application and said, get some more cash advances. And 

she said: I don't want to take on this additional debt. 

And he said: Don't worry, I will represent you in 

bankruptcy; you won't have to repay a penny of it. And 

the Court of Appeals of Maryland explained that that was 

unethical advice under the Rule 1.2(d), the model rule 

that applies in just about every jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can come up with 

your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your 

point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting

some that are much more difficult because they depend on 

particular facts. And under your construction it seems 

to me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal, 

ethical advice has got to pause before every sentence 

and think, oh, is this going to be construed in 

violation of subsection (a)(4)?

 MR. JAY: I don't think so, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and I'm certainly not attempting to fight 

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical. I'm attempting to 

illustrate that -- that the aspect of the statute that 

prohibits advice to defraud creditors, you know, will 

turn on, among other things, whether there is any intent 

to repay the debt.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't something in 

contemplation of bankruptcy done only -- isn't something 

done in contemplation of bankruptcy only if it is done 

because of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy 

petition? So that if -- if a person takes on additional 

debt in order to obtain life-saving treatment, that is 

not done in contemplation of bankruptcy; it's not done 

because of the bankruptcy. It's done because there is 

an emergency that requires immediate expenditures.

 MR. JAY: I think that that's right, Justice 

Alito, that in that hypothetical there is no -- the mere 

-- the mere fact that the bankruptcy may be looming,

And the Court has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If indeed "in contemplation 

of bankruptcy" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to 

be for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code --

right? If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness 

arguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal 

anyway, wouldn't it?

 MR. JAY: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So even without this 

statute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about 

whether he's doing something that is unlawful.

 MR. JAY: The two prongs of -- of our 

reading of the statute, that's right, Justice Scalia, 

are to abuse the Bankruptcy Code or to -- or to defraud 

creditors. The fraud of course is illegal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is you 

don't know. Of course you can't give advice to do 

something illegal. But I -- I would think that some of 

the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to 

know whether it's illegal. You yourself say it depends 

on the debtor's intent. So if a client came in to me 

and said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent, 

as a lawyer I would want to say: It depends on why you 

are doing it. But if -- but that I think could be

construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of 

bankruptcy.

 MR. JAY: But precisely because, Mr. Chief 

Justice, the definition of fraud turns on the defendant 

or the fraudulent actor's intent, that's true under 

present law, under Rule 1.2(d) which prohibits all 

attorneys from counseling their clients to commit 

fraudulent acts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The lawyer runs that risk 

anyway, whether this statute applies or not. He has --

he has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on 

creditors.

 MR. JAY: Or an abuse of the Bankruptcy 

Code. And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out in 

Mr. Brunstad's argument, that is something that the 

attorney already must be familiar with under Section 

707(b) and must certify in filing any Chapter 7 

bankruptcy that in -- after the attorney's professional 

investigation, that the granting of relief would not be 

an abuse of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

 Attorneys are -- are making that 

certification every day when they are filing for Chapter 

7 bankruptcies.

unrelated substantive objective. You want to ensure 

that debtors don't do something and you think, well, the 

way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this. 

You're going to say: We are going to regulate what 

lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated 

objective.

 MR. JAY: I don't think it's unrelated, 

Mr. Chief Justice. The objective is in many -- in some 

instances criminal and in other instances it is 

prohibited by the Bankruptcy Code. And the reason 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the objective 

is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being 

indirectly enforced by interfering with the 

attorney-client relationship.

 MR. JAY: Well, it is certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- or affecting the 

attorney-client relationship.

 MR. JAY: It is certainly true, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that the attorney is the 

sophisticated player here. It is the attorney who is 

the repeat player, and it is the attorney who, by being 

made subject to this statute, is --

to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice

about it.

 What if a State thinks that there are too 

many punitive damage awards, that they are out of 

control, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not 

tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek 

punitive damages?

 MR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, seeking 

punitive damages is not illegal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, if it's done 

with the purpose of fraud, it is. If you think, well, 

I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't 

malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard 

is for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like 

here if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's 

illegal, but if you don't it's not.

 MR. JAY: Well, I think that the restriction 

that you're positing is that advice ever to seek 

punitive damages is -- is going to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no, no. 

Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that 

advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.

 MR. JAY: Well, no. That would, of course, 

would be outside the bankruptcy context, and we are 

relying in part here on -- both on the avoidance 

doctrine and on the meaning that "in contemplation of

bankruptcy" has had for a long time.

 But -- but to answer your question, I think 

that, if there is actually a tie between -- so that 

sounds exactly to me like a prohibition saying to the 

lawyer, don't file complaints for punitive damages that 

aren't supported just under the normal Rule 11 evidence 

standard. And I don't think that that is an 

impermissible attempt to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. It's a 

difference between filing, because there the lawyer 

signs the -- signs the complaint. It's giving advice to 

the client.

 And the -- I guess what I would see as the 

parallel is that it's an objective outside the 

attorney-client relationship. It's not like saying, you 

can't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or --

or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the 

client -- protect the client.

 It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.

 MR. JAY: Well, here, I don't think -- I 

don't think it's an extraneous objective. Perhaps I am 

misunderstanding how you -- how the Court is meaning 

extraneous.

 The -- here, the advice is the motivating 

cause in some of these instances of the -- of the debtor

taking the step that's going to lead to actual harm to 

the debtor.

 That's why Congress provided that the remedy 

for a violation of this is either an injunctive action 

by a government official, the U.S. trustee or by the 

Court or State attorney general, or actual damages paid 

to the debtor who has suffered harm from the unethical 

or abuse of advice given to him or her by the attorney.

 So I think that saying that -- that it's 

extraneous to the attorney-client relationship, I think 

that's not the statute that -- that Congress enacted 

here.

 It enacted a statute that protects the 

client from improper, unethical, abusive, or even 

criminal -- criminally fraudulent advice by the 

attorney.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One thing that lawyers 

who render services for money want -- is to be sure that 

they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this 

526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney 

for representing the debtor.

 So what can a lawyer say safely about the 

lawyer's getting paid?

 MR. JAY: Well, I would like to note, if I 

may, Justice Ginsburg, that we don't think that that is

properly part of this challenge. I will be happy -- I 

will be happy to answer the question, but the court of 

appeals struck down this statute, and it said, nine 

times, that it was talking about the portion of the 

statute referring to in contemplation of bankruptcy.

 And the to pay an attorney provision was not 

addressed in the Petitioner's brief in the court of 

appeals or in their brief in opposition to our cert 

position, so we don't -- we don't think it's properly 

here -- it hasn't been addressed.

 But to -- to answer your question, the 

statute says not -- and this part of the statute is on 

page 5a of the appendix to our brief -- "to advise an 

assisted person to incur more debt to pay an attorney or 

bankruptcy petition preparer."

 So advising the client -- you know, that the 

client ought to pay the fee -- you know, here's my bill, 

my fee is due on day X, that simply doesn't come within 

the terms of the statute. It's only to incur more debt 

to pay the attorney.

 And the situation that we think Congress is 

getting at is the circumstance where the attorney wants 

to be paid up-front, again, like in the Culver case, the 

attorney wants his client to take out a cash advance 

from the credit card company, knowing -- and to give

that money to the attorney to pay his fee, precisely 

because the debt's going to be -- the unsecured debt to 

the credit card company is going to be discharged in 

bankruptcy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's the 

clear case. How about the person comes in, shows the 

attorney his or her financial state. There is no money 

to pay the fee. The attorney simply gives a bill and 

says, "I need it by Friday."

 No self-respecting person would believe that 

the individual is going to pay that bill without 

borrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at 

their financial statement and there is no money to be 

had. Would the attorney have violated the statute 

there?

 MR. JAY: I don't think so, Justice 

Sotomayor, precisely because the attorney -- the 

attorney still hasn't issued the advice to incur more 

debt. I mean, the client, of course, also has the 

opportunity -- or the option of not paying the fee and 

carrying it -- carrying it forward into bankruptcy.

 So, in any event, we don't think that that 

provision can -- can be the basis for a holding that the 

other provision about in contemplation of bankruptcy is 

substantially overbroad, which is what the court of

appeals held here.

 If I may, unless the Court has further 

questions on --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just one. So, 

basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt 

to pay an attorney is illegal?

 MR. JAY: To incur more debt to pay an 

attorney, I think -- I think that is the import of the 

statute, and that's because Congress recognized that 

there is an incentive for attorneys to put pressure on 

their clients to -- to favor the attorney as creditor, 

to, essentially, treat the attorney as a creditor in a 

better position than other creditors.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Perhaps I am being --

not quite understanding you. You are underscoring the 

more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the 

advice is to incur it. So what meaning are you giving 

to more that I am missing?

 MR. JAY: Well, in some of the examples that 

have come up in the briefing in this case -- you know, a 

refinancing transaction, for example -- you know, or a 

sale -- sale of the house and replacing it with a 

rental. We don't think that that is more debt.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't how this works 

exactly. I'm not an expert. I thought that, when

someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask 

the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for 

ongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's 

fee. Otherwise, people could never be represented.

 MR. JAY: It's true that the court can 

authorize --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, so why is there some 

incentive here? All the attorney has to do is follow 

ordinary procedure.

 MR. JAY: Precisely because, Justice Breyer, 

different standards apply to the -- to payments made to 

the attorney before the bankruptcy commences and 

payments made to the attorney after the bankruptcy 

commences.

 It's a -- the standard of scrutiny after the 

bankruptcy commences is a -- is a bit more searching 

under Section 330.

 If the Court has no further questions on 

Section 526, I do want to address Section 528, the --

the advertising disclosure requirements. And, there, we 

think that, as Justice Sotomayor brought out in her 

exchange with Mr. Brunstad, there is no evidence in this 

case pertaining to the particular advertisements that 

petitioners want to run.

 They simply say, on pages 38 and 39 of the

joint appendix, that they have advertised, and they wish 

to continue to advertise. There is no allegation about 

their content. And they sought and were granted summary 

judgment in the district court on the theory that this 

statute is unconstitutional.

 And so to the extent that it's anything 

other than a facial challenge, it's an as-applied 

challenge, as applied, essentially, to any attorney or, 

indeed, anyone who wants to run these advertisements.

 We think that, as I understand the gravamen 

of Petitioners' argument, is that the two-sentence 

suggested text is incorrect, that it's -- that it's 

misleading because it's wrong.

 And the basis for that is saying that some 

people who are debt relief agencies don't help people 

file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code. 

That is not correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it misleading for 

an attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency? 

Nobody is going to know what a debt relief agency is, 

unless they are familiar with this statute.

 MR. JAY: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: A perspective client looks 

at that, and they say, well, I don't want a debt relief 

agency, I want a lawyer.

MR. JAY: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: That's misleading.

 MR. JAY: Four points on that, Justice 

Alito.

 First, the advertisement can and indeed, I'm 

sure always will, say that the advertiser is a lawyer. 

Nothing forbids the advertisement from saying that. 

There is no restriction on what content goes in the ad, 

only that it include this is disclaimer.

 Second, the term "debt relief agency" is a 

new one. It was coined by Congress in 2005 precisely 

because it includes -- it includes attorneys; it 

includes bankruptcy petition preparers. They had to --

you know, they had to come up with an amalgamated term 

that includes them both. The fact that it's a new term 

-- it came freighted with no -- no preceding -- no 

baggage from its preceding history, and indeed, if the 

statute were on the books and allowed to take affect 

once this challenge is disposed of, I am confident that 

the meaning would become much more well-accepted.

 And the Petitioners have invited the Court, 

and this is on page 87 of their opening brief, to look 

at their website. And of course that's outside the 

record, but to the extent that the Court looks at it, 

the Court will see that Petitioners refer to their

bankruptcy practice as providing debt relief. We think 

that's a natural way of -- of pitching what the services 

made available by a bankruptcy attorney are: Relief 

from one's debts. So we don't think there is anything 

wrong with that term.

 But I do want to turn back to why it's not 

correct to say that a debt relief agency would ever not 

-- not help people file for bankruptcy relief under the 

Bankruptcy Code. That is because, as I understand 

Petitioners' argument, it's that an assisted person 

might be a creditor. That is not correct.

 The definition of "assisted person" turns on 

having nonexempt property in excess of a certain amount. 

Under section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code, and indeed 

under this Court's decision in Owen v. Owen, there is no 

exempt property until there is a filing for bankruptcy 

and an assembly of the bankruptcy estate and a filing by 

the debtor, or someone on the debtor's behalf, filing 

schedules that specify what property the debtor has and 

which exemptions the debtor chooses to claim. That is 

only done when there is a debtor. Creditors don't do 

that. Creditors don't have nonexempt property. We 

don't think a creditor could be an assisted person.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about a law firm 

that represents the biggest companies in the world? And

so they are never going to consciously, intentionally 

seek out or represent a person defined with the 

financial limitations of this category. But it so 

happens that one of their very rich clients comes in and 

says, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a 

small business; help him or her.

 Is that firm in violation now because their 

advertisements did not include what 528(a) required?

 MR. JAY: Well, first, Justice Sotomayor, 

if, for example, they do it pro bono, then it wouldn't 

-- then it wouldn't trigger the definition at all. But 

assuming that the brother-in-law pays for the services, 

then yes. I mean, yes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they have to -- for 

this one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're 

now violated the statute ex post facto somehow?

 MR. JAY: Not ex post facto, Justice 

Sotomayor. They would become a debt relief agency, and 

thereafter, advertisements directed to the public that 

advertise those specific services, and if they don't 

have a bankruptcy practice at all, or don't advertise 

the services that are listed in section 528, then the 

disclaimer requirement doesn't apply at all. But if 

they then chose --

as the hypothetical suggests, representing only big 

companies, they're probably not advertising to the 

general public anyway.

 MR. JAY: That -- that may well be. Well, 

they may have a website, Justice Scalia, but big firms 

have to deal already with multifarious disclaimer 

requirements in every State where they practice, and 

firm websites often have a lengthy set of disclaimers; 

you know, one required by Texas, and one required by New 

York, and so on. This is something that -- that 

multijurisdictional firms are already familiar with, and 

they provide these disclaimers without problem. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that one of the 

aspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are 

not limited to saying, "We are debt relief agencies; we 

help people file for bankruptcy." They can say anything 

else. But there's no screening -- there is no 

administrator that a law firm can go to and say, "This 

is what I think is substantially similar. Is it okay?"

 MR. JAY: That is true, Justice Ginsburg, 

and there is of course the safe harbor. By using this 

two-sentence statement, the advertiser is certain that 

there will be no problem.

 But I think that -- that a substantially --

a substantially similar statement is a permissive

standard, and if there would be any constitutional

regard.

 Mr. Brunstad, you have three minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &

 MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Thank you.

 Justice Ginsburg, your example about the 

woman who is in need of medical attention falls squarely 

within the statute. The lawyer would be prohibited from 

advising her to incur debt to get needed medical 

attention, and the government, in trying to articulate a 

way around that during the course of the argument, 

articulated no less than five different standards.

 The conduct would have to be fraudulent or 

unethical or abusive or criminal or improper. None of 

those are in the statute, and it's impossible to know 

which one. Chief Justice Roberts, you are absolutely 

right: What this statute does is it's basically trying 

to interfere with the attorney-client relationship, and 

even moreso on the side of "or pay an attorney. "

 And Justice Breyer, here's how it works.

The client comes to -- the prospective client comes to 

the lawyer and is in trouble. And may not know whether 

the client has to file for bankruptcy or not. So there 

is a conversation that happens. And in that 

conversation, it may be decided that the best thing for 

the client to do is to file for bankruptcy, and of 

course, the client will have to know: How am I going to 

pay for this?

 Well, there are two ways. One, the client 

can pay the attorney in full, up front, or the attorney 

can take payment over time. However, this all happens 

before bankruptcy, so there is no involvement of the 

Court at this point. If the attorney accepts payment 

over time, which many do, because it's very expensive to 

file for bankruptcy now and most debtors don't have the 

wherewithal, the attorney, by saying, I take payment 

over time, and the debtor accepting that, the debtor 

would be incurring debt in contemplation of bankruptcy. 

Incurring debt to the attorney. The attorney would be 

proscribed, under the statute, from actually giving that 

particular advice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What the attorney says is, 

Here's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I 

will ask the Court to approve my own fees as something 

that is continuing after bankruptcy.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And he says, This is what 

they will be.

 So what is the harm --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Because you can't --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- since that's what he has 

to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he 

has to do?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because you can't advise the 

client in advance to incur that debt.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, you -- you can't? This 

prevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is 

ask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, that has to happen 

anyway under section --

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course. And so what's 

wrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he 

has to tell the client?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because there, in that 

situation, you would be advising the client to incur the 

debt. In other words, be advising the client to incur 

the debt, not the actual incurrence of the debt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't read the 

hypothetical that you have given as coming within the 

statute. I think what -- what it means: Incurred debt

to pay an attorney, I don't think it means debt to the 

attorney. You are not worried about the attorney 

cheating himself.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, except debt --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Making himself an 

additional creditor. That's ridiculous.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But debt is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What it talks about is 

inducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody 

else to pay the attorney. You know, and that seems to 

be perfectly reasonable.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think it includes both, 

Justice Scalia. For example, you couldn't advises your 

client to borrow $1,000 from your mother.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: And you couldn't -- and you 

also, I think, advise a client to basically borrow money 

from you, the attorney. You're extending services on 

credit; that's incurring a debt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would you worry 

about the attorney, you know, hurting himself?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes no sense.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's at least unclear, 

Justice Scalia, and that is the heart of the problem.
