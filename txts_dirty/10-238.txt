3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument first this morning in Case 10-238, Arizona Free 

Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett and the 

6 consolidated case. 

7  Mr. Maurer. 

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. MAURER 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MAURER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  This case is about whether the government 

13 may insert itself into elections and manipulate campaign 

14 spending to favor its preferred candidates. Arizona 

does this in a manner that is even more burdensome to 

16 free speech than the law at issue in Davis v. FEC. 

17 Arizona burdens the law of three groups that pose no 

18 threat of corruption under this Court's precedents: 

19 Independent expenditure groups, self-financed 

candidates, and candidates who raise private funds under 

21 one of the lowest contribution limits in the Nation. 

22  Under Davis v. FEC and this Court's 

23 well-established precedents, the matching funds 

24 provision is unconstitutional and should be struck down.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Maurer, you -- you

1 don't have any objection, you wouldn't have any 

2 objection, if Arizona trebled the amount at the outset? 

3 In other words, there was a maximum amount, the 

4 so-called matching funds; if it were given all in one 

lump and the publicly funded candidate was told, give it 

6 back if you don't use it, that would be okay? 

7  MR. MAURER: That would be constitutional 

8 under Davis, Your Honor. 

9  This case is not about whether the State of 

Arizona may provide campaign financing using public 

11 funds, nor is it about whether -- the ability of Arizona 

12 to ensure that those who receive the public funds can 

13 run effective campaigns. What this case is about is 

14 whether the government can turn my act of speaking into 

the vehicle by which my political opponents benefit with 

16 direct government subsidies. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I try to understand 

18 that argument a little bit better, Mr. Maurer? 

19 Suppose -- and I know that you think this is not the 

case, but just bear with the hypothetical. Suppose that 

21 there were, in fact, no deterrent effect on your speech 

22 or on the speech of any candidate; in other words, that 

23 people thought, well, you know, I would rather be -­

24 have me be the only person who talks, but -- but I would 

rather talk than be silent, even if it means my opponent

1 can talk, too, so that there's no deterrent effect from 

2 this law whatsoever. 

3  Would there still be a constitutional 

4 objection?

 MR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Davis this Court 

6 recognized that a trigger like this, a -- the law that 

7 turns the choice of -- my choice to speak effectively 

8 into fundraising advantages for my opponents constitutes 

9 a substantial burden. So even if candidates continue to 

speak, the law constitutes a substantial burden on their 

11 speech. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it constitutes a 

13 substantial burden, so even if every single person makes 

14 a choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not 

chill any speak -- any speech. I suppose I'm not sure 

16 what it means to constitute a substantial burden if, in 

17 fact, the law does not chill speech. 

18  MR. MAURER: Well, Your -- Your Honor, this 

19 Court in Davis recognized that when the government 

reaches into a campaign and attempts to manipulate 

21 campaign financing in order to -- in order to basically 

22 effectuate the outcome, that constitutes a -- an 

23 illegitimate governmental purpose. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Maurer, suppose -­

suppose the government imposes a fine of $500 for all 

6

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 political speech, and people nonetheless continue to 

2 engage in political speech and pay the $500. Would that 

3 make the $500 penalty for political speech 

4 constitutional?

 MR. MAURER: No, it would not, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, in fact, there's no 

7 such restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer? There's no 

8 restriction at all here; it's more speech all the way 

9 around?

 MR. MAURER: I would disagree with that, 

11 respectfully, Your Honor. There is a restriction here. 

12 Every time an independent expenditure group or a 

13 privately financed candidate speaks above a certain 

14 amount, the government creates real penalties for them 

to have engaged in unfettered political expression. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, doesn't the government 

17 actually just give a selective subsidy? It's not a 

18 penalty, it's just saying, in order to -- to run an 

19 effective public financing system, when you speak, we're 

going to give a subsidy over a certain amount. So the 

21 trigger does not trigger a penalty; it triggers a 

22 subsidy. 

23  MR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Davis, this 

24 Court recognized that in the context of competitive 

elections, which are a zero-sum game, what benefits one 

7

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 candidate will burden, necessarily, or harm the other 

2 candidate. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't they call it a 

4 subsidy in Davis? I -- if I recall the argument, I 

think that's what -- what it was characterized as there, 

6 too. Did they characterize it as a penalty? I doubt 

7 it. 

8  MR. MAURER: In fact, it was not a subsidy 

9 in Davis, Your Honor. The -- the effect of this law is 

considerably harsher than the law at issue in Davis. In 

11 Davis, the non-millionaires' candidate still had to go 

12 out and actually raise the funds that the Millionaires' 

13 Amendment permitted him to raise. In this case, the law 

14 provides direct government subsidies, based on my act of 

speaking, to my political opponents. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: There is, though, a 

17 significant difference between Davis and this case. 

18 What the expenditure triggered in Davis was a 

19 discriminatory restriction that would never be allowed 

in and of itself. What the law triggers here is 

21 something that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government 

22 could do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech 

23 of a candidate who decides to participate in a public 

24 financing system.

 MR. MAURER: Well, Your Honor, the -- I 

8

1 would point out that independent expenditure groups do 

2 not have that choice of participating in the subsidy or 

3 not. So to the extent that Davis relied on the fact 

4 that there was a discriminatory treatment of speakers in 

the same race, this case -- this law replicates and 

6 actually exacerbates the harm that was at issue in 

7 Davis. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: But there's no particular 

9 as-applied challenge from independent speakers in this 

lawsuit, is there? 

11  MR. MAURER: Yes, there is, Your Honor. I 

12 represent two independent expenditure groups. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: My -- my understanding was 

14 that the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the 

entire law. 

16  MR. MAURER: This is a facial and as-applied 

17 challenge, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in this case, do you 

19 think the law is content-neutral within its own 

universe, which applies just to political speech, so 

21 it's not content-neutral in that sense? But within the 

22 scheme that it sets up, is it content-neutral? 

23  MR. MAURER: Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?

 MR. MAURER: Because the only thing that

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 will trigger matching funds, particularly for 

2 independent expenditure groups, is the content of the 

3 message. If an independent expenditure group speaks in 

4 favor of a privately financed candidate, they will not 

trigger matching funds. If they speak against a 

6 publicly financed candidate, they will trigger matching 

7 funds. That not is only content-based; it is also a 

8 rejection of the standard this Court enunciated in 

9 Citizens United that the government cannot make 

distinguishing burdens on the basis of an identity of a 

11 speaker. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Justice Ginsburg's 

13 hypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about -­

14 suppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink 

party, and then three candidates for the orange party, 

16 and all three candidates for the orange party received 

17 the lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about. But 

18 there's only one candidate on the other side, and he has 

19 to face, or she has to face, three.

 Is that constitutional? 

21  MR. MAURER: It would not be -- I'm sorry. 

22 It would be constitutional under Davis. And I -- and I 

23 think that the point, Your Honor, is reflected -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand the 

hypothetical. I really didn't.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: One person is on one side; 

2 three people are on the other side. And under the 

3 Arizona law, if the three people on the other side are 

4 all participating candidates, each of them gets a bonus 

if there's only one person speaking on behalf of the 

6 non-participating candidate, right? 

7  MR. MAURER: Yes, that's absolutely true. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So $10,000 by 

9 the non-participating candidate triggers off $30,000 

against him? 

11  MR. MAURER: That's exactly right. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. In Justice 

13 Ginsburg's hypothetical, wouldn't you have the same 

14 problem in different terms, in that one candidate faces 

three people, all of whom are funded by the -- by the 

16 government? 

17  MR. MAURER: Well, this case is not 

18 challenging a public financing system, and -­

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just asking as a 

theoretical matter whether there would be a 

21 constitutional problem in the case that I put under 

22 Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical. 

23  MR. MAURER: Not under Davis, Your Honor. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about not under 

Buckley?

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: How about under the First 

2 Amendment? 

3  MR. MAURER: There may be -- there may be 

4 instances where a public financing law is so lopsided 

that it creates a coercive effect, and Buckley was quite 

6 clear that one of the things that was acceptable about 

7 the public financing system at issue in that case was 

8 that it was voluntary. 

9  But in this case, we're dealing with a very 

different type of First Amendment harm. The trigger 

11 matters, Your Honors. It is, in fact, determinative. 

12 It is exactly the same kind of trigger -­

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the point 

14 of Buckley was that the public funding, which you can 

accept or reject, the justification for it was that it 

16 increased rather than decreased speech. And the -- I 

17 think you were quite right in recognizing that matching 

18 funds, this Court has said, do not conflict with the -­

19 with the First Amendment.

 MR. MAURER: Your Honor, if I -- if I had 

21 said that, I was mistaken. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not matching funds. 

23 Public funding. 

24  MR. MAURER: Oh, okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Public funding. And so

1 if it turns out that the States -- public funding isn't 

2 being used because -- because the limits are low, and 

3 yet the, the State wants to conserve the public fisc. 

4 So instead of just increasing the amount at the outset, 

it says the -- the -- the object is the same, but we're 

6 economizing by not giving it out in one lump sum, we're 

7 giving it out in installments. 

8  MR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Riley v. 

9 National Federation of the Blind, this Court recognized 

that -- that the government cannot sacrifice speech for 

11 efficiency, and what -- if -- if we accept the holding 

12 of Davis v. FEC and accept that that is still a holding 

13 that is viable under the First Amendment, then what 

14 the -- the position of the Respondents is, is that they, 

in fact, can sacrifice free speech in order to be more 

16 efficient, but -­

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you tell me 

18 on that, because I take it you agree with Justice 

19 Ginsburg about Buckley. In Buckley the Court says, 

public financing is a means of eliminating the improper 

21 influence of large private corporations, furthers a 

22 significant government interest. 

23  We both agree that's what it says? 

24  MR. MAURER: Yes, that's what Buckley says, 

Your Honor.

3  Now, your objection is how much do they pay. 

4  MR. MAURER: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Here they have a trigger, 

6 not -- not quantitatively. But here they say it's okay 

7 to finance a public candidate publicly, okay to do that. 

8 Now, what we're going to do is give them a million 

9 dollars to start with, up to $3 million to spend, 

depending on how much their opponents spend. Now, you 

11 think that's unconstitutional? 

12  My question to you is, what would be a 

13 constitutional system in your opinion? 

14  MR. MAURER: Your Honor -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That would be helpful. 

16  MR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Buckley this 

17 Court recognized -­

18  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in 

19 Buckley. I'm interested in your opinion. You object to 

the amount being paid in installments. What, in your 

21 opinion, would be a constitutional system? I don't need 

22 to repeat my question, which I just did, but I want that 

23 answer, your answer to that.

be based upon Buckley, however.

2  MR. MAURER: Yes, the presidential financing 

3 system is constitutional, Your Honor. And I would 

4 also -- I would also respectfully disagree with your 

characterization that the -- the nature of our objection 

6 has to do with the fact that our opponents are receiving 

7 money. 

8  The problem here is not that our -- the 

9 opponents of my clients are receiving money. It's what 

triggers that, and what triggers that is my exercise of 

11 my free speech rights. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Would there be anything 

13 unconstitutional about a system that worked roughly like 

14 this? At the beginning -- at some point prior to each 

election cycle, the commission that supervises this law 

16 would make a calculation about how much money would be 

17 needed for a candidate in a gubernatorial race or a 

18 State senate race or an assembly race, if that's what 

19 it's called in Arizona, to get that candidate's message 

out to the electorate, and that would be the amount of 

21 the public funding, period. 

22  MR. MAURER: That would be a constitutional 

23 system, Your Honor. There is no constitutional 

24 objection or at least we're not raising any 

constitutional objection to the idea that there is a -­

15

1 that public financing means that people can't run 

2 effective races. You can have a public financing system 

3 with sufficient funds to run an effective race. But 

4 what you cannot do is exactly what Arizona has done, 

which is turn my act of speaking into the vehicle by 

6 which my political opponents benefit. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's interesting, 

8 Mr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a 

9 difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the 

facts here. In other words, you said that Justice 

11 Alito's hypothetical would be constitutional, even 

12 though under Justice Alito's hypothetical the State is 

13 trying to figure out how much money it takes to run a 

14 competitive race and giving people who enter the public 

financing system that amount of money. That's exactly 

16 what the State is doing here, but it's doing it in 

17 actually a more accurate way. 

18  So if Justice Alito's hypothetical is 

19 constitutional, why isn't this? They're both trying to 

do the same thing, which is to put sufficient money in 

21 the hands of people who enter the public financing 

22 system in order to run a competitive race. 

23  MR. MAURER: Your Honor, one of the things 

24 that would distinguish that is that it -- Justice 

Alito's hypothetical completely divorces the amount of

1 the grant from my political activity or the political 

2 activity of people who don't want to or cannot take 

3 public funds in Arizona. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think, to the 

contrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the 

6 State is estimating how much a person will spend. Here 

7 the State is measuring how much a person will spend. 

8 The only difference is that one is more accurate than 

9 the other.

 MR. MAURER: Your Honor, I believe the 

11 distinction would lie in the fact that the purpose of 

12 this law is not to provide necessarily the ability of 

13 candidates to run effective publicly financed campaigns. 

14 The purpose of this law is to limit spending in 

elections and to level the playing field. Justice 

16 Alito's hypothetical -­

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: I think the purpose of this 

18 law is to prevent corruption. That's what the purpose 

19 of all public financing systems are.

 MR. MAURER: Your Honor, I would 

21 respectfully disagree that the purpose of this law is to 

22 prevent corruption, and I would like to read from the 

23 executive director of the Clean Elections Commission who 

24 said that: "It cannot be disputed that the purpose of 

the Clean Elections Act is to equalize the playing field

1 and to give participating candidates equal opportunity 

2 to get their message out," which is at Joint Appendix 

3 236. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Maurer, some 

people may use certain buzz words and other people don't 

6 use those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40 

7 years what public financing systems have been based upon 

8 is the idea that when there is a lot of private money 

9 floating around the political system, that candidates 

and then public office holders get beholden to various 

11 people who are giving that money and make actions based 

12 on how much they receive from those people, and that's 

13 the idea of a public financing system is to try to 

14 prevent that?

 MR. MAURER: Well, that is the basis of 

16 public financing systems in general, but this system 

17 does not actually address that because this Court -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: We have the contrary argue 

19 here. I'm sure that in some of the public financing 

cases that we've heard argued, it was asserted that the 

21 purpose was to level the playing field, and that that 

22 was an entirely valid purpose. I'm unaware that all 

23 public financing laws have had as their purpose simply 

24 to avoid corruption.

 MR. MAURER: Your Honor, it -- when this law

1 was promoted, when it was drafted, when it was 

2 propagated and -- and -- and campaigned about to the 

3 people of the State of Arizona, it was presented as 

4 doing two things: Leveling the playing field and 

limiting spending in campaigns. 

6  It wasn't until this Court's decision in -­

7 in Davis that the State of Arizona suddenly discovered 

8 that the purpose of the law was actually to fight 

9 corruption or the primary purpose was to actually fight 

corruption. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about all the 

12 background, there had been a number of scandals in 

13 Arizona, there had been vote buying? I thought that 

14 that was part of the origin of this law, was not as you 

now say had nothing to do with corruption. I thought it 

16 emerged out of that, those startling incidents of people 

17 actually selling their votes. 

18  MR. MAURER: Well, they were selling their 

19 votes for outright bribes, Your Honor. They weren't 

selling them for campaign contributions. And if this 

21 law was aimed at the single narrow exception that this 

22 Court recognized to the -- to the general principle that 

23 restrictions on political activity violate the First 

24 Amendment, then they would not have structured this law

4 I -- I just want to understand exactly what you claim 

the burden is, because I thought that what the circuit 

6 and the courts below said was that there was no evidence 

7 that any candidate actually didn't speak or didn't fund 

8 raise because of this law. There's some claims to the 

9 contrary in your briefs before us, but I've looked for 

that below, and there doesn't appear to be any record of 

11 that. 

12  So, I'm going to start from that -- that 

13 assumption, that there was no evidence in the courts

21 Ninth Circuit of the evidence produced at the district 

22 court. There was considerable evidence of people not 

23 making expenditures, of slowing their fund-raising,

to avoid triggering matching funds. But even if that

1  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRADLEY S. PHILLIPS 

2  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

3  MR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

4 please the Court:

 Public funding of elections results in more 

6 speech and more electoral competition and directly 

7 furthers the government's compelling interest in 

8 combatting real and apparent corruption in politics. 

9 There was a suggestion in response, I believe, to 

Justice Kagan's question that this law was not intended 

11 to combat corruption, but I -­

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But counsel, how -­

13 the supposition that it results in more speech, let's 

14 take the independent expenditure example. You've got 

one candidate running against three others. There's an 

16 independent expenditure on behalf of the one candidate. 

17 That means, say $10,000. That means each of the other 

18 three get $10,000 of their own. Now, that might promote 

19 more speech, but the effect may well be for the 

independent expenditure to say, I'm not going to spend 

21 the money, and so the other candidates don't get the 

22 money and you have less speech. 

23  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, it would 

24 result in more speech certainly if all the candidates 

got the $10,000. There's no evidence in the record of

18 Your Honor. The statistical data, however, here 

19 indicates that individual expenditures have in fact gone 

up since the implementation of matching funds in 

21 Arizona. That obviously doesn't directly address the

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by certain entities? I 

6 mean, I can understand you say, well, it will stop big 

7 donors from giving $10 million to somebody's campaign 

8 and having that person in his pocket. But that -- that 

9 donor is still going to have that -- that senator or 

whoever it is just as much indebted to him if he gives 

11 $10 million, regardless of whether everybody else gets 

12 $10 million as well. 

13  How does it -- how does it combat corruption 

14 unless -- unless the other side is correct that its 

whole purpose is to suppress the contribution of $10 

16 million, to make it unworthwhile for anybody to give $10 

17 million? 

18  MR. PHILLIPS: Your Honor, Arizona's 

19 triggered matching funds provision combats corruption in 

the same manner that public funding combats corruption, 

21 because that -- the law is designed to encourage 

22 candidates to accept public funding because it offers a 

23 viable public funding option to them while conserving 

24 the State's resources. And public funding serves the 

anticorruption rationale in two fundamental ways.

1 First, it frees the candidates who accept public funding 

2 from the need to accept potentially corrupting private 

3 contributions. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there are States that 

have public funding without having a matching fund 

6 provision. I would appreciate it if you would compare 

7 these two regimes. The first is exactly what Arizona 

8 has now. The second is exactly what Arizona has now 

9 minus the matching fund provision. So under the second 

one you have very strict contribution limits, and you 

11 have reporting of all contributions. Now, why does the 

12 addition of the matching fund provision serve an 

13 anticorruption interest? 

14  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I think for 

the same reasons I think that are implicit in the 

16 Buckley Court's upholding of public funding at the same 

17 time that the Court upheld contribution limits and 

18 disclosure requirements, I think implicitly therefore 

19 holding that the three could go together, serving the 

anticorruption interests. And I think it does that, 

21 first, by, first by -- first by freeing, as I said, 

22 freeing the publicly funded candidates from the need 

23 even to take the limited privately -- private 

24 contributions that would be allowed under the law, and 

which this Court has never held there's a minimum at

1 which that no longer conceivably becomes corrupting. 

2  But secondly, it -- it combats corruption by 

3 providing for more candidates running, more political 

4 speech, and more electoral competition, all of which 

have happened in Arizona. And where you have more 

6 candidates and more electoral competition, you have less 

7 -- you are going to have less corruption. The record -­

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the idea is 

9 this is a way of encouraging candidates to take the 

public financing, right? 

11  MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it encourage 

13 more candidates to do that if you doubled the amount 

14 that was available for every additional amount that the 

privately financed candidate spends? He spends $1,000 

16 over the amount and the publicly financed candidate gets 

17 $2,000. A lot more people are going to do the publicly 

18 financing route if that were the case. 

19  MR. PHILLIPS: It would encourage them more, 

Your Honor. It's not our contention that anything that 

21 a State or Congress did to encourage public funding 

22 would necessarily be constitutional. I think the 

23 question would be different if it were a two to one or, 

24 to make a more stark contrast, a ten to one match. I 

think that would raise multiple questions.

1  One question would be, looking at the 

2 statute in its entirety, has the public funding scheme 

3 become coercive rather than voluntary? It would raise 

4 the question whether the purpose of the law were really 

to simply provide viable funding to candidates -­

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's kind of 

7 an odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it? 

8 That you get a 100 percent matching as opposed to, say, 

9 110 percent or 150 percent? Somewhere in the First 

Amendment the line is drawn on the amount? 

11  MR. PHILLIPS: I think somewhere in the 

12 First Amendment there is a line, Your Honor, implicit in 

13 Buckley, where a public funding law provides such 

14 substantial benefits without sufficient countervailing 

burdens to publicly funded candidates that it becomes 

16 coercive rather than voluntary, and therefore you have 

17 coerced someone into accepting a spending limit, which I 

18 believe would be certainly subject to strict scrutiny 

19 and almost surely unconstitutional. And I think that is 

-- the Court would need to assess that in each instance, 

21 and I think it could be done. I certainly don't think 

22 that here you have a coercive system. A third of the 

23 candidates don't accept public funding, and most of 

24 those who don't and accept -- and face publicly funded 

candidates actually win.

4 accept public funding, it doesn't work in that sense. 

But it certainly works in the sense that two-thirds of 

6 the candidates do, and it works in the sense that there 

7 hasn't been a repeat of the public corruption scandals 

8 in Arizona since the law was passed. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that one 

reason for people to decline participation in the 

11 program is because they do not want to deter independent 

12 expenditures? And let me -- we'll talk about 

13 independent expenditures for just a few minutes if you 

14 don't mind. You indicated independent expenditure has 

gone up. I thought there was some data in the record 

16 that showed the population has gone up and so there's an 

17 argument about that. But just as a common sense matter, 

18 if I'm someone with the capacity and the will to make an 

19 independent expenditure, why don't I think twice if this 

is going to generate an equal amount on the other side, 

21 which might be better spent. Sometimes an independent 

22 expenditure is not really that effective, it's in a bad 

23 market, it's a bad message. But this results in cash to 

24 the participating candidate, who then can use it in the 

most effective way.

believe the opposite view, so you can tell me about 

6 that. 

7  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, independent 

8 expenditure groups -- there's no evidence that it really 

9 in fact has been deterred. Your Honor, independent 

expenditure groups essentially have to take their 

11 candidates as they find them, if they will. There's no 

12 discrimination among someone who is speaking in favor of 

13 a privately financed candidate and one who is speaking 

14 in favor of a participating candidate.

 The different treatment is the different 

16 treatment of the candidates. Someone who speaks against 

17 a privately financed candidate runs the risk that that 

18 person is going to use the ad against them to do all of 

19 the things that the public financed candidate may not 

do. He can raise private contributions, he can take 

21 money from his political party, he can spend his own 

22 money and he can spend unlimited amounts of money.

 There was testimony in the, in the district

effective, in order to be unable to trigger the matching

14  MR. PHILLIPS: I might think twice about it,

19 doing that and what my political views were and lose my 

anonymity, but thinking twice this Court has held in

1 think-twice notion that Mr. Chief Justice raised, but I 

2 don't think -- I don't think this creates any more of a 

3 burden, indeed we would submit less of a burden, than a 

4 disclosure requirement. You would expect somebody who 

believes that their speech is more persuasive than the 

6 other participants in the race, whether they be an 

7 independent group or a candidate, to choose more speech, 

8 because they think that, if I speak, even if the other 

9 people speak, my message is going to get out there and 

it's going to be preferable. 

11  There may be some few candidates, although 

12 there's not a record of that here, some few groups or 

13 candidates who would decide that they would prefer less 

14 speech. It's better for me if my opponent or the other 

candidate doesn't speak more because he's going to be 

16 more persuasive than I am. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your focus on 

18 persuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a 

19 particular view of the political process that may not be 

applicable in every case. Political scientists 

21 sometimes tell you that it's not persuasion, but simply 

22 playing to your base, getting them more actively 

23 involved. So it's not the somewhat more academic view

one is persuasive. Is that a permissible objective for

3  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I don't 

4 think that the State is doing that. What I'm addressing 

is the effect of the law, and I think Your Honor makes a 

6 good point, which is that they assume, Petitioners 

7 assume, that essentially this is a zero-sum game and 

8 that because if I spend $10,000 the other guy is going 

9 to get $10,000 to respond, that somehow that's a wash. 

Well, it's not a wash, first, because I think my speech 

11 is more persuasive so I'm going to do it anyway, because 

12 I'd rather get it out there; and secondly, because I may 

13 be spending my $10,000 on getting out my voters, and I 

14 need to do that regardless.

 And that's why you don't see in the 

16 statistics any evidence that this actually suppresses 

17 speech. And as I said, there may be some few candidates 

18 who would opt for less speech because it's strategically 

19 better for them, but we would submit that that -­

1 I want to spend more than the matching fund amount, even 

2 though I know that if I do that, the other side will get 

3 additional money? 

4  Now, if they say, no, I don't -- I'm not 

going to do it under those circumstances, they will take 

6 the public financing. And if they choose the private 

7 financing, it means they probably made a decision going 

8 in that they're going to -- they're going to be one of 

9 those who is willing to suffer the consequences of 

spending over the amount. So I don't see what this -- I 

11 don't see what that proves. 

12  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I think 

13 what it proves is that you -- the key point in here is 

14 that initial choice that is voluntarily made by each of 

the candidates, whether the system of public financing 

16 under which you may receive matching funds is better for 

17 them or whether the system -­

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask z question that 

19 goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, which I don't 

think you fully had a chance to -- or fully answered? 

21 And that has to do with the independent expenditures. 

22  Let's say there are two candidates running 

23 for governor, and one who is a participating candidate 

24 is taking a position on a very controversial Arizona 

issue with which I disagree, and the other is a

1 non-participating candidate who is taking a position on 

2 that controversial issue and I agree with that. 

3  Now, if I choose to run an ad, pay for an ad 

4 supporting the non-participating candidate, I know that 

the -- the candidate that I dislike on that issue is 

6 going to get an additional amount of funds, and -- but 

7 if I choose to run an ad supporting the participating 

8 candidate, the opposite doesn't happen. Now, why isn't 

9 that a clear-cut discrimination based on the content of 

speech? 

11  MR. PHILLIPS: Because, Your Honor, the 

12 discrimination, if you want to -- if you call it 

13 discrimination or different treatment, is based on the 

14 initial choices of the candidates as to how they're 

going to finance their campaigns. It's not based on the 

16 content of the speech. 

17  There's -- matching funds do not turn in any 

18 way on the ideas or the messages or the viewpoints or 

19 the subject matter of the candidate or the independent 

group's speech or on the identity of the speaker. It 

21 turns entirely on what choice the candidate made at the 

22 outset. 

23  And it is analogous, in a sense, Your Honor, 

24 to the situation that's faced by a contributor who is 

deciding whether to contribute, for example, to a

2 contribute to the organization that can lobby, they 

3 don't get a tax deduction. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: But if I'm the 

independent -- if I'm the independent expenditure maker, 

6 I haven't made a choice at the beginning. I haven't 

7 decided to participate or not participate. What I care 

8 about is the issue that's being debated between these 

9 two candidates.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And -- and, Your Honor, two 

11 points. You're free, of course, to run an ad that 

12 addresses the issue without expressly advocating for or 

13 against any candidate without triggering matching funds. 

14 And secondly, the candidates made a choice, and if 

you're the person who is -- who supports the 

16 participating candidate, you can't make a contribution 

17 to that candidate, while you could to the other 

18 candidate because of the choice that was made. And you 

19 can be responded to, if you run an ad criticizing the 

non-participating candidate, you can be responded to 

21 with unlimited amounts of money from -- taken from a 

22 political party, the person's own money, whereas, too, 

23 if you attack a privately financed candidate, you would 

24 only be subject to being potentially responded to with 

limited matching funds.

1  And it all flows from the voluntary choice 

2 that is made at the outset by the candidates about which 

3 system of financing is better for them. 

4  And this is a system, the matching funds 

system, is a mechanism that the State uses in order to 

6 be able to offer viable public funding to candidates 

7 without wasting public resources, and both the logic and 

8 evidence demonstrates that it is, in fact, effective, 

9 both at promoting speech by encouraging candidates to 

run and, indeed, particularly resulting in more 

11 competitive races for incumbents -- against incumbents 

12 in Arizona and promoting speech. 

13  And I would just like briefly to address 

14 Justice Alito's question about the ex ante measurement 

of the funds. Now, of course, we would submit that it's 

16 not relevant because we're not in -- should not be in 

17 strict scrutiny and therefore don't need to show this is 

18 the least restrictive means, Your Honor. 

19  But, Justice Alito, an ex ante system would 

run substantial risks of underfunding or overfunding 

21 races, and in particular -- and therefore wouldn't serve 

22 the State's interest in saving money or in properly 

23 measuring -- but, in particular, would run the risk of 

24 having an incumbent who might have been in office for 

several terms unopposed and not having spent any money

1 in those races, and now you are measuring how much his 

2 possibly now viable challenger will get in public 

3 funding based upon some minuscule amount of money that 

4 the incumbent has needed to spend.

 So I think that that would not serve the 

6 State's interests in ensuring the candidates actually 

7 have viable public funding.

 MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

16 please the Court: 

17  I would like to begin, if I may, with 

18 Justice Alito's question to Mr. Phillips about whether 

19 the independent expenditure aspect of this statute is 

content-neutral, and I think that, looking at this in 

21 the context of a multi-candidate race, which most races 

22 in Arizona are, is important to set the context, because 

23 most races in Arizona are not one candidate against 

24 another candidate.

1 has two members, so every general election has at least 

2 four candidates. And it simply is not the case that 

3 running an ad in support of a publicly financed 

4 candidate does not trigger matching funds. It depends 

not on what the ad says, not even on who the candidate 

6 is being supported, but on whether another candidate in 

7 the race takes public financing. So money spent to 

8 support one publicly financed candidate may trigger 

9 matching funds to another. That's not a content 

discrimination. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay -- Mr. Jay, do you 

12 agree with the -- the assertion of Mr. Phillips that 

13 this does not favor incumbents? 

14  I would have thought that if I'm an 

incumbent with name recognition, I would love to be able 

16 to not raise any money and just -- just take the public 

17 funding, knowing that if worse comes to worse and I have 

18 an opponent who does have a lot of independent 

19 expenditures for him, I'll be able to get that money 

free from the State. It seems to me it's very much 

21 pro-incumbent rather than anti-incumbent.

1 endorse the sentiment, because I think that the 

2 Petitioners' evidence in this case, the Petitioners who 

3 were incumbent office holders and say that they did not 

4 spend money because they were -- they feared the 

response that would be paid for by matching funds, I 

6 think their own evidence, including the declaration that 

7 they put in at Joint Appendix 364, says: If I can keep 

8 the spending down, me as an incumbent, I have a 

9 tremendous advantage. That's an Arizona legislator 

talking to one of the -- talking to the -- to one of 

11 their experts. 

12  And that's because -- and a race that 

13 features low dollar amounts on both sides often 

14 advantages an incumbent. And that is the purpose -­

that is the purpose of the matching funds provision, to 

16 allow -- to allow challengers to be competitively 

17 funded. That's the purpose of the initial grant. The 

18 reason that -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer -- your answer 

depends upon whether you believe that this scheme will 

21 keep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the 

22 expenditures. And if you believe that it will deter 

23 people from making contributions, it will keep the 

24 expenditures down.

1 deterring people from making contributions, Justice 

2 Scalia. When there are competitive races, the matching 

3 funds provision provides a formula for giving the 

4 publicly funded candidate as much money as the private 

-- as the privately funded candidate that they're 

6 competing with. And in most cases the incentives on 

7 both sides are for more speech, for both sides to get 

8 out their message, run their ads, and persuade the 

9 voters.

 In some cases -- and we submit that the 

11 anecdotal evidence the Petitioners have submitted 

12 touches on these cases -- the privately funded candidate 

13 may have an incentive to keep spending down, but we 

14 don't think that's true systemically under this system. 

We think that the -- that the public financing in 

16 general and the matching funds provision in particular 

17 facilitates speech, because the only consequence of 

18 running an independent expenditure, for example, at 

19 most, the consequence is that another party will get to 

run a responsive ad, and the sum of speech will be 

21 increased.

"level the playing field" when it comes to running for

8  MR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, whatever 

9 the Citizens Clean Elections Commission says on its web 

site I think isn't dispositive of what the voters of 

11 Arizona had in mind when they passed this initiative. 

12 The Court -- this Court has recognized since Buckley

14 purpose, and it does so because it eliminates the 

influence of private contributions on the candidates who 

16 take public financing. And it -­

18 matching fund provision by itself does not serve an 

19 anticorruption purpose?

 MR. JAY: Well, Justice Alito, the matching 

21 funds provision the State of Arizona has concluded is an 

22 important way of ensuring that candidates will take 

23 public financing, because it is a formula of ensuring 

24 that candidates will have enough money to run 

competitive races without wasting the State's money

3 general question. Answer this if you wish. Don't if 

4 you don't want to, and the same goes for your opponent. 

But as I hear this argument, what's going through my 

6 mind is we are deeply into the details of a very complex 

7 bill. McCain-Feingold is hundreds of pages, and we 

8 cannot possibly test each provision which is related to 

9 the others on such a test of whether it equalizes or 

incentivizes or some other thing, because the answer is 

11 normally we don't know. 

12  And it is better to say it's all illegal

Justice Breyer. I think that it's remarkable -- I

6  MR. JAY: That's not our position. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what if -- what if 

8 the State of Arizona says we're not going to give -­

send out officers of Arizona to argue on behalf of these

12  MR. JAY: Yes -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: And would you come in and 

14 say, well, it's perfectly okay because its purpose is to 

make public funding attractive to candidates? The mere 

16 fact that it makes it more attractive does not answer 

17 the question whether it's constitutional. 

18  MR. JAY: It doesn't make -- it doesn't just 

19 make it more attractive, Justice Scalia. It allows 

publicly-funded candidates to run on the same footing as 

21 privately-funded candidates, because they can spend 

22 comparable amounts. That is the point that we're 

23 making, not that any -- not that any incentive the State

4 to engage in speech when a disclosure requirement takes 

effect. Anyone who wishes to run an independent 

6 expenditure under the system upheld in Buckley, anyone 

7 who had spent over $100 had to disclose. And the Court 

8 recognized in Buckley that it was undeniably the case 

9 that public disclosure would deter some individuals. 

The Court nonetheless didn't apply strict scrutiny 

11 because that is not the kind of severe burden that the 

12 First Amendment recognizes. The Court -­

1 that a publicly-financed candidate takes. There is an 

2 absolute cap -- under this matching funds provision, 

3 there is an absolute cap above which a publicly-financed 

4 candidate cannot spend, no matter what.

 Once a publicly-financed candidate reaches 

6 that cap, which they've agreed to as a condition of 

7 taking public financing, independent groups and their 

8 opponents can -- can raise more money, can run more ads 

9 against them, completely without limit, and you -- you 

have to take that into consideration when you're 

11 considering what incentives and what deterrent effect 

12 the matching funds provision is having. 

13  Publicly-funded candidates accept certain 

14 limits, and one of those limits is an absolute limit on 

spending. The matching funds provision simply adjusts 

16 that limit based on how much is being spent in that 

17 race. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why do you 

19 think the elections commission then tells us its purpose 

is to level the playing field? 

21  MR. JAY: I can't -- I -- I don't speak for 

22 the elections commission, Mr. Chief Justice, but the

3 distributing information, John McComish also had a 

4 similar response, the Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee 

did not engage in a particular campaign because it would 

6 have triggered matching funds. 

7  But ultimately when we get right down to it, 

8 though, the question is does this create the same kind 

9 of burden in -- as -- as in Davis, and I could go 

through point by point, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Jay's 

11 argument, but they're all answered by Davis. 

12  Davis recognized that this type of 

13 interference with the -- with the voters' decision as to 

14 who to elect to office and the purpose of doing that in 

order to raise the voices of those the government thinks 

16 is speaking too little and muffle the voices of those 

17 the government think is speaking too much is completely 

18 illegitimate. 

19  This case is determined by Davis. For 

instance, the -- the argument that Mr. Phillips made 

21 that speech has gone up in -- in Arizona is -- is undone 

22 by Davis, which recognizes that increases in the 

23 aggregate of speech cannot justify restrictions on 

24 individual First Amendment rights.

1 by saying that if what had been triggered was not an 

2 inequitable contribution limit raised but instead both a 

3 contribution raised for both candidates, that would have 

4 been perfectly appropriate, notwithstanding that that 

would have put many independent funders to a real 

6 choice. The independent funder says, well, I'm not 

7 taking any contributions, so that's only going to help 

8 my opponent. What's the difference in that case? 

9  MR. MAURER: I think what this Court was 

recognizing in Davis is that when the -- when the 

11 government relaxes restrictions on free speech, when 

12 there's more freedom, that doesn't constitute a 

13 violation of the First Amendment. 

14  That's not what the government is doing 

here. It's effectuating its goal of limiting spending 

16 in leveling the playing field by burdening and 

17 disincentivizing people to engage in their First 

18 Amendment rights. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, as I said, the Davis 

system that was -- the system that was specifically 

21 approved in Davis would disincentivize many people, many 

22 independent funders from speaking, would put that person
