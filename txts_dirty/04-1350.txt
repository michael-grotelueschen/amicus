 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Incorporated.

 Mr. Dabney.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case concerns a very broadly worded 

patent claim, claim 4 of the Engelgau patent, that the 

Solicitor General and the United States Patent and 

Trademark Office have both told this Court is invalid 

under Section 103 of the Patent Act and was issued in 

error. The Federal Circuit's vacatur of summary 

judgment in this case is grounded in a judicially 

devised test that is fundamentally inconsistent with --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask, if that's the 

position of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to 

cancel the patent?

 MR. DABNEY: The case is in litigation at 

this point, Justice Ginsburg, and in patent litigation 

district courts are vested with authority and this 

Court is vested with authority to render a judgment of

invalidity under Section 282 of the Patent Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, you 

say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent, 

that it's an invalid issuance. So why aren't they 

curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is 

going to do?

 MR. DABNEY: Well, there is the possibility 

of director- initiated re-examination of patents as 

certainly an administrative remedy that does exist. But 

where a case is in pending litigation such as this, the 

traditional way that these disputes are resolved is for 

a court to apply the law to the facts and render a 

judgment on a defense of invalidity which has been 

pleaded to the plaintiff's claim of patent infringement 

in this case. This issue arises in the context of a 

defense pleaded to a claim for patent infringement and 

I'm not sure that the Patent Office really could swoop 

in and cut off the plaintiff's claim in the manner Your 

Honor is suggesting.

 The Federal Circuit in this case applied the 

approach it's applied in previous cases, which is a 

categorical approach. The Federal Circuit says that no 

matter what might be the nature of an alleged invention 

or improvement, no matter how broad might be a claim 

made in an issued patent, no matter how small might be

the difference between a patent claim and prior art, and 

no matter how modest might have been the degree of skill 

needed to devise subject matter described by a patent 

claim, the Federal Circuit says regardless of any or all 

of that a court of the United States can never, ever 

sustain a defense of invalidity under Section 103 of the 

Patent Act except in a very limited and narrowly defined 

circumstance.

 That circumstance is a record that includes 

clear and convincing evidence, that yields a jury 

verdict or specific finding showing what the Federal 

Circuit calls a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to 

combine prior art teachings in the particular manner 

claimed by the patent at issue. The decision in this 

case treats Section 103 not, as this Court has said, as 

a codification of a condition for patentability whose 

benchmark is skill and ingenuity. The decision in this 

case treats section 1 as implementing a supposed 

entitlement to patent protection that a court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about in 

this case.

 MR. DABNEY: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're talking about what 

the law should be. Would you make, be making the same 

argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions

of the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within 

the year, and each as I remember they held that the 

patent was obvious and therefore invalid? Suppose we 

were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were 

they, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar?

 MR. DABNEY: Your Honor, what the Federal 

Circuit has done in recent times has been after a 

certiorari was granted in this case to erect a series of 

escape devices from what is otherwise a categorical test 

that must be imposed in all cases. As a practical 

matter the Federal Circuit still characterizes as an 

issue of fact for determination by a jury the presence 

or absence of teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and 

so these seemingly remedial steps that have been taken 

by the Federal Circuit do not materially affect the 

problem that's praised by this case, which is the well 

nigh impossibility nowadays of being able to have an 

efficient, inexpensive, quick and predictable 

determination of whether claimed subject matter meets 

the statutory standard.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what is the difference 

between asking whether something is implicit in the, in 

the prior art and simply asking whether it would have 

been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?

 MR. DABNEY: The statute and this Court's

precedents make the benchmark of patentability skill, 

what degree of skill is needed to devise subject matter 

in respect to an objectively defined problem, objective 

looking at the claim and looking at the prior art? What 

the Federal Circuit is talking about now is an inquiry 

into motivation, not skill. Those two are very 

different concepts. There is not a word in this Court's 

precedents that says that whether a patent should be 

granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person 

had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows 

he could do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the 

reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this 

additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say 

obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight. In 

hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; 

and that you need -- if you don't have the sort of 

constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too 

easy to say that everything was obvious.

 MR. DABNEY: Well, the Court, Mr. Chief 

Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant 

by the term "hindsight." If by hindsight is meant 

looking at what's claimed now, the subject matter sought 

to be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to 

call that analytical process improper hindsight is to

make a frontal assault on the statute itself. If by 

hindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay 

doorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity 

than were required by ordinary skill in the art was 

needed to do that, to say that that constitutes improper 

hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire 

body of this Court's precedents construing section 103 

and its common law predecessors.

 With regard to the kind of bias Your Honor 

is talking about, this Court's precedents provide a 

wealth of mechanisms for protecting against that, 

including the statement towards the end of the Graham 

opinion, which is the only source of the word 

"hindsight" that I've seen cited in the amici brief, 

which was a discussion of the secondary consideration. 

So that in a case like Goodyear against Rayovac there's 

an excellent case where the claimed subject matter seems 

so simple in hindsight. This was a case decided by this 

Court in 1944. A leakproof battery that had been a 

problem that had defied solution for years and there was 

all kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that 

it was not solved was considered important by this Court 

in sustaining the validity of the patent in that case, 

which claimed nothing more than a sheet metal sheath 

wrapped around the electrodes and materials generated in

the battery.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I can understand, I think, 

what a teaching is. I take it a teaching is you put all 

the prior art -- that's what I guess that's what Judge 

Rich explained, which I thought was very enlightening to 

me in I can't remember the name of the case, Wigmore, 

Winsmore --

MR. DABNEY: Winslow.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Winslow. You put it all 

around the room. All right, we've got it all around the 

room, and I begin to look at it and if I see over that 

it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it 

says, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching 

and then it's obvious. Now, maybe it doesn't have the 

teaching, it just has the suggestion. Maybe it says, we 

suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's 

obvious. But I don't understand, though I've read it 

about 15 or 20 times now, it though I've read it about 

15 or 20 times now, I just don't understand what is 

meant by the term "motivation."

 MR. DABNEY: Well, the best I think anybody 

could do would be to look at the opinion in this case 

and try to figure that out.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I tried. You've read a lot 

of cases. You're a patent lawyer, and so what is the

understanding as best you have it of what is just meant 

by the term "motivation"? To be more specific, if they 

mean motivated to go look to the prior art, well, 

anybody would want to look in the prior art. If I want 

to invent something I'll look anywhere. I'll look to 

the prior art. I'll look to the Library of Congress. 

I'll look to my cousin. I mean, I'll look wherever I 

can find it. So they can't mean that, and if they don't 

mean that what do they mean?

 MR. DABNEY: Well, in this case what the 

respondents is Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation 

to look to the Asano-designed pedal because he was 

trying to meet the requirements of Fort Motor Company 

and Asano would not have met those requirements and 

therefore Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation to 

start with Asano.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Say that again? You 

wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to 

find your problem. What's an example where you have a 

motivation distinguishing you from everybody else? I 

mean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior 

art.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You disagree with the 

motivation test.

 MR. DABNEY: Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So perhaps you're not the 

JUSTICE BREYER: Right person to ask.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DABNEY: I respectfully suggest --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have a 

motive to answer that question right away.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, that's fine.

 MR. DABNEY: I believe if you study 

carefully this Court's precedence, including Graham 

itself and just about every other case this Court has 

ever decided, what this Court has said is the measure, 

what our society agreed to pay off on is subject matter 

that reflects a certain degree of skill. And this Court 

has rejected time and time again the notion that someone 

who was the first simply to take advantage of the known 

capability of technology was entitled to a patent.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would it be, would 

it be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches 

us something important; it has a valuable place; it's 

just not the exclusive test for what's obvious.

 MR. DABNEY: Certainly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do we have to reject it 

all out of -- out of hand?

of motivation to devise something.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Motivation in this special 

sense.

 MR. DABNEY: Well, I'm not sure it is in a 

special sense. What the Federal Circuit has done is 

has, it has attributed controlling significance to what 

is in most cases at best a factor, and in fact is 

nothing more than a legal argument about the preemptive 

effect of prior art. The motivation debate in this case 

is all about what is the preemptive legal effect of the 

Asano reference. It either invalidates the claim --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but, but my question 

is does it not serve to show us at least one way in 

which there can be obviousness?

 MR. DABNEY: I would agree that if there is 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may not be the 

exclusive test. We're -- I'm asking what the test ought 

to be.

 MR. DABNEY: Well, the test, I mean in this 

case, the specific claim at issue in this case is very 

analogous to the claim that this Court considered in the 

Anderson's-Black Rock case. What we have in this case 

is no dispute as to any of the factual inquiries that 

have traditionally defined patent validity analysis.

The prior art that we rely on, it's undisputed that it's 

prior art and it's in the record. The level of skill is 

undisputed. The quantum of difference between the 

claimed subject matter and the prior art is undisputed. 

The only issue in this case is what legal consequences 

follow from that. What question do you ask to decide 

whether or not that difference adds up to a patentable 

invention?

 It's very analogous to what was going on in 

the Anderson's-Black Rock case. Anderson's-Black Rock 

was a case like this in which someone had invented a 

radiant heat burner and the patentee in that case had 

seen that there was a market for using that by attaching 

it to an asphalt spreader. So the patent claim in that 

case was taking someone else's invention, the radiant 

heat burner and hanging it on a standard painting 

apparatus and using it for its, one of its marketable 

purposes.

 This Court held in this, in the 

Anderson's-Black Rock case that the patentee had not 

done anything patentable in that case. All he had done 

was take a burner that functioned as a burner, and a 

spreader that functioned as a spreader, and the two 

components did not affect one another's operation at 

all. It was in the parlance of this Court's precedents,

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does -- how does 

motivation enter into that analysis in that case? How 

would you, how would you have applied the motivation? I 

-- like Justice Breyer, I don't understand what the 

motivation -- motivation element is. How would you have 

applied the --

MR. DABNEY: Well, if the patentee in that 

case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He had no particular 

motivation to use that earlier patent, did he?

 MR. DABNEY: Well, actually in that case 

there actually was quite a story. In that case there 

was a story that for years and years you'd had this cold 

joint problem of laying successive courses of asphalt 

blacktop, and -- and this guy actually saw something 

that was interesting, that you could use this radiant 

heat burner to solve the asphalt blacktop problem. That 

was not what he claimed, though.

 What he claimed was an apparatus that just 

had these two things together, and they didn't interact 

with one another any more than if they had been both put 

in the same shopping bag. And that's what we have in 

this case. We have an adjustable pedal assembly that 

does whatever --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. No. It took 

from 10 years to go from -- I think 10 years from Asano 

to Engelgau, so it must have been not all that obvious.

 MR. DABNEY: Well, the, on this record, and 

even if you take at face value what's said in the 

respondent's brief in this case, which is very largely 

not based on the record, the story is, from Mr. Engelgau 

is, Fort Motor Company had a particular requirement and 

Mr. Engelgau sat down to design to it. He to design a 

pedal that had would meet Ford's requirements and one 

way that he did that was to come up with the kind of 

pedal assembly that's shown in the figures of the 

patent.

 But we are not here talking about the 

patentability of the figures of the patent. We are not 

talking about the patentability of claims 1, 2 or 3 of 

the patent; we are talking about claim 4 in which these 

respondents got a little greedy. Claim 4 describes 

almost nothing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you, do you concede --

do you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid?

 MR. DABNEY: We take no position on that. 

They're not an issue in the case.

opinion as an expert would you --

 MR. DABNEY: Well, Your Honor, with respect, 

I would have no opinion on that question.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DABNEY: I could stand here and make 

arguments.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean it seems to 

me that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford 

is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic 

-- you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose; 

the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together.

 MR. DABNEY: Here's the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why doesn't -- don't 1, 2 

and 3 do the same thing?

 MR. DABNEY: Well, because -- because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they're invalid then I 

have -- then I'm struggling to find what your test is.

 MR. DABNEY: Here's the reason.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know what your 

test is.

 MR. DABNEY: Here's the reason. What's 

shown in the figures of the Engelgau patent is an 

adjustable pedal assembly that has a large bore tube 

from which you suspended a pedal arm on a yoke, and it 

slides back and forth along the tube. And that's the

way that it provides for adjustment. And in claims 1, 2 

and 3 some of that structure is recited. So those 

claims would not necessarily be invalid by the Asano 

reference because the Asana adjustment mechanism doesn't 

use a tube, and doesn't use a yoke; it uses pins and 

slots and it provides adjustment by a different 

mechanism. The respondents have not asserted claims 1, 

2 and 3 in this case because those claims don't describe 

anything remotely like the petitioner's pedals. They 

limited their claim to claim 4 because only by claiming 

this enormous verbal abstraction that is claim 4 can 

they make a colorable claim of patent infringement 

against the petitioner in this case.

 So I would respectfully submit that the 

Court does not need to decide whether 1, 2 or 3 would be 

valid but the point would be, the question would be what 

we did in the Hotchkiss case or in the Anderson's-Black 

Rock case or any of these cases. Would it have required 

more than ordinary skill to devise that claim structure 

with those additional structural limitations to solve 

some objectively defined problem, and that hasn't been 

litigated or briefed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to the asphalt 

case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim 

for a process patent, that it might have been valid?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 Construed as the sole means of proving 

obviousness the teaching suggestion motivation test is 

contrary to the Patent Act, irreconcilable with this 

Court's precedents and bad policy. It asks the wrong 

question and in cases like this one, it produces the 

wrong answer. It should be rejected and the judgment of 

the Court of Appeals should be reversed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you 

understand motivation to refer to in that test?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, it's not entirely clear, 

Your Honor. I think that it's sometimes difficult to 

distinguish, certainly between motivation and 

suggestion. One way in which it is used for example, is 

if there were some indication in the prior art that

doing something a certain way might save money and then 

there would be a motivation to save money, which might 

supply the requisite motivation for combining the two 

prior art references.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that in that 

context it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we --

that is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then 

supplement it with other, with other means of, other 

ways of showing obviousness?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. We agree that 

teaching suggestion and motivation are valid means of 

proving obviousness, valid considerations for the Court. 

And this Court's precedents are entirely consistent with 

that. A number of cases cited by respondent show that 

the Court has looked to suggestion as a means to 

determining whether a patent is obvious.

 The problem with the Federal Circuit's test 

is it makes that the exclusive test and precludes 

obviousness determinations in the absence of 

satisfaction of that test which this Court's precedents 

are clearly not consistent with. In fact in Graham 

itself, in the Sakraida case, in Dann against Johnston, 

lower courts had held patents valid because of a lack of 

suggestion. This Court reversed without requiring or 

even addressing the question whether there was some

explicit principle that had been proven by the party 

challenging the patent, by clear evidence that there was 

such a teaching suggestion motivation. It's just 

foreign to this Court's precedents as a mandatory 

prerequisite for obviousness.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the, 

sort of the revolution argument that whether it's 

contrary or intention with, in fact the, it's been 

applied in what is now the Fed Circuit for what, 20 

years, more than 20 years I guess. And to tip it over 

now is going to produce chaos. What's the answer to 

that?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, several things, Your 

Honor. First of all, of course, there can be no 

legitimate reliance in lower court precedent that's 

contrary to Supreme Court precedent, and it was an open 

secret in the patent bar that the approach being taken 

by the Federal Circuit was inconsistent with cases such 

as this Court's Sakraida decision.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I realize there's 

been comment on it, but guess I'm -- I'm raising the 

question that comes up in the old motto. I mean, if the 

error is common enough and long enough, the error 

becomes the law. And in effect is that what we are 

confronted with here?

MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. I just think 

it would be dangerous proposition for this Court to 

endorse that line of argumentation but even leaving that 

aside, it's not justified here on the facts. And this 

patent is a good example. No one is suggesting that 

claims 1 through 3 are invalid; the problem here is that 

claim 4 sweeps so broadly, so much broader than what the 

applicant in fact invented, that it sweeps in obvious 

manifestations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -- if we see it 

your way, are there going to be 100,000 cases filed 

tomorrow morning?

 MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

What we are talking about here are claims at the outer 

boundaries of patentability, even under the Federal 

Circuit's test. And in those cases there will no doubt 

be some claims, such as the claim in this case that can 

be resolved at summary judgment by a court, that the 

court can simply determine as a matter of law, it's 

obvious. Whereas under the Federal Circuit's test it 

has to go to a jury and the somewhat unpredictable, at 

the least --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, this is the 

problem that I have with your test. I think I 

understand you right, now, just to say teaching

suggestion motivation has its place; it's okay; but it 

shouldn't be the exclusive test.

 MR. HUNGAR: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what I understand 

your brief to say is that it has to be supplemented with 

what you have called, you've labelled "sufficiently 

innovative." And then I begin to think well, what's 

"sufficiently innovative?" How is a trier supposed to 

know if something -- in other words I think what you're 

suggesting as a supplement is rather vague.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think the 

"sufficiently innovative" is more of a description 

rather than a test; it's a description of what this 

Court said in Graham. In Graham itself the Court laid 

out the proper analysis which is you need to consider in 

detail, not in the more cursory fashion that the Federal 

Circuit's test encourages, but in detail the 

capabilities of a person of ordinary skill and the 

content of the prior art and the differences between the 

prior art and the invention, and ascertain -- it's 

ultimately a legal judgment informed by those detailed 

factual inquiries, whether it is obvious or nonobvious 

and entitled to patent protection.

 And in addition I would point out that this 

Court in Sakraida provided a framework for assessing

patents like this one, where each of the elements is set 

forth in the prior art and each of the elements in the 

claimed invention is merely performing its already 

known, previously known function as set forth in the 

prior art.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, I have a 

question that's sort of along the lines of Justice 

Ginsburg's. It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has 

been applying this test. It's also the Patent Office 

and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for 

20 years or so.

 What, what is -- assuming that we sweep that 

test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to 

the presumption of validity of, of patents which the 

courts have been, have been traditionally applying? 

Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid 

which have been issued under an erroneous test for the 

last 20 years?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think that it 

would make sense because the statute requires it, and as 

a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference, 

because the only category of cases in which the result 

would change under our test is the category in which as 

a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are 

required under Graham, as a matter of law the Court

concludes that the difference between the claimed 

invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot 

be given the protection of a patent. And in those 

circumstances the presumption doesn't come into play. 

It's a legal determination; the presumption has been 

understood to effect the burden of proof, and in the 

Federal Circuit's view the measure of the burden of 

proof requiring clear and convincing evidence on the 

underlying factual considerations, not the ultimate 

legal determination.

 But one of the problems with the Federal 

Circuit's test is that it transforms what this Court 

made clear in Graham is supposed to be a legal 

determination. Ultimately it transforms it into a jury 

question. Because in a case like this one where you 

have as conclusory affidavits from respondent's experts 

saying "oh, this would not have been obvious." And that 

in the Court of Appeals view is enough to create a jury 

question and then you then have to role the dice in 

front of a jury in each one of these cases, except of 

course the many cases in which the challenger can't meet 

the teaching suggestion motivation test at all and 

simply is unable to challenge the validity of the 

patent, notwithstanding this Court's holding in Graham 

that it's ultimately a legal determination -- admittedly

one informed by detailed factual inquiries.

 Another problem with the Federal Circuit's 

test is that it devalues and de-emphasizes the statutory 

focus and this Court's focus in Graham on the 

capabilities of the person of ordinary skill.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well when you talk 

about the statutory focus, your innovation test -- I 

mean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of 

nonobviousness? Or is it an additional test beyond what 

the statute requires?

 MR. HUNGAR: We haven't suggested an 

innovation test, Your Honor. We were simply attempting 

to describe in perhaps imprecise terms the holding of 

this Court in Graham, and the holding of this Court in 

Graham is that the ultimate inquiry for the court, 

obviously suggestion, teaching, motivation, teaching a 

way in the prior art, all of these are factual, 

subsidiary factual issues that will shed light and a 

great deal of light on the ultimate question in each 

particular case, but ultimately the question for the 

court is whether in light of all those underlying 

factual showings the differences between the claimed 

invention and the prior art are sufficient to, that they 

would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in 

the art. And that ultimately is a legal determination,

you can refer to that as sufficiently innovative to 

justify a patent, but the ultimate question, the 

ultimate test is the one set forth in the statute and in 

the Graham decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, would there 

have been anything for a jury under your test?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because in this 

case it is perfectly clear that it would have been 

obvious for a person of ordinary skill to take the Asano 

patent, add the sensor, the electronic sensor in a 

manner that that off-the-shelf sensor is designed to be 

added, and voila, you have a winning combination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about claims 1, 2 and 

3?

 MR. HUNGAR: I don't know, Your Honor. 

Those have not been litigated. Those have additional 

limitations that are not present in claim 4 that, 

depending on what the prior art might reveal about 

those, we have no way of knowing whether they would or 

would not be obvious because obviously, that question 

has not been litigated. Certainly there is nothing in 

the record in this case that would suggest they are 

obvious.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the experts?

gotten very far. But there were two experts, were there 

not, who made declarations, that had all kinds of 

credentials, and they called it elegant, novel and 

nonobvious.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. There are two 

problems with that. Number one, the conclusory 

assertion that an invention is nonobvious, just like the 

assertion that it's obvious from an expert, should have 

no weight because of course --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well these, these were 

declarants who gave a whole declaration. They didn't 

just say that bottom line.

 MR. HUNGAR: But again, it's a legal 

question. And moreover and more importantly, the 

problem with the Court of Appeals analysis, one problem, 

and with the experts' analysis, is that they're focusing 

on the narrow definition of the quote unquote problem by 

looking only at what this particular inventor was trying 

to solve, but the scope of the claim is far broader.

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 I think the Court will want to have 

available to it the red brief and also this big, which 

is the supplemental joint appendix which has some of the 

patents in it, and I'm going to quote from both of them. 

I think you can't understand what motivation means and 

what the whole test that the Federal Circuit is 

employing means --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right about that.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- without --

(Laughter.)

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- without starting from the 

statute itself. And so I want to start with the 

statutory text and use that as the jumping off point 

like the Court of Appeals has for the inquiry that it's 

asking. It's reproduced at page 21 of the red brief. 

And Congress said it's the first blocked quote, that a 

patent may not be obtained though the invention is not 

identically disclosed or described, as set forth in 

Section 102 of this title. Those are the other 

requirements for giving a patent. If the differences 

between the subject matter sought to be patented and the 

prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole 

would have been obvious at the time the invention was 

made to a person having ordinary skill in the art. So

the term of art here is obvious, and the plain meaning 

of obvious, if you understand that the outcome of this 

case is obvious or if you think that the, what the 

Federal Circuit means by its test is not obvious, is 

something that's either apparent or not apparent, and 

that's what the Federal Circuit is asking. It says 

look, take the invention and see whether or not it was 

apparent or not apparent, and what the Federal -- to a 

person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention. 

And what the Federal Circuit says is, we want to be 

inclusive.

 The other side takes these words, teaching, 

suggestion, motivation, as if they were words of 

limitation rather than these words of inclusion. And 

what the Federal Circuit has said is what we mean by 

teaching a suggestion or a motivation, and it can be 

explicit or implicit, is anything that would have made 

this invention apparent to a practitioner at the time. 

That's what it's after. It wants to know, look, was it 

apparent to someone else, a practitioner at the time of 

the invention of Engelgau to take Asano and put the 

electronic throttle control on pin --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's all it 

means, why don't they say it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They do say that.

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then what is this 

word that confused me a lot, motivation? I found a lot 

of enlightenment in Judge Rich's idea of taking all the 

relevant art and putting it up around the room in 

pictures. And then I thought, well, okay, if that art 

teaches me to do what your client did, okay, it doesn't. 

Does it suggest it? Not really. Well then, you say 

motivated. Where does that get you?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand. Can I take 

you to their, the Federal Circuit's answer? It's two 

pages before the quote that I just gave you, page 19, 

there's another blocked quote. The Federal Circuit has 

explained what it's talking about when it means a 

motivation. They say that they have repeatedly held 

that there is an implicit motivation to combine. It 

exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from 

the prior art as a whole, that's a teaching, but when 

the improvement is technology independent and the 

combination of references results in a product or 

process. And these are common motivations. You would 

do it because it's more desirable because it's stronger, 

cheaper, faster, lighter, smaller, more durable, more 

efficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER: For who? For me?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: For a practitioner, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is not -- I can 

illustrate it with this case. The question is not do 

you want more efficient pedals. If that's the test, 

then everything is obvious because we always want more 

efficient pedals, Justice, and I'll come back to this. 

It's always going to be the case that if your test is 

capability, every patent including the first three 

claims of this one is going to be obvious, because 

you're always capable of assembling a pedal. What it 

says, what the Federal Circuit says, is there a 

motivation to make this invention? Was there 

motivation, and this was the heart of the Federal 

Circuit's ruling in this case, their theory is that 

Asano renders our patent obvious. And the Federal 

Circuit said all right, what's the motivation to take 

Asano and take the electronic throttle control and make 

it responsive --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the claim goes beyond 

that. Your claim goes beyond the Asano combination and 

in your brief you, you, you discuss the case as though 

your, your limited claim 4 just relates to this 

invention that you, you -- nobody would have thought of 

using the Asano pedal in the Ford car given the limited 

space available and so forth, and therefore, this was 

really an invention. But that's not the claim. The 

claim is simply combining the, any pedal, the Asano 

pedal or any other one with the, with the automatic 

electronic sensor.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In a particular place, yes, 

that's correct. Justice Scalia, the reason these 

Federal Circuit judges were right notwithstanding your 

correct point which is, just to be clear, our invention 

is not limited to Asano. Our invention takes any fixed 

pivot adjustable pedal and any electronic throttle 

control and says combine it in a particular way. The 

Federal Circuit's point is their motion rests on Asano.

 The other side's theory is, we've got this 

invention, Engelgau. As has been pointed out, nobody 

did anything like this for 10 years. The other side 

comes back and says yes, that it would have been obvious 

to somebody who had an Asano to do the same thing 

basically. And so the Federal Circuit said okay, show

us. If this isn't going to be hindsight, where we just 

give you the invention and you just say oh, I could have 

done that, they say give us any evidence that someone 

would have done what you say, which is take Asano, it's 

their argument, Asano --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But why Asano?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You'll have to ask them, 

Justice Scalia. They filed a motion that it was 

obvious.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're the one that's 

standing up here making that argument. They're not 

doing it.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the patent 

examiner gave us a patent, initially rejected this 

patent as obvious, decided that it wasn't after 

considering all of these things, a statutory presumption 

of validity attached under Section 282. So we have what 

we say is clear and convincing evidence, the question 

isn't presented here, but whatever. The other side 

comes in and tries to knock our patent out. They file a 

motion, and the motion rests on a piece of prior art. 

And so what the Federal Circuit said is, if we're not 

going to knock all of these patents out by hindsight, 

all we want to know is one thing and you know, on 

remand, they may well be able to prove it. We don't

think they can. But all it's asking for is for the 

district court to make a finding that says the other 

side is right, that it would have been obvious to take 

Asano, which is their only example, and combine it with 

electronic throttle control in this way. That is what's 

so --

JUSTICE BREYER: You look at that thing, you 

think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's 

a genius, is there are wheels that turn around.  And the 

wheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you 

make the accelerator go up and down. Now I think since 

high school a person has known that if you have three 

parts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio 

one to the other, you can measure the speed of any part 

by attaching a device to any other as long as you know 

these elementary mathematics. I suppose it wasn't 

Mr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured 

that one out. So he simply looks to something that 

moves, and he sticks a sticker on it.

 Now to me, I grant you I'm not an expert, 

but it looks at about the same level as I have a sensor 

on my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is 

coming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it. So I 

think of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper 

hinge, okay? Now I just think that how could I get a

patent for that, and that -- now that's very naive, 

that's very naive. But the point is, I don't see what 

we're talking about, and what is supposed to happen with 

all these affidavits. And the -- the -- Mr. Asano 

himself, I would think at some point when the Ford 

company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of 

course will have every motivation in the world to do 

precisely what your client did, because he can't use 

that thing that pulls back and forth anymore. Rather, 

he has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to 

something that moves in fixed proportion to the 

accelerator going up and down. Now those are my whole 

reactions when I saw this and I began to think it looks 

pretty obvious. What's supposed to go on, I don't 

understand it.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Let me answer it in a 

few different ways because I want to again specify and 

make clear what it is that the Federal Circuit says is 

included within teaching, suggestions, motivations. 

Then I want to turn to our invention and the affidavits 

in the case. The Federal Circuit has said, and I'll 

just -- you can come back to it for future reference. 

It's recorded at the bottom of page 19 of our brief.

motivations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It looks like Dystar was 

decided by the Federal Circuit after it decided this 

case, didn't it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you have to be 

defending what the Federal Circuit did in this case. 

And the fact that they say well now, what this means is 

really in some other case, that seems to me that's 

really irrelevant.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If I could just clarify, 

Dystar --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think you should 

tell us when the case has been decided after, I think it 

has much less, much less weight.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I agree 

that you have to distinguish two things rightly. The 

first is the state of the law as it exists now, and 

that's what we ask you to affirm. And that is, the 

Federal Circuit has made quite clear that its test is 

inclusive, and we think that that establishes that it's 

not necessary to add some new sort of undetermined test 

of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say its test is 

inclusive. I would say its test is meaningless. They

have essentially said, our test simply reduces to what, 

what your opponents in this litigation say. If you 

think that's being inclusive, you know -- it doesn't add 

anything whatever to -- to the -- to the question, would 

a person of the ordinary skill in this field have 

conceived of this idea.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I disagree 

for the following reasons, and that is: What the 

Federal Circuit is saying is that any amount of 

evidence, any form of evidence is relevant to answer a 

particular question. We have a question that we want 

answered. They have a question they want answered. 

Their question, the petitioner at least, I'm not sure 

about the Solicitor General, the petitioner's standard 

is, was somebody capable of doing this? We have a 

different question. Would it have been apparent to, and 

that's what we think the text requires, would it have 

been apparent to one skilled in the art? And so the 

Federal Circuit is saying whatever evidence you want to 

bring to bear --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think there's a 

grammatical difference in the meaning of the word 

obvious and the meaning of the word apparent?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I don't.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that the

question is whether it's obvious?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. And what 

the Federal Circuit is saying, you have -- what it's 

saying is, if you just look to capability, and that is, 

could you put Asano together on pin 54, you will miss 

the most important part of invention. And that is, 

invention isn't at the end when you put the two things 

together. Invention is finding the problem, deciding 

what pieces of the prior art to use, and deciding how to 

put them together. Everybody is always capable of, it 

will always be the case, I think, that a practitioner of 

the art can put them together. Remember the very point 

of a patent, when you look at our patent at the end of 

the case, we were required to explain it in great 

detail.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but your -- the 

Federal Circuit is saying that, the gist of it is if and 

only if the previous patents taught this. But you, you 

can look at these two devices, and you're a good 

mechanic, you've never seen a patent, you've never read 

these patents, you've never read these claims, you've 

never been to the Supreme Court, and you put them 

together.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that's 

not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Federal Circuit 

said oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, with 

respect, that is not a fair description of the Federal 

Circuit's test, and I will take you to the language that 

addressed this claim. It's at the bottom of page 18 of 

our brief and also at the top of 19, and we quote the 

Solicitor General's brief. The Solicitor General 

asserts to the contrary, that Federal Circuit precedent 

focuses attention exclusively on a search for teaching, 

suggestions and motivations in the prior art. That is 

not accurate. That was a quote from their brief.

 Here is a quote from the Solicitor General. 

It is from a new opinion of the Federal Circuit, but it 

is quoting, it is citing a series of old opinions from 

the Federal Circuit. Under our nonrigid motivation, 

suggestion, teaching test, a suggestion to combine need 

not be found in the prior art. And then there is the 

blocked quote that I read to Justice Breyer about making 

things cheaper, faster, lighter, common knowledge and 

common sense.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, once you define the 

teaching, suggestion and motivation test that way so 

that it can be implicit, it can be based on common 

sense, I don't quite understand the difference between

that and simply asking whether it's obvious. Could you 

just explain what that adds?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, all that it adds is an 

analytical framework. It's an elaboration. The word 

"obvious" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It adds a layer of 

Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back 

and forth, but if it's -- particularly if it's 

nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching, 

suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's 

nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than 

meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather 

than focusing on the statute.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

reason that the Federal Circuit disagrees and over 30 

years this special court has elaborated this problem --

these judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on 

nonobviousness -- is that we need a guidance, we need 

guidance for the lower courts. We need to focus them on 

the right question, and for patent examiners and patent 

practitioners, and the right question is not is -- was 

someone merely capable of putting the two together. The 

right question is is there any reason to believe that it 

would have been apparent at the time of the invention to 

create this invention whether it's through a teaching, a

suggestion, a motivation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or anything else.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Or anything else.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't you say that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is -- I agree with the 

Chief Justice. It is misleading to say that the whole 

world is embraced within these three nouns, teaching, 

suggestion, or motivation, and then you define teaching, 

suggestion, or motivation to mean anything that renders 

it nonobvious. This is gobbledygook. It really is, 

it's irrational.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I this it 

would be surprising for this experienced Court and all 

of the patent bar -- remember, every single major patent 

bar association in the country has filed on our side --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does 

that cut? That just indicates that this is profitable 

for the patent bar.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, it turns 

out that actually is not accurate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It produces more patents, 

which is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire 

patents, not to get patent applications denied but to

get them granted. And the more you narrow the 

obviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns, 

the more likely it is that the patent will be granted.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, that is not 

the point of these bar associations' either. These bar 

associations, including the American Bar Association, 

the American Intellectual Property Law Association, have 

lawyers on both sides of all these cases. They're 

looking for a test that has balance and that is what the 

Federal Circuit has done. Now, let me just say --

JUSTICE BREYER: As you know, we've had a 

series of cases and in these series of cases we have 

received many, many briefs from all kinds of 

organizations and there are many from various parts of 

the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal 

circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent 

bar and others who are saying basically that they've 

leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent 

they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications 

for the economy. So if you're going to these very basic 

deep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I 

do now think, that there is a huge argument going on in 

those who are interested in patent as to whether there 

is too much protectionism and not enough attention paid 

to competition or whether it's about right, or whether

it goes some other way.

 In other words, your argument now suggests 

all this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it 

isn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us 

to be involved in. So what are your views since you 

brought it up?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, there is a 

big debate over whether or not there is too much 

patenting in this country and Congress is involved in 

the debate. What I don't think that there is that much 

debate about is whether a properly applied test that the 

Federal Circuit has articulated strikes the right 

balance, because that is why all of the patent bar 

associations have filed on our side, I think, and that 

is it takes account of the interests of both sides and 

that is it says, you're right, we have to be concerned 

about overpatenting, it says on the other hand we have 

to be very concerned about hindsight determinations of 

obviousness.

 But I do want to just step back and make a 

point about judicial administration. If the ultimate 

conclusion of this Court is that teaching, suggestion, 

motivation just boils down into an inquiry into 

obviousness, I still think that an opinion that says 

that and says that it, that this Court believes that it

is embracing the bottom line of what the Federal Circuit 

has been doing, is the one that will be much better for 

the patent system and for the courts, because we have a 

real concern and that was articulated -- asked about at 

least by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, and that 

is if you purport to change the rules unnecessarily, if 

you say we're going off in a different direction, this 

test has -- underlies 160,000 patents issued every year. 

There is no rhyme or reason to applying a presumption of 

validity if you're saying the patent examiner applied 

the wrong test. And it will create genuine dramatic 

instability.

 The question I think is if you think instead 

that the teaching, suggestion, motivation test is 

incomplete, what is it that you want to add on top of 

it, and that's really what I didn't understand from the 

first half-hour. If it's going to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have to go on 

top. It's just to say what you've been saying, that 

what you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a 

person, as the statute says, who is familiar with the 

subject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a 

person this would have been obvious. Now, there are 

many, and this Court has listed several, factors that 

might count in favor of it not being obvious, such as

people have been trying to do it for a long time and 

they haven't been able to figure out how. That's a good 

one, and there are some other ones here. If there's a 

teaching right there, it seems to cut the other way.

 But to hope to have a nonexclusive list 

seems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to 

have an exclusive list of what counts as negligence. In 

the law we have many standards that you can get clues 

about, but you can't absolutely define them, and why 

isn't this one of them?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I think 

that's the dilemma that the Federal Circuit has been 

facing and is in answer to the criticism of Justice 

Scalia and that is the Federal Circuit isn't trying to 

articulate every single possible thing that can show you 

that it is obvious. What it's trying to do is focus you 

on the right question. It's trying to say, here's the 

process of invention: We have to figure out there's a 

problem. We have to figure out what prior art you're 

going to use. You have to figure out how you're going 

to combine it, and then you actually combine it.

 The act of invention, the thing that is the 

discovery that we want to encourage, is there in the 

middle. It's picking out the prior art and deciding how 

to put it together.

JUSTICE BREYER: Supposing we then were to 

say exactly what this Court already said, that the 

standard here is obvious, we list a few of these 

additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as 

the Court said before, all these additional factors are 

there. They can be considered in an appropriate case, 

but it is important to remember that the ultimate matter 

which is for the judge is to apply the word "obvious" or 

not in light of the evidence and what the experts say 

and the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the 

factfinder. Would you have any objection to an opinion 

like that.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, in this case 

let's assume that we all strike out on coming out with 

the magic formulation. One of the ways the law 

progresses is we go from case to case, and in this case 

you have two standards of operation. One is a pedal 

that basically operates by pressure. The other -- and 

by levers. Other is by electronics, and these are two 

different methods of making the carburetor release the 

fuel. So why not, so somebody combines them. Why is 

that such a big deal as, as claim 4 says it is. 

Certainly this inventor would not be the only one to 

think that the two could and should be combined.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that's 

absolutely right, and I just want to focus you on why it 

is you now think I lose. We don't lose because that's 

not our invention. The Federal Circuit's point was that 

that this invention, claim 4, does not put an electronic 

throttle control together with an adjustable pedal. 

It's do it in a particular way. And let me take you in 

summary judgment in this case to the declarations and 

explain why it is that the experts here said you would 

not have done this. And I just have to urge the Court 

to cross the t's and dot the i's here and pay particular 

attention to exactly what it is that we claimed and 

exactly what it is that they said rendered our patent 

obvious.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in claim 4 do 

you say it's putting it together in a particular way?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, if I can 

take you to the big book that I asked you to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, page 8.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Page 8, exactly. And that 

is, there are six different pieces to claim 4 and I'm 

going to take you to the relevant one. And they are the 

last two paragraphs here. We claim an electronic 

control attached to the support, so we specify where the 

electronic control is going to be. And then we say

where, what that electronic control is going to be 

responsive to, and that's the next paragraph: Said 

apparatus characterized by said electronic control being 

responsive to said pivot, and that said pivot is defined 

above to be a fixed pivot. So here is the design.

 Let me take you to a picture if I could, and 

that's going to be at the back of the red brief. 

Engelgau is the third foldout page. It looks like this. 

What we say is there is going to be a fixed pivot. It's 

the red pivot in our picture, and there's going to be an 

electronic throttle control. That's actually on the --

you can't see it because you're looking straight at the 

device. That's on the next page. It's in green. 

There's going to be an electronic throttle control and 

it's going to respond to that pivot.

 So we specify where we're going to put the 

electronic throttle, on the support. That's what the 

Federal Circuit recognized was our invention. Now --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it basically an 

invention where in fact there are only four or five 

moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one 

of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the 

accelerator going up and down, as it must be because 

they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle 

thing coming out. And so, whichever of those four that

you figured out you were going to attach it to, it's 

obvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to 

the pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to 

a part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the 

movements of one of those two? Now, that's what I would 

find fairly obvious. Why isn't that obvious?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me, Justice 

Breyer. The experts say it's not obvious and the reason 

nobody did it for 12 years and the reason that Asano was 

never combined with an electronic throttle control is 

explained in the record in this case and it's twofold. 

The first is, and I have to take you now to the picture 

of Asano because that's what the claim that is supposed 

to make our invention obvious is. They say you would 

have done this with Asano. What the experts say is this 

Asano thing, no one would ever use it at all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who do you get to be 

an expert to tell you something's not obvious.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You get --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the least 

insightful person you can find?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we got a 

Ph.D. and somebody who had worked in pedal design for 25 

years.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And people who actually know 

this industry. And they, there are two things that come 

from the record in this case. The first is all of the 

experts and Engelgau himself testified not simply, no, 

this is not obvious, but you would have never used Asano 

to solve this or any other problem with an electronic 

throttle control.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You keep coming 

back to Asano. Why do you keep coming back? Your claim 

here does not say anything about Asano.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the way 

these cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other 

side says this would be obvious in light of a particular 

piece or collection of prior art. You may have a 

nonprior art motivation to combine them, but you're 

going to say something else already exists. They say 

it's Asano, and you're going to combine it with 

something else. This is their motion. Their argument, 

the argument that was presented to the Federal Circuit, 

was that you would take Asano. That's why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think they happened to 

use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on. 

But I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody 

would have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it

on Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical 

accelerator mechanism.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that is not -- we did 

not stick it on Asano. Nobody stuck it on Asano. They 

picked Asano because it was the prior art of adjustable 

pedal designs.

 Justice Scalia, you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to 

our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, 

on prior art, as opposed.

 To I would say common sense. And so they 

say we have to find something in prior art to show that 

this was non -- that this was obvious.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

not correct. Even under a capability standard, even 

under an extraordinary innovation standard, you are 

going to compare something to prior art. You're going 

to take what exists now and compare it to what existed 

before, no matter what standard you're employing. And 

what they did is they compared it to the prior art, 

which is Asano, and the Federal Circuit said, all right, 

you want to say it will come from Asano. It would not 

come from Asano for either of two reasons.

 The first is you would never use Asano.

That's the expert testimony. The second is the reason 

given by the PTO in its brief in this case and that is 

you wouldn't put it on the pin that would render 

Engelgau obvious. You would put it somewhere else. 

They say that you would put it attached to a lever up 

high. What I want to make clear is two things. The 

first is, though the Federal Circuit has in recent 

opinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its 

test is, it has consistently cited earlier Federal 

Circuit precedent and said that the other side and the 

people who claimed that their standard is too narrow and 

misguided are mischaracterizing it. And the second is, 

the judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges 

and implies the implicit teaching, suggestion, 

motivation standard.

 So I don't want you to have the mistaken 

impression that there has been some radical change in 

Federal Circuit law. But no matter what one thinks 

about the differential between Federal Circuit law today 

and Federal Circuit law a year ago or two years ago, 

there is a quite considerable cost by articulating a 

desire to head off in a new direction, because there 

will be dramatic instability in the patent system, the 

incalculable investments that underlie current patents. 

There is nothing fundamentally not functional about how

the Federal Circuit is approaching this question. It 

has had decades to look at this to try and elaborate a 

standard. This court in cases like Sakraida and --

JUSTICE BREYER: And it so quickly modified 

itself.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And in the last year or so, 

after we granted cert in this case after these decades 

of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it 

up.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if you 

actually believe that, then you just don't believe the 

judges in the Federal Circuit because in each of these 

opinions they say quite explicitly we are not changing 

it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you dispute that in 

some of the earlier cases, like Dembiczak with the 

garbage bag that looks like a pumpkin, that this TSM 

test was applied in a way that seemed to ask for 

something quite explicit in the prior art?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do think that you can find 

outliers. I think that's fair. These judges as I said 

have heard 300 of these cases. There are mistakes in 

the Patent Office; there are mistakes by judges. The 

Federal Circuit explains in Dembiczak what it was 

actually looking for is an explanation. It wasn't

saying that you had to use the prior art, and it has 

tried to make quite clear that the law is not that you 

have to have prior art. Or that those decisions here 

today.

 You can't take, in a system that produces so 

many patents, and say ah, look at this side swing 

patent, or the garbage bags, and draw from that the 

conclusion that the system is fundamentally broken.

 Justice Breyer, I meant to come back to 

that. We can look through the studies, we cite a series 

of empirical studies in our brief that have looked at 

this problem, the rhetorical claim that the obviousness 

rule is leading to gross over-patenting.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Tell me again, just to be 

sure I have it my -- tell me very briefly, what it is 

that makes this invention nonobvious?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two things. The first is --

and they do arise from the other side's motion under 

Asano. First you wouldn't have chosen Asano. The 

second is the Federal Circuit explained -- excuse me, 

the Solicitor General explains that you would have put 

the electronic throttle control somewhere else, 

technically on what's called pivot 60, which would not, 

would have rendered, would have not have rendered 

Engelgau obvious.

JUSTICE STEVENS: The invention, to use an 

old-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the 

control.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the extent of the 

entire invention.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And just -- what 

makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving 

piece?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: An adjustable pedal that has 

a nonmoving pivot, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the claim doesn't 

require that.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes it does. It does. I 

promise.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to follow 

up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this 

nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic 

control on a part of the car that doesn't move?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: On the support --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And then a particular kind 

of adjustable pedal. That's the state of the record so 

far.

axis turn?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Does the pivot turn?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't there an axis, and 

the axis turns?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The pivot rotates?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The pivot rotates, but it 

doesn't -- the difference is that the pivot doesn't move 

with the adjustment of the pedal. It spins around, of 

course, you have to have something that you can -- but 

the prior art, almost all that involved a pivot that 

when the pedal moved out, the electronic throttle 

control would go with it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the wires would 

get worn, worn down, right? And the invention here is 

well, let's not put it somewhere where it doesn't move, 

and so the wires won't move and it won't get worn down.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be a motivation. 

That's absolutely right, why you would want to improve 

on the part. The Federal Circuit said that you would 

never do it in the way that was described here. You may 

be able to prove it some other way on a remand. This 

was a very specific motion, and the Federal Circuit 

faithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was 

presented to it.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES W. DABNEY

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. DABNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 As someone who tries patent cases, there is 

no legal regime that is a greater generator of patent 

litigation than the teaching suggestion motivation test 

that is urged by the respondent. Where in this 

unbelievable situation where, in the District Court, 

this Court's precedents were cited, were not followed. 

In the Court of Appeals, this Court's precedents in 

Anderson's-Black Rock and others were cited, not 

distinguished, followed at all.

 If the law of this Court had been applied in 

the District Court I wouldn't be standing here right 

now. The reason that we have this, this proceeding 

going on is because of this extraordinary situation, 

where notwithstanding that this Court has issued 

precedents in a variety of circumstances dealing with 

multiple technologies, lots of different kinds of 

differences, lots of different kinds of alleged 

innovation, they are simply not paid attention to in the 

corpus of the Federal Circuit's case law up until about

 So the, this Court could do no greater 

service to the actual process of determining whether 

claimed subject matter does and does not comply with the 

statute than to decide with case. The worst possible 

thing that can happen in this case is for the case not 

to end here, and for the Court not to provide a 

precedent as it has done in so many particular past 

cases, and give the public an example of a particular 

claim and a particular difference that does not meet the 

standard.

 What's made clear throughout the history of 

patent decisionmaking is that no verbal formula is ever 

going to get you there. What we have as a functional 

approach; it's not as opposing counsel suggests -- is 

"it" apparent, is "it" obvious, would it have been 

obvious to do "it?"

 What this Court has held over and over again 

starting with the doorknob case in 1851 is to pose a 

problem. Would it have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about in this case 

where the wires were getting frayed until this 

disclosure?

 MR. DABNEY: That's not, if you read the 

affidavits carefully that is not an accurate

characterization of -- of any evidence put in by the 

petitioner. That was an argument --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So suppose I read the 

record the other way. Suppose I read the record as 

saying this invention stopped the wires from being 

frayed and therefore it was an advance.

 MR. DABNEY: That would be, to the extent 

that that -- if that is established that could be taken 

into consideration along with other facts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would that be? I mean, 

I've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the 

machine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a 

problem. So I move it to the top of the garage door. 

Does that suddenly -- nobody before thought of moving it 

to the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought 

of moving it to a different part that moves in a 

constant ratio with the accelerator.

 MR. DABNEY: What the statute calls for, 

Justice Kennedy, is not to focus on a particular 

subjective problem like fitting into a Ford F 350, or 

particular difference between a prior art pedal that 

provides wire chafing and a claimed invention. The law 

has always required that the patentability be determined 

by the smallest amount of difference. So if it were 

true that there was wire chafing, that that was a

problem that would have had to have been overcome, if 

you started with a prior art pedal that, that provided 

for wires to move -- well then, maybe that combination 

would not make the claimed subject matter obvious.

 But that would not foreclose the defendant 

from saying well, this other technology over here that 

doesn't suffer from that problem, it's a simple matter 

to modify that, so the premise of the question, that 

because there is some other potential combination that 

might have been, might have been more difference or less 

reason to modify it than the one that's relied on by the 

petitioner, is legally not material to the decision in 

this case.

 So I respectfully submit that the -- I 

really have to emphasize this. I mean, this is a 

litigation between, you know, two real businesses. The 

justified expectations, Justice Souter that I think this 

Court has recognized over and over again, are the 

expectations of real innovators, who make real products 

and have real inventions. And -- and I think it would 

come as a great surprise to the owner of the Asano 

patent to find as Justice Breyer suggested, that in 

order to supply it to a modern vehicle maker it would 

have to pay tribute to the Engelgau patent.

 Thank you.
