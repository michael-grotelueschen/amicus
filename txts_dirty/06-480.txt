 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-480, Leegin Creative 

Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated. Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The per se illegality rule for resale price 

maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated, 

misguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced 

with the same rule of reason standard that applies to 

other forms of vertically imposed marketing 

restrictions.

 The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable 

restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies 

a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a 

restraint is unreasonable.

 Per se rules should be rare and imposed only 

where the court is virtually certain based upon 

considerable economic experience that a practice is 

nearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum 

retail -- resale price maintenance are plainly not 

invariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus

of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that 

vertical restraints promote interbrand competition, 

which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely, 

if ever, anticompetitive.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an argument 

made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to 

distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, 

that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made 

with the dealers was more successful in getting a 

horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers 

had attempted it themselves, in which case some might 

have held back.

 MR. OLSON: Well, the economists who have 

looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said 

that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It 

certainly could not be the case in this industry in 

connection with this participant in the marketplace. 

There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton 

products are sold through. There are thousands and 

thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of 

products.

 What the Court has said repeatedly is that 

programs such as this may promote interbrand 

competition, perhaps --

the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among 

themselves on the price. Would that be lawful?

 MR. OLSON: No. I think that that would be 

covered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say that it's 

per se unlawful?

 MR. OLSON: I think it would be, as 

horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could 

be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was 

-- if it was -- involved the manufacturer in some way, 

it could be dealt with by the rule of reason.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why should that be any 

different from the arrangement where those dealers all 

got together in the convention and recommended to the 

manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of 

precisely the same dimensions? Why --

MR. OLSON: What this Court said in 

Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan, 

is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive 

to increase --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm asking what if 

he did, why should you draw a distinction?

 MR. OLSON: Because the motivation for the 

arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer -- you're 

suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in

a particular area would get together to impose this on a 

manufacturer. I think it's very unrealistic that that 

would happen.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. They just passed a 

resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this 

vertical restraint and ways to do it. Should that be 

different from one in which the manufacturer does it 

independently?

 MR. OLSON: I think that if the manufacturer 

makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would 

like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in 

Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of 

course relationships between the dealers and the 

manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in 

doing this, because they may find for the same reason 

that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of 

products. The record is clear in this case that this 

was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the 

Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the 

Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly 

competitive marketplace, and it was successful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe, Mr. Olson, 

you could give us an example where the rule of reason 

would find a violation in this situation?

 MR. OLSON: Well, it might be a situation,

the economists have written about this, say that it 

would be very rare, and would require retailers with a 

strong powerful market power to impose a situation where 

the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a 

horizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in 

this case, and that would probably be found to violate 

the rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be 

unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this 

Court. That was not an issue in this case. The 

economists say that that would very seldom happen.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You say very. Which 

economists? I know the Chicago school tends to want 

rule of reason and so forth. Professor Sherer is an 

economist, isn't he? Worked at the FTC for a long time. 

A good expert in the field. He points out the drug 

industry after you got rid of -- after you got rid of 

resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent. 

The drug stores it went down 20 percent. He says with 

blue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200 

million to get rid of it. And his conclusion is, as in 

the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the 

restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits. 

Massive.

 MR. OLSON: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: What that sounds like is

that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you 

get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more 

for the goods that they buy at retail. Now that's one 

economist, of course. There are other whose think 

differently. So how should we decide this?

 MR. OLSON: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Should we overturn 

Dr. Miles and run that risk?

 MR. OLSON: In, in the vast majority of the 

economist whose have looked at this have come out to the 

opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer. Secondly --

JUSTICE BREYER: We're supposed to count 

economists?

 MR. OLSON: No. No. I think that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that how we decide it?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. OLSON: But what this Court -- what this 

Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such 

as this where there's a consensus among leading 

respected economists, that is one factor. There's 

another factor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I haven't seen a 

consensus. A consensus? Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all 

these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?

 MR. OLSON: This is one factor that the

Court should consider and the Court has considered in 

the past when dealing with something that the Court 

itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically 

schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain 

vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with 

respect to other vertical restraints. The Court -- the 

Court itself has made those pronouncements.

 The enforcing agencies have changed their 

view with respect -- and they are here today, the 

Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all 

of whom have announced that they believe that it is very 

rare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as 

this to be anticompetitive.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not so long 

ago that the Department of Justice took a different 

view. And of all of the vertical restraints, this is 

the only one where Congress has been a player. I mean, 

Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. And 

then it withdrew that. There's no other restraint where 

they are has been congressional action, where the 

argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of 

this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if 

they so will.

 MR. OLSON: Essentially, the same argument 

was made in the Sylvania -- at the time of the Sylvania

case. The same argument was made just a term or two go 

in connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt 

with tying arrangements. The same argument was made in 

State Oil versus Khan. This Court has construed the 

antitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the 

courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the 

marketplace --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in those cases you 

didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and 

McGuire. That's what makes this -- this one different 

in terms of congressional intention.

 MR. OLSON: The repeal of those statutes, 

Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules. It 

was not a congressional expression against the rule of 

reason --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there was in the 

patent case, though, Mr. Olson. We relied on the fact 

that the patent law changed.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, you did.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. OLSON: And that was a, that was one 

factor, however, Justice Stevens. I think, as I read 

that opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact 

that the, the per se rule which -- and the Court said 

the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the

Weyerhaeuser case -- to the extent there's practices 

that can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a 

low threshold of illegality, especially low per se 

illegality threshold. There were -- there have been --

it is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly 

said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a 

substantial body of economic experience that shows us 

that this practice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

about the reliance interest, though? I mean, hasn't a 

whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance 

on the Dr. Miles rule? And don't we need to be 

concerned about the disruption to that established 

practice?

 MR. OLSON: There's really no evidence that 

the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the 

Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there evidence that 

the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the 

Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade? 

So -- that there's that correlation.

 MR. OLSON: Actually I looked into that, 

Justice Souter. And me, my limited historical research 

is that the -- those discounters were coming on strong 

before 1975 which is when the, the consumer price,

whatever it was, act was passed in response to that.

 There are -- the evidence basically shows 

that -- and this Court has said -- that it's interbrand 

competition that ultimately produces lower prices.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know. We 

have -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of 

the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called 

resale price maintenance where he has five economists --

now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. 

Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that 

isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief 

as single argument that isn't in the book.

 There's one interesting thing about the 

book. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question 

is what's changed? Now I know two things have changed.

 One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, 

and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that 

when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices 

went down. That's changed. And the second thing that's 

changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, 

today in the retail side of the market than there are 

used to be, a factor which makes resale price 

maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take 

place at the request of the dealers.

 Now, I see those two changes. My question

to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale 

Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even 

on Google, and -- what's changed? What's new?

 MR. OLSON: Well, a number of things have 

changed. The -- the number of respected individuals, 

notwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and 

have focused on the marketplace, have said that because 

it allows -- it increases the possibility of interbrand 

competition, it can provide incentives for dealers to 

provide service, differences in the products. And other 

things that have happened since then, are this Court's 

decision in the Sylvania case, which -- which involved 

an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found 

that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the 

ruling -- the reason for a per se rule.

 This Court's decision in State Oil versus 

Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well 

aware of where per se rules have systematically been 

dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the 

marketplace. This --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Olson, does brand 

competition generally help retailers, or is this a 

question that can't be answered?

 MR. OLSON: Did you say inter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Interbrand, interbrand

competition? Do retailers like interbrand competition?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I don't know that -- I 

don't know whether people like competition. But the 

antitrust laws like competition and this Court likes 

competition. And this Court has said that interbrand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but we're talking 

about inter -- we're talking about retailers. It, it 

seems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you 

acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that 

if the retailers themselves have this resale price 

maintenance, it is invalid. Well, if the manufacturer 

does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and 

that's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for 

the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers, 

then why shouldn't there be a per se rule? Why should 

we allow the manufacturer to do something we that 

wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the 

retailers?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the manufacturer is very 

unlikely to do this for the convenience of the 

retailers, to -- because it's in the interest of the 

manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible 

so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the 

manufacturers' products as possible.

that's what he's aiming at, low price. Is it the object 

of the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to 

produce low prices?

 MR. OLSON: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was consumer 

welfare.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, yes, it is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought some 

consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.

 MR. OLSON: Precisely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that it 

would increase prices doesn't prove anything. It 

doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. If, 

in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more 

service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance 

consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive 

products at a lower price, wouldn't it?

 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's absolutely 

correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why, why we 

should have to focus our entire attention on whether 

it's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not. 

The market out there has different goods at different 

prices which have different qualities that attract 

different consumers.

MR. OLSON: I -- I agree completely. I 

would like to reserve the balance of my time for 

rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has 

said over and over again. If you -- the purpose of the 

antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition, 

because competition between competing manufacturers give 

the consumers more choice. Some people may want the 

cheapest product. Some people may want the product 

that's more available to them. They may wish the return 

policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that 

the dealer provides. And in this marketplace 

particularly, that system of providing competition is 

consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced 

success in the marketplace.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, before you sit 

down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your 

argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in 

this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to 

discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to 

discount. And if that were true, as a matter of fact, 

then that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust 

law, wouldn't it?

 MR. OLSON: This -- but the case was never 

litigated on that basis. It wasn't considered on that 

basis in the Court of Appeals. It came up sort of as a

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR 

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 The same considerations that led this Court 

in Sylvania and State Oil to reject outmoded per se 

rules compel that same result here. The Dr. Miles rule 

conflicts with this Court's modern antitrust 

jurisprudence in three fatal --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I'll put my question, 

which is really just one for this. I understand 

perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing 

differ things. Of course, resale price maintenance does 

raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of 

course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that

might help consumers.

 Now, in addition, you need clear rules. Now 

those three sets of things require a balance. And we 

have a hundred years of history where this Court and 

Congress and others have balanced those three sets of 

considerations, and they've come out one way. Now, the 

Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come 

out the other way.

 There are good arguments on both sides. Why 

should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the 

absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that 

that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a 

difficult area of people reaching a slightly different 

weight on some these three sets of things?

 MR. HUNGAR: Several reasons, Your Honor. 

It's not -- it's not a close question whether this Court 

under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial 

matter would impose a per se rule in this context. 

There is economic -- there is consensus among the 

respected economists --

close question.

 MR. HUNGAR: Given that this Court's test, 

the question this Court's modern cases ask, in 

distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se 

rule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or 

almost always anticompetitive. That's what the Court 

has said.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Price fixing, horizontal, I 

guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn 

those too.

 MR. HUNGAR: Certainly not, Your Honor. 

Because that, that is almost always anticompetitive in 

our experience and in the experience of the courts. But 

the same is not true in the resale price maintenance 

context. Dr. Miles has foreclosed the courts from 

conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look 

into this question. But the empirical data that are 

available would suggest that anticompetitive 

explanations for resale price maintenance do not have 

very much explanatory power. When you actually look at 

the cases that have been litigated, they involve 

manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated 

markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases 

of any cartelization going on. So the anticompetitive 

explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do

not appear to explain most of the retail price 

maintenance that has been litigated. It's true that 

retail price maintenance can but does not always result 

in price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 

price is not the only thing that consumers care about. 

And there is widespread consensus in the economic 

literature and in this Court's recent cases that 

price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price 

based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce 

intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand 

competition.

 In Monsanto and Business Electronics, 

this Court made clear that price vertical restraints, 

like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in 

fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the 

non-price vertical restraints to which this Court now 

applies rule of reason analysis. So the reason in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't your argument 

also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in 

this product just to fix prices? Because there's plenty 

of interbrand competition, I think. I don't think you 

can say it's absolutely clear that that would always be 

anti-competitive because they would also agree to 

provide additional services.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because

horizontal -- the important thing to keep in mind is 

that the incentive of the manufacturer when the 

manufacturer --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about a case 

in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide 

extra services at higher prices as their method of 

better serving the public and they all agree that they 

have to be conscious about the competition from other 

brands. Why can we be absolutely certain that's always 

going to be harmful to the consumer?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the reason why we 

know that is always or almost always harmful is that the 

incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel, 

just like the incentives of the participants in a 

manufacturing cartel --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They might be precisely 

the statement as the manufacturers: We think we'll make 

more, all make more money if we concentrate on service 

rather than price.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because the 

manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits 

of the retailers, but the retailers when they get 

together obviously have a very different incentive, 

which is not to benefit the manufacturer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What you say is right.

What you say there is right. I feel I'm back in 1966. 

The argument against that is, we don't know which way 

the push comes. The large retailers, Home Depot, 

whatever they are, huge retailers, they want -- or maybe 

it isn't the discounters, it's some other once. We 

don't know which way. You're throwing it into court. 

You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not 

work this thing out. So the argument against what 

you're saying is not logic. It's empirical and 

administrative.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it was. That's 

what it is now, I guess.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in State Oil the 

same argument was made. The argument was made that, 

while we don't have compelling empirical evidence that 

Albrecht results in harm to the economy, we don't have 

compelling empirical evidence that resale price 

maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, is 

generally pro-competitive, and in the absence of such 

empirical evidence there's no basis for overturning 

precedent. This Court unanimously --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We do have empirical 

evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this 

case is going to be very significant in the sort of

battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and 

why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark 

at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to 

Congress, which is in a position to know more about 

where the shot is going to land than we are?

 MR. HUNGAR: This Court -- I'm sorry. 

There's no empirical evidence that I'm aware of about 

what impact eliminating Dr. Miles would have on the 

Wal-Marts of the world.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's my point. But it 

seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence 

that the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and 

the Home Depots was a success which was correlated with 

the elimination of price maintenance by the States.

 MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

In fact, as Mr. Olson pointed out, the K-Marts of the 

world began during the fair trade era.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They began, but they have 

flourished in the post-fair trade era.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, but I think 

considerations likes the opening up of international 

trade and the development of markets like China to 

supply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the 

success of the Wal-Marts of the world than a rule like 

Dr. Miles.

Remember, it's perfectly legal under current 

law for manufacturers to impose the same sort of 

constraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral 

enforcement rather than by agreement. So the suggestion 

that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy 

if Dr. Miles is overruled is simply unsupportable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's 

the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's 

perfectly legal to achieve the same result already?

 MR. HUNGAR: As the Ping amicus brief, the 

Ping Golf Club Manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's 

extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the 

Colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom 

resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy 

like Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many 

circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption 

that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without 

further discussion for discounting one item in order to 

keep your policy in place.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that answer 

your argument that there isn't reason to believe that 

there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes, 

because now it's going to be easy?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in 1945 during the 

height of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which

concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was 

affected by fair trade. And the fair trade regime, 

remember, is a different and more extreme regime. There 

it was per se legality, not rule of reason. So it's 

just -- there's just no basis for these assertions that 

somehow the economy is going to be massively changed. 

But it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there 

are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a 

manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. It will 

enhance its ability to compete and it will provide 

consumers more of what they want, and that is a good 

thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically 

foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of 

cases it is conceivable that there can be 

anticompetitive effects.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it fair to say that 

there is reason to believe that there may be a massive 

reorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes? 

And that gets to my problem, why should we be the people 

to make a guess as opposed to the Congress as the 

institution to make the guess?

 MR. HUNGAR: I'm not aware of any reason to 

believe that, Your Honor, based on the historical record 

and based on the modern realities. The Wal-Marts of the 

world have succeeded because of their discounting

strategy. That's not going to change, and manufacturers 

have an incentive to have their goods sold through those 

stores and that's not going to change either in the vast 

majority of cases. And With respect --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the rule of reason is 

the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, 

from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case 

would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never 

get to trial. How do you think the rule of reason would 

operate if it were the rubric under which this case were 

to be decided?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think it would 

operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would 

be required to establish an anticompetitive effect 

resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that 

burden is overcome the defendant would be required to 

come up with some legitimate business justification, 

some pro-competitive results that outweigh that. And 

only if they could do that would they succeed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's the formula, 

but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that 

the plaintiff could never get across the first 

threshold?

 MR. HUNGAR: We don't agree with that, Your 

Honor. In cases where resale price maintenance is being

used to facilitate cartelization, either at the 

manufacturer or the retail level, the plaintiff could 

prevail. Also in, for example, in an oligopolistic 

market.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in this case, this 

case has none of those features.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin loses under the 

rule of reason, right?

 MR. HUNGAR: We don't know that. It seems 

likely to assume that, though, and that's not a bad 

thing. Leegin is obviously not dominant in the market. 

It's obviously not going to succeed unless what it is 

offering at a higher price is what consumers want, and 

that is a good thing under the antitrust laws.

Discouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low 

prices is bad antitrust policy. RPM prohibits price --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, You 

really think that antitrust policy means when -- any 

arrangement that produce a higher price is bad?

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, we aren't talking 

about any arrangement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a lot of consumers 

want, you know, extended warranties. They want show 

rooms where they can go and look at things. All of 

which costs more money. And where you can not have 

resale price maintenance the customers -- or you have 

the free rider problem. The customers shop at the place 

that has the big show room, likes at all the product 

there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has 

not incurred that expense.

 Now, I just don't think that all the 

customers want is cheap. I think they want other things 

besides cheap. I think they want service. I think they 

want selection. I think they want the ability to view 

goods and so forth. Why do you discount all of those 

things?

 MR. COYKENDALL: I don't discount all those 

things. All those things are available under our 

current regime where we have a per se prohibition

against resale price maintenance.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they aren't 

available. This company thought that it could provide 

higher service if it could assure its retailers that 

they would not be undercut by people who are not 

providing that kind of service.

 MR. COYKENDALL: And there's no question 

that even the plaintiff in this case was providing that 

service. He was providing it more efficiently and he 

just wanted to pass those efficiencies on.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, I don't know that 

there's no question about that. There's certainly no 

question that this company was successful in breaking 

into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring 

its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the 

service.

 MR. COYKENDALL: The record shows that with 

this specific company, most of the growth of its sales 

occurred before it established a resale price 

maintenance policy. So there are no demonstrated 

benefits from this company of imposing and enforcing a 

resale price maintenance policy.

objection to -- I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of

promote the objectives you've just articulated?

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, as a practical matter 

for someone in my position, or plaintiff's position, 

it's impossible for a small dealer to muster the 

resources in order to put forth -- CHIEF JUSTICE 

ROBERTS: For a small dealer. But as we've already 

heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are 

prices like Target and Wal-Mart. Those aren't small 

dealers. Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.

 MR. COYKENDALL: I would suggest that those 

are not the people that really are being protected by 

this particular per se prohibition. It is the small mom 

and pop operation like my client that wants to innovate 

and expand and pass on efficiencies and compete with the 

big discounters who might have power of their own in 

order to secure discounts.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So you don't agree with the 

argument that we've heard this morning that the 

transformation of American retailing since the 1970s and 

the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has 

anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and 

that overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?

 MR. COYKENDALL: No, I absolutely agree with 

that. But it's resale price maintenance that enables 

these initiators, these small companies, these small

operations, to grow and innovate, achieve the 

efficiencies, and pass those on, attract customers by 

reducing prices. And all that is stopped by imposition 

of a resale price --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest 

that the large-scale low-price retailers who were 

supposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are -- support its 

retention? Have they filed amicus briefs here or 

otherwise suggested that this is essential to their 

continuing operation?

 MR. COYKENDALL: Again, the large-scale 

dominant players in the retail industry have their own 

market power. They don't need the protection of the 

per se rule in order to enforce them. It's the next 

generation that this rule really aims to protect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I 

mean, if it was really the case that they were going to 

be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been 

here. I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the 

Targets. They're not here on amicus briefs because 

they're -- what they're selling is cheap. They are 

selling price, and people who want low price and for 

whom that's of value above all other things are going to 

continue to go to those stores. So they're not going to 

be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to

provide not just the low price -- of course, they'll try 

to keep the price as low as possible -- but service.

 I just don't see what, what harm can 

possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, 

from allowing some people to make their money on service 

and -- rather than cheap price.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, again I would suggest 

that under this current system the way it is we have 

both the full service providers of complete service that 

offer goods at a certain price and we have discounters 

selling those same goods. There is currently a mix of 

service and price that better serves the economy than 

just having one cookie cutter -- a one size fits all 

approach that you would have with resale price 

maintenance.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought the per se 

rule was the cookie cutter approach.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, in terms of 

prohibiting price or in terms of, yes, prohibiting price 

fixing, that's true. But it permits stores to have full 

price and full service and charge high prices for that 

service, and it permits discounters to reduce price, 

reduce service and cater to those customers who want the 

goods with lower service.

you would have said four years ago, or I think we are in 

this argument, you would have said that it's the large 

discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of 

the world who want to get rid of retail price 

maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. Okay. 

They're in now, they're big, and they may want to 

maintain resale prices because they may want to extract 

the other profit, while the Internet little company 

comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper.

 Now I can imagine circumstances like you 

say. I can imagine they're not like you say. I don't 

know. And so what should I do if I really don't know?

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, there is no doubt 

that resale price maintenance raises prices to 

consumers. The only economic doubt is whether there are 

any redeeming effects of those prices; and that's where 

the economic dispute of this is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought the 

Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that 

it made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the 

current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices 

because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of 

those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where 

something other than price is important, and they have 

to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.

MR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, I would 

suggest that, first of all, eliminating the per se rule 

would not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate 

doctrine. If they want to impose resale price 

maintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned 

approach, they would have to go --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even with the tremendous 

anomaly that the employer -- that the -- the 

manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do 

it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that 

won't go along? Those two are substitute of each other. 

Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but 

we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have 

to do it on your own, and then you have to do the 

draconian thing of terminating the dealer.

 MR. COYKENDALL: I believe that anomaly 

really lies at the heart of the Sherman Antitrust Act 

which is aimed at contracts, combinations and 

conspiracies. Unilateral conduct isn't reached by that, 

it's the price of being in a fair country. People can 

deal in ways that they want to with this particular 

issue.

 But again, eliminating the per se rule will 

not help Ping out if they want to maintain their retail 

price maintenance as legal, as unilateral. They'll

still have to go through these same machinations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why 

can't -- eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point 

was they would just put in their contracts, you have to 

sell it at this price, and they could enforce the 

contracts, rather than having to have these machinations 

of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an 

agreement with their retailers.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, again, then they 

would be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the 

uncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this 

contract is lawful. If they want to avoid that, then of 

course, they would have to stick with the Colgate 

doctrine.

 Your Honor, this particular case, we have 

clear evidence that RPM was used to facilitate a 

horizontal retailer cartel. We have evidence in the 

briefs that Leegin would gather its dealers in a dealer 

meeting, discuss the policy, agree to changes, and reach 

a consensus, and then enforce that policy against 

everyone.

 One of the evils of resale price maintenance 

is specifically this: It does facilitate the formation 

of cartels.

economically it makes any difference whether the dealers 

are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was,

even among a single brand, has always been a per se 

violation of the antitrust law. You can look back at 

the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if we say the rule 

or reason should apply to all cases that just affect 

intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep 

this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that 

only affect intrabrand competition.

 MR. COYKENDALL: There you're striking 

really at the heart of the -- the heart of the Sherman 

Act, et al., holding that horizontal conspiracies, which 

nobody believes promote competition, could be justified 

under the same thinking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's a totally -- I 

cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers 

could ever produce consumer welfare. It will be a

horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the 

consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to 

impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to 

give the retailer as much -- more money than the 

retailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their 

margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell 

as many of his products as possible consistent with his 

desire to sell his product by attaching to it more 

service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever.

 You know, horizontal conspiracy, the 

incentives are entirely different. When you're dealing 

with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is 

still to keep the price as low as possible consistent 

with the additional good that he wants to give consumers 

to attract those consumers to his product.

 MR. COYKENDALL: In this particular case 

there is a complete alignment of incentives, because the 

manufacturer was also a retailer competing in this 

market. He has the incentive to increase retailer 

profits.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that's the case 

and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would 

allow you to make that argument. But you -- but you 

want to say it's bad across the board for everybody. If 

indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the

rule of reason would allow you to argue that.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, we would 

suggest that the horizontal conspiracy between Leegin as 

a retailer and the other retailers offering his products 

is more than just a rule of reason approach. That would 

be per se illegal under this Court's precedents.

 Retail price maintenance also has the 

problem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent 

forms of distribution at the expense of the innovative 

and more efficient distribution means. Retailers, in 

retail competition matters, retailers should be entitled 

to innovate, pass efficiencies along to customers in the 

form of lower prices, attract new customers, and grow in 

that manner.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Coykendall, the -- on 

the question -- you alleged in the complaint that there 

was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce 

it, Leegin?

 MR. COYKENDALL: Leegin.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin. And Mr. Olson 

says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?

 MR. COYKENDALL: That particular aspect was 

referred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of 

this. Prior to trial, the judge did rule that the 

Dr. Miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be

judged under the per se rule. So certain aspects with 

respect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences 

in discounts -- I mean, developed that much.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose you were to lose, 

you would still have that claim, I take it?

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, yes. We would 

suggest the record is sufficient that on remand the 

instruction given the jury as to the standard by which 

their conduct could be judged could be sustained as a 

per se violation under the rules related to horizontal 

conspiracies as well. And again, I would suggest that 

perhaps if the Court doesn't reach that, it should 

remand to the Fifth Circuit for them to consider whether 

that is a possibility.

 Resale price maintenance can distort 

consumer choice. The retailers -- so the person comes 

into the store -- the retailers can exercise pressure to 

influence the selection of higher margin products over 

ones that may better fit the consumer needs. That is an 

evil of resale price maintenance, whether or not it does 

promote efficiencies.

 And if resale price maintenance does act as 

it is theorized, to increase retailer services, some 

consumers will be worse off, they'll be paying for 

services they don't want.

There are alternatives to RPM.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't suppose there's any 

-- I don't suppose there's any way to protect against 

the fallout to the consumer, is there? I mean if 

indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a 

product that's more expensive than what he needs or --

and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, 

that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned? 

I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the 

situation.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, if -- what you're 

doing is you're building in this high margin that gives 

the retailer an incentive to do that. If there is no 

resale price maintenance so that margin isn't 

guaranteed, the incentive disappears. What is clear is 

that retail -- resale price maintenance is a blunt 

instrument to achieve any economies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're assuming that the --

that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale 

price good. Why do you assume that?

 MR. COYKENDALL: That's the only incentive, 

the only reason for imposing resale prices

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's only going to be given 

the thing if he does the kind of additional service that 

the manufacturer wants. That's the whole purpose of it.

And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin 

just as low as he can consistent with the -- you know --

consistent with selling as many products as he can.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, there are more 

efficient ways than RPM to achieve any benefits of 

efficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to 

provide those additional demand creating services. He 

could pay the retailers to provide those services. He 

could provide those services directly, I would suggest.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would you argue 

that those are more efficient than resale price 

maintenance?

 MR. COYKENDALL: The resale price 

maintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money 

at the problem. You're guaranteeing a margin and you're 

hoping that it's going to be used somehow for the 

consumer's benefit, and you've got no guarantee that any 

dealer is going to use the margin that they're 

guaranteed in any way to service the consumers.

 And I would suggest that in geographically 

isolated areas --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can add 

the contractual provisions you were talking about to a 

contract that has a minimum resale price. The minimum 

resale price is to take away the incentive from the

retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.

 MR. COYKENDALL: If you have a contract 

requiring those services, you don't need the minimum 

resale price. That's just completely unnecessary. And 

that would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on 

those efficiencies to its consumers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that presume a 

contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for 

the service?

 MR. COYKENDALL: It could be. It may not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If not, I don't see how 

that would work under your rule.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Well, under -- the idea is 

the manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers 

that offer this particular service. They sign a 

contract to provide that service. If they don't want to 

provide that service, they don't sign the contract, 

these don't get the goods. It's as simple as that.

 If the question is providing a larger margin 

to the dealer, the most efficient way is for the 

manufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price, and 

the margin the dealer receives is higher.

 Again, if there are other efficiencies, they 

might be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted 

by Sylvania or by the Colgate doctrine.

years following the elimination of the fair trade laws 

have shown the wisdom of the Dr. Miles decision which 

places faith in the free market system. This Court 

should continue to honor its precedents and respect the 

will of Congress by adhering to the Dr. Miles rule.

the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation 

that supports the result you seek.

 MR. COYKENDALL: Your Honor, as this Court 

observed in Sylvania, Congress by repealing the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 When a manufacturer agrees with its 

retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point 

of the agreement is to prevent price competition among 

retailers, to prevent discounts. For almost 100 years

the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act 

to prohibit such price fixing agreements. Any change in 

that fundamental understanding of the statute should be 

made by Congress and not by this Court.

 The per se rule against resale price 

maintenance is different in at least three ways from 

other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned. 

First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled 

law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by 

this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also been 

settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that 

manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more 

inefficiently. Doesn't it make sense to allow them to 

adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already 

completely legal?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No. That tension that you 

-- that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a 

result of the fact that the antitrust rule -- law does 

not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. It prohibits 

agreements that are anti -- that restrain competition.

 And so it will often be the case that it is 

possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that 

has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately 

the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that

line because of a different value, a value in preserving 

the independent action of individuals.

 It is, however --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's often the 

case. Give me some other examples where you can achieve 

the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, as you have observed, 

virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished 

by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing 

function and become one entity instead of two entities. 

Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is 

eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates 

the whole function, is -- can fix prices, fix his, what 

are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of 

the antitrust laws. There are other reasons why a 

manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that 

integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to 

be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid 

the prohibitions of the antitrust law.

 It is also -- so, this is old and well 

settled. Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial 

restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it 

was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum 

resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years 

after it was established, this has a much more settled

pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up 

around it.

 Second, it was endorsed and relied on by 

Congress, not enacted by Congress but endorsed and 

relied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair 

trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this 

Court is now asked to interpret.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Were they relying on 

Dr. Miles or were they relying on us? That's the 

question.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: They were relying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They left the situation 

where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as 

determined by this Court, and we had shown our 

willingness to update the antitrust law when sound 

economic doctrine suggests is necessary.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No. The legislative history 

described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's 

brief shows that actually they were returning the law to 

the per se rule against resale price maintenance because 

they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should 

be prohibited.

 This is -- it is also true that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But of course, they 

could always pass a law saying that if their intent is

so clear. They didn't do that here.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That's true, they did not do 

that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only 

that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has 

established in the antitrust area, this rule has 

received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the 

Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn 

the rule should be at its peek as compared with those 

other rules.

 And third, price is different. This Court 

has said that price competition is the central nervous 

system of the economy. Other restraints, to be sure, 

might indirectly affect price, but not with the same 

absolute force. Territorial restraints don't absolutely 

prevent price competition because customers can travel 

or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under 

territorial restraints there are often multiple 

retailers in a particular territory who can compete. 

Maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at 

all unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really 

Minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which 

case the Court in Khan said it's illegal.

 Manufacturers can of course pay retailers 

for the services that enhance the product that are being 

advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price

maintenance. But the question for this Court is whether 

the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing 

agreement to make that payment to buy those services, 

and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide 

in a rule of reason trial. That's a question of 

statutory interpretation for this Court. It's a 

question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer 

can use to buy those retailer services.

 It's also true that the claim that 

price-fixing works to induce those services is both 

debatable and untested. The retailers have no 

obligations to provide services under the retail price 

maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other 

cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they could. I 

mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you 

have to charge this much and because you have to charge 

this much you also have to provide the training, the 

service, whatever the non-price inducements are.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: You could. You could also 

require those things without resale price maintenance 

and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise 

the price to pay for that or to provide it so 

efficiently that he could in effect engage --

retailer, but then the retailer might have a real 

incentive not to do a good job on the service because 

they really want to market it for price, not for 

service.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That really depends, doesn't 

it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if 

it's correct, if the manufacturer -- if the claim on 

behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the 

customers want is service, the retailers are in at least 

as good a position to identify that fact as not.

 I think the point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there you 

have the free rider problem, which is you go to the 

fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then 

you buy it at the discount store.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. That's at its peak, 

perhaps, when you're talking about electronics. When 

the shopping experience alone is what is thought to be 

the benefit, which is often the case, you can't free 

ride on that. You either shop in the place where you 

like to shop or you shop -- or you have a different 

shopping experience in Target.

their product associated with excellent service, high 

warranty, and all of that. And there is no way to get

that uniformly for that product without this kind 

of agreement.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there is. The 

manufacturer can contract for it. The manufacturer can 

decline to deal with people who don't provide it. The 

very same point that was being made earlier.

 I think that the point here is that 

permitting resale price maintenance would be such a 

drastic change in the longstanding settled 

interpretation of the Sherman Act that it doesn't really 

qualify as the kind of common law evolution that this 

Court has said is appropriate ordinarily in making 

antitrust rules under the Sherman Act. If that change 

is to be made at all, it should be made by Congress and 

not by this Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct on the 

congressional point that there was a period when 

Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General 

from making the argument he made today?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there was such a 

period. And this Court noted that fact in --

expression of a position on this particular issue?

this statute that this Court is being asked to 

interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning 

of this statute as it stands.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As Mr. Olson pointed out, 

under the fair trade laws this was per se legal. So 

that's kind of a different thing.

repealed that, there were considerable -- there was 

considerable expression of legislative history, for 

those who find legislative history helpful, that 

declared opposition to resale price maintenance, not 

simply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes 

hurtful. So to the extent Congress's intent can be 

gleaned from that legislative history, it was an intent 

to return to the regime of per se illegality.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe on the year by 

year, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided 

that wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has 

used that after, hasn't it, in other cases?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: It has, but I would question 

the wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing 

Congress's views. The fact that Congress went so far as 

to use it once suggests a very strong view indeed.

interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand 

competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand 

competition on matters of service and availability and 

other things in addition to price. The Respondent and

pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a 

contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then 

have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a 

Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a

we want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws --

in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or 

they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire 

all your retailers.

 The benefits of these type of arrangements 

provide the consumers with choices. It stimulates 

interbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand 

competition on things other than price. It provides 

consumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more 

freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its 

products, to enter the marketplace.

 These are things that the Court has said, 

and provides a more varied market price. The court has 

repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of 

reason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not 

adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is 

invariably anticompetitive. This practice, as 

acknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many 

opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical 

restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price 

area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of 

reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a 

rigid per se rule that cannot be changed.

Official - Subject to Final Review 

the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to 

continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the 

antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the 

benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules 

which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do 

something that's rational in the marketplace, to give 

consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that 

is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare 

makes no sense at all.

 For all those reasons, the rule of reason in 

this area, as in the other areas, should replace the 

per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the 

end of the day.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Olson.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., The case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
