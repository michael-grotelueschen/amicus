 (10:05 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-571, Watson v. United 

States.

 Mr. Koch.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL J. KOCH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KOCH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Mr. Watson's receipt of a firearm in 

exchange for drugs does not constitute the use of that 

firearm as the word "use" is employed by 18 U.S.C. 

Section 924(c)(1) for two principal reasons. First, 

applying the plain and ordinary meaning of the word 

"use," the receipt of a thing is not the use of that 

thing. There is no grammatically proper way to say that 

someone uses a firearm when all that person does is 

receive it.

 Second, treating receipt as use under the 

statute conflicts with this Court's decision in Bailey 

v. United States, which held that use requires active 

employment. And I'll address those two points in turn.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you address first 

whether receipt of the gun constitutes possession of the

gun?

 MR. KOCH: Yes, ma'am. I believe receipt 

does constitute possession. However, of course, 

possession standing alone under this Court's decision in 

Bailey does not constitute use.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But under the statute as 

amended, possession is also indictable.

 MR. KOCH: Possession in furtherance of the 

offense is -- is -- would be indictable. That -- that 

was not charged in this particular case. And I would 

suggest that the -- that the circumstances of this case 

might not call that into -- into play simply because his 

possession really was -- was incidental, and it was 

following the conclusion of the drug transaction.

 So I think -- I question whether the 

possession in furtherance would necessarily apply here. 

Of course, it was not charged.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure. 

I have the same question as Justice Ginsburg. It seems 

to me, absent some precedents which narrows this 

definition, that that would have been the way to charge 

your client. That's not what was charged; that's not 

the indictment; that's not what you're arguing. So I 

guess the question is more appropriate for the 

government.

But, if, following Justice Ginsburg's 

question, this covers it, and it seems to me that it 

does, then we're not arguing about very much.

 MR. KOCH: I understand, Your Honor. My 

only point, again, would be, that recognizing that "in 

furtherance," at least by the authors of that language, 

would suggest it to mean something more than "in 

relation to,." I think the question could legitimately 

be asked in a -- in a transaction like this, where the 

possession basically is what he was attempting to 

achieve and did, in fact, achieve, but after the -- at 

the end transaction.

 I don't -- I can't answer whether or not, 

ultimately, that would be -- deemed to be in furtherance 

or not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Koch, let's say 

that the parties to the transaction are concerned about 

avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute, 

and so they got together and said: All right, we are 

going to have this deal. What can we use besides money? 

And they say: Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun. 

And the seller of the drugs says: Okay. I'm willing to 

use that.

 Isn't he using the gun in furtherance of the 

transaction?

MR. KOCH: I don't believe that the -- that, 

given what the -- what this Court has said in Bailey, 

that that would constitute active employment still. The 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's being actively 

employed as the consideration in the sale.

 MR. KOCH: However, the -- from the 

standpoint --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not being shot, 

but it's still being employed.

 MR. KOCH: Yes, sir. From the standpoint of 

the -- of the seller -- from the standpoint of the drug 

seller, who's ultimately still doing nothing more with 

respect to the gun, I think the focus has to be on what 

are his activities? He hasn't even come into possession 

of it in the example that Your Honor has given.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think it would 

be a natural, grammatical construction to say he's 

willing to use the gun for the consideration.

 MR. KOCH: Your Honor, I'm not certain that 

we would -- that we -- that it could be held in the 

absence even there of even possession -- whether or not 

that would be enough to constitute the use. That would 

be the first question that would occur to me. The --

certainly grammatically, and dealing, of course, with

the facts of this case, grammatically the question on 

the table is: When interpreting 18 U.S.C. Section 

924(c)(1) giving it, as this Court held in Smith, its 

plain and ordinary meaning, the example that was used by 

the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Stewart, I thought, 

was appropriate, where -- the coffee shop example, where 

you have the -- the individual buying the coffee, and 

you have the cashier.

 The -- the customer doesn't -- the customer 

comes in and pays with the dollar. The cashier accepts 

the dollar, but the cafeteria isn't using the dollar by 

receiving it as payment. It's just receiving it. 

Likewise, the customer isn't using the coffee through 

the act of receiving it. He's getting it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we look at this 

transaction, a guns-for-drugs transaction, is there --

can you think of any good reason why Congress would want 

to prescribe a 5-year penalty for the person who hands 

over the gun, but not any penalty for the person who 

receives the gun and hands over the drugs?

 MR. KOCH: I do think that there are 

distinctions between the two conducts, sir. First of 

all, certainly the person that -- that has the gun and 

is bringing it into that transaction I would suggest, as 

a practical matter presents a different type of risk.

He's got the gun. He's in control of it. He's going to 

decide when and if to hand it over and in what condition 

it would be when he hands it over, or not to hand it 

over at all. So that the --

JUSTICE ALITO: And so that the -- the risk 

is Congress was worried that somebody would go to a 

transaction like this with a gun originally intending to 

trade it for drugs and then when one person gets there, 

a person decides to shoot somebody with the gun?

 MR. KOCK: I think --

JUSTICE ALITO: And that's why they would 

penalize one side of this transaction and not the other?

 MR. KOCH: Well, assuming of course it would 

-- in Smith the Court held that that is a use within the 

term of the statute. I think that the -- looking at --

this does not do violence to this Court's decision in 

Bailey. There still has to be some active employment. 

The person on the drug end of the transaction is --

really has nothing to do with the gun, doesn't even 

possess the gun, which -- before the other party decides 

to hand it over.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Smith, the Court said 

that the reason that selling the gun in exchange for 

drugs -- what was dangerous about that was the potential 

for instantly converting the gun from currency to a

cannon. But here isn't that even all the more of 

concern because one who receives the gun can instantly 

turn it around and shoot the drug seller?

 MR. KOCH: He could if the gun was handed 

over in a condition -- first of all, there -- were there 

bullets or not? That's going to be up to, at the first 

instance, whether he brings them or not, the gun seller. 

The gun seller can decide whether to hand it over --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's the same on both 

sides. It seems to me in both cases there is a risk of 

using the gun. The one who comes in with the gun can 

use it; the one who receives the gun can use it.

 MR. KOCH: I will -- I will grant Your Honor 

there's obviously risk presented by the presence of the 

gun potentially by either party. I would suggest that, 

as between the two parties, the fellow that shows up 

with the gun who's going to decide when and if to hand 

it over and in what condition, cocked, uncocked, loaded 

or unloaded, et cetera, is in somewhat more control.

 All that being said, one still gets back to 

the central point, which is, regardless of Congress's 

purpose or desires here, they still chose words that had 

fairly common meanings, in this case "use." And very --

it's grammatically impossible, I'd suggest, in the 

straightforward transaction and trade situation to

suggest that the guy that's receiving the gun is using 

it by receiving it, any more than the cashier is using 

the dollar that I pay for the cup of coffee with.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the person who hands over 

the gun is not a government agent or informant, is there 

any doubt that the person who hands over the drugs can 

be charged with using the -- the gun under 18 U.S.C. 

Section 2(b)? He causes -- the person who hands over 

the gun, to do something that is a crime.

 MR. KOCH: I do think that there -- that's 

an issue that's been raised. I -- I question whether, 

when the underlying offense itself is the transaction 

and these are the only two parties, whether or not 

aiding and abetting liability would be intended to 

extend that far, any more than it would be, for example, 

to a drug purchaser being charged with aiding and 

abetting the distribution of drugs.

 Certainly, given the severe penalties 

involved, I -- I'm a little uncomfortable with that 

being a usage of that statute or usage of the aiding and 

abetting statute. I also would point out that the 

overwhelming majority of these cases do involve police 

informants, practically all of them.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you're relying on the 

language of 924. If you look at the language of 2(b),

is there any doubt that this situation would fall 

squarely under it? "Whoever willfully causes an act to 

be done which if directly performed by him would be an 

offense against the United States is punishable as a 

principal."

 MR. KOCH: That is what that statute says, 

sir. There is some jurisprudence, and I'm -- it may be 

older in nature -- that deals with two parties to a 

transaction and whether or not aiding and abetting 

liability can be used, again going back to my drug 

purchaser situation. And I question whether or not the 

-- the aiding and abetting statute can be used. It 

would basically, in the drug context, read out the 

possession statute. Every drug buyer could be charged 

with distribution as a principal under Section 2. The 

-- again, of course that's not charged here, and I've 

not -- I've not seen cases where that has been charged.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Subsection (b) is 

not charged in the indictment?

 MR. KOCH: 18 U.S.C. Section 2 was what I 

understood the question to be, Judge. I apologize.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But that was 

not charged in the indictment?

 MR. KOCH: No, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Section 2(b)?

MR. KOCH: It was not.

 Now, the -- the government's brief concedes 

it would not be natural to say that the customer in my 

example with the coffee used the coffee. Unless we're 

prepared to discard that standard usage of words and 

sacrifice it for the purpose that we believe Congress 

intended, then I think that the analysis really does 

stop there if one's reading the language of the statute 

and applying it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Koch, but the 

government answers that, a dollar for coffee, by saying 

it depends what question you ask. So if you ask was the 

coffee part of a beverage transaction, the answer would 

be of course yes.

 MR. KOCH: One of the problems --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a gun 

transaction.

 MR. KOCH: Yes, ma'am. One of the problems 

I think that that raises that I see in different 

contexts with this is the different ways that the word 

"use" is used in an active or passive context. One 

might see two people to that transaction and ask, is a 

dollar being used in that transaction? And I think that 

we would all fairly say yes. But the focus in 924(c) is 

on that defendant: Did he use it? Just in the coffee

shop example, did the cashier use the dollar? Or in my 

example, did Mr. Watson use the firearm? And I think 

that that's -- that's the question that needs to be 

asked and when that question is asked in that format, 

then the answer I suggest is no.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't remember whether 

you ask in your brief as an alternative argument for the 

overruling of Smith.

 MR. KOCH: I did not raise that in the 

briefs, no, ma'am.

 With regards to Bailey, which I think 

answers to a great extent some of the questions 

presented here, Bailey of course held that 924(c)(1) 

requires evidence sufficient to show an active 

employment of the firearm by the defendant. Mr. Watson 

here did not actively employ the firearm. Bailey 

narrowed the category of uses that fell within the 

statute. To quote Bailey, it said "It's undeniable the 

active employment reading of use restricts the scope of 

924(c)(1)." That's the jewel of that case. Bailey held 

that use requires active employment, not only in general 

but by the defendant.

 More importantly perhaps to this case, 

Bailey held that possession alone is not use, and here 

Mr. Watson was trying to achieve possession, but -- and

ultimately when he did get possession, he had it 

instantaneously. So looking at it from a temporal 

standpoint, first he receives the gun. Before that 

point he doesn't have possession, so he doesn't even 

rise to the level of Bailey. After that point, all he 

did was possess it for an instant, still not enough, I'd 

suggest, to qualify as active employment or use under 

Bailey, the most recent definition that we have 

available.

 There's an argument presented by the 

government that feeds off of Smith's use of 924(d) which 

I wanted to mention briefly. The -- and that is the --

the importation of the definition of the term "use" from 

924(d), the forfeiture provision of the statute, into 

924(c).

 In Smith, the Court held that there were 

predicate offenses for 924(d) in which the only way that 

the weapon could be used was in a non-weapon use, which 

is what the Court was concerned about in the Smith case, 

and therefore the Court found, looking at those 

predicate offenses that had non-weapon uses only, that 

therefore the term "use" as it's employed in 924(d) must 

include non-weapon use. That logic, however -- and 

that's the argument made by the government -- that 

doesn't translate into the situation we have here. It's

addressed, by the way, on page 9 of our reply brief in 

some detail. I'll talk about it briefly.

 First of all, 924(d) is a forfeiture 

provision and the focus there necessarily is on the 

firearm, not on the defendant. The language in 924(d) 

is, quote, "any firearm or ammunition intended to be 

used in one of the predicate offenses." That's compared 

with 924(c), which states "any person who during and in 

relation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a 

firearm."

 So you have firearm intended to be used on 

the one hand, versus a person who uses a firearm. One 

might say perhaps that in this transaction a firearm was 

used, but not -- that's a different thing from saying 

that Mr. Watson used the firearm. It's a passive versus 

active formulation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be used by 

somebody, some human, and the human in this case is 

Mr. Watson.

 MR. KOCH: Well, ma'am, I think under Smith 

the human that's using the firearm in the transaction is 

actually the person that came with the firearm to use it 

to purchase drugs. And as -- as Smith said that that 

was definitely a use, it wasn't even really contested in 

Smith. And so I -- and I'm not contesting for this case

obviously that that person that showed up with the gun 

is using the gun to get drugs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. It wasn't 

contested in Smith?

 MR. KOCH: I beg your pardon, Judge. I 

meant that the Court, in its holding -- I recognize that 

it was contested. In its holding, the Court said that 

it tended to focus more on the question of whether or 

not a nonweapon use would -- would be required. But 

the -- certainly as between the two parties in this 

transaction, the guy that shows up with the gun trying 

to use it to get drugs is certainly making use of it in 

a way that, that recipient is not.

 The -- in, in Smith, the Court reached the 

opinion it did about the meaning of the term "use" only 

because there were, there were predicate offenses in 

which the only uses available were nonweapons uses. By 

contrast, here the predicate offenses that are suggested 

to import this definition of "use," there aren't any 

predicate offenses in which the only way to commit the 

offense is through receipt.

 I'll grant you that there are predicate 

offenses in which receipt is one of the ways in which 

the offense can be committed, but it's not the only way. 

And so that logical step can't be made, as it arguably

could have been in Smith.

 And finally, unlike the situation in Smith, 

here we know that the predicate offenses can't be 

interpreted --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Go back over 

that.

 MR. KOCH: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't it have been 

said in Smith that -- that trading it for drugs was not 

the only way in which the offense could have been 

committed? Couldn't the same thing have been said in 

Smith?

 MR. KOCH: In Smith the argument, as I took 

it from the opinion, Justice, was that the -- when one 

looked at, at the predicates, there were several which 

had, according to the opinion, only nonweapon uses. So 

if, if it's used or intended to be used in committing 

one of those offenses and one looks at those offenses 

and there's only nonweapon uses, then so the argument 

goes, that means nonweapon uses are part of use.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the issue in Smith was 

weapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're 

arguing here?

 MR. KOCH: That's correct, sir.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The issue here is use

versus nonuse, active employment versus passive receipt?

 MR. KOCH: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it -- why isn't 

your argument more directly that the issue here is -- is 

nonweapon use by A versus nonweapon use by B? You 

represent B and you say B wasn't the one who used it in 

a nonweapon sense?

 MR. KOCH: I agree that certainly Mr. Watson 

didn't use it in any weapons sense. So if there is a 

use at all, it would be in a nonweapon sense.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if you are right, 

that's the end of the case.

 MR. KOCH: I understand, Your Honor. I 

understand what you're saying. I believe you're right. 

That is another way. It's not -- it's not the direction 

that we went, but that makes sense.

 The -- what we focused on was use or not at 

the first instance. And Smith having decided that in 

that case use and defining it broadly to include a 

nonweapon use here, we're getting to the point where 

there's no use at all in the first place.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're not -- as you 

said before, you're not arguing for the overruling of 

Smith, and therefore, you concede that the other party 

to the transaction used the gun.

MR. KOCH: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In a nonweapon sense.

 MR. KOCH: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you are making his 

argument. I think you're -- you're too humble, the 

argument you're making.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's really not a bad one. 

I mean, you don't --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but what you're 

saying is that all Watson did was to receive the gun. 

But he agreed to accept the gun as payment.

 MR. KOCH: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that in 

that sense he used a gun. It wasn't his gun yet, but he 

agreed that if the gun would be brought to the scene of 

the transaction, that he would accept receipt of it.

 MR. KOCH: I would suggest, sir, that the 

agreement couldn't rise to the, to the level of active 

employment as that term is used in Bailey. In other 

words, at that point all he has done is make a statement 

that he'll accept something if it's offered. Whereas in 

Bailey --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: He says, you get a gun, 

you put it in your car, you come to my house, you bring

that gun with you, and I will give you drugs. I think 

in a sense he's using the gun. It's through the, the 

actions of another that he is doing it to be sure.

 MR. KOCH: We -- I would take the position 

that he certainly, in a situation like that where he is, 

he is not possessing the gun, he is expressing his 

intentions or desires with respect to it. But he is not 

in a position to do anything more than that. I don't 

think that that fits within the definition of "use." I 

don't think that if I say that, that I'd like to buy 

your house and if you'll sell it to me, that I'm using 

the house.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps. But it seems to 

me to unduly constrict the case to say that all he did 

was receive it. He did more than that. He agreed in 

advance.

 MR. KOCH: It is correct that when he --

that although he initially wanted to ask how much the 

gun was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He agreed to let the other 

party to the transaction use a gun to pay for the drugs, 

the other party to make the use of the gun.

 MR. KOCH: Factually what happened was that 

he wanted to buy a gun. And then the police officer, 

the undercover people said, well, instead of giving

money, we'll take drugs for it, which of course, brought 

us within the statute. That's the factual, particular 

factual circumstances here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you have besides 

the linguistic argument? I mean, when I start out, I 

can't think of a reason why Congress wouldn't want to 

penalize the buyer, not the seller. We are dealing with 

a statute that does catch your client, if they had only 

charged him with the right part. But no one in his 

right mind would ever rely on a ruling in your favor to 

actually engage in such a transaction, since it would 

violate the statute in 15 different ways. I exaggerate, 

but you see the point.

 So you have a linguistic argument which 

people are -- you're right, I think, in saying it's 

awkward but not impossible. And, therefore, awkward but 

not impossible; we create an anomaly in the law. I 

can't think of a reason why to do it. So what else do 

you have?

 MR. KOCH: Bailey. I have this Court's 

decision in Bailey, Your Honor, namely there that it 

can't just be a use. Even if we were to go ahead and 

hold our mouths and make that awkward formation and say 

what he did was a use, it's still not rising to the 

level as Bailey interpreted the term of active

employment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, you could 

say the same thing about Bailey, I suppose. You know, 

What was there in Bailey except -- what was the term, 

linguistic -- nothing but a linguistic decision.

 MR. KOCH: I guess ultimately --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Bailey doesn't make any 

more sense either from a policy standpoint.

 MR. KOCH: I do think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We sometimes we rely on 

linguistics, don't we?

 MR. KOCH: Yes, sir.

the statute.

 MR. KOCH: I do think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to put you in 

a whipsaw here.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Sometimes policy seems 

relevant, too, to figure out what Congress wanted.

 But let me go back to the question I had, 

which is do you want to us overturn Smith? Are you 

asking that, because I could understand it more easily 

if you said, look, both sides of the transaction should

be treated alike, but they should be both outside the 

word "use."

 MR. KOCH: I do not believe it's necessary 

for this Court to overrule Smith in order to rule for 

the Petitioner here, because of -- because of the 

differences, first of all linguistically; and secondly 

because of the reliance on Bailey.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in answer to my 

question, you said you were not urging the overruling of 

Smith?

 MR. KOCH: That's correct. That being said, 

I think that there is, there are arguments that can be 

presented, they were presented in Smith, as to whether 

one could take one position or the other. But it 

doesn't, it doesn't do violence to Smith to hold for the 

Petitioner here.

 Ultimately, when you look at the Bailey 

decision and at the facts of Bailey, and there you have 

people riding around with guns in the trunk of their 

car, and that's held not to be a use within the statute.

 Well, here Watson didn't even do that. He 

never had the guns in the first place going into the 

transaction. So it seems to me if Bailey --

JUSTICE BREYER: But he receives the gun and 

it could have been loaded. And if it was loaded, you

receive a loaded gun, and you're there and you give the 

money for the gun and you have the gun and somebody 

comes up, maybe you'll shoot him. I mean, that seems 

like a risk.

 MR. KOCH: Under Bailey, however, if all he 

did was receive the gun, hold it in his hand, Bailey 

says that's not enough, that's not a use. And, of 

course, those are the facts of this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose he received the 

gun, loaded it and said, well, now, let's renegotiate 

this transaction?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. KOCH: As Bailey -- as Bailey thought 

very clearly, if he then takes the gun and uses it to 

communicate a threat to the other party, then he is 

making a use. He is now actively employing it, in this 

case, as a threatening item.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he doesn't brandish 

it. He just, he puts it in his pocket and he says: 

Let's renegotiate this. What result? Could the 

government charge him?

 MR. KOCH: Your Honor, I believe if the jury 

was to find in that factual scenario that that was --

that he was, in fact, silently making reference to the 

gun, then I think that gets you within Bailey. There's

all kinds of things Mr. Watson could do beyond what the 

facts of this case are that would turn it, what he did, 

into active employment and use. But merely getting it 

and putting it -- and holding it, which are the facts in 

this record, doesn't -- doesn't rise to the level of use 

under Bailey.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought Bailey involved a 

guy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of 

his car, which is a little different from holding it in 

your hand.

 MR. KOCH: There were -- there were actually 

two, two different fact patterns in the consolidated. 

One had a gun that was locked up in another room, the 

other one had guns in the trunk, with expert testimony 

being that that was the typical method of drug dealers 

to protect their drugs and things.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he has a gun in his 

hand he is certainly carrying it.

 MR. KOCH: He did have the gun in his hand 

then he would be carrying it under Muscarello and the 

other cases. That's correct. Yes, ma'am.

 Recognizing again I just would point out 

that whatever condition Mr. Watson had the gun in and --

in this record that's unloaded -- was the choice, not of 

Mr. Watson but of the people that brought him the gun.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner used the firearm by accepting it 

in exchange for his drugs. In doing so Petitioner used 

it during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. 

Although the situation in Smith was different, the 

principle of Smith is that use of a firearm as an item 

of trade or commerce -- specifically used as the medium 

of exchange -- is a use falling within the meaning of 

Section 924(C).

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not answer 

the question use by whom. As I understand it, we are 

not really arguing about whether the gun was used in the 

transaction; we are arguing about whether the defendant 

was the one who used it.

MS. MAYNARD: And the Petitioner did use it 

here, Your Honor. In agreeing to take it in exchange 

for a certain amount of his drugs --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I mean, the 

problem you, it seems to me you've got that you can't 

totally paper over is that that's not usually the way we 

talk. I mean, if I buy a car, and pay money for it, I 

do not use the car in the transaction. It's what I have 

after the transaction is complete; and you, you got that 

kind of linguistic problem here, it seems to me.

 MS. MAYNARD: If you buy the car, then you 

have used the car as an item of trade or commerce during 

or in relation to that commercial transaction. We don't 

usually talk that way but we do -- and one can --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's enough to say we don't 

usually talk that way.

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

As long as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the end of it. We 

don't talk that way. We don't say use a car when you 

buy a car.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well here, Your Honor, it's 

important to put it into statutory context, of course, 

and the statutory context asks whether or not one has 

used the firearm during or in relation to a drug

trafficking crime, here a drug transaction. And I do --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It adds an additional 

element you have to prove but it doesn't answer the 

linguistic point.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think one can employ use in 

a natural way to mean receipt in the way that Petitioner 

used the firearm here. The subway system uses tokens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you're on the other 

side of the transaction, it's perfectly natural to say I 

used the gun for the transaction. What is the converse 

sentence? I used the gun --

MS. MAYNARD: I used the gun as a medium of 

exchange to sell my drugs. Just in the same way that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't use the gun as a 

medium of exchange. I accepted the gun as a medium of 

exchange. He didn't use it until he got it.

 MS. MAYNARD: I believe in any barter 

transaction, Your Honor, in particular, where one side 

has said as they negotiate it out, I will sell you this 

amount of drugs for this particular firearm, then both 

have used the gun as the medium of exchange --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have --

sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you don't have the 

simple sentence. I used the gun to pay for the drugs --

that's easy, but you don't have a simple countervailing 

sentence.

 MS. MAYNARD: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose you could say we 

used the gun in order to complete the drug transaction.

 MS. MAYNARD: And -- and the drug dealer 

used the gun as the medium of exchange to complete his 

drug sale, and I do think we do sometimes use "use" in 

that way, Justice Stevens. The subway system uses 

tokens. The metro system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say --

let's say you have a duel, and each person in the duel 

needs to have a weapon. One person has a gun; the other 

person has the sword. Would you say the person with the 

sword is using the gun in the duel?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well in a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because you can't 

have a duel without both people having weapons.

 MS. MAYNARD: You would have certainly 

used --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't say 

that the person --

MS. MAYNARD: -- the sword as weapon. There 

is no exchange there, Your Honor. Here it's crucial, 

because you have during your relation to a drug

trafficking crime, which here is the drug exchange, just 

like in Smith.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Each person in the 

drug exchange brings to the table what they've got. The 

one has the drugs; the other brings the gun. That 

doesn't mean that the person with the drugs is using the 

gun.

 MS. MAYNARD: If he agrees to trade his 

drugs for the gun as the currency to close the drug 

transaction, I believe he has used the gun in the way 

that we normally use the word.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the only way you can 

make that argument is to define the crime as consisting 

of the agreement as opposed to the consummated 

transaction.

 MS. MAYNARD: No. I think the -- I think 

the crime is the taking of the firearm in exchange for 

the drugs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought you said a 

minute ago that he was using it because he agreed to 

accept it.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think one could make the 

argument, Justice Souter, that an agreement alone is a 

use once, one agrees to use the gun as the medium of 

exchange to sell one's drugs. The Government is not

pressing that point here today and we don't, and the 

Court need not go that far because here Petitioner did 

receive the drugs, and the reason that possibly the 

agreement line goes too far is the rationale of this 

Court's decision in Smith where the Court pointed out 

that someone who makes a material misstatement in order 

to acquire a gun is clearly not using the gun, but the 

Court gave examples of receipt offenses in, in the 

forfeiture provisions in Section 924(D) where receipt of 

a firearm is a use under the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why wouldn't making 

a material misstatement in order to obtain a gun 

constitute a use of the gun -- as much as it, the 

receipt of the gun constitutes a use of the gun here? 

What's the difference between the two situations?

 MS. MAYNARD: I think one could make the 

argument, Your Honor, as I said, that making material 

statement. I'm saying the Court in Smith --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if you believe Smith.

 MS. MAYNARD: I beg your pardon.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if you believe Smith.

 MS. MAYNARD: Because -- and that's why the 

Government is drawing the line today at actual receipt, 

and that's - that's all that's involved in this case.

the dangers present with which Congress was concerned, 

which is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes but Justice Breyer 

made the very persuasive argument that it doesn't make 

sense to treat both sides of the transaction exactly the 

same; but isn't it the fact that in many drug 

transactions the buyer is not treated the same way as 

the seller? It's a crime to sell poison drugs but it 

may not be a crime to buy the poison drugs.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, there are two points in 

response to that, Your Honor. One is that if the buyer 

of drugs buys the distribution quantity, then we do 

often treat the buyer as a distributor under the 

distribution statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But generally speaking 

buyers and sellers are not always treated alike in the 

criminal law, are they?

 MS. MAYNARD: When Congress -- no that's 

correct, Your Honor; but in those cases where Congress 

uses words, like it does in the distribution statute, 

that clearly targets one side or other of the 

transaction. But here what the Court is interpreting is 

the much broader word, "use," and we know from Section 

924(D)'s forfeiture provisions that Congress employed 

the word use broadly in Section 924(d) and used it to

include receipt crimes; and Smith cites several examples 

of receipt crimes that Smith believed was a use, 

including unlicensed receipt of a firearm from out of 

State, receipt of a stolen firearm and receipt of a 

firearm with an intent to commit a felony; and in 

context Congress clearly did use "use" broadly in 

Section 924(D). If -- if in response to their argument 

in Ponce, their argument about (D)(1), the forfeiture 

provisions in (D)(1) and D 3, I do think those 

provisions strongly support the Government's argument 

here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? There's -- they refer 

to crimes in which there has been a receipt but there 

has also been a conveyance. Why do you focus on the 

receiver rather than the conveyer?

 MS. MAYNARD: Because our reading, Justice 

Scalia, gives full effect to the provisions that 

Congress has carefully chosen to place in (D)(3) and the 

Petitioner's reading does not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What are they?

 MS. MAYNARD: And if I could explain it. In 

(D)(1) -- it's on page 8a of our brief, (D)(1)-- in 

924(D)(1) Congress provided two principal ways in which 

the Government can forfeit firearms. The first is if an 

offense is completed, the Government can forfeit a

firearm that is involved in or used in that offense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Involved in -- that 

broadens that enormously, doesn't it?

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes it does, Your Honor; but 

that actually strengthens my point.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It cuts the other 

way. Congress knows how to say involved in if it wants 

to reach that broadly, and it didn't do it under the 

provision in which -- pursuant to which Mr. Watson was 

indicted.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well yes, Your Honor, but if 

you allow me to continue on, further on in (D)(1) 

Congress used a narrow subset of crimes some of which 

include receipt crimes where it only used the word use 

and that's the logic to this Court's decision in Smith 

and it applies equally here. Further down in (D)(1) 

Congress allowed the Government to forfeit firearms 

intended to be used in certain very specific listed 

crimes, and in other words to forfeit the firearms 

before the -- the crime actually is committed. Some of 

those crimes include -- receipt crimes -- include the 

very receipt crimes listed by this Court in Smith' and 

so given that Congress believed that the firearms 

intended to be used in purely receipt crimes were 

ultimately going to be used by the receipt, Congress

employed the term here very broadly including to receipt 

of a firearm.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be -- it could 

have -- it is intended to be used, not necessarily. As 

-- as your opponent pointed out, this section does not 

focus on the individual. It focuses on the firearm, 

simply for -- for confiscation of the firearm. And, 

therefore, it suffices if either side intended it to be 

used. It doesn't have to be the recipient who intended 

it to be used even though it's a receipt crime. It was 

intended to be used by the other side. Wouldn't that 

make sense?

 MS. MAYNARD: I think if you were to 

interpret (d)(3) in that way, Your Honor, you would do 

great violence to what Congress intended. If I can 

point you to page 10-A of our brief in -- it's (d)(3) 

that sets forth very particularly the crimes that 

Congress thought the government should be able to 

forfeit firearms before the crime occurs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What page is that?

 MS. MAYNARD: It's on the government's gray 

brief, 10-A. In (e) of 922 -- this is 924. I'm sorry, 

924(d)(3)(E ). It includes any offense described in 

section -- and it lists several examples including 

922(n). And 922(n) is set forth in the government's

brief on page 2-A, which makes it a crime for someone 

under felony indictment to ship, transport, or receive a 

firearm.

 Now, under Petitioner's reading they would 

say: Well, that's fine. That still has meaning. Under 

our reading of "use," the government can forfeit 

firearms that the person under felony indictment intends 

to ship or transport, but cannot forfeit firearms that 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is what -- this is 

what is bothering me about your side of this case. I 

start thinking this is a total fluke. Normally, you 

would charge him under "possession in furtherance of," 

which you didn't for reasons I don't know. Or he would 

be an accessory, which he isn't here because the other 

side was a government agent. So we've got a fluke.

 Now, if I accept your linguistic approach, I 

don't know what I'm getting into. Imagine an artillery 

team. One loads the ammunition; the other pulls the 

trigger. We say the team used the ammunition, but the 

guy who pulled the trigger by himself didn't.

 Think of a baseball team. The pitcher 

doesn't use the bat, but the team does.

 Now, if I take your linguistic approach, 

where am I in respect to other statutes? But if I deny

your linguistic approach on the ground that it's 

unnatural to say "use" of the -- the individual used it, 

all I've done is create a fluke case because it will 

never come up again.

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't think that it's --

several responses, Your Honor. I don't think it's 

unnatural to use "use" to mean "receipt" when you're 

talking about using something as a medium of exchange 

during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. 

Because, as I said before, company stores use script. 

American stores use dollars. French stores use euros. 

We can use the word "use" and then have to wait --

JUSTICE BREYER: But those are all examples 

that I used the gun to pay for the item. You don't use 

the word "use" when you're the seller. It doesn't fit.

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I disagree. 

I think when a company store uses script, that means it 

accepts script as money from the company employees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress 

passes a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime 

of violence gets an additional sentence, the person who 

is shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?

 MS. MAYNARD: You wouldn't have to go that 

far here, Your Honor, because the "use" here is use as a 

medium of exchange. So the court need go no further.

And that's another response to Justice Breyer. The 

Court need go no further than it did in Smith, which you 

-- it doesn't have to -- we have much more than receipt 

simpliciter here, Justice Breyer. We have the 

negotiated transaction where he received the firearms as 

the medium of exchange.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is that a 

necessary element of the offense: That the transaction 

be negotiated in advance?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, if you take it 

as the medium of exchange to sell your drugs. He 

doesn't dispute that he engaged in a drug trafficking 

crime, and he doesn't dispute that he took the gun as 

the currency to close that drug deal, and that is a use 

within the meaning -- within a natural meaning of "use," 

if it is used as currency.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that the 

parties are viewed collectively so that in Justice 

Breyer's example the pitcher and the batter used a ball 

and a bat. Is that your position? And in this case the 

seller and the buyer used drugs and a gun.

 MS. MAYNARD: In any bartering exchange, 

Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does that fit with 

the words of the statute, any person who --

MS. MAYNARD: Any person --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though it's a 

collective enterprise, you can still focus on one of the 

parties and prevail. Is that your position?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, imagine -- imagine a 

statute that made it a crime to use United States 

currency during and in relation to a drug trafficking 

crime. A drug dealer who sold his drugs for cash would 

surely be in violation of that statute.

 This is no different. The Court has already 

held that using the firearm as currency is a violation 

of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't think -- I 

don't see how your hypothetical advances the argument. 

I mean, I don't necessarily agree that someone who sells 

drugs for currency is using the currency in the 

transaction. They are accepting it. It is what they 

want. That's not the same as using it.

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I think they 

are using it as the medium of exchange, which I think 

even under the sentence rationale in Smith -- such as --

such as statutes, if you would say: Well, what's the 

normally intended use of United States currency? And 

that would be as the medium of exchange, and both 

parties would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what 

weakens your hypothetical. It's not the normal use of 

a gun as a medium of exchange.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, but the Court has already 

held that using a gun as the medium of exchange falls 

within the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It held that the 

person who does use the gun, which is the natural, 

grammatical construction, uses the firearm. That's 

quite a bit different than the question of whether 

someone who receives it as the consideration is using 

the firearm.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think the rationale 

necessary to the holding in Smith, Your Honor, was that 

use of a gun as an item of trade or commerce, 

specifically as the medium of exchange, is the "use." 

And, in fact, Smith refers several times to an earlier 

D.C. Circuit decision in Harris, a per curiam, a public 

per curiam, in which two members of this Court were on 

the panel, that involved this very fact pattern, where 

the -- the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the argument in 

Justice O'Connor's opinion was largely linguistic. The 

natural use of the word "use" is to say: I used it to

pay for the gun -- I used it to pay for the drugs, 

rather. But you don't have a countervailing sentence 

that fits into anything in her opinion, and you haven't 

really answered his reliance on the -- on the other 

case, which requires active use.

 MS. MAYNARD: I think in -- in Bailey, Your 

Honor, the Court required a use that makes the gun an 

operative factor, a use that changes the circumstances 

where both parties are aware the gun is being used.

 This is a far cry from Bailey. This is not 

locked-up weapons where only one party is aware of their 

existence to protect the store of drugs. This gun was 

front and center, part and parcel, of the drug 

transaction. It was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- Watson 

possessed the gun, would you agree with that, in 

furtherance of the transaction? Would you say that this 

case fits the statute, as amended, so it could have been 

charged as possession?

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. That's the 

government's position.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why was it -- why wasn't 

possession charged here?

circumstances of the charging decision here, Justice

Ginsburg, but in the Fifth Circuit the law was already 

clear that this was a use. And, indeed, when Congress 

amended the statute post Bailey to expand this Court's 

understanding of the meaning of "use," there was no need 

to address this particular fact pattern because most of 

the circuits had been --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the prosecution would 

certainly want to assure the success of the argument; 

and if this is clearly possession, why wasn't possession 

charged? And does the Department of Justice give any 

guidance to prosecutors since the 1988 amendment on what 

to charge in these situations?

 MS. MAYNARD: I don't know the answer to 

that, Your Honor. I don't know the answer to either of 

those questions, but I do know that we argued in our 

opposition to the cert petition that this question 

doesn't have much going-forward significance because of 

that new amendment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they were doubtful 

about whether the "possession" thing applies here. I 

don't know. Possesses a firearm in furtherance of the 

crime -- I mean, the crime has been completed by the 

time the -- the person who is receiving the gun has 

possession of it.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's hard to say it's in 

furtherance of the crime when the crime is over once he 

gets it. His possession is not in furtherance of the 

crime, it seems to me. It's the other person's 

possession that's in furtherance of the crime. He 

possesses it so he can turn it over, which is the crime. 

But I mean I'm just not all that sure that you have a 

hundred percent easy case on the possession point.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the Petitioner agreed 

with you on that, Your Honor, but four circuits have 

agreed with the government. On the going-forward basis, 

we think we do have a good argument. Here, and in your 

hypothetical, imagine the situation where the gun is 

turned over first, and then the payment -- and then the 

drugs are traded. It would certainly seem that you 

possessed it in furtherance there.

 I think it is possession in furtherance in 

-- in -- because it is the sine qua non of drug 

transactions. It's the very part and parcel of drug 

transactions. But it does -- this case does matter to 

the government because the government has prosecuted 

peeople properly, it thinks, under the "use" prong of 

the statute. Those people are -- currently stand 

convicted; and, as experience proves post-Bailey, if

this Court were to rule against the government here, 

that could have an effect on those people's current 

incarceration.

 If I could get back to my 922(d) point, just 

to finish up, which is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I just -- I 

don't understand the significance of the argument you 

just made. Are you saying that because some people 

might be let out of prison if we correctly construed the 

statute, we should read it your way?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. Of course if 

the Court feels that these people are properly 

convicted, then, you know, they can pursue whatever 

remedies they may have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what was your 

point referring to the people who were convicted under 

this statute --under this construction of the statute?

 MS. MAYNARD: That it -- that it is of 

ongoing importance to the government, even though as a 

prospective matter the government may be able to charge 

this conduct under possession and furtherance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the 

argument you made earlier was that this may not be of 

particular ongoing significance because of the 

amendment.

MS. MAYNARD: Right, Your Honor. From now 

on, the government could charge, if you rule against us 

in this case, we believe we can charge this conduct 

under possession and furtherance. However, my point is 

-- is that we nevertheless care about the result in this 

case. We believe that people in this situation have 

used a firearm as a medium of exchange during and in 

relation to a drug trafficking crime and stand properly 

convicted. It was only to make the point that the 

government does have an interest in how the Court rules 

in this case and that it's not meaningless to us which 

prong applies here.

 Back to the 922(d)(4) point, the -- under 

Petitioner's reading, it would mean that the government 

can't forfeit firearms in a situation like someone under 

felony indictment ships or transports -- intends to ship 

or transform a firearm. Under Petitioner's reading the 

Government can forfeit that because they consider that 

to be active verbs, but under -- if the person under 

felony indictment simply intends to receive a firearm, 

the government would have to wait until that person 

receives the firearm in order to be able to forfeit it, 

and that is -- I suggest that no rational Congress would 

have meant that by referring to the provision.

 They do point to -- well, if there -- if

there are no further questions, the government believes 

that this crime,this -- that the use of the gun in this 

manner is a crime, that there's no reason to believe 

that Congress would have wanted the defendant in Smith 

to stand convicted of this crime but to leave the drug 

dealer who ends up with the gun not with the punishment 

for this crime.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Something just occurred to 

me. When you distinguish the case,our unanimous 

opinion requiring active use, you said, well, that --

that gun was in the trunk of a car so -- what if this 

gun had been in the trunk of the car also and the guy 

said, well, it's now -- that's your gun?

 MS. MAYNARD: Whose trunk is it in, Your 

Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they just 

transferred ownership in exchange for drugs with -- by 

transferring title to a gun that was located in the --

in the trunk of a car.

 MS. MAYNARD: If he has constructive 

possession of it, Justice Stevens, and he's -- I believe 

he would have received it and that would be sufficient.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it -- it was not 

sufficient in -- in Bailey in any case, but it would be 

sufficient here because it played a role in the

transaction?

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.

 MS. MAYNARD: But -- I mean Bailey makes 

examples to things that would involve an active 

employment including reference to a gun that -- if the 

reference to a gun changes the circumstances of the 

underlying offense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but Smith, in 

Smith, Justice O'Connor used the illustration turning 

currency into a cannon. You can't do that very well if 

the gun is in a car, in a locked trunk in a car on the 

street. You can't turn the currency, the gun, into a 

cannon.

 MS. MAYNARD: That's true, Justice Ginsburg, 

and if the Court wanted to limit it to "use" means that 

you've actually taken possession of it because that --

that's all the government is defending here. That's 

what happened in this case. That's what happens in most 

of the cases.

 I -- I would also like to say in response to 

their point about the government sting, that if you look 

at the cases in the courts of appeals, there are many 

cases where -- that indicate these kinds of trades do 

happen in the real world absent government involvement.

For example, in the First Circuit's decision in Cotto, 

which is currently pending before the Court, the -- the 

person who ultimately came -- became the confidential 

informant -- before that the drug deal her sold to her 

drugs for guns on 20 separate occasions. So this does 

go on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there any reason 

in such a case, if you lost this case, in the future 

could you not just charge, as Justice Alito said, that 

they're a principal in the possession by the seller?

 MS. MAYNARD: We -- we believe --

JUSTICE BREYER: If the government is not 

involved? And if the government's involved on the other 

side, I guess you'd have to charge an attempt.

 MS. MAYNARD: There is no attempt offense 

under Section 924(c), Justice Breyer. You can use a gun 

during and in relation to an attempted drug crime, but 

you can't attempt to use a gun.

 The -- the government believes it could, on 

a going-forward basis, charge possession -- oh, you're 

asking me about whether we could charge aiding and 

abetting going forward. The -- the Seventh Ccircuit has 

suggested in Dick that that would be open to the 

government to charge. I think that -- and potentially,

be read into the indictment. But there are two possible 

issues: One that my colleague has pointed out, which is 

in some cases where Congress has criminalized one side 

of the transaction but not the other. And so that might 

be the situation here. The Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: And so your -- your 

practical argument then is that there has been 

considerable reliance on your interpretation to the 

extent that many people have been convicted under it. 

How many?

the transaction is desired and certainly something has 

to go, I would suggest it ought to be Smith because 

otherwise you're stuck with Bailey and with what I 

suggest are settled principles of statutory 

construction. The -- I think Smith takes -- takes it 

about as far as it could go, and you're having to make 

-- you have to make a number of linguistic compromises 

to get to the Smith result to begin with.

 The -- with regard to the -- the charging as 

possession or furtherance or not, again it's not before 

us, it's not part of this case I would suggest that 

Mr. Watson possessed this firearm as a consequence of a 

drug transaction rather than in furtherance of a drug 

transaction.

 I do think, and it's obvious from other 

statutes in the neighborhood, that Congress certainly 

knows how to say "receive" and "accept" and words of 

that nature, if it was its intent to -- to make the 

receipt of a weapon or bring that within the ambit of 

this -- of this particular statute.

 I don't think it's enough to say, as my 

opponent does, use as a medium of exchange if it's a 

crime for example to use a forged instrument. The guy 

who accepts it doesn't use it, I don't think by any 

reasonable interpretation. So I think that that -- that

really stretches this farther than it should go.

 Lastly, I would point out, and again this is 

in our brief around page 9, with respect to this 924(d) 

argument, one of the predicate offenses that's used in 

924(d) is 922(j), which includes language "it shall be 

unlawful for any person to receive, possess, conceal, 

store, barter, sell, or dispose of" et cetera. Well, 

"possess" is there in 922(j), yet we know from Bailey 

that "possess" in and of itself can't be a use. And 

that's just one of the reasons why that argument 

unfortunately falls apart when one is trying to import 

those definitions of use into this statute.

 I have nothing further.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Koch. 

The case is submitted.
