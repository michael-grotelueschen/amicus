3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning in Case 11-1285, US Airways v. McCutchen. 

Mr. Katyal. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 and may it please the Court: 

ERISA permits plan fiduciaries to seek 

11 appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the 

12 plan. 

13  Six years ago, this Court, in Sereboff, 

14 concluded that reimbursement actions by ERISA plans, 

such as the one at issue here, seek equitable liens by 

16 agreement. And because the plan's claim here is one for 

17 an equitable lien by agreement, that means one parcel of 

18 equitable defenses, those derived from unjustment 

19 enrichment, offer no help to Respondents. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, if you go to 

21 equity, why aren't you bound by equity? 

22  MR. KATYAL: We certainly are, Justice 

23 Sotomayor, bound by equity. Our contention is not that, 

24 once you say the magic words "equitable lien by 

agreement," that somehow transforms into a "we win" as 

4

1 plaintiffs at all. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's exactly 

3 what your bottom line is, which is you have someone else 

4 do the work for you and you don't pay them. 

MR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice 

6 Sotomayor, our position is that the rules of equity bind 

7 equitable liens by agreement, just as they bind anything 

8 else. We're not trying to say that the equity 

9 doesn't apply --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why does your lien 

11 have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally 

12 created at the commencement of the litigation? Why is 

13 the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the 

14 beneficiary? 

MR. KATYAL: So our position is that the 

16 attorney doesn't -- there is no lien created with the 

17 attorney; that, once Mr. Sereboff signed -- entered into 

18 an agreement with US Air, that agreement said --

19 provided for 100 percent reimbursement rights. 

And there is no -- essentially, what 

21 happened is Mr. Sereboff -- excuse me -- Mr. -- Mr. 

22 McCutchen double-promised his money. He promised it 

23 first to -- first to the US Airways plan, and then he 

24 promised it to -- to his attorneys. 

And that's a problem that he might have with 

5

Official 

1 his attorneys, although, as I understand the facts here, 

2 maybe that debt has been forgiven, but it is not 

3 something that creates an independent lien on the money 

4 that's at issue here. 

That is, the rules in equity say that it is 

6 the agreement that controls -- when we're talking about 

7 an -- when we're talking about an equitable lien by 

8 agreement --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: With Sereboff, that 

you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes 

11 the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the 

12 end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I 

13 assume, also the common fund doctrine, so -- so it's --

14 it's an open question. 

MR. KATYAL: Right. So our position is not 

16 that Sereboff's letter controls this case. We do think 

17 the reasoning of Sereboff essentially does decide the 

18 question because what Sereboff said, Justice Ginsburg --

19 and this is at page 368 of the opinion in the text -- it 

said -- the Sereboffs had argued the make-whole 

21 doctrine. 

22  And the -- in response, what this Court said 

23 is, quote, "Mid Atlantic's claim is not considered 

24 equitable because it is a subrogation claim. 

Mid Atlantic's action qualifies as an equitable remedy 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 because it is indistinguishable from an action to 

2 enforce an equitable lien established by agreement of 

3 the sort epitomized by our decision in Barnes. 

4 Mid Atlantic need not characterize its action as a 

freestanding action for equitable subrogation. 

6 Accordingly, the parcel of equitable defenses the 

7 Sereboffs claim accompany any such action are beside the 

8 point." Beside the point. 

9  And our position is, once the Court has 

decided that the type of action that is at issue here is 

11 an equitable lien by agreement, the relevant doctrine --

12 and this is a further answer to you, Justice Sotomayor --

13 that the Court is to look to is how are equitable liens 

14 by agreement evaluated in equity? 

And those rules in equity say that, again, 

16 the general rules of equity apply and govern that; but 

17 the one place -- the one set of defenses that aren't 

18 governed, are those that sound an unjust enrichment. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I recognize that 

we're talking about a matter of Federal law here. What 

21 about the law of most of the States? 

22  Suppose there's an agreement with an insurer 

23 and an insured, that says the insured gets 100 percent 

24 of the proceeds. I would think that the law of most 

States gives a superior lien to the attorney for the 

7

1 contingent fee, notwithstanding the agreement. 

2  I'm not sure of that. It's just an 

3 assumption. 

4  MR. KATYAL: That -- that is true, in some 

subrogation States. However, even with respect to that, 

6 when you have -- as long as it's not abrogated by 

7 statute or something like that. But if you simply have 

8 an agreement by an insured and it provides for 100 

9 percent reimbursement and abrogation of the common fund, 

even there, Justice Kennedy, the -- the agreement is 

11 enforced. 

12  So State Farm v. Clinton, which is a case 

13 cited in our brief, as long as -- as well as the Dobbs 

14 case and other decisions -- the Arkansas Supreme Court 

in 1969, the Arkansas court in 1931 -- have all said 

16 that, if you have an insurance agreement that abrogates 

17 the common fund doctrine, that that agreement is 

18 enforced. 

19  And, here, of course, we're dealing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that 

21 abrogation -- where is that abrogation in this -- not 

22 the plan description, but the plan itself -- what clear 

23 language in the plan bars the -- the --

24  MR. KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the 

district court at pages 30A to 32A of the petition

Official 

1 appendix had two pages that found the agreement clear 

2 and unambiguous with respect to abrogation of the common 

3 fund doctrine. And the plan itself is found at Joint 

4 Appendix page 20. 

That finding by the district court was never 

6 appealed to the Third Circuit. It was not appealed to 

7 this Court. And, indeed, the brief in opposition 

8 conceded this issue. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that's the summary 

11 of the plan that's at A20. That's not the plan --

12  MR. KATYAL: Yes. The summary plan 

13 description is at page --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the plan 

itself because the plan controls if there's a 

16 discrepancy. 

17  MR. KATYAL: Exactly. And so the plan 

18 itself was submitted, I believe, a few days ago. The 

19 Respondents have now made an issue of it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And I -- and I 

21 don't -- you -- you make a distinction between 

22 reimbursement clause and the subrogation clause. And 

23 this -- as far as I can tell from the plan, is no 

24 reimbursement clause. 

The only one that's there is labeled 

9

Official 

1 "subrogation." And I looked at what's in the plan, and 

2 I don't see language that clearly abrogates the common 

3 fund. 

4  MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, I suppose that --

that they could have made this an issue when they 

6 appealed the district court's finding on this. They 

7 didn't. And, indeed, there was discovery --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, you -- you 

9 want us to decide a case without looking at the plan? 

I have before me the same language that I 

11 believe Justice Ginsburg is looking at, and I think 

12 she's quite correct, that the word "abrogation," of 

13 course, is not used, but neither is the concept. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think we took this 

case to review the plan. Is -- is that what the Supreme 

16 Court took the case for, to say what this particular 

17 individual plan said? 

18  MR. KATYAL: Absolutely not, Justice Scalia. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Had that -- had that point 

been raised, we would not have taken the case. 

21  MR. KATYAL: And much to the -- and much to 

22 the contrary, Justice Scalia, exactly, this is the way 

23 that they framed the brief in opposition. The question 

24 presented is this: "Whether a seriously injured ERISA 

beneficiary must reimburse his ERISA plan for 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

Official 

1 100 percent of his medical expenses simply because the 

2 plan language so provides." 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, "simply because the 

4 plan language." I mean, obviously, we have to look at 

the plan language to see what the -- you're -- you're 

6 relying on the plan language. And you cite the summary, 

7 but you don't cite the main plan. 

8  MR. KATYAL: Two things, Justice Kennedy. 

9 First, that brief in opposition goes on to say that that 

plan was clear with respect to the common fund doctrine 

11 and others at page 5. 

12  But, second, if you're concerned --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you 

14 conceding --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. Maybe --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the plan doesn't say 

17 it? 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, please. The 

19 second point? 

MR. KATYAL: The second point is, even if 

21 you are concerned about any discrepancy, point -- 4.2 of 

22 the actual plan itself -- and this is page 22 of the PDF 

23 that was submitted by -- lodged by my friends on the 

24 other side a few days ago -- has essentially an 

anti-Amara clause in it.

1  It says that the benefits that are provided 

2 under the plan are those put forth in the summary plan 

3 description. So there is no discrepancy between the SPD 

4 in the plan in this case, unlike in Amara where there 

very well was a discrepancy. 

6  So here --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, the phrase 

8 that you just read says that the benefits are the same. 

9 It doesn't say that the reimbursement and subrogation 

language are the same. 

11  So go back to Justice Ginsburg's question 

12 and point out in the plan what words you're relying 

13 upon, not the summary, but the plan. 

14  MR. KATYAL: So the plan has, in 4.7, two 

things. It has, "The plan" -- quote, "The plan shall 

16 have the right to recover from any participant the 

17 amount of any benefits paid by this plan for expenses 

18 which were recovered from or paid by a source, other 

19 than this plan." 

And then later, in 4.6, it says, 

21 participants are -- quote, "are obligated to avoid doing 

22 anything that would prejudice the plan's right of 

23 recovery." 

24  So I don't think that there is any 

discrepancy, Justice Sotomayor. And to the extent that

Official 

1 this Court were concerned about it, there were 4 years 

2 for them to have made this an issue, but this is just 

3 about as procedurally barred as -- as anything --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: So if I were -- if I were 

Joe Smith, and a plan -- the plan pays me 100 -- I have 

6 medical expenses of $100,000. And, actually, the –-

7 the -- there was a driver who caused this problem. And 

8 later, I collect 100,000, but I have to pay 50,000 to 

9 get the 100,000. 

So I am left with 50,000 net because I had 

11 to pay my lawyers, I had to pay expert witnesses, there 

12 were a lot of different things I had to pay. I'm left 

13 with 50,000 now. So in comes the plan and says, we 

14 want 100,000. I say, what? Then I look at the 

language. The language allows them to get back expenses 

16 which were recovered from the third-party. 

17  I didn't recover 100,000 from the 

18 third-party. I recovered 50,000 from the third-party 

19 because it cost me 50 to get the 100. 

Now, if I were a judge and listening to 

21 that, I'd say, assuming they wanted a reasonable 

22 interpretation of this language, it sounds pretty 

23 reasonable to me. 

24  MR. KATYAL: All right. And, 

Justice Breyer, if you were the district court judge in

1 this case, I suppose you could have reached that result. 

2 The district court here --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: It's a little tough, since 

4 nobody had the plan. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, they -- they had the 

6 summary plan description, and they did not make an 

7 issue of it. They had all sorts of discovery 

8 requests, but never made a request for that --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But, I mean, 

wouldn't the normal result of such a case, like any 

11 contract case, where you have language, even if it was 

12 the word "any," it doesn't mean wheat grown on Mars, 

13 okay? 

14  And so you'd say -- if it says you can 

recover anything, that "any expense," it means, yes, you 

16 can recover that which was paid, but not money that you 

17 had to pay to get the amount paid. 

18  MR. KATYAL: Justice Breyer, we absolutely 

19 agree that a plan could be written in order to 

embrace --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But this is a plan that 

22 they wrote and that US Air --

23  MR. KATYAL: -- but I think it would be 

24 highly unusual for this Court, indeed, I think, 

procedurally unavailable for this Court to --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I guess your 


2 opponent could have raised that point. 


3  MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. 


4  JUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't raise it. 


MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: And we took this case on 

7 the assumption that there is an issue of law involved --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I can --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and not -- not on the 

assumption that --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: What is the issue of law? 

12 The issue of law is what happens if we have a plan which 

13 says, Joe Smith, my employee, if you have to spend 

14 $90,000 to get back 92,000, you have to give us back all 

92, even though you only have 2 in pocket. And we are 

16 supposed to assume that's what the contract said. Is 

17 that right? 

18  And then -- and then we say, now, can you 

19 override that with the principle of equity? Is that the 

issue you see before us? 

21  MR. KATYAL: So, again, we're not overriding 

22 with the principle of equity. We're saying that the 

23 rules of equity, if they have in the plan an abrogation 

24 of the common fund, as that is here, in the way this 

case comes to the Court, then that is what settles the 

15

Official 

1 question. 

2  Now, you could have a Sereboff plan, which 

3 says the reverse, which says, we're going to have a 

4 common fund doctrine and avoid that problem at the 

outset. The parties evaluate the valuation of the 

6 transfer of assets at the outset, and that's what 

7 controls. And if they want to buy into the common fund, 

8 as this Court said in Sereboff, that's absolutely 

9 enforceable. 

And so it's not a contract around, Justice 

11 Sotomayor, doctrines of equity. It's simply a 

12 reflection of the general rule that, in equity, if --

13 when we're talking about equitable liens by agreement, 

14 it is the agreement that controls, that starts the ball 

game. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the plan 

17 available to the employee at any time before this 

18 litigation? 

19  MR. KATYAL: Sure. If they had asked for 

the plan, it could have been provided to them. They 

21 have --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are they -- are they 

23 advised that they can ask for the plan? 

24  MR. KATYAL: I -- I'm not quite sure about 

that. I will look into that and try and get you an

1 answer on that. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought it took most 

3 of the litigation for the plan to be provided. 

4  MR. KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, at the 

outset, they asked for the summary plan description or 

6 the plan. The summary plan description was provided. 

7 Only --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You say, "they." I assume 

9 you mean their lawyer? 

MR. KATYAL: Their lawyer. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: This is not -- you know, an 

12 ignorant layman who knows nothing about the law. 

13  MR. KATYAL: That's correct. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: The lawyer, you say, did 

not ask for the plan. 

16  MR. KATYAL: And -- and I should say, the 

17 minute that US Air found out that a tort -- a 

18 plaintiff's lawyer was hired, they sent a letter to that 

19 lawyer saying, we assert a right of reimbursement. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Katyal, could I ask 

21 you about the legal argument that you are making, the 

22 distinction you are making between reimbursement 

23 agreements and subrogation agreements, which you 

24 think -- seem to think is critical here. And -- you 

know, once you put it in one box, rather than another,

1 some result follows -- different results follow. 


2  MR. KATYAL: Yes. 


3  JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- so how do you know 


4 whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a 


subrogation agreement? And what follows from that 

6 categorization? 

7  MR. KATYAL: So, Justice Kagan, there are 

8 two very distinct rights. Subrogation is the right to 

9 stand in someone else's shoes. And so the insured --

the plan says, we are going to inherit all of the 

11 benefits and burdens of the insured in bringing an 

12 action. It's a vicarious -- it's a kind of vicarious 

13 notion. 

14  Reimbursement's an entirely different 

concept. It's the idea that, look, we're not obligated 

16 to give you this money because we're not at fault in 

17 this accident, but we're going to essentially advance it 

18 to you, but you've got to reimburse us for it. And 

19 so --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So if this were a 

21 subrogation agreement, what would follow? 

22  MR. KATYAL: So if it were a subrogation 

23 agreement, I think my friend's case on the other side 

24 gets a lot stronger because there are subrogation cases 

that -- that have different rules. 

18

1  But when you talk about reimbursement, which 

2 is not the right to stand in someone's shoes, but a 

3 first priority absolute agreement between the parties to 

4 get money, it's just simply a dispute about that money. 

And you can't --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: So if your friend's argument 

7 would get a lot stronger if it were a subrogation 

8 agreement, how do we tell that this agreement is a 

9 reimbursement agreement, rather than -- are we supposed 

to just take that because that's the way the Court --

11 it's come to us? Or -- or is there an argument about 

12 why there is a reimbursement? 

13  MR. KATYAL: There is an argument. And, 

14 indeed, all I think you have to do, Justice Kagan, is 

look at what happened in Sereboff because, in Sereboff, 

16 you had essentially the same thing, a plan that had both 

17 a reimbursement provision and a subrogation provision. 

18 And the -- the beneficiaries in Sereboff were saying, 

19 hey, this is subrogation, this is subrogation. 

And the language that I've read to 

21 Justice Ginsburg at page 368, as well as earlier 

22 language in the opinion, said, no, this is actually a 

23 claim for an equitable lien by agreement that does not 

24 sound in subrogation, that sounds in reimbursement. 

And so all you have to do here is precisely

1 what this Court unanimously did in Sereboff, which is to 

2 say, look at the nature of the action, is this an action 

3 that seeks personal liability, does it specify a 

4 particular fund, the typical hallmarks of an action for 

an equitable lien by agreement; and, if those are 

6 present, as they are here, that is enough. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Are you, in effect, asking 

8 for a windfall because Mr. McCutchen and his attorneys 

9 didn't understand what ERISA means in this context? 

If they understood that things would work 

11 out the way you think they should work out and they saw 

12 that the limits of the insurance policies against which 

13 they could collect were $110,000, wouldn't they have 

14 realized that this was a suit that wasn't worth 

pursuing? There would be no point in doing it because 

16 nothing would be -- nothing would be gained for 

17 Mr. McCutchen or for the attorneys. 

18  MR. KATYAL: Not at all, Justice Alito. Two 

19 things. One, the rule on ERISA -- and this rule has 

been the rule in the Third Circuit since Federal Express 

21 v. Ryan in 1996, this is a long-established rule -- if 

22 an attorney comes and takes a case, knowing that there 

23 is a -- an ERISA plan at stake, seems to me they're at 

24 least on inquiry notice that there would be some 

sort of --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, perhaps they should 

2 have realized it. But, if they realized it, they have 

3 no incentive to pursue this litigation or to pursue the 

4 tort decision --

MR. KATYAL: Not so. This is both in our 

6 brief, as well as the Blue Cross amicus brief. 

7  What usually happens in these situations is 

8 that an agreement is struck in advance, before the 

9 lawsuit is filed, between the plan and the plaintiff's 

attorney to reach some accommodation. After all, the 

11 plan has an incentive in some sort of action being 

12 brought --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In this case, he 

14 wrote -- the attorney wrote to you any number of times 

and finally said, look, unless you come and tell me what 

16 your position is, I'm going to go forward. 

17  So what are attorneys supposed to do in 

18 those situations, just drop the lawsuit? 

19  MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, I don't think that 

quite is an accurate statement of the facts. That was 

21 precisely what the district court evaluated on the 

22 summary judgment motion. They had made a big issue 

23 about our failure to communicate and so on. The 

24 district court rejected all of those arguments --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Rejected it because it

4  MR. KATYAL: I do -- I do think that there 

were lots -- and this is in Joint Appendix, pages 50 to 

6 64 -- lots of communications between the two. 

7  Now, here's -- there was one place where 

8 there wasn't communication, which was they went and 

9 negotiated a secret settlement of $100,000. And when US 

Air found out about it --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, were they 

12 supposed to -- if the insurance limit was $100,000, are 

13 you suggesting that that was a bad-faith settlement? 

14  MR. KATYAL: I am suggesting that we didn't 

have the opportunity, Justice Sotomayor, that we 

16 typically do in the lion's share of cases, as I was 

17 saying to Justice Alito, where you work these things out 

18 in agreement -- in advance with clear lines of 

19 communication. And so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Kagan's question 

21 had two parts. She said, tell me about the two boxes, 

22 subrogation and reimbursement. 

23  I think there is quite a bit to your 

24 argument that this is not subrogation. The plan is 

rather confusingly drafted. The plan calls it

1 subrogation. I don't think it really means subrogation. 

2  If it's not subrogation, Justice Kagan's 

3 question was, what then? The -- the common fund rule 

4 still does not apply? Because? 

MR. KATYAL: Because the common fund rule --

6 and, this, we are in agreement on, the parties -- the 

7 common fund rule is a doctrine based in unjust 

8 enrichment. This is what they say at page 26. This is 

9 what all the courts say common fund is. 

And, indeed, up until six months ago, seven 

11 different circuit courts had evaluated this question of 

12 whether the agreement can trump the common fund 

13 doctrine. 21 of 21 circuit court judges all said it 

14 did. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are still in 

16 equity, pursuant to the statute. 

17  MR. KATYAL: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And are you saying that 

19 there is no discretion in the equitable decrees that the 

judge made? 

21  MR. KATYAL: That -- that is precisely 

22 right. The agreement sets the evaluation of the 

23 parties. That's what the State Farm case says, what 

24 their own treatise says, what the Arkansas Supreme Court 

says.

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Where there is a legal 

7 right, equity cannot overcome it. 

8  MR. KATYAL: That is correct. And as the 

9 Solicitor General says, at page 17, quoting the 

Restatement, "A valid contract defines the obligations 

11 of the parties as to matters within its scope, displacing 

12 to that extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment." Any

21 and may it please the Court: 

22  As this Court's cases recognize, Section

are available that -- under Section 502(a)(3), that

1 would have been available when an analogous claim was 

2 brought. And --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Equitable powers to enforce 

4 the agreement? 

MR. PALMORE: Yes. 


6  And so we agree with Mr. Katyal in what 


7 we've characterized as the first question presented, 


8 that we think is essentially decided by this Court's 


9 case in Sereboff. 


At equity, when there was a -- an equitable 

11 lien by agreement, that agreement was generally 

12 enforceable according to its terms. It was like a 

13 mortgage, is the classic case, and the mortgage gave a 

14 security interest in land; and, if the debt was not paid 

off, then the lienholder could -- could foreclose on 

16 that land. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, do you agree 

18 with Mr. Katyal's view of this distinction between 

19 subjugation -- subrogation agreements and reimbursement 

agreements and which this agreement is? 

21  MR. PALMORE: I think that's a -- the --

22 there is certainly a distinction, and the Couch 

23 Insurance treatise talks about the -- the distinction. 

24 But the Couch Insurance treatise also explains that the 

terms are often used interchangeably in a confusing way.

Official 

1  So I don't think that the bright line that 

2 Mr. Katyal seeks to establish between subrogation and 

3 reimbursement is necessarily reflected in all the cases 

4 and all the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think you can say 

6 that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them 

7 up. I mean, that means the rule doesn't exist because 

8 it's sometimes used in a confusing way? 

9  MR. PALMORE: No, I think it's just the fact 

that the courts do use these terms interchangeably. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the rule? What's 

12 the rule? Do you acknowledge that that is the rule? 

13  MR. PALMORE: We acknowledge that, when 

14 there is a -- when there is a contractual plan-based 

reimbursement provision like this, it is enforceable as 

16 an equitable lien by agreement, in the same way that an 

17 equitable lien by agreement would have been --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I think Mr. Katyal 

19 said that, if this were a subrogation agreement, 

Mr. McCutchen would have a much better argument because 

21 a different set of rules would apply. And so that makes 

22 this categorization question quite meaningful. 

23  Now, you could say, well, we don't see it as 

24 all that meaningful. We think, no matter what you call 

this agreement, the same rules apply. Or you could say, 

26

25

Official 

1 yes, different rules apply with respect to these two 

2 different kinds of agreements, and your job is to figure 

3 out which kind of agreement this is. 

4  MR. PALMORE: Right. We think -- as the --

as the case comes to the Court, this is a case for 

6 reimbursement. This is just like Sereboff, and this is 

7 a reimbursement agreement. 

8  What -- what adds to the confusion is 

9 that -- and if you look at more modern insurance 

decisions, they're bringing in all kinds of concepts 

11 from State law, from insurance law, from public policy 

12 of the State. They don't necessarily reflect what would 

13 have happened in a court in equity at the time of the 

14 divided bench, and that's the import --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's my exact 

16 question. I think, now, what we're being asked to 

17 decide is, from your point of view, does the common fund 

18 doctrine apply? 

19  I take it the common fund doctrine says, if 

this victim here got some money back from the person who 

21 caused the accident, that that money goes into a common 

22 fund, in the sense that those who share in the fund must 

23 share as well in the cost of producing the fund. 

24  So if it costs 50,000 to produce 100,000, 

which is in the fund, that we have to have US Air, as 

27

Official 

1 well, pay part of the cost of producing the fund. That 

2 sounds very fair. 

3  But I hear the argument, fair though it is, 

4 we have here an agreement, and in this agreement, it 

says, it's as if it said, and you shall not apply the 

6 common fund doctrine or any other equitable doctrine, 

7 such as he who seeks equity must do equity, etc. And I 

8 think that's the question that's being asked. 

9  And so what is your response to that? In 

particular, why do you say the common fund doctrine 

11 applies, though the contract says it doesn't, we assume, 

12 but all these other equitable doctrines don't apply? 

13  MR. PALMORE: Because we think the 

14 equitable -- equitable doctrines that apply are the 

equitable doctrines that would have applied at equity. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Good. So now, we have 18th 

17 century authority which says that, in the 18th century, 

18 Lord Cooke or someone said that the common fund doctrine 

19 applies, but the other doctrines don't. And the -- and 

the name and citation to that authority is? 

21  MR. PALMORE: Well, there is not one 

22 authority that is going to give you both -- both 

23 answers. But the equitable lien by agreement cases from 

24 the time of equity, as I mentioned before, were 

typically mortgage cases or a promise to provide future

1 acquired funds to discharge a debt. 

2  And it's clear, under those cases, that that 

3 could be executed, according to its terms. The unjust 

4 enrichment principles that Respondent is invoking were 

in a -- really a different silo involving equitable 

6 restitution. And this Court in Sereboff said, we are 

7 not going to look at equitable restitution principles, 

8 we are going to look at equitable lien by agreement 

9 cases. 

Now, there is a separate line of authority 

11 involving the common fund that we talk about in our 

12 brief. And, as Mr. Katyal said, it has at times been 

13 characterized as an unjust enrichment doctrine, but its 

14 roots are different. Its roots are actually in an 

analogy to trust law. 

16  If you look back to the principal case that 

17 established this, the Greenough case that we talk about 

18 in our brief, the Court said that the -- Mr. Vose, 

19 who -- the bondholder who had secured a benefit for all 

the bondholders, had -- while not a trustee, had acted 

21 the part of a trustee. And it was a well-settled 

22 principle of trust law, both then and now, that a 

23 trustee is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable 

24 expenses from the trust itself. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was there an agreement that

1 contradicted that? 

2  MR. PALMORE: There was no agreement in --

3 in Greenough that contradicted that. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but we have an

6 authority apply? 

7  MR. PALMORE: Because, Justice Scalia, 

8 I -- I -- 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: We have an agreement, which 

says that the insurance company gets all the money. So 

11 you either say that that agreement can be overcome by 

12 equity, or else, you -- you say the agreement prevails. 

13  MR. PALMORE: There are two answers, 

14 Justice Scalia. One is that -- that a plan can't add to 

or subtract from the powers of the court in equity, 

16 under Section 502(a)(3). A plan couldn't disclaim a 

17 claimant's ability to get an injunction --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: But it only has the powers 

19 to enforce the agreement. 

MR. PALMORE: The powers to enforce --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: There are various equitable 

22 powers, and it can use various of them to enforce the 

23 agreement. 

24  MR. PALMORE: But we don't think --

4 Section 502(a)(3) takes the settled powers of the court 

in equity as it finds them. And the -- and the plan 

6 can't divest the Court of those powers, it can't add to 

7 those powers, like this Court held in Great-West; it 

8 also can't take away from them. 

9  But, if I could go to an equity answer, 

because I think this is important --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Do you really 

12 think that if -- if an equity court finds the agreement 

13 to be unfair, it can say, he who seeks equity must do 

14 equity, and rewrite the agreement, so that it's fairer? 

MR. PALMORE: Not on general unfairness 

16 grounds, but it was a settled principle at trust -- of 

17 trust law, and remember, Greenough based the common fund 

18 doctrine on trust law that if, for instance, a trust 

19 document had said, the trustee shall take his expenses 

from the trust corpus, not from the income -- or 

21 vice-versa, says the trustee shall take his expenses 

22 from the income, but not from the trust corpus -- if 

23 that proved unworkable or unfair and the trustee 

24 couldn't discharge his obligations to maintain the 

trust, the court of equity had broad reformation powers

previously advanced. You make their point in footnote 9 

6 of your brief. You say that, in prior case, the 

7 Secretary of Labor took this position. And then you say 

8 that, upon further reflection, the Secretary is now of 

9 the view -- that is not the reason. 

It wasn't further reflection. We have a new 

11 Secretary now under a new administration, right. 

12  MR. PALMORE: We do have a new Secretary

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it would be 

more candid for your office to tell us when there is a

17 reflection of the Secretary. It's not that the 

18 Secretary is now of the view -- there has been a change. 

19 We are seeing a lot of that lately. 

It's perfectly fine if you want to change 

21 your position, but don't tell us it's because the

8 now of the view. I found that a little disingenuous. 

9  MR. PALMORE: Well, I apologize for that, 

Your Honor, but we do cite in that footnote the Amara 

11 case, and that is a key element to our position here 

12 because Amara said that Section 502(a)(3) incorporates 

13 the traditional powers of the court at equity. 

14  And it talked about, not only the ability to 

issue an injunction, but the ability to provide for a 

16 surcharge remedy, the ability to reform contracts --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The ability --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: We never doubted that

powers did not exist under ERISA?

powers was the ability to enforce an equitable lien by 

6 agreement without looking at inapplicable unjust 

7 enrichment --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or not to enforce it, 

9 meaning the equity is to enforce it or to stay your 

hand. And so the court could decide not to reach into 

11 the pocket of the plan participant to pay back money 

12 that the lawyer has. 

13  MR. PALMORE: Well, we do agree with respect 

14 to the common fund doctrine, and we think that, to the 

extent this Court is willing to look at the -- at the --

16 the purposes of ERISA, that the position that we've 

17 advanced strikes the right balance, and in particular, 

18 it avoids the -- the negative recovery scenario that is

1 please the Court: 

2  Reimbursement claims that are based on an 

3 express subrogation agreement are subject to equitable 

4 principles of subrogation. 

In equity, these claims were governed, 

6 according to the same principles that governed every 

7 other type of subrogation. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your opponent says this is 

9 not a subrogation agreement, so that argument goes 

nowhere. He would concede that point. You have to tell 

11 us why this is a subrogation agreement, even though you 

12 conceded below that it isn't. 

13  MR. WESSLER: Your Honor, it is a 

14 subrogation agreement. The claim, however, that 

Petitioners have pursued here, is a reimbursement claim. 

16 And -- but it's based on an express subrogation clause. 

17  And in equity, reimbursement claims, which, 

18 to be clear, are distinct from subrogation claims 

19 because they involve a suit directly against the 

insured, as opposed to against the tortfeasor, are 

21 governed by the same principles of subrogation that 

22 equity treated -- equity used that -- to apply to all 

23 claims that involved an insurer who is seeking to 

24 recover money from either an insured or a tortfeasor. 

And so we concede, absolutely, Your Honor,

1 that the claim is one for reimbursement for monies 

2 recovered out of a fund obtained by the insured. But 

3 it's -- it's based on an expressed subrogation --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what I say 

you've conceded. That's the common fund doctrine. Your 

6 opponent denies that the common fund doctrine applies. 

7 And it says this is an equitable lien by agreement, so 

8 that the common fund doctrine doesn't apply. 

9  Now, you -- you say it is not an equitable 

lien by agreement? Is that your position? 

11  MR. WESSLER: No, Your Honor. We -- it --

12 to be clear, it is an equitable lien by agreement, but 

13 it arises within the doctrine of subrogation, which is, 

14 as Couch and Palmer and other treatises explain, is an 

umbrella term that is used to describe all of the rights 

16 and rules that govern claims by insurers for money back 

17 after they've paid it out under a policy. 

18  Now, the form of the action in this case is 

19 a -- is a claim for reimbursement out of a fund, but the 

mere fact that that's the form of the action, which, in 

21 Sereboff, this Court called an equitable lien by 

22 agreement, does not alter the underlying rule that 

23 equity courts in the days of the divided bench would 

24 have applied to the claim. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But doesn't Sereboff suggest

1 not? I mean, I realize that Sereboff has this footnote, 

2 but if you read the text in Sereboff, it says, these 

3 affirmative defenses that would arise in a normal 

4 subrogation context are beside the point. So how are 

they not the beside the point? 

6  MR. WESSLER: They are not beside the point 

7 for -- for one reason, and let me -- let me explain why. 

8 What the Court actually said in Sereboff was that the 

9 parcel of equitable defenses accompanying a 

free-standing claim or free-standing action for 

11 equitable subrogation are beside the point. A 

12 free-standing action for equitable subrogation is not 

13 one based on an agreement. It's an implied claim, a 

14 claim for subrogation or reimbursement based on the mere 

fact that the insurer has paid the money. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: So is that true that, in 

17 Sereboff, there was no agreement? 

18  MR. WESSLER: There was, but what this 

19 Court -- there was absolutely an agreement, just as 

there is an agreement in this case. What the -- the 

21 distinction the Court drew in Sereboff was it said that 

22 whatever principles apply to free-standing claims are 

23 beside the point, because -- precisely because the claim 

24 was based on an agreement. That is absolutely correct. 

And it's perfectly consistent with our

1 position because we believe that the principles in 

2 equity that governed exactly the kinds of claims that 

3 were at issue in Sereboff and are at issue here, 

4 reimbursement claims based on an express agreement, are, 

in fact, governed by the same principles of unjust 

6 enrichment. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't understand 

8 that because it seems to me that, when Sereboff said it 

9 was beside the point, they were refuting the arguments 

that the insured party was making, that the insured 

11 party was saying, hey, look, we have these great 

12 defenses. 

13  And -- and you are saying they had an 

14 agreement, but they also said they have these great 

defenses, and the Court said, too bad, those defenses 

16 don't work for you here. 

17  MR. WESSLER: The Court -- the -- the 

18 beneficiary, Your Honor, in Sereboff, argued that the 

19 defenses that applied to a -- a freestanding or implied 

claim for equitable subrogation should control the --

21 the measure of relief available in the case. 

22  They said -- it -- the contract doesn't 

23 matter. The -- the agreement makes no difference. What 

24 the plan is trying to obtain here is a pure, 

freestanding claim for subrogation. And -- and look at

6 but what our view in this case is --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what -- what's the 

8 difference between the two? Meaning -- I take your 

9 argument to be that the Court was right before, that 

freestanding subrogation claims have one set of remedies 

11 or rights, and subrogation, by agreement, have another. 

12 So what do you see as the differences between the two? 

13  MR. WESSLER: When it comes to the rules 

14 that govern relief, there is no difference. The same 

principle of unjust enrichment controls, and it limits 

16 an insurer to recovering out of the fund 

17 only --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So was the Court in an 

19 exercise of futility, in writing what it did in 

Sereboff? 

21  MR. WESSLER: Not so, Your Honor. It did 

22 not reach the question in Sereboff of what rules apply 

23 to -- to reimbursement claims based on express 

24 agreement. That was footnote 2.

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I understand 

3 the argument. It's a bit unsettling that you've got two 

4 kinds of rights, one implied and one express, and 

there's no difference between the two? You -- you've 

6 got to give them a little bit more body to have a 

7 persuasive argument. 

8  MR. WESSLER: Your Honor, in equity, that 

9 was the rule. And I'll point this Court's attention to 

the leading treatise on equity. It's Palmer's treatise 

11 cited by this Court in Sereboff and in Great West. 

12  And what Palmer says -- and he -- he 

13 discusses, precisely, this claim on pages 473 and 474 of 

14 his -- of his treatise, and it's cited on page 21 of our 

brief. And he says that, "The same principle of unjust 

16 enrichment controls claims for reimbursement arising out 

17 of an express agreement." 

18  And I'm quoting here --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there another line 

after that, that says something --

21  MR. WESSLER: Yes, I'm about to quote that. 

22  And he says that that principle, quote, 

23 "should serve to limit the effectiveness of contract 

24 provisions which in terms provide for reimbursement out 

of the insured's tort recovery, without regard to

1 whether or the extent to which that recovery includes 

2 medical expense." 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this the part --

4 I might be mixing this up with something else, but is 

this the part where he says, unfortunately, the courts 

6 don't agree with that? 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. WESSLER: He -- he -- he identifies two 

9 decisions -- that -- you're correct, Your Honor -- he 

identifies two decisions, which did something contrary 

11 to that rule. But, in his view, that is the rule that 

12 governs these claims. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to what 

14 the -- the simple argument. We have an agreement here, 

and the plan is asking for what the agreement gives it. 

16 Why is the plan unjustly enriched by receiving exactly 

17 what the plan entitles it to receive? 

18  MR. WESSLER: Because, Your Honor, these --

19 these insurance reimbursement cases arose in a very 

different context from most other equitable lien by 

21 agreement cases. 

22  And the core difference in -- between these 

23 cases and all 22 or -- or more of the cases that the 

24 Petitioner cites, is that they involve a third party, 

who has caused the loss both to the insurer and the 

41
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 insured. And that third party, the tortfeasor, in these 

2 reimbursement cases is not the defendant. 

3  And so, in two-party equitable lien by 

4 agreement cases, which are -- all of the cases that 

Petitioner cites involve two-party cases in which the 

6 defendant is also the wrongdoer, is the person who is 

7 culpable and who has caused the -- the Plaintiff's loss. 

8 In those cases, when courts awarded relief, they awarded 

9 relief that was consistent with the defendant's unjust 

enrichment, but was also co-extensive with or consistent 

11 with the loss under the contract. 

12  In these three-party cases, however, because 

13 the defendant, who is -- who is a beneficiary, not --

14 not the tortfeasor, did not actually trigger the loss, 

courts developed, in equity, a different set of rules to 

16 apply to -- to measure the relief available under the 

17 claim. 

18  And what they said was, where there is a 

19 fund that is insufficient, where it cannot cover all of 

the losses suffered by all of the parties, that -- that 

21 all of the parties must share equally with -- of the 

22 loss. And the Palmer -- Palmer itself has an entire 

23 chapter devoted to third-party problems. And --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why is it so unfair? 

I've been putting it in a way that looks unfair, which

2 now, here is the deal, we'll pay your medical expenses. 

3 And now, if somebody causes those expenses, you come to 

4 us, and we decide whether we want to sue and get our 

expenses back, and any extra money, we give to you, and 

6 we pay our attorneys' fees extra. They don't count 

7 against the fund. 

8  And if our lawyers tell us it isn't worth 

9 it, you're free to sue; but, I'll tell you what, your 

lawyer is going to be at the end of the queue. We're 

11 first, then comes your lawyer, and anything left over

14 on those conditions, good for you. But he might because 

he might think he's going to get -- but our lawyers have 

16 already told us it's not going to work, so that's the 

17 situation.

1 because, in equity, parties could not defeat the rules 

2 that typically apply. 

3  Now, if this were a legal case and that were 

4 a legal claim, there's nothing unfair about that.  The 

parties can structure their contracts or agreements as 

6 they see fit. But the fact is that we are talking about 

7 the rules that equity applied in these situations. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: So whenever you have a 

9 contract that explicitly, although -- you know, nowadays 

when the merged bars, I suppose, you wouldn't even have 

11 to say it, but let's assume it explicitly says that 

12 rights under this contract can be enforced in law or --

13 at law or in equity. 

14  Whenever -- whenever you have a contract 

like that, it's going to be up to the court of equity to 

16 decide whether it's fair? 

17  MR. WESSLER: No, Your Honor. I -- I don't 

18 think that's right. And I would point the Court to --

19 to its decision in McKee in 1935, in which it drew a 

distinction between a claim in equity that was a legal 

21 claim based on a contract, which could happen, and a 

22 claim in equity that was a, quote, "purely equitable 

23 claim," based on the contract. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't this a legal 

claim? It's -- it's a promise made in a contract.

1 Why -- why is that not a legal claim? 

2  To be sure, the contract says that --

3 that -- you know, all equitable remedies are available 

4 to enforce that claim. But why is it an equitable 

claim, not a legal claim? 

6  MR. WESSLER: It -- it could be either, Your 

7 Honor. And we've cited -- cited to this Court cases 

8 in -- in the days of the divided bench, in which a party 

9 could have sought legal relief for breach for this exact 

kind of claim, but there was also a remedy that a party 

11 could seek in equity. 

12  But in order to do that, in order to -- to 

13 enter equity's doors on this reimbursement theory, it --

14 it had to agree to allow other parties their correlative 

rights in equity, and it also had to agree not to 

16 override or defeat the -- the rules in equity that 

17 typically would --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't that party 

19 simply say, I want to go to the other side of the court? 

You just made a distinction between the remedy at law 

21 and at equity. This is the plan, and if the plan is 

22 told, well, if you go to equity, you get all these extra 

23 things. You could say, I'm asserting my rights at law. 

24  MR. WESSLER: No, Your Honor. The -- the 

plan is in a bind here. And we know this from Sereboff

1 and Great West and Mertens. They cannot seek legal 

2 relief under this contract. 

3  The only remedy -- the only provision in 

4 ERISA's enforcement section that allows that is Section 

502(a)(1)(b). And it says, a party has rights to -- has 

6 the right to enforce the terms of the plan. But -- but 

7 fiduciaries like Petitioner are not allowed to pursue 

8 relief under that provision, so all they get is purely 

9 equitable relief under 502(a)(3). 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The general rule in equity 

11 was that the equity court would not give a specific 

12 performance decree to pay a certain amount of money, was 

13 the general rule. Were there exceptions? 

14  MR. WESSLER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if so, do those 

16 exceptions bear on this case? 

17  MR. WESSLER: And there were -- there were 

18 exceptions, but we don't view this case as a specific 

19 performance case. And I'm not sure Petitioner --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- you don't view the 

21 case as? 

22  MR. WESSLER: As a specific performance 

23 case. That -- that was a specific type of -- of remedy. 

24 The remedy here that's being sought is an equitable lien 

by agreement, but -- but in our view, when an insurer

Official 

1 sought to enforce, through an equitable lien by 

2 agreement, a claim or a lien on a fund, it must agree to 

3 take that relief, subject to the way equity would have 

4 treated the claim. 

And what Palmer and what Couch and -- and 

6 what the cases we've cited say is that, even for those 

7 reimbursement claims that are based or arise on an 

8 express agreement, that the relief available is limited 

9 in two concrete ways. 

The -- the insurer could not get more out of 

11 the fund than its share of the fund that accounted for 

12 the medical expenses it paid, and it must have agreed to 

13 reduce proportionately for an amount of -- of fees and 

14 costs. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Enter best case -- what is 

16 your best case? I'd love to find it. There's a case 

17 that says something like this. 

18  MR. WESSLER: The Svea case, Your Honor,

JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, let me tell 

21 you what I'm thinking of. The -- there is a contract, 

22 all written down. They forgot to put a seal on it. 

23 They forgot to put a seal on it. So I guess it's now 

24 1463 or some year like that. So they go into equity.

2 contract. He says, I'm a judge in equity. He says, I 

3 know, but we've agreed, and you enforce it in equity. 

4  The contract says, give Smith all the wheat. 

And equity says -- you know, there are other people who 

6 would like some of this wheat, too, so we are not going 

7 to follow the contract. We are going to modify the 

8 contract according to equitable principles, which, as 

9 you say, they can do. And the other side says, no, they 

wouldn't. They'd follow the contract. They are just in 

11 equity because they forgot the seal. 

12  Okay. What is your best case to show they 

13 did, indeed, modify it with the common fund doctrine or 

14 some other doctrine? I want to be sure to read it with 

a magnifying glass. 

16  MR. WESSLER: Well, Your Honor, to be clear, 

17 there is not a single equitable lien case that -- that 

18 Petitioners have found in which a court has --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I didn't ask 

you about what they found. I was asking what you found. 

21  MR. WESSLER: So -- so, Your Honor, the Svea 

22 case, is -- is, I think, our best example. And in that 

23 case, the insurer had a subrogation agreement, which 

24 authorized it to recover -- authorized recovery to, 

quote, "the extent of its payment" out of, quote, "all 

48
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 rights of recovery of the insured." 

2  And in that case, there was an underlying 

3 settlement that the insured reached with the tortfeasor, 

4 the wrongdoer. And after that occurred, the insurer did 

not participate in that underlying proceeding at all. 

6 And after that occurred, the insurer then directly sued 

7 the insured. 

8  This is exactly the kind of case we're 

9 talking about here, seeking recovery out of the fund. 

And they based that claim on their -- on their express 

11 subrogation agreement. And they said, we paid 

12 approximately $3,000. You recovered something like 

13 $9,000. We should get $3,000 back. 

14  And the court there said, no, because the 

fund was insufficient to cover all of the losses --

16 the -- the insured did not recover for all of its 

17 losses, several other claimants did not recover for all 

18 of their losses -- and the court said that, because the 

19 fund was insufficient, the -- the insurer was limited to 

recovering -- and I'm quoting here -- "no more than its 

21 proportion of the amount recovered after deducting costs 

22 and fees." 

23  And so they applied both the double recovery 

24 cap that we believe applied in every single case in 

equity in which an insurer --

6  MR. WESSLER: The highest court in Maryland, 

7 I believe from 1901. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wessler, would it be 

9 fair to say -- I mean, we're in this unusual position 

because we're supposed to be looking back to before the 

11 1930s sometime. 

12  Would it be fair to say that we just don't 

13 have very many cases, and Mr. Katyal doesn't have any, 

14 and you don't have any, that raise this question that, 

where somebody walks into an equity court with a 

16 contract, and we try to figure out whether the equity 

17 court is going to use these unjust enrichment defenses? 

18 Would it be fair to say that we just don't know? 

19  MR. WESSLER: I -- I think -- I think that 

it's fair to say that this did not arise that frequently 

21 in courts of equity. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Why didn't it? 

23  MR. WESSLER: Be -- for -- for several 

24 reasons, Your Honor. 

First, most of these claims arose simply as 

50
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 freestanding or implied claims. So there was not --

2 there was no need for an insurer to include in its 

3 insurance policy an expressed subrogation agreement. 

4  However, that -- that changed approximately 

around the turn -- the mid-20th century, when medical 

6 insurance started to become an increasing commodity. 

7 When that occurred, most States had a -- a prohibition 

8 on the assignment of personal injury claims. 

9  And so what insurers began to do to get 

around that prohibition was to insert in their -- in 

11 their policies an express clause allowing them to obtain 

12 reimbursement from the insured, in the event that the 

13 insured recovered money that it had paid. 

14  Now, there is another reason in this case --

or in these ERISA cases -- why these agreements need to 

16 be in the plan. And that's because Section 502(a)(3) 

17 itself does not allow for a plan, like Petitioner, to 

18 obtain a general right to equitable relief. All that 

19 the Petitioner can -- can seek here is equitable --

appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of its 

21 plan. 

22  And so, in the absence of an expressed 

23 provision, like a subrogation clause, it would not be 

24 entitled to pursue a -- a general right to subrogation. 

It's a term -- that back-end reference is

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can -- I 


4 want to give you an opportunity to respond to the 


argument that you've waived, the -- the -- your argument 

6 based on the distinction between the summary of the plan 

7 and the plan. 

8  And there are two things that concern me 

9 about that, in particular. The summary of the plan, 

which you've had all the time, says, on page 1, "This is 

11 only a summary. Complete plan details are contained in 

12 a legal plan document. If there is any difference 

13 between the information in the summary and the legal 

14 plan, the legal plan" -- "the legal plan document will 

govern." 

16  So when you had the summary, you were on 

17 notice that, if there were any difference between it and 

18 the plan, the plan would govern. You received a copy of 

19 the plan in June of 2012. Okay? 

And as late as August 29th of 2012, 

21 two-and-a-half months afterward, you filed a Joint 

22 Appendix that didn't -- didn't contain the provision 

23 that you say now governs. So why shouldn't you be held 

24 to have waived that? 

The first time we found out about that was

25

Official 

1 in your red brief that was filed -- June, July, August, 

2 September -- three months -- October -- four months 

3 after you had the plan. 

4  So didn't you waive it? 

MR. WESSLER: Well, I -- I don't think we 

6 waived it, Your Honor. It's in our opening brief on the 

7 merits to this Court, and --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which was four 

9 months after you had the plan and -- and the plan was 

lodged with us last week for the first time. 

11  MR. WESSLER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

12 In our view -- and -- and I think I need to be clear 

13 about this. I mean, the -- the fact that the plan 

14 contains a different set of rights than -- than the SPD, 

to us, is meaningful in -- in its -- in its effect that 

16 it will have on this case when this -- if and when this 

17 Court remands because -- because, in our view, the 

18 rights are different. 

19  However, I -- it doesn't change the 

underlying nature of our argument, which is that, even 

21 the strong form argument that Petitioners have made 

22 here, which is that, on the SPD, it can defeat the --

23 the rules that typically would have applied, that equity 

24 would not have allowed that. And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem is that 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 the district court interpreted the plan as precluding 

2 the claim you're making here. And your argument that 

3 that's not true is based not on the summary of the plan, 

4 but on the plan itself. 

MR. WESSLER: That --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what the 

7 district court does is it defers to the administrator's 

8 interpretation of the plan. So the district court found 

9 that the administrator's interpretation was not 

arbitrary and capricious. 

11  So what your friend is arguing is that, 

12 well, you are kind of stuck with the district court 

13 interpretation, and you can't, at the last minute, argue 

14 that it shouldn't control because of some other 

document. 

16  MR. WESSLER: Well -- well, we think we do 

17 have the right to argue that on remand, Your Honor. 

18 And -- and this Court's decision in Cigna only -- only 

19 arose in this case after the -- the briefs were complete 

to the Third Circuit. 

21  And so it's -- I -- I think Cigna has 

22 changed the law to the extent that all parties are now 

23 on notice and know that the plan document will trump any 

24 contrary language --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, Cigna

1 didn't tell you that. The plan -- the summary told you 

2 that. It says, "Complete plan details are in the legal 

3 plan. If there is any difference between the summary 

4 and the plan, the plan controls." So you didn't need 

Cigna to tell you that. 

6  MR. WESSLER: Well -- well, Your -- Your 

7 Honor, I mean, I -- I think that the -- the -- you know, 

8 that -- for us, that's an issue on remand. We're 

9 comfortable that our arguments in this case control, 

even -- even as it relates to the actual language in the 

11 SPD and that -- and that whatever differences between 

12 the SPD and the plan actually are don't necessarily 

13 change the rules that govern when a -- when a party in 

14 equity sought this kind of reimbursement relief directly 

from -- from an insured. 

16  I'd like, just -- just for the last minute 

17 or so, to discuss the common fund rule because I do 

18 think it applies as a separate and distinct rule, 

19 regardless of how this Court interprets the agreement as 

governing the rights between Mr. McCutchen, the 

21 beneficiary, and the plan. 

22  And I'd just like to point out that this 

23 Court, in Pettus, made clear that the common fund 

24 doctrine confers a separate lien on the attorney. And 

so whatever the agreements control between the

1 beneficiary and the plan has, it cannot defeat the 

2 rights that the attorney has, as a separate matter, to 

3 come into court and invoke its own lien on the fund as a 

4 first priority lien over the money. 

And -- and I -- and I'd just like to point 

6 out that Petitioners have not responded to that 

7 argument. Nowhere in their reply brief did they explain 

8 why their theory would allow them to defeat the rights 

9 of a third-party defendant in this case, Mr. McCutchen's 

lawyers, who have their own separate right to the lien. 

11  And -- and none of their equitable lien 

12 cases, Your Honor, involve any kind of common fund 

13 whatsoever. So they say precisely nothing about the 

14 rules that would have applied in equity to an attorney's 

attempt to -- to take their proportion out of the fund 

16 before it was distributed to any of the parties. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were 

18 discussing the common fund would be the allocation 

19 between McCutchen and the plan. But now, you seem to be 

talking only about the attorney's right to come in 

21 first. 

22  MR. WESSLER: The common fund, Your Honor, 

23 applied either to deduct -- either as -- as a deduction

13  MR. KATYAL: Thank you. 

14  I'd like to begin where -- where Mr. Wessler 

left off, with the common fund, and make three quick 

16 points. 

17  The first is that both equity law and ERISA 

18 law point in the same direction. Justice Scalia is 

19 absolutely right, that they have zero cases that say, if 

there's a preexisting agreement that settles the common 

21 fund doctrine, that that makes it not enforceable. 

22  And Justice Ginsburg's absolutely right to 

23 say that when the plan -- the plan is not unjustly 

24 enriched, to get the money that they are entitled to get 

under the contract.

1  The second point I would make is that the 

2 Solicitor General says, well, this is now --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Put on the back of 

4 someone else, meaning --

MR. KATYAL: I agree. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I may or may not 

7 agree that, in terms of your split with the participant, 

8 the contract might control. But I still am having 

9 trouble with understanding how you can bind a third 

party, like a lawyer, who's done the effort to recover 

11 that fund -- more along Justice Breyer's question, which 

12 is not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled, 

13 whether by contract or by unjust enrichment principles, 

14 to a -- to a percentage of their expenses in recovering 

something. 

16  MR. KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, that's 

17 precisely what cases like State Farm and the Arkansas 

18 case from 1969, the Maryland case from 1931, address, 

19 which is that situation. And the reason is that 

essentially here -- it's a mistake to see this as a 

21 third-party case. 

22  This is really a situation created by 

23 Mr. McCutchen double-promising the same money to two 

24 entities, US Air and to his lawyers. And so it's 

essentially a dispute, really, among two parties, not

1 three. 

2  Now, the Solicitor General says, well, this 

3 is rooted in -- in equitable doctrine. There is no case 

4 that they have that says that there's some equitable 

doctrine that trumps the preexisting agreement. And, 

6 indeed, the case that they cite, the Greenough case, is 

7 one that essentially relies on unjust enrichment 

8 principles. 

9  Sure, the Court has an equity power when to 

remedy unjust enrichment. That is an inherent power of 

11 the Court. We're not disagreeing with that. What we 

12 are saying is that, when you have an agreement in 

13 advance, that means, per se, there is no unjust 

14 enrichment, that they are, to use this Court's language 

in Sereboff, a defense that it is beside the point. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm assuming, 

17 because ERISA's in place now, that the many State laws 

18 that prohibit this kind of agreement, where insurance 

19 plans are seeking full reimbursement, despite an 

attorney's efforts, that those are void, that those 

21 would be enforceable. 

22  MR. KATYAL: That is precisely --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The only one who can fix 

24 this problem now is Congress, if they --

MR. KATYAL: That is correct.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if they perceive it 

2 as a problem. 

3  MR. KATYAL: Congress, in 1974, set it up 

4 this way. And I think that that's an important point, 

Justice Sotomayor. For 38 years, this Court has never 

6 embraced an idea that Federal common law allows 

7 rewriting of plan terms. It would be a very dangerous 

8 doctrine to do so. It'd be standardless. 

9  And here is a very vivid example: They are 

saying that it is inequitable to have the Federal Blue 

11 Cross/Blue Shield plan, which governs 4.6 million 

12 people, including perhaps members of this Court, which 

13 has the exact same provisions as the US Air plan, an 

14 abrogation of common fund and a 100 percent 

reimbursement provision. 

16  And they are saying that that would not be 

17 enforceable. That may create any number of problems for 

18 the government, I imagine, when it tries to enforce 

19 that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the expense weren't 

21 to pay the lawyer. Suppose, in order to get the 

22 100,000, you had, for example, to build a model car to 

23 demonstrate to the manufacturer what caused the injury, 

24 and it cost you 98,000 to do it. And they pay you 

100,000.

1  You're saying that -- it wouldn't be unjust 

2 to say the 100,000 has to go to -- back to pay US Air? 

3  MR. KATYAL: Justice Breyer, if the 

4 agreement settled that in advance, yes, it would not be 

unjust. It is the agreement that controls. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
