 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-9995, Rivera v. Illinois.

 Mr. Leven.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. LEVEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LEVEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Petitioner lawfully exercised a 

peremptory challenge on juror Delores Gomez. As a 

result of the erroneous denial of that challenge, Ms. 

Gomez wrongfully sat on the jury and lacked authority to 

render a judgment. Petitioner's conviction should be 

reversed automatically for three separate and 

independent reasons.

 First, the trial before an unlawful 

adjudicator is structural error. Two, the wrongful 

seating of a juror is structural error, because the 

effect of the error is impossible to determine --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you putting -- are 

you equating this with a biased judge? The -- the 

category of structural error has been kept very narrow 

by this Court. And it seems to me that a juror who is 

perfectly qualified, who it is conceded -- it is

conceded could not have been dismissed for cause, is 

quite a different matter than a judge who -- who has 

taken a bribe or who has a monetary stake in the case.

 It -- it seems quite a stretch to apply 

those decisions to -- to the case of a juror who was 

qualified, and it was just a judge who was overexuberant 

in denying a peremptory challenge.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, our unlawful-adjudicator 

claim is not dependent on a finding or showing of bias. 

A -- a juror who is illegally on the jury, who does not 

have the authority to serve, would render the jury 

improperly constituted. Therefore, there would be 

structural error for a jury illegally constituted to 

render a judgment irrespective of bias.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But your whole 

argument that the -- that the juror was illegally 

sitting and the jury was illegally constituted is a --

in effect a statement of the effect of State law. And 

the State supreme court doesn't think that's the effect 

under State law.

 So it seems to me that the -- the full 

premise of your argument that there is something 

inherently unlawful about the seating of that juror is 

simply in -- in effect denied by the State supreme 

court. And we take our law from them.

MR. LEVEN: Well, Your Honor, there are 

State law and Federal law components to this issue. 

Petitioner had a lawful right to excuse juror Gomez 

under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 434.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But no -- no 

constitutional right, no constitutional right to the 

peremptory challenge.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, there is a constitutional 

right to due process involved that is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you in effect 

are saying that any violation of State law with respect, 

let's say, to criminal trial procedure becomes, if not 

remedied, a due process violation under Federal law. 

That's -- that's your -- your unstated premise, isn't 

it?

 MR. LEVEN: No, Your Honor. The -- our 

argument is very narrow in scope: That if a -- a jury 

that is illegally constituted renders a verdict of 

guilty, then that jury is an unlawful adjudicator. The 

unlawful adjudicator claim is what triggers the right to 

due process.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There could be a thousand 

reasons why under State law a particular jury is 

improperly constituted. So you are saying whenever the 

State under whatever State laws it has says that the

judge made a mistake about who to put on the jury, that 

that violates the Federal Constitution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just as an example, to 

follow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can 

you answer his question -- many States have -- have 

rules that you have to be a resident of the county to 

serve on that jury. And suppose a juror thinks that he 

or she is a resident and gets the county line wrong or 

doesn't know what the residency requirement. Under your 

rule -- what is your term, an "unlawful adjudicator." 

And then we have a -- we have a -- a Federal 

constitutional standard that requires structural error 

for any State -- for any violation of any State -- State 

rule. That is Justice Breyer's question.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, with respect to jury 

qualifications such as age and citizenship, there is a 

very delicate screening process that goes into effect. 

So the problem of an unlawful-adjudicator with respect 

to, say, age would be a very, very rare phenomenon and 

would rarely occur, because jurors who are too young to 

serve, perhaps under 18 years old, would never make 

their way to a jury pool in the first place. So it 

would really be unfair to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You are -- you are 

avoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there

are not going to be many violations of this sort, and 

then you pick out age. But Justice Breyer began -- the 

preface to his question was -- was that there are -- are 

manifold requirements varying from State to State.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What you are giving us is 

a sweeping proposition, A, for the constitutional 

principles that you are setting forth; B, for the 

supervision and intrusion it would cause Federal courts 

on the State system.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, if we take the juror's 

qualifications that were discussed in the State's brief, 

it would appear that all the qualifications that are 

discussed there would -- as I said, it would be a very 

rare situation, indeed, for a --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? One 

qualification is that a jury -- a juror can't be 

prejudiced. All right. I think it's a very common 

thing for prosecutors and defense lawyers to get into 

arguments about whether a particular juror is or is not 

prejudiced. Okay.

 So sometimes the judge excuses them, maybe 

five million times a year; and probably in a certain 

percentage, maybe 5,000 or 500 or 50,000, the judge is 

wrong. All right.

So the State appellate court says he's 

wrong. So the jury wasn't made up properly.

 Now you are saying in every one of those 

cases that violates the Federal Constitution. I have 

never heard of this before. It may be there is some 

precedent for it. I don't know. That's why I am 

asking.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, Gomez versus United States 

set forth the principle equating a right to an 

adjudicator with lawful authority to decide at every 

critical stage of the proceeding.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So that means that held --

we have held in that case -- I had better look at it --

that in any instance where excusing a juror violates 

State law that that is a violation of the Federal 

Constitution. Which is the case that says that?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, that -- that case did not 

involve jurors, Your Honor, but it did involve a 

magistrate who lacked the authority to preside over voir 

dire. And the court held under a general principle of 

law equating the right of -- the lawful-authority right 

to the right to an impartial jury and used the phrase "a 

basic fair trial right," meaning that the right to a 

lawful adjudicator is a basic fair trial right. And

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are not --

suggesting, because you conceded there was no basis for 

a for-cause challenge, you are not -- you are not saying 

that Gomez was unqualified or that she was biased. If 

she was biased, you had a basis for that, she could be 

excused for cause.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, there is a reasonable 

possibility of bias with respect to Gomez because of her 

extensive contacts with gunshot victims at Cook County 

Hospital --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But she was an 

administrator. She wasn't a nurse. She didn't deal 

with people who had gunshot wounds.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, the Illinois Supreme Court 

held that defense counsel's strike of Gomez was a valid 

reason to have her removed from the jury. She could 

have, even though she said -- even though she was not 

challengeable for cause, the peremptory challenge is 

there for a purpose, and that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't need a good 

reason for a peremptory challenge.

 MR. LEVEN: The peremptory -- if I 

understand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole fun of a 

peremptory challenge: You don't need a good reason.

MR. LEVEN: Well, the purpose of the 

peremptory challenge is to help to create a fair and 

impartial jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And for some 

reason, I just think this person is not going to vote 

for me. I don't know why. I just don't think so. I 

don't want this person sitting on the jury. That's all 

the reason you need.

 MR. LEVEN: That's right. Under Swain v. 

Alabama, a peremptory challenge can be exercised without 

having to state a reason.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, our footnote in a 

later case authored by Justice Scalia indicates 

considerable doubt as to the viability and to the 

correctness of that formulation in Swain.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, with --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Salazar, I think, is 

the --

MR. LEVEN: Yes, Martinez-Salazar in its 

footnote 4 determined that the automatic reversal rule 

in Swain was subject to reconsideration due to the 

advent of harmless error analysis.

 But I was citing Swain for a different 

purpose. I was citing Swain for the purpose that a 

peremptory challenge can be exercised without having to

state a reason, and that's a fundamental --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. I thought you 

were citing Swain -- and I think you are going to have 

to establish -- that peremptory -- to win your case, 

that there is a constitutional basis, a constitutional 

right to exercise a peremptory challenge, at least --

then you can you have a subset of that -- when the State 

gives it to you. But I think Swain no longer stands for 

that proposition.

 MR. LEVEN: I wasn't citing it for that 

proposition, Your Honor. We have the case of Evitts v. 

Lucey, for example, where the Court was analyzing the 

right to an appeal. And the Court found that the right 

to an appeal was not of constitutional origin, but once 

the State had created a right to an appeal it had the 

obligation to administer that right consistently with 

fundamental fairness and due process.

 So here we have a peremptory right that the 

State of Illinois wasn't obligated to create. But once 

it adopted that peremptory right, it was, in effect, 

adopting the long venerable tradition of peremptory 

challenges that has existed in this country since the 

founding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- well, first, 

how many peremptories does Illinois law allow?

MR. LEVEN: For non-capital cases, it's 

seven, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose a State 

allowed only three peremptory challenges. There would 

be nothing in the least unconstitutional about that, 

right?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, under Ross v. Oklahoma, 

the State had the authority to regulate peremptory 

challenges.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This was number four, was 

it?

 MR. LEVEN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The challenge to Gomez 

was the number four peremptory?

 MR. LEVEN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, if the State had 

only three which it could do, there would be no basis 

for removing Gomez from the array. That is, the defense 

would have already exercised three peremptory 

challenges, she's number four, too bad. That would be 

the end of it, right? She would sit on the jury.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, as to our unlawful 

adjudicator claim that would be correct, because if the 

defense did not have a peremptory challenge to exercise 

in order to strike Gomez if the peremptories have run

out --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is something 

unseemly about saying because the State is generous in 

its peremptories, you have a grand constitutional 

argument to make, even though there is no constitutional 

right to any peremptory challenge?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, the State is obligated, 

consistent with due process, to provide that which is 

promised. And the problem --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That goes back to the point 

which you rejected when I suggested -- I suggested 

earlier that you were in effect arguing that every 

violation of a State statute in this criminal context 

amounted to a due process violation. And you say, no, 

that's not what I am arguing. It seems to me that that 

is exactly what you just said to Justice Ginsburg.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, what makes the peremptory 

challenge unique is its venerable tradition since the 

time --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we were talking about 

peremptory challenges before and we are talking about 

peremptory challenges now. Have you changed your 

position from -- from the position you stated in answer 

to my question?

Your Honor, the case involves peremptory challenges.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Look, the question that I 

thought I was asking and I thought you were answering 

was this: Do you claim that every violation of State 

law in the -- we'll say in the selection of jurors -- is 

automatically, if not remedied by the State, a Federal 

due process violation? And you said, if I recall 

correctly, no.

 It seemed to me that in answering 

Justice Ginsburg's question just now you were saying 

yes. You said the State has to act consistently with 

due process.

 MR. LEVEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so, do you stand by 

the answer you gave me or is it, in fact, now your 

position that every violation of state law that goes 

unremedied becomes a federal due process violation?

 MR. LEVEN: No, I'm not saying that every 

violation of State law that's unremedied --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then why does 

this one become a due process violation if it's 

unremedied.

 MR. LEVEN: Because this one involves a 

State violation that resulted in an unlawful 

adjudicator. Let's take --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- that then 

goes back to an earlier question. It's an unlawful 

adjudicator if state law says so. Federal law says you 

don't even have to have peremptory challenges, you don't 

even have to have a process for winnowing out the Gomez 

jurors.

 So, in effect, if you are saying that there 

is something unlawful about the seating of the juror, 

you are making a statement of State law, and the State 

Supreme Court disagrees with you, which seems to me to 

foreclose your argument.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, the State disagreed with 

our position as to the Federal automatic reversal law. 

The court applied, and we would argue misapplied --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the court -- the 

Supreme Court of Illinois did not find anything unlawful 

about the juror sitting. They said, yeah, the perempt 

should have -- the peremptory challenge should have been 

respected. But they did not say, and it seems to me 

they clearly rejected the notion, that there was 

something unlawful about the jury and unlawful about 

that juror's participating in reaching a verdict; isn't 

that correct?

 MR. LEVEN: I would read the Illinois 

Supreme Court opinion -- specifically what they did

state is that the trial court was incorrect in denying 

the peremptory challenge, therefore that juror should 

not have sat on the jury, that juror was wrongfully on 

the jury.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no. The -- the 

peremptory challenge should have been respected. But 

the Illinois Supreme Court did not say, as I understand 

it, that by allowing the juror to sit the juror was 

acting in an unlawful capacity, or that there was 

something unlawful under State law about the jury's 

actions and the jury's verdict.

 Am I not correct about that?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, the Illinois Supreme Court 

only made one statement, that the peremptory was 

wrongfully denied. Now, as far as elaborating on its 

reasoning --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if they thought that 

tainted everything that happened afterwards, it seems to 

me they would have said, therefore, the verdict is no 

good.

 MR. LEVEN: No, because the court misapplied 

this Court's precedent in Neder. That's the basis for 

the court affirming the conviction. It had nothing to 

do with the issue of whether or not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it had everything

to do, it seems to me, with the issue of State law. 

Regardless of whether they applied or misapplied a 

precedent of ours respect -- with respect to Federal 

constitutional law, it seems to me that the Illinois 

Supreme Court has to have meant it was okay so far as 

the validity of the verdict was concerned for this 

person to participate.

 MR. LEVEN: The Illinois Supreme Court found 

that the verdict was valid because they thought that the 

error was subject to harmless error review in relying on 

Neder and Martinez-Salazar

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So ultimately, there was --

there was no error under State law that needed to be 

corrected?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, there is an error in terms 

of the adjudicator, Ms. Gomez, being seated on the jury 

and under Rule 434 Petitioner had the right to a juror 

that then was not subject to a peremptory challenge. 

Gomez was -- seated on that jury.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But so far as the ultimate 

jury verdict was concerned, the Illinois Supreme Court, 

I understand it to have said, was there is no error that 

needs to be corrected under State law.

 MR. LEVEN: I don't read the opinion that 

way. I read --

correct it?

 MR. LEVEN: Because they thought that the 

error was subject to harmless error review under Federal 

law. And we would argue the two positions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You read -- in other words, 

you read the -- the -- the Illinois Supreme Court as to 

say, this is a violation of our statutes and 

constitution, a violation that would -- would entitle 

this person to have the -- the verdict set aside and a 

new trial, but because the Federal practice, applying 

Federal constitutional law, is to engage in harmless 

error analysis, we won't correct our State law error as 

a matter of State law, and -- and we will in fact apply 

a harmless error analysis that otherwise wouldn't apply 

because it's Federal, and on that ground we will let the 

verdict stand. Is that the way you read the Illinois 

Supreme Court?

 MR. LEVEN: No. The court declined to 

determine whether a constitutional right had been 

violated, but the court applied this Court's precedent 

under Martinez-Salazar and Neder, the Federal harmless 

error automatically reversal law that this Court has, 

and used that to find that the error was subject to 

harmless error review. The court did not --

could it do that if there were not some underlying 

Federal constitutional right? I say "how could it do 

that." It obvious that they did it; but what -- what 

would be the principle basis for that analysis? What 

would be the analytic framework that would lead it to 

look to the Federal decisions? This is a State issue.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, the court did not specify 

why it did so, but it did rely on Neder and 

Martinez-Salazar. And therefore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are asking you what 

the analytic justification for that course of reasoning 

is if that is indeed its course of reasoning.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, it's hard for me to 

speculate on the thinking of the Illinois Supreme Court. 

But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you have to give 

us a sustainable analytic framework if -- if we are 

going to reverse their decision.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, we argued at the Illinois 

Supreme Court level that due process was violated; but 

the Illinois Supreme Court declined to consider whether 

a constitutional right had been violated, moved 

accordingly to the question of whether or not automatic 

reversal would apply or whether the error would be

subject to harmless error review.

 But the Illinois Supreme Court did not say 

anything about whether a constitutional right had been 

violated except it declined to consider that issue, even 

though it was argued at that level by Petitioner.

 Not only do we have a constitutional basis 

for this Court to have access to its automatic reversal 

law; the fact that the court did rely on -- the Illinois 

Supreme Court relied on Neder and Martinez-Salazar gives 

this Court authority to reach the issue of whether or 

not to apply automatic reversal law under -- under its 

authority to correct --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the Illinois 

Supreme Court was assuming a Federal violation when it 

decided what the reversal rule would be. But your 

Federal violation determines -- is bottomed on the 

notion that there was an unlawful adjudicator on the 

jury. Would that reasoning apply, in regard to one of 

the earlier questions, if you have a Cook County jury 

and they had a juror from Dupage County and the law says 

no, you have got to have a local juror, and it turns out 

that they had wrongly seated such a juror? Would that 

be an unlawful adjudicator?

 MR. LEVEN: Yes, it would appear so if it --

if a State law stated that, a juror qualification

requirement that the juror who presides in Cook County 

must be a resident of the county.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I just have one more 

thought. And if it is such an unlawful adjudicator, it 

would definitely be Federal constitutional error?

 MR. LEVEN: Yes, because it would implicate 

the due process clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But would it have to 

be -- would it have to be structural error? I -- I 

don't know why you don't argue that it's structural 

error when the error is a wrongful denial of a 

peremptory challenge, because it is impossible for you 

to establish the harmfulness of error because, as 

Justice Scalia pointed out, a peremptory challenge is 

just a hunch on your part; you don't need any more. But 

if it's something like he was in Dupage County rather 

than Cook County, maybe that's something where it's fair 

to put the burden of showing harmfulness on the 

defendant.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

State under Chapman would be required to prove 

harmlessness, and I think it would be impossible to 

determine whether this -- this error would be harmful --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe that's

true. My point is that may be true with respect to a 

peremptory challenge, but it doesn't seem to me to be 

terribly difficult to say, well, he lives in Dupage 

County and not Cook County, so what's the big deal?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, under harmless error 

review, the appellate court envisions the actual jury 

that rendered the verdict, whether or not the error 

would have rendered the verdict different had it been --

had it not occurred. And in this instance, we have a --

we can't analyze it from the perspective of whether this 

jury would have rendered the same verdict absent the 

error, because this jury that rendered the verdict is 

illegally composed, is illegitimate.

 So what the Illinois Supreme Court did in 

analyzing harmless error review is it substituted its 

judgment for -- for the reviewing court, it substituted 

its judgment for the -- for the jury. The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we had an actual 

jury. It's not as though you had no jury verdict and 

then the court would say -- the court would say, we 

think that this defendant was as guilty as they come; 

but you had a jury with jurors who met all the State law 

qualifications, already made the determination of guilt. 

So that's a little different from the case where, say, a 

judge would attempt the equivalent of a directed

verdict.

 MR. LEVEN: Well, in this case I don't think 

we can look at it from the perspective that the Court 

normally looks at it from when it reviews -- adopts 

harmless error review. In the normal situation the 

Court looks at whether or not the error contributed to 

the verdict and whether or not the actual jury that 

rendered the verdict would have rendered the same 

verdict absent the error.

 But we don't have -- we can't do it from the 

perspective of the actual jury in this case, because the 

actual jury here is illegal.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the 

Constitution prohibits the State from going further than 

Batson to protect against the use of peremptory 

challenges for discriminatory purposes? Specifically, 

is there any reason why a State could not provide that 

whenever -- that a trial judge always has the authority, 

when the judge has any suspicion of discrimination, to 

ask for an explanation from counsel as to the reason, 

without having to establish -- without there having to 

be a prima facie case?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, that's our position, Your 

Honor, because what the trial judge did in this case is 

asked for a reason without having established any prima

facie case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, well, that's what 

Batson says has to be done to in order justify the 

strike. When -- but is there any reason why a State 

couldn't go further to guard against discrimination in 

the use of peremptories?

 MR. LEVEN: I apologize, Your Honor; I'm not 

sure I understand about going further than. Under 

Batson there is a three-step process, and the State must 

establish a prima facie case of discrimination before 

the judge is entitled to ask for any kind of 

explanation; and here there wasn't any kind of gender 

discrimination of any kind, according to the Illinois 

Supreme Court. Therefore, the -- the judge in this case 

was not authorized to even ask for an explanation. But 

the explanation given by defense counsel is pretty good.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But Justice Alito's 

question is could the State say as a matter of State law 

whenever the trial judge has a hunch that there might 

have been discriminatory purpose involved, may he refuse 

to allow the preemptory challenge?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, we argued that the judge 

doesn't have sua sponte authority to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I -- if the State 

explicitly gave the trial judge that authority, would

that be constitutional?

 MR. LEVEN: Well, the -- the State has the 

authority to have some regulation of preemptory 

challenge rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The authority to challenge 

preemptory challenge rights entirely? Right?

 MR. LEVEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So this is not a hard 

question.

 MR. LEVEN: Yes, the State can abolish 

peremptory challenges if it wishes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, it could 

take the much lesser step of allowing the trial judge, 

if he has any suspicion that a peremptory-challenge 

right is being used in violation of Batson, to disallow 

it. What is wrong with that.

 MR. LEVEN: In this case, though, we do have 

peremptory challenges created by the State. And, Your 

Honor, I request that I -- to reserve the remainder of 

my time.

please the Court:

 There is no due-process violation here, and 

that takes care of this case at the threshold.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, does it really? 

Suppose I agree with you that there is -- there is no 

Federal constitutional violation. But I also think that 

in assessing the consequence of a State-law violation 

the Illinois court here was looking to Federal law and 

was trying to apply the Federal law of harmless error.

 If that's the situation, would we not have 

the obligation to determine, or wouldn't we have the 

obligation to determine, whether it was properly 

applying the Federal law of harmless error? Even though 

it didn't have to, it chose to use the Federal law of 

harmless error to -- to apply to this State violation.

 MR. SCODRO: Justice Scalia, the briefs 

before the Illinois Supreme Court raise two independent 

grounds for automatic reversal by the petitioner. One 

was a pure State law for automatic reversal. The other 

was a due-process violation that would then trigger a 

Federal automatic reversal.

 What the Illinois Supreme Court did 

explicitly is to say, even if there were a due-process 

violation here, we believe as a matter of Federal law 

that would not trigger automatic reversal.

What certainly applied -- because of some of 

the Federal questions that they have suggested, what is 

implied is that if the Court had believed that as a 

matter of Illinois law there were an automatic-reversal 

rule required, that this was an unlawful juror to the 

extended so profound that it voided the judgment and 

required a new trial, under those circumstances the 

court would never have had to reach that assumption, 

much less go into any of the analysis it did.

 So here the court was faced with both 

claims, rejected both, but to reach the Federal claim 

they must first show a due-process violation. And 

that's what they failed to do here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to 

Justice Scalia's question is what?

 MR. SCODRO: The answer, Your Honor, is that 

if the court had said, we are going to lockstep our 

Federal -- or, rather, our State harmless-error analysis 

with the Federal question, Federal analysis, and 

whatever they say goes, then I would agree under those 

circumstances this Court could review that and say, you 

got that wrong.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case would 

you cite for that proposition? And you can't say 

Michigan versus Long.

were Federal? I don't know. I'm asking. Again, I

absolutely correctly, as a matter of fact.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't this Johnson versus 

Standard Oil and that sort of thing?

 MR. SCODRO: Well, I think -- I should say 

if the court -- if the -- if the Illinois court wanted 

to back away from Federal law at this point, they could 

absolutely do so. And so even if this Court were to 

say, you got it wrong federally, they could, of course, 

at that point say, no, we -- as a matter of State law, 

we are going to apply a Brack standard or a Chapman 

standard.

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that clear as a matter 

-- I don't know. Again, I'm asking. Is it clear as a 

matter of Federal law that we have lots of Federal 

trials, and in a Federal trial where a district judge 

makes an error in excusing a juror -- he shouldn't have 

excused the juror, there are many, many reasons for 

doing it, so the jury is not properly as the defense 

lawyer has the right to have it -- that that requires 

automatically a new trial? Is that clear as a matter of 

Federal law or not? And I --

MR. SCODRO: That is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know the answer.

 MR. SCODRO: It is not clear, Your Honor. 

In response to an earlier question they cited Gomez. 

And they -- and there is a line of cases including Gomez 

that are cited in their brief. Those are Federal 

supervisory authority cases in which the Court said not 

as a matter of due process interpreting the Federal 

statute -- in that case the Magistrate's act -- to 

conclude that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I am not talking about 

Magistrates, and I'm not talking about due process. I 

am asking the question, just what I asked. Now, you 

heard what I asked. It's about jurors.

JUSTICE BREYER: All right? What is the 

answer?

 MR. SCODRO: It is not -- that is not a due-

process violation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. I'm not asking 

that question. I am asking when a lawyer -- when a --

when a judge makes a mistake and excuses a juror whom he 

shouldn't have excused because he thought the juror was 

prejudiced, let's say, and he wasn't. The appeals court 

says, you are wrong about excusing him. Does under 

Federal law the defendant become entitled to a new 

trial? Not under the Constitution, under whatever you 

want.

 MR. SCODRO: I don't believe --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?

 MR. SCODRO: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You think the answer is no, 

okay.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Going back to 

Justice Scalia's question, do you think we would have 

jurisdiction of this certiorari condition if we were 

convinced there was no Federal or constitutional error; 

they were merely trying to decide whether the State 

court applied the correct constitutional standard in 

correcting what it thought was a correct federal

constitutional error?

 MR. SCODRO: I don't, Your Honor. I think 

the Federal question, if there is one presented, is 

whether or not there is a Federal due-process violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if there is none 

there, we don't have jurisdiction to answer and give an 

advisory opinion on how the Illinois Supreme Court 

should run its shop.

 MR. SCODRO: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the Illinois Supreme 

Court can happily go along blaming everything on us, so 

when it stands for reelection, it can say, well, we are 

just applying Federal law.

 MR. SCODRO: Your Honor, I think in this 

case what the Illinois Supreme Court did is they 

concluded --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but that's the 

consequence of your answer to that question. It seems 

to me there is much to be said for the disposition that 

where a State court even in resolving a State-law 

question uses a Federal principle, adverts specifically 

to Federal law and cites Federal cases, it would cover 

you.

 MR. SCODRO: Your Honor, let me be clear. 

What they did here is they had assumed the Federal

constitutional violation because they recognized that 

there was no State entitlement to a new trial under 

these circumstances. So they then said, well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You -- they did make that 

assumption, but you think the assumption is wrong. And 

if we think the assumption is wrong, you would agree 

with Justice Scalia that we can go ahead and say, well, 

you are running for reelection, so we are going to 

correct your errors on Federal law.

 MR. SCODRO: I would say, Your Honor, I 

think that if the Court were to conclude there is no 

due-process violation, it would be an artificial 

exercise to then embark on an analysis of a -- harmless 

errors.

 This Court has said time and again that 

there is a close link between the alleged due-process or 

Sixth Amendment violation and the manner in which the 

due process -- the harmless-error analysis is conducted.

 In Gonzales/Lopez that was the gist of much 

of the debate between the majority of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would certainly agree 

that if the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court used 

the Federal harmless-error rule was because it was 

assuming a Federal constitutional violation, once we 

reject that assumption, the whole thing drops out. But

is that entirely clear from the opinion?

 MR. SCODRO: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clear that the 

Illinois Supreme Court wouldn't have used the same test 

under simply Illinois law?

 MR. SCODRO: Well, two points, Your Honor. 

First, in context with the briefs which independently 

sought both State and Federal remand and page 171 of the 

joint appendix where the court makes clear that we are 

simply not going to resolve the question of whether 

there is a Federal due-process violation, I think in 

context it does become clear what the court has done 

here is it certainly concluded there is not a State 

right.

 So it proceeded to say, well, what if there 

is a Federal due-process entitlement? If that is the 

case, let's proceed and decide, well, it's harmless 

anyway. We don't need to then reverse this conviction.

 Now, I will say that if the Court harbors 

concerns -- if the Court were to conclude there is no 

due-process violation here, but harbors concerns that 

the Illinois Supreme Court feels itself duty bound to 

follow this Court's jurisprudence on the question of 

harmlessness, then at that point the Court could simply 

make a due-process ruling and remand to allow the

Illinois Supreme Court to make clear what I think is 

already clear -- but to make crystal clear that they 

would apply a -- a harmless-error standard to this sort 

-- this sort of declaration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is the -- the 

only reason the Illinois Supreme Court found: That 

there was no error of constitutional dimension, meaning 

Federal constitutional dimension. The only reason it --

it found that is because it found that the error was 

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

 MR. SCODRO: Your Honor, I think that what 

they have done is they just put the statement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is the cart before the 

horse.

 MR. SCODRO: They have run the analysis, and 

what they have done, Your Honor, is said, look, any 

error here of constitutional dimension would be 

harmless. Therefore, we inform the reader on page 171 

we simply haven't reached the question. Please don't 

read the foregoing analysis to suggest that we have made 

a prior conclusion that there is indeed a due-process 

violation here.

 Indeed, the court suggests there probably 

isn't by early arguments that you are pointing out that 

this Court has long held since -- since Hilt in 1919 has

long held that there is no due-process entitlement to a 

peremptory challenge. So I think in context it is quite 

clear that what the Court has done is to say, there is 

nothing in here for you under Illinois law. Under 

Federal law, even if there were a due-process violation, 

it is simply not -- it is simply harmless error.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- then you would 

have no objection to a remand that says, Illinois 

Supreme Court, you can't blame it on Federal law. It's 

up to you as a matter of State law. And now answer the 

question that you didn't answer; that is, what is the 

consequence under State law of an erroneous denial of a 

peremptory? You would have no objection to such a 

remand?

 MR. SCODRO: Your Honor, we would have no 

objection to that procedure, but I would caution that it 

seems unnecessary in light of the fact that the parties 

so sought relief under both State and Federal law and 

the fact that the supreme court -- the Illinois Supreme 

Court concludes it doesn't need to reach -- the way it 

analyzes the -- the constitutional question.

 I think that -- and this underlying 

assumption that judges understand, I think it's fair to 

assume that the Illinois justices understood they could 

go further as a matter of State law than Federal, but

not -- they couldn't provide fewer protections.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: For the reasons that have 

been discussed, it may be that we won't get to the 

merits of the Petitioner's argument, but assuming we do, 

the Petitioner talks about the -- I don't have -- the 

"unlawfully constituted jury." Is -- is -- what is the 

extinction distinction between the hypothetical case of 

the juror who isn't a resident of the county and the 

State says you have to be a resident of the county --

what is the distinction between that and, say, a 

non-Article III judge sitting on a court of appeals 

panel? Why is one structural and the other not?

 MR. SCODRO: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this would -- this 

would be a little different than the juror who might be 

biased or might not be biased, because this goes to a 

hard qualification. It's just a hypothetical in the 

case, but it's a -- it's a linchpin to the Petitioner's 

argument.

 MR. SCODRO: I should begin by saying that 

the Gomez and Wingo and Nguyen decisions and others they 

cite in that line for the non-Article III judge 

proposition are themselves not due process decisions, 

but are conclusions as a matter of State -- of Federal 

law, rather, the idea being that Congress simply hadn't

delegated the authority properly in those cases. They 

are not due process cases.

 But if one were to assume that those would 

also be due process violations, to have a non-Article II 

judge sit, I would distinguish those cases at that point 

hypothetically by saying there is a profound, profound 

difference between someone who lacks any and all mantle 

of state authority, on the one hand, and a juror who is 

properly sworn and who satisfies all the statutory 

requirements for sitting as a matter of Illinois law.

 And I should note, in the reply brief 

there's a point at which they contend --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but the 

hypothetical is it doesn't -- the juror doesn't satisfy 

the requirement because he or she is from the wrong 

county.

 MR. SCODRO: Again, Your Honor, the 

fundamental -- the lodestar analysis here in the due 

process appeal -- in Buford, the Court said it did not 

define it with precision, but it has always been 

fundamental fairness, a community sense of fair play and 

decency.

 It seems to me that, as you move into a 

judge with absolutely no mantle of State authority or --

and -- whatsoever, versus a juror who is properly sworn,

properly instructed, but who nevertheless sits from a 

different neighboring jurisdiction -- and I should note 

that in Cook County there are three jury jurisdictions, 

so the errors could be legion just within Cook County in 

terms of being from the wrong part of the county. It 

seems to me that that sort of error simply doesn't come 

anywhere close to the fundamental fairness --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- but how do 

you -- there is no way to tell. I mean, presumably the 

State has a reason for restricting the jury pool to the 

neighborhood, and that type of limitation does go back 

to Blackstone, the vicinage of the crime. So -- and the 

there's no way to tell. There's no way to tell whether 

the juror from DuPage County is going to have a 

different view of a different perspective or affected it 

in a -- or that it affected the verdict in a particular 

case.

 MR. SCODRO: This is true, Your Honor, but 

in those contexts, the very State law that has created 

those divisions, for whatever reason they have seen fit 

to do so, is the proper authority to conclude whether or 

not the error is so profound by having that person sit 

that it ought not be a violation of due process -- that 

it ought to be a void judgment. That's how these 

Federal cases, Gomez and others --

JUSTICE BREYER: Did -- that's exactly what 

I can't figure out.  I'm trying -- forget due process. 

All right? Keep that out of your mind. We have 

approximately 50 State jurisdictions, the District of 

Columbia, and a bunch of Federal jurisdictions. All 

right? In those jurisdictions, to your knowledge -- you 

may not know this, you may not have looked it up -- but 

what happens in the situation where a juror -- where a 

juror should have been excused? I guess there's a new 

trial. The juror should have been excused, but wasn't. 

I guess there's a new trial normally; is that right?

 MR. SCODRO: If the juror is biased, yes, 

but not if the juror is unbiased --

JUSTICE BREYER: If the juror is biased. 

Yes. Okay.

 Now suppose it's the defendant who wanted 

the juror and he was wrongly excused. All right? So 

that's what the appeals court holds. What's the rule? 

Again, do they go back and look and see if it's biased? 

If the juror -- if the defendant didn't get the juror he 

wanted, somebody else took his place, do they look to 

see if that person was biased? And if not, say, too 

bad, defendant, you may have been right, but you lost 

the jury that you want, no remedy? What happens?

don't believe -- I don't have cases to cite on that --

but I don't believe there would be a remedy because this 

Court has said time and again that the preemptory right 

and those surrounding it do not create a right to any 

particular jury.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, at least in the case of 

where he failed to get a preemptory, whether it's 

Federal or whether it's State, the Federal law and most 

State law is: You lost your right to a preemptory, one 

of them. You should have had it, but you are out of 

luck, if -- if the juror who replaced the replacement, 

the juror who was there, you know, who otherwise 

wouldn't have been is a fair juror.

 MR. SCODRO: Your Honor, I thought you were 

asking what happens if a particular juror the defendant 

wanted did not sit, and under those circumstances, I 

would say that because this Court has held --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the last 

hypothetical?

 MR. SCODRO: If you question -- that 

indicates really the split in this case, Your Honor, and 

the indirect split that was -- all of which was laid out 

in the cert petition. There is -- there is 

disagreement, but we would note that much of the

footnote 4 with its remarks about Swain. Some of it is 

Federal, and therefore you don't have the same concern 

about a threshold due process violation.

 I will say, to answer your original question 

as well about jurors who should not have sat but are not 

deemed biased, Illinois certainly has a history of cases 

to that effect, and the court -- the Illinois court has 

handled them as a matter of Illinois law. The case in 

1986, an alien sat, and the court concluded there was no 

timely objection that was part of this analysis, but it 

certainly was not a "nullity," in the court's words, 

under those circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was that case?

 MR. SCODRO: This is not cited in the 

briefs, so I'm only citing it in response to a question. 

It's a case called Chase from the Illinois Supreme Court 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, Illinois --

MR. SCODRO: -- in 1886. And it's a case in 

which an alien sat on the jury, and there was, I 

believe, as part of the court's analysis a failure to 

make a contemporaneous objection, but they said it was 

not a "nullity," to use the court's words, to seat this 

improper juror and, again, made as a determination of 

Illinois law, just as the question here as to what

remedy should be in effect is purely a question of 

Illinois law.

 Again, they have simply failed to establish 

a due process violation.  This Court has said time and 

again there is no due process entitlement to peremptory 

challenges. Much of what we accept as given these days 

depends, hinges, upon that presumption, including the 

Baston line, as the concurrence in Miller-El pointed out 

in 2005, numerous restrictions on peremptories that have 

been upheld since the 19th century, which are laid out 

in the government's brief. And then, indeed, the 

remarkable variety amongst States, which has been 

touched upon today, where States -- State by State --

provide very different numbers of peremptory challenges, 

and they provide very different limits thereon as well.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the judge who sat on a 

State trial was not authorized under State law to hear 

that particular matter, would that be a due process 

violation?

 MR. SCODRO: I think the answer to that is 

no, Your Honor. And indeed, as we point out in our 

brief, Cook County has several substantive divisions, so 

that, for example, a criminal law division judge is not 

authorized to sit on a family law matter, for example. 

And yet Illinois law has made clear that if there's an

error, if you go to the wrong court and that is unlikely 

to happen in the scenario I put forth, but it could 

easily happen between law and chancery for example, and 

does indeed happen. If that were be the case, the --

any error in going to the wrong court and having the 

wrong court resolve your issue does not void the 

judgment as a matter of law. And I certainly don't 

think that would implicate due process concerns.

 If the Court has no further questions, we 

would ask that you affirm the judgment below.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Federal law does not require automatic 

reversal of a conviction because the denial of a 

peremptory challenge at most violated only his State law 

rights. And even if his Federal constitutional rights 

had been violated, harmless error review would apply. 

The Constitution does not give criminal defendants the 

right to peremptory challenges; therefore, a -- the

right of a State defendant like Petitioner to exercise 

peremptory challenges derives entirely from State law, 

and when erroneous denial of a preemptory challenge 

deprives him only of State law right, and when the State 

law rights alone have been violated, State law not 

federal law dictates whether harmless error review 

applies. The violation of a State law right doesn't 

rise to a due process -- federal due process violation 

unless it deprives the defendant of a fair trial.

 And this Court has repeatedly held 

that States can withhold preemptory challenges entirely 

without impairing the right to an impartial jury or a 

fair trial. It, therefore, follows that the erroneous 

denial of a single preemptory challenge does not render 

a trial fundamentally unfair.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's not a single 

challenge. What if, let's say, each side has six, and 

the trial judge just arbitrarily refuses to allow a 

defendant to exercise any preemptory challenge, but the 

jury -- the jury is ultimately selected, there is no 

reason to think it's not a fair jury?

 MR. ROBERTS: We'd still thing that that 

would not be a federal constitutional violation, and 

even if it were some kind of a federal violation, that 

it would be subject to review for harmlessness. If the

trial court could violate due process, if its actions so 

skewed the balance of power over the selection of the 

jury in favor of the government that it resulted in a 

fundamentally unfair trial, but even the denial of 

multiple preemptory challenges wouldn't rise to that 

level.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the Illinois had a 

statute that the prosecution gets 10 peremptories and 

the defendants get one, would that raise a federal 

question?

 MR. ROBERTS: The question there would be 

whether that so skewed -- the test that I said before. 

I think the question would be that that's so skewed 

about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the answer pretty 

clear that that would be unfair.

 MR. ROBERTS: I don't -- I don't think that 

the answer is clear at all. The State might rationally 

conclude that because the government has to prove its 

case beyond a reasonable doubt, because it has to 

convince the jurors unanimously to rule in its favor and 

because it has no right to appeal an unfavorable 

determination by the jury, that the prosecution should 

be entitled to more preemptory challenges. Of course, 

this case doesn't --

 MR. ROBERTS: It's unlikely to, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The reason it's unlikely 

is it is so clearly unconstitutional.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we don't think it's 

unconstitutional at all, Your Honor, but it is contrary 

to what the common practice and the way things have been 

approached in both the federal and State court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, if you do 

get to harmless error, how do you deal with the question 

that was raised by the Chief Justice, that is, there is 

no way in the world that you can tell whether this was 

harmless or not? You would have to imagine another 

juror being on the panel, that juror could have swung 

the case, could have had no influence, there is just no 

way of knowing what would happen.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that rests on 

the mistaken premise that harmless error now just turns 

on the predilections of the particular decisionmaker or 

on speculation about what one particular juror would 

have done differently than another. In fact, harmless 

error -- the harmless error inquiry looks at the 

hypothetical objective rational juror. And so, that's

what you look at and the difference between --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but maybe --

maybe you have an -- you know, the irrational juror. 

You know, the holdout is not going to convict for any 

reason.

 MR. ROBERTS: But -- but that is not an 

appropriate part of -- of a harmless error analysis just 

like the fact that the jury might engage in 

nullification is an appropriate part of the harmless 

element.

 If -- in Strickland, which is the best case, 

I think, to explain how that is irrelevant to the 

inquiry, even though it's part of the constitutional 

there -- analysis there, the Court very clearly explains 

that you don't look at the particular decisionmaker, you 

don't speculate about nullification and about arbitrary 

action and the like, it sort of transferable over. 

That's just not an appropriate part -- analysis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even assuming 

your premise, isn't it pretty difficult to know what a 

rational juror would have done?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we think that the 

correct inquiry in this circumstance, given the nature 

of the right, is to ask whether the error resulted in 

the seating of a juror that was not impartial. And then

you look at the record in the case, the voir dire 

record, and make that determination, and the government 

bears the -- bears the burden of proof.

 So we don't think that that would be 

difficult to do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that is almost the 

same, at least in some states, as getting a new trial 

anyway. If we find out after the fact that the jury was 

biased, and in some States that's a reason for a new 

trial in the discretion of the trial court, anyway.

 MR. ROBERTS: That -- that -- that could be, 

but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The point is you are not 

giving much substance to the rule.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think we are 

respecting its fundamental -- its fundamental purpose, 

Your Honor, which is to assist to help achieve the goal 

of selecting an impartial juror.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the law there? 

That's what I am trying to get at. I mean, my initial 

instinct would be that if a defendant doesn't get the 

jury that the law entitles him to, that's an error. And 

you normally would think it was harmful, because you 

can't say, in honesty, it was harmless, it's the jury 

that's supposed to decide. I suspect it would work out

that way. I have never looked into it. How has it 

worked out?

 MR. ROBERTS: Generally for errors like the 

error you described before, where the judge 

erroneously -- mistakenly excuses a juror in the belief 

that the juror is disqualified for cause, where the 

judge mistakenly substitutes a qualified alternate for 

one of the jurors, or the judge places one alternate on 

the jury instead of another, the courts have generally 

looked at that for harmlessness and has not required 

automatic reversal.

 Indeed, even in the case of jurors that 

don't satisfy --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So in other 

words, they have often said you don't get a new trial?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. And even in the case of 

jurors that don't meet the statutory requirements in the 

federal courts of appeals have held that unless a biased 

juror sits, a new trial is not required.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But don't some of those 

courts, rather than focusing on the qualifications of 

the particular juror, look to the -- how close the case 

was?

MR. ROBERTS: The harmless error analysis, 

there are sort of a lot of different scenarios of types 

of violations, and the standard that they use is not 

clear in all of them. In the ones that -- the cases 

that I found that involve the seating of jurors that 

don't meet the federal statutory requirements, usually 

they involve felons that didn't reveal that they were 

felons, the courts have looked to the biased juror 

standard.

 Some courts have done that, others have 

looked to whether it affects the verdict. They haven't 

been exactly clear how you determine that, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's because there 

is no way to tell.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I think that --

that even if you had a standard that said to look to 

whether there was an effect on the verdict, you can tell 

precisely the way the Illinois Supreme Court applied 

Neder here, if no rational jury could have acquitted, 

then you know the substitution of one rational, 

impartial juror for another didn't have an effect on the 

outcome. And that doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment 

to do that, Your Honor, because the underlying right --

the underlying error doesn't violate the Sixth 

Amendment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But a jury is a 

fundamental protection of individual liberty, and in 

your analysis you are having a judge decide what the 

jury would --

MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. As 

Justice Ginsburg pointed out before, the Petitioner here 

got a determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 

on every element of the offense from a fair and 

impartial jury that was properly instructed. So we are 

not having a judge substitute that at all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The judge is making 

a determination that a juror that should have been 

sitting would act like the juror who was sitting 

instead.

 MR. ROBERTS: That is true. But the Sixth 

Amendment doesn't give the defendant the right to any 

particular jury, it doesn't give the defendant the right 

to a jury that has been selected in compliance with 

every jot and frivolous State law. And therefore, if 

the underlying error, as the underlying error here where 

you get a denial of preemptory, where a juror is seated 

that even though that violated state law, assumably 

here, that -- that that doesn't amount to a Sixth 

Amendment violation.

review can't violate his Sixth Amendment rights. He 

already got them. And so it can be done and it doesn't 

violate the Sixth Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are any number of 

alternatives that we can adopt in ruling for your 

position. If we were to rule for your position, what do 

you think is the most straightforward rationale?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- we would obviously 

like to have sort of alternative rulings that do both, 

but I think the most logical way to approach the case is 

to decide whether there was a violation of the 

Constitution here, and because there wasn't one, to say 

that State law governs the harmless error analysis.

As to the Sixth Amendment issue, the 

Illinois Supreme Court did act inconsistently with the 

Sixth Amendment as far as its manner of conducting 

harmless error review, because harmless error review is 

impossible to conduct in this situation, because in 

order to do that, we would have to examine what the 

particular jury would have done had it not been for the 

error; and the particular jury in this case must be out, 

because there the particular jury, the panel as a whole, 

is illegally constituted, and the -- and it's impossible 

to conduct your harmless error analysis.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that any harder than 

harmless error analysis that is conducted all the time? 

For example evidence is erroneously excluded from the 

trial, and you ask was that a harmless error? But you 

have to -- there has to be speculation about how this 

jury would have received the additional evidence. What 

-- what's the difference?

 MR. LEVEN: Because in that situation, we 

are looking at what the particular jury, how a 

particular jury in that case would have resolved the 

matter had the erroneously admitted evidence not been 

admitted.

no inside information about the dynamics of that

particular jury. It's just -- it's deciding what a 

rational jury would do, what a -- what a standard jury 

would do.

 MR. LEVEN: Whether that particular jury 

would have reached the same verdict, which we can't do 

in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But how does the Court 

know anything particular about the jury when it conducts 

that harmless error analysis? It doesn't.

 MR. LEVEN: It probably could look at the 

record as a whole to determine whether or not the -- the 

particular jury that rendered the verdict would have 

done the same thing had the erroneously admitted 

evidence not -- not been -- not been introduced.

 And in this case, we have a very different 

situation. We have an illegal adjudicator, and we can't 

determine whether that adjudicator would have resolved 

the case differently had it not been -- it's impossible 

to assess because of the -- the particular adjudicator
