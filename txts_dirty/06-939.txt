 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 06-939, Chamber of Commerce versus Brown.

 Mr. Goldsmith.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 In AB 1889, California defunded employer 

speech about union organizing because the State's labor 

policy is that such speech interferes with employee free 

choice. The Federal policy is that employer speech 

enhances employee free choice. California's labor 

policy is designed to discourage exactly what the NLRA 

promotes. The fact that California implemented its 

labor policy as an exercise of its spending authority is 

irrelevant under Gould. If the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say the labor 

policy promotes it? It certainly permits it, but 

what -- what --

MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that if you look at the exceptions to the policy, in 

particular those that allow State funds to be spent for 

things that clearly facilitate union organizing, for

example, that it's not prohibited under AB --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about the 

-- the Federal policy. You say the Federal policy 

promotes this employer speech. Why do you say it 

promotes it? It clearly permits it. It clearly does 

not discourage it, but is that the same as promoting it?

 MR. GOLDSMITH: I think -- I think it is, 

Your Honor. I think that the cases of this Court and 

the cases of the NLRB have made clear that free, open, 

robust debate is important on all matters having to do 

with the union/employer relationship. That was 

certainly what the Court noted in Linn.

 The fact that employer speech is, I think, 

absolutely critical to an employee being well-enough 

informed to make an informed judgment about whether to 

say yes or no to a union, further underscores the point.

 A union election or any situation involving 

a contest of any sort between a union and an employer is 

something on which both parties should have the right to 

speak, and to speak in a noncoercive way, and I think 

that clearly the National Labor Relations Act promotes 

that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did Congress in 

several statutes have a provision from which California 

copied when it enacted this measure? In several

statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will 

go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use 

any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter 

union organizing.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Your Honor, those are three 

statutes that the court below and Respondents rely on 

heavily. Those statutes, first of all, I don't think in 

any way reflect the meaning or the sense of Congress 

that employer speech is to be inhibited in connection 

with union organizing. Those in no way, I think, 

reflect the overall intent of Congress. More ever, 

nothing in those statutes, in any way, undercuts the 

basic principles of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they run against that 

principle because they say at least under these programs 

-- I think there were more than three. Wasn't Medicare 

MR. GOLDSMITH: Medicare was the fourth, I 

believe. It was a regulation not a statute. But 

certainly in doing that, Congress didn't in any way 

modify the NLRA. There's nothing in the legislative 

history of those statutes that suggests that this 

Court's principles, as laid down in Machinists and 

Garmon, were in any way to be inhibited. And, moreover, 

what Congress can do certainly doesn't mean that the

States have the same right. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Those -- those grantees 

would be subject to the NLRA. So, as to them, it is 

modified.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, it's not modified in 

the same way that AB 1889 modifies it, Your Honor. 

First of all, under those statutes there is no 

requirement that funds be segregated. There is no 

possibility of litigation, treble damages to follow. 

There is no possibility of attorneys' fees to the 

prevailing party. So those statutes are, I think, are 

really unique and don't in any way change the basic 

principle that I think all labor lawyers would agree, 

and that is that, under the National Labor Relations 

Act, all parties to a union election or any issue 

between a union and an employer have the right to speak 

in a noncoercive way.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Say: Speak, go ahead, 

speak, speak. Just not on our nickel.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, I think that's clearly 

what they say, but it's not that simple given the way 

this statute operates, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And they also say -- by the 

way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind -- you 

may be right about it being too much of an

administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but 

they've made major concessions here, and they say that's 

a matter to be worked out on remand.  And it may be that 

they have to be very careful about inhibiting your 

speech.

 So let's go back over those administrative 

provisions one by one. They are suggesting to us, as I 

read it, don't do that now.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: If I may respond to both 

questions, Your Honor. First of all the notion that one 

can use your own money, to use the vernacular, and use 

it to speak, doesn't answer the most basic question that 

the statute presents, and that is that whether you can 

or you can't -- and I'll get to that in a moment -- the 

fact is that California has regulated, used its spending 

power to make labor policy, something that this Court 

has made clear, in Gould and various other cases, it 

cannot do. But even getting past that, which I think is 

the end of the case, there are certain employers, 

certain Petitioners here who are a hundred percent 

funded by the State. They have no ability, as a result 

-- when I say "funded by the State" I mean they depend 

for their income on State programs, let's say -- they 

have no ability, none, to speak to employees.

MR. GOLDSMITH: The State has effectively --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the 

State's fault.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, the State's argument 

to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's a free-market 

choice. They can either do business in California or 

not. And I would refer the Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they can do 

business with other entities beside the State.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: They can, Your Honor, that's 

true, but that doesn't answer the question because for 

those that -- because of the service that they provide, 

such as under Medi-Cal, they have chosen to be in 

business with the State. They are being forced to make 

an election between doing business with the State or 

giving up an NLRA-protected right. That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you have -- you have a 

park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand 

there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State 

pays for everything. The State pays for everything. 

And it happens that, in the grant, they have no place 

for talking about the union. You're saying they are 

required to add to the legislation, a special grant, so 

that the employer can speak of the union?

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, a grant presents a

slightly different problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? Because they 

say here we are talking about 100 percent money that 

comes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is 

use that money for the State purposes, and those 

purposes do not include talking one way or the other 

about the union.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, that may be the case 

for a particular program or a particular grant, but 

that's not what AB 1889 does, Your Honor. AB 1889 

affects on an across-the-board basis every single 

contractor, every single employer doing business with 

the State of California. So if -- if the State could 

show that it were making that -- it was making that 

policy decision for some fiscal purpose, then there 

might be an argument. But that's concededly not the 

case here, whereas --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you -- you are 

bringing a facial challenge, and I thought that you must 

show, not that the State must show, and the State -- the 

simple argument is look we are paying for certain 

things, and we want to get what we paid for. There are 

a lot of other things that we could have paid for, but 

we -- we want to get, say, a training program for 

elementary schoolteachers. And that has nothing to do

with union organizing. We don't want to pay for union 

organizing.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: That might be an argument 

that the State could advance credibly if in fact this 

statute had anything to do with saving money. It 

doesn't. The court below unanimously concluded that 

this was not anything that had anything to do with the 

fiscal issues; it had solely to do with making labor 

policy. And as far as a facial challenge is concerned, 

Your Honor, the fact is that this statute was applied to 

the Petitioners. The Petitioners --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the lower court 

say it has nothing to do with the State getting what it 

is paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want 

to pay for?

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, Your Honor, that's, of 

course, my vernacular for --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That in --

MR. GOLDSMITH: -- what the court said, but 

what the court did say was that the State passed --

legislature passed and the governor signed AB 1889 

solely for labor policy purposes, and that's clear from 

the preamble to the statute. The preamble to the 

statute says, it is the policy of the State of 

California -- in so many words -- that employer speech

interferes with employee free choice. There's nothing 

in the record. There's no attempt at all to suggest 

that anything achieved by 1889 saves the State a dime. 

That's an argument --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would come out --

it would come out differently if the statute has said, 

we want to get what we pay for and we don't -- we choose 

not to pay for labor relations?

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, if the State could 

establish that it was acting as a proprietor, within 

meaning of this Court's decision in Boston Harbor, and 

establish as a proprietor that it was doing something to 

advance a fiscal purpose, then perhaps a statute so 

worded would survive the pre-emption challenge. But 

that is clearly not what happened here. There's no 

evidence that that happened, and that is not the purpose 

or the effect of AB 1889.

 And as to the facial challenge issue, if I 

could answer both Justice Breyer and Your Honor, the 

fact is that this statute was applied to the 

Petitioners. The Petitioners went into district court 

and they said, this applies to us, it's burden some for 

us to do -- to do what the statute purports to require 

us to do. The district court granted an injunction and 

so on.

But whether it's a facial challenge or 

as-applied challenge I think really makes no difference 

here. The Ninth Circuit found that AB 1889 was not 

pre-empted as a matter of law. Our position is that AB 

1889 is pre-empted as a matter of law. The purpose and 

effect are clear. Sending this back to remand to 

develop facts or trying to sort this out and whether 

it's a facial or as-applied challenge really doesn't 

change the basic fact that the court below, as I said, 

decided this as a matter of law and NLRA pre-emption 

generally raises purely legal issues.

 The legal issue is whether or not the 

Federal scheme has been interfered with, and I think 

that any fair reading of this statute makes it 

abundantly clear that that's exactly what happened. 

California was very open about it. The preamble says 

precisely that: We believe that employer speech 

interferes with employee free choice. So that they 

passed a statute that is designed to and does severely 

inhibit an employer's ability to speak. That's what 

they wanted to do; that's what they did; and that 

interferes with the Federal policy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they say something 

different from what Congress said in those three or four 

statutes that were mentioned earlier?

MR. GOLDSMITH: In terms of using the words 

assist, promote and deter, those words appear in those 

statutes in that Medicare regulation, or statute, 

component of the Medicare statute, and those appear also 

in, in AB 1899.

 But, you know, again, Your Honor, from my 

perspective I think, you know, it's clear that nothing 

in those statutes changed the fundamental policy that 

speech, free speech, for both employers and for unions 

is something to be encouraged in the context of a union 

organizing drive for a number of reasons, not the least 

of which employees are allowed and entitled to hear both 

sides of the picture before being put in the position 

where they have to make a choice. California believes 

that employer speech is a bad thing. AB 1899 is a 

reflection of that. They believe it's bad because it 

interferes with employee free choice.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If you take the example of a 

nursing home that participates in the Medi-Cal program, 

what does this require? They have to segregate the 

funds that they get from the State, and they can't use 

-- is it the case they can't use any of those funds for 

union-related speech or just the portion that does not 

represent profits?

 MR. GOLDSMITH: They can't use any of those

funds. The notion that profits -- the statute doesn't 

say a word about profits, and, of course, if the statute 

were to say something about profits, it would make 

segregation of accounts problem in the statute even 

worse than it already is.

 But what a nursing home has to do is to 

track every single possible circumstance under which an 

employee of the nursing home engaged in speech that was 

designed to assist -- which don't happen very often, 

presumably -- promote or deter union organizing.

 And let me try to bring it down to what 

really happens in the union organizing campaign. This 

is, by and large, a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour a day 

operation. There are any number of encounters during 

the course of the union organizing drive that the 

employer responsible for complying with AB 1899 may 

never even know about.

 So, for example, if an employee goes to his 

supervisor and says union X is trying to organize 

nursing home, what do you know about union X? And the 

supervisor says, well, the only thing I know about union 

X is they used to represent the nursing home across the 

street, and then that nursing home is now closed.

 Now, that may be a purely factual statement, 

purely true statement. That's certainly what the

employer would argue. What the union might argue is 

that no, no. You have to put that in context, and that 

was a statement designed to deter the employee from 

voting for union X.

 Now, if the employer guesses wrong on that 

issue, that is the employer says, well, this is factual, 

it's not something designed to deter union organizing, 

he is subject under the statute to litigation for not 

having segregated -- and I don't know what he would 

really segregate; the statute is unclear. Do you 

segregate the time? Do you account for the time that 

the employer spent talking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if he guesses right, 

he is subject to the litigation.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You said if he guesses 

wrong, he is subject to litigation. He is subject to 

the litigation even if he guesses right.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: That's correct, Your Honor, 

and unlike the prevailing party as the defendant, or the 

prevailing party will of course -- the prevailing 

plaintiff and the prevailing intervenors will recover 

reasonable costs of attorney's fees, the prevailing 

defendant under this statute does not. There is --

there is no question that it's even impossible for an

employer under the situation that I described to 

effectively account for that encounter that I describe 

between an employer and employee.

 Do you take the 30 seconds that it took and 

allocate 30 seconds of the salary? Do you take the 

overtime for the week that the supervisor might have 

worked? There is really no way that the statute allows 

for that to happen, and it I think underscores the 

degree to which this statute interferes dramatically 

with NLRA protected rights.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

dividing labor and management. State laws that restrict 

speech regarding unionization frustrate that fundamental 

national policy and are therefore pre-empted, as this 

Court held in Linn.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

spending clause question? You -- the Federal Government 

has a lot of programs where they use their own money and 

they come with a lot of conditions, and you -- your 

office frequently argues that those are justified under 

the spending clause. Why isn't what California is doing 

here similarly justified?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, first of all, obviously, 

Your Honor, the National Labor Relations Act does not 

constrain Congress' ability to impose particular 

restrictions. It does constrain the State's ability to 

use their spending power to regulate, as this Court held 

in Gould and in Nash.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we tell 

whether they are using their spending power to regulate 

as opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done 

with State funds?

 MR. HUNGAR: The Court has identified 

several factors that it has used to distinguish 

regulatory from proprietary conduct, first and foremost, 

as this Court said in Boston Harbor. It looks to

whether the State is acting in order to effectuate 

policy or is instead seeking to achieve cost savings 

program efficiency and the like. In addition, the Court 

looks to whether the measure --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On a case like Rust 

versus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to 

promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary 

capacity?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, of course, that question 

did not come up in Rust against Sullivan because there 

was in a NLRA pre-emption issue there, and the question 

that the State was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about 

spending power versus regulatory power in general.

 MR. HUNGAR: But what the Court did say in 

Rust is that the government has a legitimate policy 

interest in advancing its preference for life, in that 

case, that the Congress was entitled to advance. The 

problem here is that the policy interest that the State 

is advancing, a policy interest that says employer 

speech regarding unionization interferes with employee 

free choice, is a policy that is directly contrary to 

the Federal policy under the Act as Congress and the 

board have repeatedly recognized, and that this Court 

has repeatedly recognized.

So, there is no legitimate interest 

supporting what the State is doing here, it's an 

interest directly contrary to Federal policy, unlike in 

Rust and other First Amendment cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, give me an 

example of a spending clause provision that would be 

acceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in 

general, because you would say, well, that's not trying 

to implement a policy at all.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, if the -- one of the 

amicus briefs in this case points to a rule that the 

State has adopted recently apparently in the Medi-Cal 

context, which says that they will only reimburse 

administrative costs of hospitals up to the 50th 

percentile of costs incurred by similar facilities.

 That's obviously not attempting to regulate 

any particular labor speech or any other type of 

conduct. It's simply saying we are only going to 

regulate this category, this broad general category of 

costs to a certain level. It's not targeted at a 

specific category of disfavored speech because the State 

disfavors that speech. It's simply attempting to save 

money.

 That clearly would not be pre-empted, even 

though it might have a disproportionate impact on a

particular hospital that's engaged in a costly --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would your answer be the 

same if -- if -- and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps, 

that a magic administrative scheme were invented so that 

there was no administrative problem, we could identify 

with the greatest of ease each penny that came from a 

State and which did not? And then the State said, you 

know, we do have a policy here. We actually favor labor 

unions in our State, and some other State might have a 

different policy. But we think it best that the State 

officials involved when their company -- when their 

department is being organized, to say nothing. We think 

it best that the employers that we pay a hundred percent 

to, given their -- their strong funding by the State, 

that they got to find some money elsewhere, and those we 

pay 50 percent to better use the private money, not use 

our money.

 Now, no administrative burden whatsoever, 

but that's the policy. Now, is there some rule or 

statute that would make that unlawful or pre-empted that 

policy?

 MR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer, I think -- I'm 

assuming in your hypothetical that this hypothetical 

law, in addition to posing no administrative burdens 

also doesn't have the strict liability of treble

damages.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, on all these things 

which I think they are asking us on the other side to 

leave for another day, none of them exist. They all 

work perfectly. It's only the magic system has been 

developed to, without any extraneous burden, segregate 

the State money from the non-State money. And the only 

rule is don't use the State money when you speak. 

That's the only rule.

 MR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, other states 

have exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work 

states. They give you extra State money. So -- but one 

State has this rule and --

MR. HUNGAR: Obviously that would be a very 

different case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, well, if it's a very 

different case, then why aren't they right to say this 

is a facial challenge, leave that very different case 

which raises all the issues to be worked out when we 

discover whether this is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say it's a very 

different case Mr. Hungar? I don't really understand 

it.

the sense that in this case it's -- from every one of 

the factors that this Court has looked to, to determine 

regulatory versus proprietary -- and this case cuts 

fairly in favor of the conclusion of the unanimous court 

of appeals, all 15 judges, that this is regulatory. 

It's punitive; it's government-wide; it's not program-

or contract-specific; it's not the kind of conduct that 

private entities engage in. All of the factors -- and 

it's expressly as well as obviously, in effect, intended 

to disfavor a particular kind of speech that Congress 

favors.

 So everything cuts in favor of it being 

regulatory; whereas, in your hypothetical, most of those 

considerations would not. However, I think it's still 

the case that in that hypothetical, what the State is 

doing is regulating -- for labor policy reasons it's 

disfavoring a particular type of speech. The State does 

not have any obligation under the Act to fund 

unionization speech, but what it can't do under the Act 

is deny a government benefit because of a -- a labor 

policy. That's what this Court held in Nash.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is my right-to-work example 

equally -- equally pre-empted?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, I think it would be. But,

JUSTICE BREYER: So, they could not say in 

Utah, to take a State at random, the -- here we have 

government grants and there's overhead, and we would 

like you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're 

certainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as 

much as you want, should there be an organizing 

campaign. Don't worry about spending the government 

part. Can they do that? You say no, they couldn't?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well -- I took your -- the Utah 

example to be one where the State was somehow mandating 

this particular expenditure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No.

 MR. HUNGAR: If the State is simply -- is 

not taking -- is taking a hands-off approach, it's hard 

to characterize it as regulation. But what this Court 

held in Nash, what this Court held in Gould, what this 

Court held in Livadas is, when the State is denying 

benefits -- even though there might be plenty of 

legitimate reasons that might enable it to deny benefits 

-- if it's denying benefits for the purpose of advancing 

labor policy in an area where Congress has said there is 

to be no regulation, that's pre-empted, and that's 

doubly pre-empted here where the labor policy that the 

State is advancing is directly contrary to the Federal 

labor policy that Congress and the Board have

enunciated.

 And with respect to the facial versus 

as-applied or the suggestion that somehow because you 

might be able to craft a statute that would achieve some 

of the effects of this statute in a nonpre-empted way, 

that doesn't make this statute not facially pre-empted. 

This statute has the punitive provisions with the strict 

liability, treble damages, the segregation requirement 

that's virtually impossible to apply in practice, the 

clear expressive mission of a regulatory policy that's 

contrary to Federal policy.

 This is the statute that is in front of the 

Court. This is the statute that is facially 

unconstitutional, and that's the issue that the Court 

should decide in order to correct the Ninth Circuit's 

error, which said it's both facially and as applied 

immune from pre-emption challenge before it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What policy was Congress 

implementing in the Federal funding statute that 

California copied?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, California did not 

copy any Federal statutes. None of the Federal statutes 

has a segregation requirement; none of them imposes 

strict liability, punitive damages.

money is not to be spent to assist, promote, or deter 

union organizing.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, there are three Federal 

statutes that impose use restrictions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do they do that?

 MR. HUNGAR: It's not clear why they did 

that, other than obviously they were choosing not to 

compensate those particular kinds of costs as well as 

the others. Congress is entitled to carve out 

particular exceptions to the general nonregulatory 

provisions of the Act, just as it has done in section 

8(c), where they have carved out coercive employer and 

union speech for regulation, even though other speech is 

to be unregulated.

 It's important to understand also that the 

general policy in Federal grant programs is to the 

contrary. There is no such restriction in the vast 

majority of Federal grant programs involving the vast 

majority of Federal grant money.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't -- there's 

no reason, rhyme or reason to what they would have done 

in these three statutes that you say is flatly contrary 

to national labor relations policy?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, it's not contrary to 

national labor relations policy, because Congress has

the Federal Government wanted, right?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Until this statute was enacted, California 

was in the anomalous position that it was financing 

speech on one side of union organizing campaigns but not 

on the other, because most grants, programs, contracts 

include employment costs as an allowable cost.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so was anyone

who hired a company to do any kind of work, right? 

Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try 

to restrict what activities the company engaged in with 

respect to union organizing.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. I mean, a private 

employer could have said the same things that the State 

said: don't use our money to do this. And they would 

not have violated anything by doing that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not sure why you 

characterize California as financing one side of a 

debate, because -- and this I think is sort of the nub 

of the disagreement between the two sides here -- their 

argument is that a State can determine what it wants to 

buy with its money, but what California is doing is 

telling its contractor what it can do with the money 

after the State has got what it paid for.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: That's not correct, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the --

MR. GOTTESMAN: That's what they claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that is the 

basic distinction between a case like Rust and a case 

like this.

their profits as opposed to determining what they get --

what you get for your money. And how do you respond to 

that?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's true if it were 

the case that the State's statute said: Even after you 

have earned this money by performing all the service we 

asked, you still can't -- it's therefore now your money; 

you can't use it. That is not what the statute means. 

That is -- the State has been very clear about that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is there any case in 

which California claims that it has not gotten the 

service that it paid for as a result of the position 

which an employer -- a grantee employer took on -- on a 

unionization issue?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, there haven't been any 

cases decided under this statute, but what the court of 

appeals pointed out is that the Petitioners did not move 

for summary judgment on the ground that you're 

forbidding us from using our money. They moved for 

summary judgment solely on the ground that it was the 

obligation of the State to give them money that they 

could use for these purposes. And that it was wrong --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not quite 

accurate. They moved for summary judgment on the ground 

that what the State was doing was in effect regulating

labor relations --

MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and that that 

activity was pre-empted.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. Well, yes, on that 

core issue, they said to -- to tell us that we cannot 

use State funds for this purpose -- well, they are still 

State funds -- is to regulate us. And we submit that 

that is wrong. This is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say "while they 

are still State funds" -- the -- the money that the --

that any employer is using, I presume, to the extent 

that it can be identified, is money in the employer's 

pocket. And the only claim that California would have, 

it seems to me from the pre-emption argument, is that in 

fact we are buying a form of speech or a form of 

promotion of labor policy when we contract with social 

service agencies or whatnot. But I don't understand 

that to be California's argument at all.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: No. Our argument -- let's 

take one of the two provisions that the district court 

struck down, and that Petitioners argue properly struck 

down. It said that when we give you grant money, don't 

use that money for this purpose. Now, the State gives 

them the money up front, before they have provided the

services. And that's true universally.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if they give them 

grant money -- let's say it's a grant rather than a 

contract, and I assume that's, you know, the point 

you're making. When they give them grant money, I 

assume they're giving them grant money in order to do or 

to perform whatever kind of service or function the 

agency is devoted to performing.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Not to -- not to enforce 

labor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the 

arts or conservation or whatever the organization does. 

And there's no argument here that the organization is --

is failing to promote conservation or the arts or 

whatever, and that for that reason, California isn't 

getting what it's paying for. The argument is that 

whatever California has to -- I'm sorry, whatever the 

organization has to spend, say, on its labor relations, 

which is something that is left over from its promotion 

of the arts, cannot be spent except in accordance with 

California policy.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, first, if they don't 

spend all the grant money on the prescribed purposes, 

they have to give it back to the State because grants 

aren't profit --

entitled to some overhead cost which would include the 

cost of their employee-related -- managing employee 

relations?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. And that's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that wouldn't be money 

left over. That would --

MR. GOTTESMAN: Right, but that, Your Honor, 

is where the concern that the State was addressing comes 

in.

 Traditionally, when the State gave grant 

money, one of the permissible uses of that money was for 

the costs of employees who had to perform the grant, and 

without this limitation, that would have included the 

employer spending the money to combat unions. That 

would be -- could arguably be a legitimate cost.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, is the argument that 

the employer in fact -- that the employer is in fact 

devoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the 

grant, so that it falls within Rust?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well -- yes. Well, our 

position is certainly yes. That is, the State is 

entitled to prescribe what it is prepared to pay for in 

a grant and what not, and it is not required to 

subsidize the employer's campaign --

-- the policy is they don't want employers to talk about 

unionization.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: No. They don't want them to 

spend them the employer's money -- the State's money to 

talk about unionization.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Because it's wasting 

the money or because that is their --

MR. GOTTESMAN: Because the State wants --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- their labor policy?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Because the State wants to 

be neutral, and that -- the right --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then that -- then that, it 

seems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment 

ago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's 

getting less of what it thought it was getting for with 

its grant, because more is being spent on labor policy. 

And now, it seems to me, you're saying no, that's not 

the case. It is simply the fact that the time that the 

employer spends in talking with employees, whatever the 

subject is, involves a policy that California does not 

want to support, and, therefore, California prohibits 

them spending that time for purely policy reasons.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it prohibits them 

using the State's money to do it. Of course they can 

use their own money to do it.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument a 

moment ago is that they were using the State's money 

because in fact they were providing less of the service 

that the grant was for and spending that in -- in 

conversation with employees about labor unions. And it 

seems to me your answer to Justice Scalia was 

inconsistent with that. Your answer to Justice Scalia, 

as I understood it, was it is simply that they do not 

want that policy being implemented by anyone who gets 

any money from the State within that State.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: I don't think I said 

"inconsistently." What I said was, previously it was 

within the permissible scope of a grant to spend money 

in an organizing campaign, either assisting, promoting, 

or deterring unionization. The State is now saying that 

will no longer be. We don't really want to spend grant 

money on that, and our reason is that we think we -- the 

State's money should not be used by either side in that 

union organizing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that -- how 

is that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an 

OSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective 

devices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want 

to get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be 

used to put in these federally required safety devices;

you can use somebody else's money for that. Why isn't 

that the same thing here? You're saying there's a 

Federal labor policy that allows this, and we don't want 

our money to be spent implementing that policy or 

pursuant to that policy.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Because there is no Federal 

labor policy that requires States to use State treasury 

money to finance a party who is engaged in this debate. 

That's why this is just like Rust.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just like -- like Gould. I 

mean, there is a case where a State used State money, no 

contracting with any -- with any company that's been 

convicted of unfair labor practices three times. 

Strictly State contracting policy, we just don't want to 

spend our money dealing with such a person.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right, but there we're 

saying we won't deal with you. That's -- that would 

classically -- if the State in this case said, no 

employer who opposes unions can have a State contract, 

that would be Gould. It would also be a violation of 

the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that be the 

State's managing its own money? It's our money.

something, and saying, we won't deal with you even when 

you use your own money to do it. The implication that 

this is pre-emptive --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But on your argument, there 

is no "your own money." You're saying that everything 

that the grantee gets in a grant situation is the 

government's money.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that distinction that 

you just made in answer to Justice Scalia could not be 

drawn.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if they have their own 

money, they can spend it on that. They just can't use 

the State's money.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, the hypothesis of this 

whole argument is that we are talking with a grantee who 

was fully funded by -- I thought fully funded by the 

State, and I thought that was your strongest argument. 

So that this alternative -- well, you can use your own 

money -- is an alternative which, you know, by the very 

hypothesis that we are arguing on, will never exist.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if we have a grantee

who has no other money, that doesn't mean the State has 

an obligation to provide them money to oppose 

unionization. It would be very odd to believe -- and 

this is, after all, implied pre-emption -- that it was 

Congress's intent without mentioning it to say that it 

is the obligation of States to provide funding to 

employers to do this.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gottesman, can I ask 

sort of a background question to be sure I understand 

your position?

 Am I correct in assuming that if the State 

of California had its labor relations agency make it an 

unfair labor practice to engage in this employer speech 

described here, that that would be pre-empted?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Employer speech with its own 

money?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course that would be 

pre-empted, absolutely pre-empted.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: If not pr-empted, it would 

certainly be a violation of the First Amendment as well, 

to punish them for engaging in speech.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if they adopted the 

rule that the Federal labor board applied prior to the

Taft-Hartley Act.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Exactly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's what I'm asking.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Exactly. Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That would be pre-empted?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course that would be 

pre-empted.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Our position, however, is 

that it's quite different to say that the National Labor 

Relations Act requires the State to pay for these 

activities. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It does require that this 

-- it arguably requires that this area of combat between 

labor and management be unregulated.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. And this is not 

regulation, for the very reasons that this Court in 

Regan and Rust and in a whole line of cases had said 

that it is not regulation to simply say, we the 

government are not going to pay for this activity.

 That's all that California is saying in this 

case: we are not going to pay for it. It's the policy 

of the State not to interfere in these union organizing 

drives; therefore -- and this is the precise words of

the preamble -- "for this reason, the State should not 

subsidize."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your reason for not 

paying for this activity is that you don't like this 

activity.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: That's not true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I call that -- I call that 

regulating the activity.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: That is not at all the case, 

Your Honor. There's nothing in this preamble -- the 

other side keeps characterizing the preamble, which they 

don't include in their statutory appendix, as saying, we 

don't like the employer doing it. That's not what it 

says; it's on page 3.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you allow the 

employer to engage in all other employee relations, and 

you're willing -- that can be done without -- the one 

thing the employer can't do is speak out against the 

union. This isn't because you don't --

MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, you've got for or 

against. This is content discrimination, not viewpoint 

discrimination; and it is content discrimination whose 

purpose is to keep the State's funds out of this area of 

context. The taxpayers' money should not be spent 

supporting one side and not the other in these disputes.

This court in the Linn case -- and I want to 

quote this sentence, because this is the key to why a 

policy of neutrality with respect to the use of the 

State's money is not, you know, regulated. We -- this 

was a case in which, to be sure, it was the Federal 

Government was denying food stamps to strikers. And the 

claim was that was a violation of their associational 

rights under the First Amendment. Everybody else who 

satisfies the test for food stamps is entitled to them, 

but we are not going to give them to strikers.

 And when the Federal Government is asked why 

is that, they said, well, we don't want to get involved. 

To be sure if we give them the money, that would make it 

likely the strike would go on longer. But we are not 

being anti-union. We just want to be hands off. We 

want to be -- we don't want Federal money spent to help 

one side or the other in this labor dispute.

 And what this Court said was, we have little 

trouble in concluding that that provision is rationally 

related to the legitimate governmental objective of 

avoiding undue favoritism to one side or the other in 

private labor disputes.

 Now, that's the core of what this statute is 

about. The labor union --

doesn't give favoritism to one side or another?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: It just takes the State's 

money out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that depends, as 

a practical matter, on the view that there are at least 

some employers who would be arguing in favor of 

unionization?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it wouldn't matter if 

they were arguing for or against. The point is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but my point is 

that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. Well that may well 

be true, but the point is when they are arguing against 

the union, until this statute State money was being used 

to argue against the union, the union was not getting 

any State money to respond. The State was funding one 

side of this dispute. And the notion that it was an 

implied purpose of Congress in the National Labor 

Relations Act to compel States to fund one side of a 

dispute with a subsidy is -- would be remarkable.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, when the State pays a 

program participant -- let's again take the case of a 

nursing home -- for providing services to patients who 

are covered by Medi-Cal, and money is paid to the 

nursing home, it's your position that remains the State

's money.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: If this -- if the nursing 

home -- there are a number of different ways in which 

this money is paid to the State. If the situation is 

the nursing home first provides the services and when 

they have done so billed the State for the money, that's 

not State funds. Once they receive the money, since 

they put the money up in front to provide the service, 

they are being reimbursed for it, that's not the State's 

funds. It's the State's funds if the State gives them 

the money up front.

 As is true universally with respect to 

grants. We give you this money. This money now because 

of this statute its purposes are limited so that they do 

not include engaging in -- one side or the other in 

union organizing. If you have your own money, feel free 

to spend your own money on that, but we are not giving 

you this money for that purpose.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just be clear. The 

statute with reference to State contractors, which is 

the $50,000 statute, and the statute with reference to 

private employers, which is the $10,000 statute, in all 

of those cases, the law is applicable only if the money 

is paid before all the work is done?

contract one, which is not actually before the Court 

because nobody had standing -- the district court ruled 

to raise it -- it says the State funds to assist, 

promote or defer -- union organizing during the life of 

the contract are not to be spent on this.

 So once the contract is done, that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question of when 

the contract is done is different from the question of 

when the money is paid.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course. Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He is asking with when the 

money is paid.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: So when you pay the money up 

front and you say here is your money to do the 

contract --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the 

situation in which the contract runs for a year and you 

bill monthly? On your theory the contract is still 

going on and yet there is no prepayment. I assume on 

your argument they would be just as bound by the 

California policy as if they got a hundred percent 

payment up front.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's -- that's a 

question about a meaning of a provision that isn't at 

this issue in this case. The ones that are at issue in

this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you concede that 

if they -- if all they did under a 12-month contract 

was -- was bill for services rendered every past 30 

days, that there would be either no application of the 

California law or that the application would be 

pre-empted?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: That might well be the case. 

But we don't have an interpretation of that provision of 

the California law.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. That was an 

either/or.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE ALITO: Which might be the case?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Oh. I say it might be the 

case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's like saying yes.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GOTTESMAN: But again, that issue isn't 

here. What we've got here are programs, some of which 

the State advances the money, and some of which it pays 

after the services have been completed.

statements there, where it would say "organizations," 

namely organizations, even those that receive a hundred 

percent of their money from the State are free to use 

their profits?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If there are any, or any 

other non-state moneys they had?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: And we the State responded 

say the same thing in our brief. We say it at pages 26 

to 27: The State maintains a legitimate interest in 

program funds until such time as the program participant 

has provided the State with a service the State has 

funded.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So if you sell them tables 

and they write you a check, the State, for the tables, 

at that point the check is yours?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: There is no question about 

that, because in that case, that would be covered by the 

contract provision that isn't here. But it says once 

the contract is completed, it's your money.

 So the concern here only is that they not 

use our money. The State's brief also says --

warranty for another year, say if these tables break you 

have to replace them?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's a question 

of -- remember, neither of the lower courts has 

interpreted this statute. This statute has never been 

interpreted. That's -- and what the court of appeals 

said is that's because the argument that you all have 

been asking me about was not raised in summary judgment 

by the Petitioners. Their core argument is the State 

has an obligation to subsidize our speech. And that's 

the only issue they brought up on summary judgment. 

Because Judge Beezer in the panel decision said, oh, 

look at all these, quote, as he called them, horribles 

that will come from this, Judge Beezer got into all 

these issues: The accounting would be burdensome, that 

it's going to be the employer's own money.

 And what the majority said is, number one, 

that's not here. And number two, they said this -- I 

believe it's on page 34 of the appendix but I'm not 

certain of the -- wait a minute, I can tell you the 

exact page. Yes, it's page 34, in a sense the parade of 

horribles goes far beyond the scope of plaintiff's 

facial challenge, that is the challenge they brought on 

summary judgment. The district court made no findings 

nor is there evidence that this statute, quote, "co-ops

the payments for goods and services and profits realized 

under a contract ."

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is your recommendation 

as to -- we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's 

there, I put the thing that I've heard as -- well, the 

example with the tables is an example of it. When does 

the profit actually accrue? Is there treble damage 

provision that makes this much worse? Are there 

administrative requirements that in practice make it 

impossible? Is it administered in such a way that the 

employee we heard about would just not know what to say, 

the employer's representative?

 All those things could be problems, and you 

say, well, they haven't been dealt with yet. And your 

recommendation as to what we should do is what?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Is affirm, because all the 

court has said is the motion for summary judgment was 

improperly granted.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And if we did that, how 

would all these problems be worked out? I mean, how 

would the arguments that you -- they think are far too 

burdensome, you think they are not and can be done 

properly, how does that get worked out?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, first of all, let's 

talk about the burdens, the accounting burdens, which

are actually quite minimal under Medicaid, because they 

already have to do this because the Federal Medicaid 

requires them to -- to account for which were allowable 

expenditures and which were not in a very detailed 

accounting form. And of course, the Federal Medicaid 

says that this is not allowable expenditure, so they 

have to do this anyway, half this money is Federal and 

half is is State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not going to go 

through all of these one by one, are you?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Pardon? No. I just wanted 

to give an example of that.

 But with respect to each of these, we need 

to have a record. For example, on the burdens there is 

an affidavit from an accounting firm submitted by the 

defendants that says this is really not burdensome at 

all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you a basic 

question that doesn't require you to get into one by 

one. Suppose you have a State that doesn't want to have 

its money used to assist unions. This is an antiunion 

State and it adopts the same kind of law that you have. 

And it simply says, none of -- none of this State's --

yes, you can recognize unions if you like, but none of 

the money that we give you --

MR. GOTTESMAN: Give who.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- shall be used -- shall 

be used for collective bargaining or for any -- any 

activities involving unions.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: That would be -- that would 

be the moneys we give to the employer?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Same. Yes.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: I'm not sure which question 

you're asking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To the employer. No 

employer getting money from the State can expend any of 

our money -- the same way yours is -- in collective 

bargaining with unions or in anything else. Now, we are 

not stopping employers from doing that. We just don't 

like unions, and it's our money and we don't want this 

employer to use it for unions. Would that be all right.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: I think that would be 

problematic but only for this reason. If the employer 

is allowed to spend the State's money to -- to bargain 

with nonunion employees and you know medical 

researchers, whatever, negotiate contracts with them, 

but the State says you can't do it for collective 

bargaining, then that is exactly the Livadas case. That 

is the case in which the State is saying your 

entitlement to a State benefit turns on whether you are

unionized or not. In this case we'll let the employer 

do this with nonunion employees, but not with unionized 

employees. But if the State said we don't want to pay 

for the costs of negotiating --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that -- why does 

that make a difference? If it violates Federal policy, 

it violates Federal policy. Livadas said you can't do 

it because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor 

unionization, and not to deter.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. But this statute 

neither favors nor deters. This statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same 

about that other one.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: This statute simply says we 

don't want to subsidize either party, and as a practical 

matter we are only subsidizing one party in union 

organizing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So does the statute I 

posit. Just don't use State money. You can use all of 

your own money to deal with unions; just we don't want 

our money used for it.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.

be banned if the State had said we don't want you to use 

State money to negotiate contracts with any of your 

employees; that would not be banned. It would be banned 

if they singled out only unionized employees that you're 

not allowed to use it with. You're allowed to use it 

with nonunion employees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I want to get back 

to your responses on the procedural costs of the case. 

You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would 

be with respect to accounting rules.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. There is a State 

disputed facts in the district court on that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make any 

difference if the argument is which is what I understood 

it to be, that you can't regulate at all? It's not 

simply that you can't regulate so long as it's 

particularly burdensome, but you don't have the 

authority to regulate in this at all.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: But our argument is that 

this is not regulation. To say that the State money is 

not going to be spent for this is not regulation. Just 

as Regan and Rust says --

spending clause question. We're not -- I mean, we can 

address that without deciding whether the regulations 

are particularly burdensome. You were saying well, the 

accounting is not a big problem.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't mean 

that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, we are not regulating 

whether the employer opposes unions. What we are 

regulating is what they do with the State's money. 

That's the only regulation that's here. We are saying 

don't use our money for this purpose. The only 

regulation that's going on is to see whether you use the 

State's money --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't seem to 

me to be responsive to my question. Your point was 

well, we don't know how burdensome a particular 

regulation is. If you lose on the question of whether 

it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to 

see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled 

to regulate at all.

to the spending question.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: -- is regulation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm putting that 

aside.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: I'm having -- the problem 

I'm having with Your Honor's question is presuming the 

answer to something. The -- if this is regulation, then 

there is a serious prospect of its being pre-emptive, 

but this is not regulation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of 

whether -- regardless of whether it's burdensome 

regulation.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's regulation 

why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary 

judgment. Not the spending question we have -- that's a 

different issue. But if there is no difference with 

respect to regulation whether it's burdensome or not, so 

we don't have to have further proceedings on whether 

it's burdensome.

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. But the only issue 

they raised on summary judgment is that to deny us your 

money, the State's money, is regulation. And our 

position is that to deny you the State's money is not 

regulation, any more than it was in Regan, in Rust, in

this whole line of cases where the Court has said the 

government's choice not to subsidize an activity is not 

regulation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But on that point you're 

in disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and --

MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes, we are. The Ninth 

Circuit misunderstood Boston Harbor. It thought Boston 

Harbor created two boxes that represented the whole 

world. You're either a market participant or you're a 

regulator. That's not what Boston Harbor said, if you 

go back and look at it. What Boston Harbor said, if you 

regulate you are vulnerable to pre-emption arguments; if 

you are not regulating, then you are free of pre-emption 

concerns.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the principal rationale 

for the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your 

view?

 MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it's not -- no. The 

Ninth Circuit also talked about the First Amendment and 

got it right. It said when it talked about the dissent 

had said what this State is doing is violating the First 

Amendment, and the Ninth Circuit's response is no, 

that's not right. All this is is withholding a subsidy, 

and the First Amendment cases are clear: that's not 

regulation of a speech.

What the Ninth Circuit thought erroneously 

is that Boston Harbor had denied it the right to take 

that same view, because it thought that Boston Harbor 

said that everything is regulation unless it's market 

participation, and that's not what Boston Harbor said, 

and this is not regulation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

 Mr. Goldsmith, you have four minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GOLDSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 I'd just like to make a few comments in 

rebuttal. First of all, the preamble of the statute 

makes it absolutely clear as to what the State's purpose 

is. It's at page 3a of the appendix of the petition. 

It says it is the policy of the State not to interfere 

with an employee's choice about whether to join or to be 

represented by a labor union. For this reason the State 

should not subsidize -- and so on.

 So clearly the State has a labor policy 

position. It's a position as I said at the outset that 

is completely contrary to that of the NLRA. The NLRA's 

position is that employers just like unions ought to

have the right to speak in a noncoercive way to their 

employees.

 Secondly, it is not our position that the 

NLRA requires the State to fund activities. It is our 

position that the NLRA and the decisions of this Court 

make it abundantly clear that the States are to stay out 

of this area altogether, period. And that would be the 

case whether it is the kind of statute that Justice 

Scalia was posing a question about, whether it was in 

effect anti-union or pro-union. It doesn't matter. 

They are both pre-empted.

 The State has no business making labor 

policy. The decisions of this Court, the unanimous 

decisions of this Court in several circumstances I think 

make that very clear. And the Ninth Circuit did find 

that for all practical purposes, the State was 

regulating by making labor policy.

 If I could make two points about neutrality. 

First of all, the statute is anything but neutral. 

First of all, the State's policy is not one of 

neutrality. As I just read from the preamble they have 

a position; the position is that noncoercive employer 

speech interferes with employee free choice, and the 

statute follows that position.

 The decision to withdraw funds is not the

same thing as being neutral. Your Honor made a 

reference to the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment, 

Congress withdrew funds from -- from abortion 

practitioners. It was not neutral about abortion. And 

California here has made a judgment about noncoercive 

speech.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the Lyng 

case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that 

argument?

 MR. GOLDSMITH: The Lyng case seems to me to 

be completely off the point on the pre-emption issue. 

But there is no question, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that Congress can make judgments about what it chooses 

to fund or not to fund. That did not open the door to 

the States to do whatever they wanted to do by way of 

funding or not funding. Lyng addressed a 

constitutional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Lyng said that 

the -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was 

making a choice on how to spend its funds. And I 

understood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too, 

here, California is being neutral.

 MR. GOLDSMITH: But California is -- is not 

being neutral, not just because of what the preamble 

says but because of the add-ons to the statute if you

will. California has taken it much farther than simply 

withdrawing the subsidy. California has taken it to the 

point that you're exposed to treble damages, but then 

you have minute tracking and segregation of fund 

details, and California has taken it even one step 

farther and said on the other hand, if you want to spend 

State money to facilitate union organizing, that's 

perfectly fine with us. You can spend money to give 

access to union representatives to property. You can 

use State money to -- to facilitate neutrality 

agreements of one sort or another. Anything that would 

help a union organize employees, that's fine by us.

 So California is not neutral in the same way 

that Lyng was neutral, but again I would suggest that, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that Lyng didn't open the door, any 

more than Rust or Regan opened the door to the States to 

make labor policy by granting or withholding moneys in 

any way that they saw fit. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Goldsmith.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
