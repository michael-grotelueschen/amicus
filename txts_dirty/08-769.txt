 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear, first, 

this morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens.

 Mr. Katyal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Ten years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18, 

Congress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against 

certain depictions of actual animal cruelty. Yet the 

Third Circuit struck the statute down on its face 

without even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth 

analysis. The statute has four critical features and, 

just as the Court last year in United States v. Williams 

began with statutory construction, analysis should begin 

there.

 First, like the statute at issue in the 

United States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches 

depictions of cruelty to actual living beings --

animals, not simulated ones or the written word.

 Second, the statute only applies to 

commercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the 

market for animal cruelty.

Third, the statute examines the work as a 

whole --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What record do you have 

of that fact?

 MR. KATYAL: Before Congress?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.

 MR. KATYAL: Before Congress -- Congress had 

a bunch of testimony that showed that there were 

extensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty 

videos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000 

crush videos that were in -- that were -- that were 

being sold at the time.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That I understand, but 

crush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals. 

What evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting 

had as large and robust a market or that hunting videos 

in those States in which hunting was illegal had a 

robust market, et cetera?

 MR. KATYAL: Well, hunting we think is 

excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from 

the reach of the act. Congress spoke in general terms, 

and I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page 

13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that 

Congress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate 

animal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is

correct and the record does not support that.

 Congress spoke in general terms. They had a 

for-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and 

the statute dealt with it in general terms. And they 

reasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these 

videotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine 

market --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by a 

"for-profit commercial market"? You mean anything that 

is sold, right?

 MR. KATYAL: That is -- that is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. KATYAL: Yes.

 And the Third Circuit's decision in this 

case struck down the statute with respect to crush 

videos, with respect to the sale of video -- the 

creation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember, 

the statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the --

the sale of videotapes. It also encompasses the 

creation of dog fighting videotapes. And, yet, the --

the Third Circuit struck that down as well. That, I 

think, was a fundamental error under this Court's 

principles, most particularly, United States v. 

Williams, which says that the statute should only be 

struck down if there is a substantial -- if there is

substantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort 

of the Court, not the first.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would you -- if 

you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for 

determining which categories of speech are unprotected 

by the First Amendment?

 MR. KATYAL: In one sentence, if -- if -- if 

Congress sees a compelling interest in regulating the 

means of production and does not target the underlying 

content, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so 

long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that 

expression in -- in place, and that is I think what 

Ferber --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And what case --

what case do you have for that proposition?

 MR. KATYAL: United States v. Ferber -- New 

York v. Ferber. In Ferber, the Court -- the Court 

dealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in 

Free Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free 

Speech Coalition together say is that Congress was 

not -- or the legislature, was not targeting the 

contents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at 

and dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in 

that case.

summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American 

Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make 

not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil 

suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as 

sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and 

degradation.

 The Seventh Circuit said that that was a 

blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after 

purveyors who show these women in the shocking, 

degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily 

affirmed.

 MR. KATYAL: And this case is fundamentally 

different from all of those because here Congress is not 

aiming at the underlying communicative impact. It's not 

saying, as it was in the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course it is. I 

mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say, 

since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity, 

the means, which is to prevent the communication, is 

okay. It is targeting the communication of videos that 

depict this conduct.

 MR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice 

Scalia. The bona fides of this statute are evident 

right on its face, because the very same depictions that 

Mr. Stevens or anyone else swept up under the statute

wants to portray, they can -- they can do it, so long as 

they use simulated or images.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but to say 

that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I 

think is contradicted by the exceptions. You have to 

look at the content and make a decision, is this bona 

fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical? 

So you have to look at the content to determine whether 

or not the speech is prohibited.

 MR. KATYAL: I don't think so, for two 

reasons. I think what Congress is dealing with with the 

exemptions clause in this statute was just reflecting 

the underlying nature of the market that they saw in 

1999, a for-profit commercial market in cruelty.

 And so they exempted educational depictions, 

religious, and so on, because that wasn't what was 

driving the underlying market for crush videos --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you tell 

these aren't political videos? You do have, with 

organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same 

sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support 

for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the 

exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and, 

in each case, it would fall under the political 

exemption?

MR. KATYAL: And often they will fall under 

that exemption. My point is that Congress carved a 

broad exemption in Section 48 precisely to make sure 

that expressive messages aren't swept up.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you 

tell me what the difference is between these video and 

David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David 

Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the 

actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, 

greater sections of the film, and more explicit.

 In this film, the -- the Respondent didn't 

let the video show the actual tearing of the jaw. David 

Roma's did much more than that, showed much more than 

that. So isn't -- doesn't there have to be a judgment 

inherent in this statute?

 MR. KATYAL: The line will sometimes be 

difficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in 

child pornography --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not in child 

pornography because, there, Congress says the very 

act -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is. That very 

act of child pornography is illegal.

 MR. KATYAL: Quite to the contrary, Justice 

Sotomayor. In this -- this Court approved, in Osborne 

v. Ohio, a statute that's on child pornography, that had

the following exemption: For a, quote, "bona fide 

artistic, educational, religious, governmental, 

judicial, or other purpose by or to a physician, 

psychologist, sociologist, persons pursuing bona fide 

research studies, a judge or other persons having a 

proper interest in the material or performance."

 And this Court pointed to that exemptions 

clause to make the statute constitutional at two -- at 

two pages in that opinion. And so this Court has 

already gone down the path of saying these decisions are 

tough to make on a case-by-case basis, but nonetheless 

the legislature should have a freer hand to act when it 

is regulating, not the expressive message, but targeting 

the underlying content, the -- targeting the underlying 

production, not the content.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Child -- child pornography 

is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been 

treated as part of that same traditional classification 

which there has always been permission for the 

government to prohibit. This is something quite 

different.

 I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I 

am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to 

the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble 

both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that

bullfights are terrific and we should have them.

 I would -- I would not be able to -- to 

market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight 

is. Right? I would be able to talk and say, oh, you 

should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the 

most significant point that I want to make, get people 

to watch it.

 MR. KATYAL: I want to answer your 

hypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so 

to -- to respond more generally to all of these 

hypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the 

course of our conversation.

 We believe that Section 48 will have 

as-applied constitutional challenges that will be 

inferred from case to case. But what this Court has 

said is that, in your decision, Justice Scalia, in 

United States v. Williams, is that we should be careful 

about that endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals 

precisely because the test under substantial 

overbreadth, which knocks an entire act of Congress out 

on its face, is that there must be a realistic danger 

that the statute will be applied in -- in the manner the 

hypothetical suggests.

 With respect to your bullfighting 

hypothetical, there is no realistic danger.

We have had ten years of experience under the statute. 

Congress itself said -- the legislative history, which I 

know will not be of relevance to you but may to others 

on the Court -- they explicitly exempted Spanish 

bullfighting and said that is the paradigmatic case of 

what is educational and artistic and the like.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What if I made --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Wait. I don't 

understand that. Any depiction of bullfighting is 

educational?

 MR. KATYAL: Spanish depictions of 

bullfighting --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is true because 

Congress said so?

 MR. KATYAL: Well, that is true because it 

is educational, and -- and a prosecutor would bear the 

burden of proof.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess a dogfight is 

educational, too.

 MR. KATYAL: And some dogfights certainly 

are, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, look what you have 

done, and this is what is bothering me. You take these 

words, which are a little vague, some of them, "serious 

religious, political, scientific, educational,

journalistic, historical, or artistic value," and you 

say that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will 

apply. And people have to understand it because they 

have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being 

prosecuted.

 Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, 

you then require people to apply that standard, not 

simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but 

also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, 

sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, 

humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, 

the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras.

 All right, so there is a whole long -- quail 

hunting. There's a whole long list in here of things 

that people might want to do. They won't know if it 

falls within this exemption. Nobody in every State 

wants to forbid these things. Sometimes they are, 

sometimes they are not. They won't know whether or not 

they can make this particular film, picture, or other. 

That's the overbreadth argument. And I would like to 

hear your response.

 MR. KATYAL: We have had ten years of 

experience, Justice Breyer, under the statute, and we 

haven't seen those things being chilled. Indeed,

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example 

of a case where we said a statute which might otherwise 

be overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have 

been restrained? Can you give me one case where we've 

said that?

 MR. KATYAL: Last year in United States v. 

Williams, an opinion that virtually every member of this 

Court joined, including you, Justice Kennedy, this Court 

said that it would look to the experience, the 

post-Ferber experience, in prosecuting cases to decide 

whether or not a -- two terms in the statute, "promotes" 

and "presents," were vague and would raise the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was a case where 

we knew what the content was. The content was not 

subject to an -- to an overbreadth challenge. The 

content was not.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, actually, Justice 

Kennedy, the reason that came up in the case is because 

there were hypotheticals being advanced such as 

police -- a man who wants to call the police that says 

that child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and 

so on. And what the Court said is that even though the 

words in the statute, just as the words in this statute, 

could be read broadly or narrowly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that

went to intent. It seems to me that -- let me tell you 

what I think your framework is and if it is wrong, tell 

me that it is wrong. This statute without the 

exceptions clause would be wildly overbroad. So you say 

it's not overly broad because of the exception or the 

savings clause. I will call it the exceptions. But it 

seems to me that the exceptions must be then tested as 

to whether or not they are vague.

 MR. KATYAL: We do think that the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have you to show 

that they are not vague.

 MR. KATYAL: We do think that the exceptions 

clause does some of the constitutional work to exclude 

some of the hypotheticals like bullfighting and the 

like. We do think the statute itself has a number of 

restrictions built into it on its face to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is a -- what is 

"and the like"? How about cockfighting? What is the 

difference between -- perhaps I missed something a few 

moments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting, 

dogfighting? You say dogfighting is included, but 

bullfighting -- and I don't know where you put 

cockfighting.

 MR. KATYAL: Dogfighting and cockfighting 

are illegal in all 50 States and therefore would be

swept up. Some certain depictions of dogfighting and 

cockfighting would be swept up, not all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about 

bullfighting? Isn't that illegal in --

MR. KATYAL: It may or may not be. There 

aren't, at least, specific statutes generally dealing 

with it, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What about hunting with a 

bow -- What about hunting with a bow and arrow out of 

season?

 MR. KATYAL: Okay. So --

(Laughter.)

 MR. KATYAL: In hunting, as well as --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- have we 

finished with the category of fights?

 MR. KATYAL: So let me just, to Justice 

Ginsburg's question. Not all dogfighting videos are 

swept up by Section 48. There may be educational 

videos, along the lines that Justice Sotomayor said, 

raised which are not swept up. Bullfighting is the same 

basic thing. It's not that there is a categorical -- a 

categorical exemption on bullfighting; it is rather that 

there are certain ones that are educational and not, 

just like in child pornography.

JUSTICE SCALIA: So noneducational 

bullfighting would be prohibited? If I market this just 

because I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting?

 MR. KATYAL: If it meets the other terms in 

the statute, right. So commercial and things like that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. It is covered.

 MR. KATYAL: Now, with respect to hunting, 

hunting is generally not considered animal cruelty. And 

it doesn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but hunting with a bow 

and arrow, and some depictions of hunting are pretty --

are pretty gruesome.

 MR. KATYAL: That's correct. And to the 

extent that it is something that resembles the terms of 

the statute, the language of which is "maimed, 

mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Or killed." How do you 

limit "killed" to cruel -- you say in your brief that 

it's noscitur ex sociis. But that's a doctrine that 

says when you have a string of words, one of which has 

various meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the 

words with which it is associated. So if you speak of 

staples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other 

fasteners, "nails" obviously doesn't mean toenails. It 

means a nail that is a fastener, the word "nail" having

various meanings.

 "Kill" has one meaning, which is kill. And 

you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in 

addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and 

other things. Do you have a single case where -- where 

that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an 

ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which 

on its face is absolutely clear?

 MR. KATYAL: Yes, sir, Your Honor. I do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is that?

 MR. KATYAL: That is the decision you wrote 

last year in United States v. Williams, which interprets 

the words "promotes and presents," which you yourself in 

the opinion said are capable of a wide variety of 

meanings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

 MR. KATYAL: And -- and here the word "kill" 

in context is a term that the statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it's not susceptible to 

a wide -- that's my whole point. It means kill.

 MR. KATYAL: It means killed in the context 

of a statute that is defining the words "animal 

cruelty," and this Court has consistently said that the 

definition that is being defined by the legislature --

animal is animal cruelty. These people don't eat meat 

because it is the product of killing animals.

 MR. KATYAL: And the legislature under no 

way, shape, or form was targeting that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't have 

said that, then.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that it basically 

did say that by using the words "animal cruelty" in the 

statute. Now, if there's a disagreement about that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have a single 

case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like "kill" 

is given a more narrow meaning because of other words 

that are different from that word.

 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this 

Court defined the term "crime of violence," which the 

INA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So you want to say "cruelly 

kill"?

 MR. KATYAL: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, "cruelly kill" is not 

exactly crystal clear. And therefore my question is 

why, given the need for you to save this statute to read 

so many words that are so general, those contained here 

that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed 

to just wound or kill. You are doing that in order to

prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities 

that aren't intended to be covered by this statute.

 Why not do a simpler thing? Rather than let 

the public guess as to what these words mean, ask 

Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those 

frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, 

that can be done. I don't know why they couldn't do it.

 MR. KATYAL: And it could have been done in 

Williams. It could have been done in the child 

pornography cases, which also have vague terms. But 

what this Court has said is that using the substantial 

overbreadth doctrine to do that leaves gaping holes in 

place. If we followed your invitation, Justice Breyer, 

we would leave crush videos unprotected.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? You say a crush 

video, my description that I read of it, you would have 

a strong case. I'm not saying you would win, I don't 

have to decide that. But you have a very strong case. 

So you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on 

that. You are worried about dog fighting, write a 

statute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about 

something unlawful in every state. I am not giving 

Congress advice, though I seem to be.

 (Laughter.)

can't you here write a statute that does not force the 

courts into the work of interpreting these very vague 

words to prevent the statute from being held 

unconstitutional?

 MR. KATYAL: Well, here I think we should 

give Congress some credit, because what it actually did 

in the exemption clause was borrow this Court's own 

jurisprudence from the obscenity context on exceptions 

like literary, artistic, political and scientific. It 

had found that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, would 

this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be 

constitutional? You can't depict videos of, say, 

violent muggings or things of that sort?

 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think it would be 

complicated because Congress would have to find that by 

targeting the underlying videos but leaving alternative 

simulated mugging videos in place, somehow it would have 

reduced the market for muggings or something like that. 

I think that's very hard. And it goes to Justice 

Ginsburg's question about whether this statute is aimed 

at the communicative of impact, which we don't think it 

is, or it is aimed at just reducing the first order 

problem which is --

occurs in states where it is not illegal. These videos 

are taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting 

or cock fighting is entirely legal. So, I don't know 

how you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think 

that violence in movie brutalizes people and causes 

violence in people's action.

 Why couldn't Congress, persuaded by these 

people say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict 

torture? You know, these horror films that come out 

around Halloween, you can't depict that anymore. What 

is the difference between that and what you have done 

here?

 MR. KATYAL: So dog fighting is illegal in 

all 50 states along with crush videos. I don't think 

that -- there may be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it 

isn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here 

were dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no 

different from bull fighting.

 MR. KATYAL: Right. This Court has dealt 

with that in footnote 19 of Ferber in which it said that 

just because something is legal somewhere else, it's 

often very hard to figure out where the underlying 

material is made. It doesn't have a GPS component.

JUSTICE ALITO: Justice Scalia spoke about 

the aficionada of Spanish bullfighting. Suppose that I 

am an aficionado of the sort gladiatorial contests that 

used to take place in ancient Rome, and suppose that 

some -- Rome or some other place decides that it wants 

to make money by staging these things and selling videos 

of them or broadcasting them live around the world. Do 

you have any doubt that that could be prohibitive?

 MR. KATYAL: This is -- I'm sorry if I'm not 

following the hypothetical. This is historical --

JUSTICE ALITO: A gladiatorial contests 

where the gladiators fight to the death.

 MR. KATYAL: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you have any doubt that 

that could be prohibited?

 MR. KATYAL: Well, it sounds like it would 

fall under the historical exemption, at least in the 

hypothetical as you have raised it. So, it wouldn't be 

prohibited by section 48 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who knows.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, no, not under this 

statute, under a different statute.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that -- I think

interest in suppressing historical -- historical

information.

 Now, Justice Scalia, you said who knows. I 

think the answer to that is that this statute places the 

burden of proof on the government in order to -- in 

order to prove that there is no historical or 

educational value.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you dress up like an 

ancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical 

interest?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that it?

 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I do think that 

is the Court's own jurisprudence with respect to, for 

example, obscenity and child pornography, both of which 

this Court has accepted precisely those types of 

exceptions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A different category. That 

is traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not 

protected. And child pornography, as far as I am 

concerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned 

is obscenity.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, I don't believe the Court 

has actually read child pornography to be obscenity.

something quite different between Ferber, because the 

abuse of a child is occurring at the very time. As I 

understand it, Mr. Stevens was not a promoter of dog 

fights. He was just filming them. And so the -- the --

the simultaneous abuse of the child, it occurs only 

because the picture is being taken. The dog fight goes 

on whether Mr. Stevens is there with his camera or not.

 MR. KATYAL: Let me say two things about 

that. First Mr. Stevens, of course, even in the Japan 

videos you mentioned, he sent his dogs to Japan to -- to 

fight. And this statute encompasses real time 

transmissions of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where it was legal for 

him to do that.

 MR. KATYAL: It was, just -- again, like 

child pornography and the like. The second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It even -- what I would 

like you to confront is that the very taking of the 

picture is the offense. That's the abuse of the child. 

The abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is 

separate from the filming of it.

 MR. KATYAL: I agree with that. And I don't 

think that's what underlay either this Court's Ferber 

decision or the free speech coalition. The move that 

Ferber makes is to say that the legislature can target

the underlying loaded production, so long as it leaves 

alternative mechanisms for that same exact message to be 

spoken. And this statute does that. Mr. Stevens can 

produce the exact same message, just as long as he 

doesn't involve the torture or mutilation to an actual 

living animal. And to compare this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: His message is that getting 

animals to fight is fun. That's his message.

 MR. KATYAL: And Congress hasn't stamped 

that out.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To say he -- you know, he 

can convey that message in some other way, how else does 

he do it?

 MR. KATYAL: With simulated messages, the 

written word. He has written an entire book about that. 

He has a whole variety --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Simulated dog fights would 

be okay under this statute?

 MR. KATYAL: Simulate -- absolutely. This 

statute leaves that in place, Justice Scalia. That's 

the key to understanding why this statute is not like 

the traditional statutes that come before this Court in 

which the government asserts some paternalistic interest 

and says viewers can't see this because of the offense 

of the message.

This statute has nothing to do with the 

offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry 

up an underlying market for animal cruelty.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It is not the exact same message, if you are 

forced in a popular debate that is going around this 

country now about the treatment of animals. To require 

one side to engage -- to use simulated images, which is 

exactly what the government's reply brief at page 3 

insists upon, while those who want to ban conduct are 

allowed to use real images. That puts the government's 

censorial thumb on the scale of public debate.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What about crush videos, 

which apparently were the focus of Congress's attention 

when it drafted these? Now, I suppose by an analogy to 

what Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog 

fighting videos, the people who produce crush videos 

think they have a message, and the message is that this

is -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some 

way to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a 

little animal to death.

 Do you think that is constitutionally 

protected?

 MS. MILLETT: I think -- I think there's 

a -- that a properly drawn law could very well, at least 

in my humble opinion, this Court would have to decide, 

survive strict scrutiny.

 There is also, I suppose, some argument 

whether it would fit into -- you wouldn't need strict 

scrutiny, you would fit it into an unprotected category 

of speech like obscenity or it would be the production 

issue that would -- like you have in Ferber.

 But what -- beyond that I do think we need 

to keep in mind a couple of things --

JUSTICE ALITO: You are not -- you are not 

even willing to say that that could be prohibited?

 MS. MILLETT: No, no. I think -- I'm saying 

that there are three alternative ways in which to get to 

it. My first if one is that not this statute, but under 

a properly drawn statute --

JUSTICE ALITO: Under a properly drawn

scrutiny. I'm not sure you would --

JUSTICE ALITO: Might. I would really like 

you to tell me whether it would; whether you are willing 

to concede. Because we are trying to determine whether 

this is overly broad. And this is the category of 

activity that Congress particularly targeted. So to me 

at least it's important to know whether at least as 

applied to what Congress principally had in mind, the 

statute could -- could pass constitutional muster. If 

it were, you know, as applied.

 MS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't want to, 

say this statute, because I don't think this statute --

but if the statute said, this -- I think this Court 

disagree -- it disagrees with me sometimes -- but I 

think this could pass constitutional muster. A statute 

that says the patently offensive intentional torture and 

killing of an animal for -- designed to appeal to the 

prurient interest for the purpose of producing the 

image, I think that would satisfy -- I think it would 

satisfy strict scrutiny. The Court might also decide 

that it's close enough to obscenity or it's like the 

Ferber production rationale. That's my position; there 

are sort of three ways it could be analyzed, a statute 

like that.

 That's not this statute and I don't think we

blanket net as wide as this one has that this means this 

statute is the mechanism, a lawful mechanism for getting 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one more -- one 

more question along the lines of Justice Alito. Forget 

this statute. Under a properly drawn statute, suppose 

that bull-fighting or pitbull-fighting is unlawful in 

every State. Could a theater have a live broadcast of a 

pitbull fight in Japan and charge ten dollars? And 

let's add the hypothetical fact that a lot of the 

revenue goes back to Japan and promotes more 

bull-fighting. Could a properly drawn statute prohibit 

that? And then perhaps Justice Scalia, Alito, has a 

follow-up question on his own hypothetical. Could a 

properly drawn statute prohibit that, that speech?

 MS. MILLETT: A properly drawn statute with 

the requisite congressional findings or record of a need 

to attack -- it sound to me like this is a need to 

attack production. As in child pornography, the fact 

that the image taking is legal overseas does not mean 

that it can't be prohibited here. And if you had the 

type of record of a statute that says we want to stop 

the production; it's not the content, it is the

production, as this Court explained in Free Speech 

Coalition for Child Pornography.

 But that is a statute that then wouldn't 

have -- either you would have to decide which things are 

in and out -- if you started saying animal cruelty 

production, but we we'll let the bullfights in but the 

pitbull fights out and the cock fights, then you'd have 

problems.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are asking whether or 

not that specific instance could be prohibited under a 

properly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's 

hypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you 

could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that 

conduct.

 MS. MILLETT: The theory -- I mean, 

ultimately this Court would have to decide whether 

Ferber is limited to an obscenity that's historically 

unprotected by the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your answer to my 

hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a 

properly drawn statute?

 MS. MILLETT: If this Court -- two things. 

It would have to be a very, very narrowly drawn statute, 

I think going to the production theory like Ferber; and 

the question I think before this Court would be, given

the nature of the harm that presumably would be found, 

the nature of the market, the synergistic effect, where 

the -- I am assuming the findings here would be that the 

crime and the image are one and the same, inextricably 

intertwined -- then maybe, although I still think it 

would be a bit harder because we are dealing with the 

First Amendment here. We don't make it up as we go 

along. At the time that the First Amendment was written 

dog-fighting was legal in this country.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the point -- the point 

I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are 

thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted 

does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the 

instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of 

things that do not communicate, but appeal to the 

instinct of sadism; and that is true when other 

creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who 

want to see them killed.

 Now, that's what you are saying. Now -- and 

I think maybe that's true. We don't have to decide 

that, perhaps. But the government says that is this 

statute, that is this statute read in light of its basic 

intent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as 

it achieves that objective. And you say that's not 

possible. Why not?

I haven't heard it in a legal argument in a long time.

that are so far off base that we're going, I think in my 

opinion, so far beyond construing ambiguity and doing 

instead what was asked of this Court and the Court 

declined in Reno v. ACLU, and that is to write the 

statute for Congress.

 The ambiguity, as, Justice Scalia, you 

explained -- you would have to excise this statute in 

and out, sever so many things. I don't know what you'd 

have left unless it's the statute I posited to Justice 

Alito, which might have a couple of words that overlap 

with this statute. But that is not statutory 

construction. This Court's job is not to write the

Court consistently under the First Amendment has 

required, not just the right words, but a record from 

Congress. In the First Amendment area we can't just 

posit the problems; we have to really have confidence 

that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- would this 

record support any ban? I mean, there was a real 

concentration on crush videos. So there is that. Is 

there anything else in the current record other than the 

crush videos?

 MS. MILLETT: No, there is not. And in fact 

they spent their time, as we said in our brief -- and 

this is perfectly accurate. Members of Congress, to the 

extent they discussed other things, kept saying in the 

floor debates: That's not in; bull-fighting's not in; 

dog-fighting's not in; hunting's not in; these things 

are not in. So they mentioned them in the context of 

saying these are not in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think --

I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, 

because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting 

from page 763: "The evil to be restricted so 

overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at 

stake." That was their articulation of the test. Now, 

why shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?

MS. MILLETT: I don't think that is a legal 

test that is adopted under the First Amendment. I think 

that is a description of the types of categories that by 

history and tradition had been outside the First 

Amendment and the rationale for why Ferber came in, 

which was, yes, there's overlap, but I think it actually 

bridges the world of obscenity and virtual incitement 

because you have the crime and the image one and the 

same wrapped up together.

 There is in this instance -- there are about 

five different ways that this is different from child 

pornography. The first is that there has never been any 

finding, any assertion, even by the government, that 

creating the image is the primary or sole motive for 

creating these images. It's not if you lock Mr. Stevens 

up -- if you throw away every dog-fighting video in the 

country tomorrow, dog-fighting will continue. It -- no 

one thinks that it will go away.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the government 

does. It says that is how you dry up the market.

 MS. MILLETT: But you don't dry up the 

market by having a sweeping value exception like they 

have here. If Congress wants to dry up the market, what 

Ferber says is there's two things that have to happen: 

One, you've got to prove causation. You can't simply

say, we got a problem, let's go first to the speech and 

cut that off as our first prosecutorial tool when we are 

not even ready to make the crime itself a felony, but we 

will make the speech a felony.

 You've got to prove causation, that these 

images cause the harm, they are one and the same with 

the harm as they are with child pornography. You also 

have got to prove that Congress is acting in an 

evenhanded way. It is not leaving, as Justice Scalia 

said, appreciable damage to the interests that its 

asserting uncovered by its many, many exceptions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question 

about your view of the breadth of the statute. I didn't 

yet really get an answer out of your opponent. Do you 

think the statute would prohibited depictions of hunting 

if it involved killing in the District of Columbia, 

because hunting as I understand it is not allowed in the 

District of Columbia, it's prohibited. Does that mean 

that any depictions of hunting that show the killing and 

cruelty are prohibited by this statute?

 MS. MILLETT: Well, they are prohibited 

subject to the value police and the value trial like we 

had here, which I think is antithetical to the First 

Amendment. It's a very different rule under the 

obscenity statute. So it would all depend on whether a

jury decided that that had serious value, which was 

defined as significant and great import in this 

particular case. That would decide whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just not significant 

value; significant artistic, educational. What are the 

others? Scientific?

 MS. MILLETT: Scientific, social, artistic, 

journalistic --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Strictly entertainment 

value doesn't count, does it?

 MS. MILLETT: No, it does not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And most of the hunting 

videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment. 

They like to see a hunt.

 MS. MILLETT: I think that's exactly right 

and that's what the Safari Club and the NRA have told 

us.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, but 

this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of 

thin air. They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in 

Miller recognized that they were significant in causing 

the restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional 

muster.

 MS. MILLETT: First of all, this is about 

-- this is Miller doubled -- there's a lot more here

-- categories here. But it's a very different role 

that value plays under Miller in obscenity. First of 

all, this Court made quite clear again in Reno v. ACLU 

that Miller only works if you have all three prongs. 

You can't just use the serious value prong to take 

care of your constitutional problem. Second, you were 

dealing in an area that by history and tradition is 

unprotected speech. Milller --

JUSTICE ALITO: But in determining whether 

this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all 

of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that 

might fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the 

District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with 

a goose and say, "Well, we've thought of a lot of 

hypothetical situations where this statute might apply 

and therefore it's overly broad"? Or do we look at 

what's going on in the real world?

 MS. MILLETT: I think what you do is you 

look at text of the statute, and then you ask yourself, 

how much of a strain is it to come up with a factual 

pattern that will fit into it? In Williams you had to 

first of all read the --

JUSTICE ALITO: So we really think of all 

the hypotheticals. That's how you think we determine 

the constitutionality of this under the overbreadth

doctrine?

 MS. MILLETT: I think at some level Congress 

has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in 

the First Amendment area, and the only way to ensure 

that happens is to look at the text and say, does this 

text fit the purpose, does it fit what the Constitution 

will allow? And when the --

JUSTICE ALITO: If it's the fact that during 

the ten years when this statute has been in effect there 

has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows 

on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible 

change in the real world is that these -- is that the 

market for crush videos dried up, at least until the 

Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance?

 MS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't think it 

does for this reason. People -- and this gets a little 

bit to Justice Kennedy's vagueness concern. People have 

a right to know how to -- outside the courtroom how to 

conform their conduct to the law. If I got a call from 

the general counsel of Outdoor Channel or someone making 

hunting videos and they said, "Does this fall within 

this statute," I wouldn't have to come up with a 

strained factual scenario. I would say yeah, it falls 

squarely in, subject to a prosecutor or jury anywhere 

where you market in this country, deciding that it has

serious -- one of the adjectives -- value. I would have 

to say that to that person, and that would be accurate 

legal advice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be that the reason 

hunting videos are still out there is that the producers 

were quite confident that this Court would not allow 

them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as 

this.

 MS. MILLETT: One would hope, and I think 

quite frankly the NRA has been quite honest when it 

recently said you know, this -- this is not an actively 

enforced statute. People were shocked to learn -- to 

become aware of it.

 Now maybe everyone's supposed to know the 

existence of laws, but I think the reality is that once 

people looked at what this said, they became very, very, 

very concerned, and I think when you're talking about a 

criminal prohibition here -- this is not a civil suit, 

this is criminal prohibition with severe penalties. The 

penalties for speech are higher than most animal cruelty 

statutes. And the whole point of the criminal law is to 

deter conduct and to make people stay wide of the 

margins here, wide of the borders.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your 

answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would 

be situations where this statute could be 

constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could 

draft a statute.

 MS. MILLETT: Not this statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not this statute. 

But --

MS. MILLETT: That's different. I think 

that's very different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if in fact there 

were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted 

statute could be applied to particular instances, 

perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that 

enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and 

then we will consider as-applied challenges?

 MS. MILLETT: I think in the First 

Amendment -- I'm not talking -- if I heard you right we 

were not talking about this statute. If you have 

another statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I am just 

trying to get at what your understanding of what the 

test is for overbreadth in this area. How much of an 

area of constitutional application is necessary before

you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its 

face, but will consider as-applied challenges?

 MS. MILLETT: Right. And this Court has 

been clear that the overbreadth has to be both 

quantitative and qualitative. It hasn't set a 

particular ratio. I think this one is easy. We are 

talking about 2,000 crush videos and tens if not 

hundreds of thousands of other images that are captured 

by this statute. I think normally when this Court says 

it wants to -- to apply overbreadth, it has been dealing 

with situations for the most part in two contexts. One 

where Congress has already regulated in an area that is 

unprotected under the First Amendment, unprotected in 

the sense that they are allowed to ban, regulate 

heavily. They are already there, and the question is 

did they draw the margins too broad?

 That is not this case. We are dealing in an 

area that was never until December 1999 barred by 

anybody, never considered to be outside the conception 

of the First Amendment's freedom of speech. The other 

scenario where we see substantial overbreadth is when 

Congress is regulating conduct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't that -- isn't 

that due to changes in technology? Before people could 

show -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing

would -- would be very difficult.

 MS. MILLETT: This covers photographs, so 

this would go back as far as photographs. I'm not sure 

it wouldn't cover a sketch artist or a hieroglyphic, for 

all I know. All it requires is that it be a depiction 

in some form.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- in the real 

world is there a market for sketches of dog fights?

 MS. MILLETT: I don't know if there's a 

market --

JUSTICE ALITO: People get a thrill from 

seeing that?

 MS. MILLETT: With respect, I can't answer 

that. I'm not -- I don't know if there is a market for 

dog fighting videos. There is a few, but it depends on 

what you mean by a market. Will somebody buy something? 

I guess somebody in this world will buy anything.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any indication 

that there has been any dry-up of the market for dog 

fights as a result of this statute?

 MS. MILLETT: There --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Alito suggested 

that until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were 

fewer crush videos produced. But with respect to dog 

fights, animal fights, is there any indication that

there has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as 

a result of this statute?

 MS. MILLETT: None whatsoever, and in fact 

what we've seen is robust enforcement, and we cite the 

article in our case, we have seen robust enforcement; 

there was just an arrest a few weeks ago for I think a 

couple hundred people involved in dog fighting rings. 

So the dog fighting rings are going on unabated and they 

are getting found and discovered and prosecuted 

successfully, and in fact the images sometimes help with 

the prosecution.

 This is a place, when we start talking we 

are going to take something outside the First Amendment, 

one of the other things that unifies the categories of 

speech outside the First Amendment is a judgment that 

more speech doesn't work. This is an area where we know 

speech works powerfully. Speech about these ugly images 

produced this statute. It informed people. Unlike 

children and child pornography, people need to see 

images to understand what's going on with animals, and 

to make these important decisions and engage in these 

important debates that our society is having.

people to see molestation of children because then they 

will be outraged and they will enforce the statute more.

situations between dealing with the subject, a very 

topical subject that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that 

we ought -- if there is a significant chance that 

Congress can affect an illegal market, an illegal 

activity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to 

Congress on that ground. I think you still have speech 

arguments.

people hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the 

opposite, it seems to me. On the right under the First 

Amendment of people who like bull fighting, who like dog 

fighting, who like cock fighting, to present their side 

of -- of the debate.

 And unless it's a subject like obscenity, 

which from the beginning has not been considered 

protected speech, it seems to me that side of the debate 

is entitled to make its point as -- as forcefully as 

possible. That's it seems to me what the problem is 

here. Not --

MS. MILLETT: I think that is 100 percent 

right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's 100 percent, 

then what about people who --who like to see human 

sacrifices? Suppose that is legally taking place 

someplace in the world. I mean, people here would 

probably love to see it. Live, pay per view, you know, 

on the human sacrifice channel.

 (Laughter. )

 JUSTICE ALITO: They have a point of view 

they want to express. That's okay?

 MS. MILLETT: The problem with this statute 

is that presumably that statute would be even-handed and 

would it not say if the sacrifices were religious, or

journalistic, or historic. Or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can create a lot of 

First Amendment horribles. What about -- what about a 

new Adolf Hitler? Can we censor any depiction of that 

new Adolf Hitler and the horrible things that he is 

proposing, including extermination of a race? Is that 

proscribable under the First Amendment? Is that any 

less horrible than the human sacrifice contemplation?

 MS. MILLETT: No, Justice Scalia. Again, I 

agree, because what the First Amendment says is we 

allow --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; you agree 

you can prohibit it, or not?

 MS. MILLETT: I agree that, just because 

something is repulsive, incredibly offensive or maybe 

even involves some harm to people does not mean that --

depictions of it that do not cause that harm, that are 

not integrally tied to it, that are not the purpose and 

animating motivation for that harm cannot be proscribed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was your answer to 

Justice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?

 MS. MILLETT: The -- if -- at a minimum, 

Congress has got to be evenhanded. The point there is 

that you are trying to say we are concerned about the 

creation for purposes of the image. We are concerned

about what the government calls the "snuff video 

situation."

 This whole reason that this is created is 

for purposes of creating the image. If you establish 

the causation -- and I don't think we -- the Court does 

just defer to Congress on these things.

 It looks carefully at factual records in --

as it has in the child pornography are under the First 

Amendment, Justice Kennedy. If Congress proves the 

causation and shows that it is -- it's the least 

restrictive means -- compelling and least restrictive 

means, the strict scrutiny that Congress -- the 

government never wanted this statute to march through.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And what if there is no 

chance of drawing up the activity? Suppose you have the 

ethnic cleansing channel on cable TV, and there is no --

this is taking place in a country that's beyond our 

power to influence. Congress couldn't prohibit that?

 MS. MILLETT: The -- the fact that conduct 

is repulsive or offensive does not mean we automatically 

ban the speech. You would have to have -- it would have 

to follow this Court's patterns, either it would be an 

even-handed ban on production, under the Ferber theory, 

or you would have to establish if those images were 

never within the constraints.

JUSTICE BREYER: I think what -- I think 

what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two 

things. One is you are trying to produce education 

about something that has no communicative value.

 In so far as you are trying to make an 

argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the 

government, here, is saying I think the statute is 

intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's 

hard to draw a line.

 Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing 

which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's 

worst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to 

advocate it.

 It is to try to make money out of it, and 

that's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed 

at.

 MS. MILLETT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's why they have the 

journalistic exception.

 MS. MILLETT: The -- when it comes to 

promoting illegal conduct, we have the Brandenburg Test,

causing it -- which I think is where Ferber, largely, 

is. They are just intertwined. That's one thing. But

disgusting, despicable channel doesn't mean that we 

automatically ban it. Maybe it will be educational. 

Maybe we will learn from it.

 I think Congress is going to have to show, 

before it goes to speech as its first tool of repression 

to attack conduct with, very specialized, narrow 

circumstances.

drug that is known to kill people.

 MS. MILLETT: That is commercial --

JUSTICE BREYER: We are advertising --

MS. MILLETT: That is commercial speech.

make it commercial speech.

 Samuel Johnson, himself, said that no one 

but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money. I don't 

necessarily agree with that, but it is -- it would be a 

shock to him, to Thomas Payne, who sold his tracks of 

"Common Sense," that the First Amendment would go all --

leap all the way from commercial speech and say, just

to people's worst instincts in the area of the First 

Amendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to 

the government to decide what are people's worst 

instincts.

that's what it means.

movies cannot be made.

Amendment. The answer --

theories --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Adolf Hitler, can we keep 

him off the screen, too?

 MS. MILLETT: It's a dangerous proposition. 

That's what the First Amendment says we won't do. There 

is -- so if it's just that we don't like the content, 

outside obscenity, we -- Congress doesn't get to ban it. 

The answer is more speech.

 If you have got --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we don't like --

we don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a 

law saying you cannot have a channel that shows human 

sacrifice -- real human sacrifice. You think that is 

unconstitutional?

 MS. MILLETT: I think, if the point is that 

we don't like the could content, we don't -- we want to 

protect people from these images, the First Amendment 

says a lot about that.

a pure content baseline.

 It is -- we got to stop -- we can't stop the 

conduct. The conduct and the speech are inextricably 

intertwined. The only way we can stop human sacrifice 

is to stop the image because the sacrifice is solely 

for the image.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but, I 

mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it. 

It is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice 

taking place wherever in the world, so that that 

argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table.

 In that situation, you think it's 

unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there 

can be no human sacrifice channel.

 MS. MILLETT: I -- I think the fact that --

I think it would be a lot harder under the First 

Amendment to say why Congress is doing that.

 If it's not something -- if it's not conduct 

it has any authority to regulate, I don't -- then the 

only compelling interest is -- I'm trying -- I mean, I 

don't want to watch this channel, and people should 

fight with their wallets and their votes and not support 

these things, but -- I'm sorry.

 May I finish?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Go ahead.

MS. MILLETT: But, under the First 

Amendment, if the only rationale Congress is giving is 

we are here to shield your eyes for you, we will make 

this censorial decision, it has got to find some basis 

to think that was never freedom of the speech under the 

First Amendment, in the way that obscenity was.

 You don't get to make it up as you go along. 

We are interpreting a constitution.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

 Mr. Katyal, you have three minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KATYAL: There is one analytic move 

Congress made in Section 48, which is simple and 

obvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice 

channel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself.

 That is the logic of Ferber. When Congress 

tries to dry up a market for underlying cruelty by 

targeting depictions and leaves alternative mechanisms 

for that expression in place, the legislature has 

latitude.

 When the statute is not aimed at the 

communicative impact of the message, like the Hitler 

video, but, rather, is aimed at reducing underlying acts

of exploitation, that is an area which Congress has 

great leeway.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Are 

you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this 

country and no market to be dried up, the videos would 

be okay?

 MR. KATYAL: I'm saying that, if Congress 

identified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video 

market was driving, somehow, people to get killed, 

Congress would be fully within its power to regulate it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah; but we don't have any 

human sacrifice. Nobody's doing that stuff. So you 

could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.

 MR. KATYAL: That's precisely correct, but, 

here, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal 

cruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a 

brief before you saying that Section 48 is a success 

story, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has 

reduced the market for animal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many prosecutions 

have there been for crush videos?

 MR. KATYAL: There -- there haven't been any 

prosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is 

because the market dried up very quickly after the 

enactment of Section 48.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did I just 

understand you to agree with your colleague on the other 

side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice 

channel because there would be no connection between 

drying up the underlying activity?

 MR. KATYAL: Oh, no. If there is an 

underlying argument --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I'm saying there 

is no connection. We can't reach the activity where it 

is taking place.

 MR. KATYAL: I think that does start to 

reach into questions about obscenity and expressive 

impact on viewers, which is not before this Court. 

Congress is not resting its judgment here on something 

saying these images are repulsive and can't be seen.

 Rather, it is saying --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress is --

and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time.

 So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just 

don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice 

channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do 

that?

 MR. KATYAL: Again, that raises a whole 

different set of questions under obscenity and 

expressive impact that isn't before the Court here.

Now, if I could return to, Justice Stevens, 

you had he wasn't clear on the position on hunting. I 

want to be very clear on this.

 Hunting, like the other hypotheticals, is 

not covered by section 48 for two reasons: First, the 

statute -- the statute's term "animal cruelty" should be 

defined to encompass torture, mutilation and the like, 

and not simple acts of ordinary hunting, most of which, 

by the way, are legal anyway under animal cruelty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How about the statute's 

term, "kill" --

MR. KATAYAL: And again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what should that be 

interpreted to mean?

 MR. KATYAL: And again, Justice Scalia, as I 

said before, I think that comes within a definition of 

animal cruelty. That's the term being defined. And 

just as this Court has defined, for example, crimes of 

violence to exclude certain things that otherwise would 

be within the statute, such as drunk driving offenses in 

the context of the IMA, a similar result is possible 

here, particularly because of the doctrine of 

constitutional avoidance.

 And, so, we are saying that if this Court 

were to write an opinion that made clear that these

things are outside of the purview of section 48, there 

would be no chilling effect, and you wouldn't have to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wait, I want to just be 

sure I understand you. Even if the hunting depiction is 

very offensive and cruel and all the rest, and that the 

cruelty to the animal using bow and arrows or knives or 

something, you say it's not -- and even if it's illegal 

in this particular jurisdiction, you say the statute 

still does not apply at all?

 MR. KATYAL: It would have to be for a 

reason of animal cruelty or something like torture, 

mutilation and the like. So there may be certain 

hunting examples that fall within it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the hunting would 

never qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is 

that what you are saying?

 MR. KATYAL: No, it has nothing to do with 

the motive, it has to do with what happens to the 

animal. And, so, there could be images of hunting which 

are not really hunting, like the images in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you shoot a little low 

and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you 

didn't intend that.

 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, with all due 

respect, I think the images in this case and what

Congress was getting at was not shooting a little low. 

These are the most horrific images that you can imagine 

of cruelty to living animals. And that's what 

Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But what about your 

response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter? I 

understand Congress wasn't directed at --

MR. KATYAL: And my point if those -- if 

there are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas, 

that is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not 

what this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the 

Third Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire 

statute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000 

crush videos and the like.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

both counsel, for very able presentation. The case is 

submitted.
