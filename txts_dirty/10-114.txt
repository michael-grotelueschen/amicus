 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 10-114, Fox v. Vice.

 Mr. Rosenkranz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Mr. Fox has rock-solid legal claims against 

a police chief based upon facts that were strong enough 

to send that police chief to prison. Yet he's been 

ordered to pay all of the attorney's fees for an entire 

2-year course of a litigation because his lawyers 

decided to plead and then drop a single Federal theory. 

That award is wrong and it's not what Congress intended. 

Congress wanted to protect defendants from the lying or 

the vexatious plaintiff who shouldn't be in court at 

all.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did we take the case on 

the assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may 

disagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption 

that this was a frivolous cause of action?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the Court took 

the case on the assumption that the legal theory was

frivolous, but that the underlying cause of action, 

which is to say the operative facts, were meritorious; 

and in fact they are meritorious. They are going to 

trial in 2 weeks. And so this is a wrongdoing defendant 

against whom was pled a legal theory that we now assume 

was frivolous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. I mean, my 

goodness. You could say the same underlying facts 

justify, you know, a suit for -- for libel, and also 

justify a much -- a much greater suit. I'm not sure 

that we look to simply the underlying facts. We look to 

what kind of liability was sought to be imposed upon the 

defendant. That's what determines how much money the 

defendant is willing to pay for his lawyer, and how much 

he has to expend in defending.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, in this case 

the liability was far greater for the State court claims 

than for the 1983 claims. But Congress was concerned -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's not quite 

right. To the extent they overlapped, even on the 

theory the Federal claims were presented, the plaintiff 

below was seeking attorney's fees -­

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- under 1983.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That was -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the city's liability 

would be greater.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That was one incremental 

increase. But the liability in this case on the 

constitutional claim was for, and the reason it was 

found to be frivolous, was that he was seeking liability 

on a constitutional claim for being deprived of his 

right to run for office when in fact he won the office. 

The intentional infliction of emotional distress, the 

reputational harm was far greater.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew 

that, though, from day one. This case is brought in 

State court, it's removed to Federal court. Ultimately 

the plaintiff says: I recognize that as a matter of law 

my 1983 claim is no good. But the plaintiff didn't say 

that until 18 months after the -- the transfer. So 

doesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for 

running up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening 

the Federal court, having discovery in Federal court, 

instead of saying when defendant removed the case -­

either dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that 

point that it had no merit so it's only the State 

claims.

 I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff 

bear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal

court for 18 months?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is partial 

responsibility, yes, Your Honor. But let's -- and I 

think Your Honor is correct to be looking at the 

burdens. The burdens of the discovery were all the 

same. It was the same nucleus of operative facts. Now, 

if this was indeed frivolous from inception, the 

defendants could easily have filed a motion to dismiss. 

It should have taken no time at all. And if there was 

incremental increase in discovery with respect to the 

Federal claims, then the defendants have only themselves 

to blame for not having moved to dismiss early on.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if Mr. Fox had filed 

two -- two actions, the Federal claim in Federal court, 

the State claims in State court? Now, the Federal claim 

is handled in the same way that it was here. It's found 

to be frivolous. Would not the defendants be entitled 

to all of the time that they spent preparing for the 

Federal court case?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And they're simultaneous, 

simultaneous, Your Honor? I -- that's a much harder 

question. I think the answer would be yes, they would 

be entitled at least to those incremental increases in 

the burden, but if -- if they're doing discovery on both 

cases, they can't say: Oh, well this is the -- all of

the discovery was Federal discovery, none of it was 

State discovery, when they were on the same facts.

 It's the incremental burden when you've got 

these, these intertwined -­

JUSTICE ALITO: You're proceeding on the 

assumption which I -- I think is certainly, based on 

what I know of the record, true here, that the State 

claims are far from frivolous. But how is -- let's take 

another case, where it isn't clear whether the State 

claims are any more meritorious than the Federal claim. 

Then how is the Federal judge supposed to handle the -­

the calculation of attorney's fees in the separate 

Federal suit?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, your Honor, we're still 

operating on the hypothetical that they're separate 

cases -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Yes.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- not intertwined? 

Because my answer might be different.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the facts are -- the 

facts are intertwined, but they're two separate cases.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You have claims of unknown 

merit in State court; you have a frivolous claim in 

Federal court.

MR. ROSENKRANZ: My answer to that 

hypothetical is the same as our point two, that if there 

is -- if there are fees to be awarded at all, they have 

to be fees that are tethered to the rationale for there 

being a right to attorney's fees in the first place, 

which is what was the incremental burden of the Federal, 

of the Federal lawsuit? And a judge would say -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you calculate 

that? I mean that -- that's what the question was.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, it would 

be very easy in this case. What you do is you look for 

entries or ask the defendant to come forward with 

entries that say this was specific to the Federal 

lawsuit; I had to -- I had to file a removal notice, I 

had to litigate over -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an incredible 

burden to impose on the district court. It's hard 

enough for clients to read through these billing records 

and figure out what's valid and what's not, but to ask 

the district court to then go through and look at it, 

and see -- and maybe it doesn't say, you know, "1983 

suit," "State suit." Maybe it's just an entry. And 

then you've got to go through entry by entry and say 

well, now, was that for the 1983 action or was that for 

the State court action?

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that seems -­

just -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems 

to me to be an especially odd burden to impose when 

you're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose 

of discretion to the district court in the first place.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, let me then 

start -- move back to our overarching point, which is 

that these are the sorts of incremental burdens that are 

trivial, if they exist at all, and that shouldn't be 

awarded attorney's fees at all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe in your 

case, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be 

cases where the things are flipped, and the Federal 

claim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than 

a factual one, is the dominant driving force in the 

litigation and you've tagged on a few other State 

claims.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, that's a key 

point in our presentation. It actually doesn't matter 

whether it's flipped or not. The factual foundations 

are the same, by definition, for all of the legal 

theories, so the factual -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, there -­

there are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because,

first, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under 

cover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary 

in the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show 

that Vice was an official policymaker for the city. 

Those are discrete issues that relate to the 1983 claim 

but have nothing to do with the extortion/defamation 

claim.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Indeed, Your Honor, and so 

let me answer that question in two ways. First is, if 

the defendants see a complaint, a 1983 theory, that is 

flawed at the inception, they have no business incurring 

costs with respect to color of State law or policymaker 

or not. They should move to dismiss on the theory that 

is presented on the face of the complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a pretty 

audacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause 

of action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time 

responding to it.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no, Your Honor. My 

point is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a lot of 

chutzpah.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: You Honor, that's their 

point. They're saying it was frivolous on the face of 

the complaint. Well, if it was frivolous on the face

from inception, they should have moved to dismiss from 

inception.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you shouldn't 

have filed it.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I understand the argument, 

Your Honor, but the Seventh Circuit has a very good 

opinion that's cited in the brief that explains that 

when the defendants are just racking up fees on a claim 

that they claim is frivolous, that they could have filed 

a motion to dismiss on, they shouldn't be racking up 

fees on that claim.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I 

understand what legal analysis you're proposing? Your 

blue brief seems to suggest, as does your argument a few 

minutes ago, that you want the Sixth Circuit's rule, 

which is the only circuit that applies this rule, that 

says when the facts are identical and intertwined, the 

defendant gets no fees.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of the other 

circuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that 

extreme. They say something closer to what you started 

with, and your yellow brief suggests, is a but-for 

cause: The defendant is entitled to those costs related

to the defense of the frivolous claim. Which of the two 

theories are you advocating?

 And then a separate question, of what 

standard of review should be imposed in those situations 

in which the activities are so intertwined, but there is 

still a core essence of defense of the Federal claim, 

which is some of the hypotheticals my colleagues -­

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Let me 

begin by -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- correcting the premise, 

if I may, Your Honor. The Sixth Circuit is an outlier, 

but the Sixth Circuit is an outlier because it says if 

you have got a lawsuit with related and completely 

unrelated claims, no fees at all. The majority rule, 

the clear majority rule, is the rule that says no fees 

at all when you've got intertwined claims. That is the 

Sixth -- which also has that other piece -- the Second, 

the Ninth, and the Eleventh. And that is the rule -­

that is the primary rule that we are advocating: No 

fees if they're intertwined, because the burdens of 

demonstrating that a legal theory is frivolous are 

minimal. But we have a backup -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there are difference

but I'll accept your proposition.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And, Your Honor, I would 

encourage the Court to look at the -- at the Schwartz 

treatise, which says what I've just articulated is the 

clear majority rule, not just among the circuits, but in 

the district courts, where circuits haven't weighed in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I clarify what 

you mean by "completely intertwined"? You mean there is 

no incremental work just on the Federal action?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. What I 

mean by "completely intertwined" is that they arise from 

the same core of operative facts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you're 

looking for fees -- your first argument -- even though 

they can identify fees that were incurred solely on 

defending the frivolous cause of action?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm looking to block fees 

even though they can, and the reason is Congress was 

concerned about burdensome litigation, not about minor, 

trivial increases in litigation to utter three sentences 

about a legal claim and then say -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. That's 

an easier case. What if it's 20 percent spent on the 

Federal action? Do you still completely intertwine?

here is that the Federal action is completely frivolous. 

There shouldn't be 20 percent spent on the Federal 

action if they're all -- if they're all intertwined, if 

it's frivolous on its face.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's not 

completely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a 

demand for fees? What if it does take them, you know, 

40 hours to prepare the motion to dismiss it as 

frivolous? Do they get those 40 hours?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I guess I'm 

having trouble accepting the premise. It shouldn't take 

40 hours to tell a court, here's the claim and here's a 

string cite of 17 cases that say it's wrong.

 But let me then move to the -­

hours to do it, then it's probably not frivolous.

claim. The idea that it's going to be able to -­

doesn't reflect an adequate -- doesn't reflect a 

realistic understanding of Federal litigation.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I understand, Your Honor. 

Let me just make one other point about our first rule, 

and then move to the second rule.

 The point that was made earlier, that Your 

Honor made, Mr. Chief Justice, earlier about the burden 

on the Court is yet another reason why we shouldn't open 

up this new avenue of ancillary fee litigation. When 

it's just that incremental burden, we now have not just 

the burden of a frivolous claim, but the burden of 

courts addressing attorney's fees applications and 

the -- on the frivolous claim, and the burden of the 

courts now of defendants playing the games of 

withholding motions to dismiss that should have been 

brought earlier -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't want to have 

you adopt this phrase, but just to clarify, are you 

saying that it's a but-for test, that you get only those 

fees for time that was -- that would not have been 

incurred but for the frivolous claim?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So let me move now to the 

second argument, Your Honor, and the answer to that is 

yes. If there are going to be fees at all, the fees 

should be tied to the basis on which Congress is

allowing defendants to get fees, and that is defendants 

are suffering extra burdens; we want to protect them 

from those burdens.

 If that is the rationale, as everyone 

agrees, then the only fees that should be covered are 

fees that would not have been incurred but for the 

existence of the Federal claim, and that is, to the 

Chief Justice's question, actually not that hard to 

demonstrate. If plaintiffs keep good, accurate records 

and they know that they're going to be seeking or may 

well be seeking fees on the Federal claim, identify the 

few documents that are really -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not how 

it works. You say they know they're going to be seeking 

claims. They don't know in advance, this is going to be 

a frivolous claim, the discovery is going to be 

completely overlapping or it's not going to be 

overlapping. And most lawyers do not keep detailed 

accurate billing records. That's just an underlying 

reality.

 So I do think it's a significant burden on 

the district court to say, go back and read these -­

read these billing sheets, figure out which is which, 

presumably have litigation over it. Someone is going to 

file a motion for these fees; the other person is going

to say, no, no, it shouldn't be 20,000, it should be 

15,000. And our precedent in this area gives a huge 

amount of discretion to the district courts, just 

reasonableness. And it seems to me you're buying into a 

lot of litigation to decide whether it's 20,000 or 

15,000.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Which is one of my reasons 

for our underlying -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand you go 

back to the first point.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, let me -­

let me just explain how I think this works. First of 

all, a lawyer who is -- who has a Federal claim against 

him is duty-bound to start keeping track of the Federal 

issues early, just like the plaintiff who is going to 

seek fees is as well. But it isn't that hard, because 

the vast majority -- in an intertwined case like this, 

the vast majority of expenditures will be overlapping 

expenditures. All of the discovery, or most of it, will 

be overlapping.

 And the lawyer does have the obligation, 

then, to say if there are separate things, it's the 

burden on them -- that is, the defense lawyer -- to 

point out those incremental burdens that would not have 

been incurred but for -­

have to label that and figure the hours for that 

separately; similarly for whether Vice was an official 

policymaker, those hours that you are requiring that -­

instead of saying X number of hours for deposition of 

witness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that's 

what Hensley says. Hensley says general litigation is 

general litigation, and you don't try to parse it out, 

but if there are -- in the case of plaintiffs, that 

redounds to the benefit of plaintiffs, because the 

entire case, all the general litigation, could have 

contributed to the ultimate success.

 When it comes to the defendants, though, the 

general litigation costs could easily or almost 

certainly were incurred in connection with the overall 

defense, and so it makes perfect sense to say to them, 

break out the pieces, the documents that were really 

just about the Federal lawsuit.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And Mr. Rosenkranz, in this 

case what's your understanding of the approximate 

percentage of time that was spent on the Federal issues 

that Justice Ginsburg was talking about?

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Minuscule, Your Honor, and 

let me refer the Court to the supplemental appendix. If 

you look, for example, on page 30, that's where Vice's 

expenditures begin. It goes for 37 pages. There is but 

one reference to Federal law. It's like looking for 

Waldo, trying to find the theme that they claim was 

dominating this case, which is on page 38, one 

reference. And so I would say it's trivial. And 

particularly, then, if we layer over this the 

proposition that the district court -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: So there was no significant 

motions practice on these issues? There was no 

particular discovery on issues of State action and so 

forth?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: There was, and there was -­

and that was done mostly by the city. So the city was 

focused on -- there was motions practice about some of 

the legal theories, very little about the one that was 

purported to be frivolous. There was quite a bit about 

color of State law, policymaker, which, as I said 

earlier, certainly the district court should be -­

should be encouraged to ask whether those should have 

been incurred or whether there should have been a motion 

first, and then there was the removal petition, and then 

there were the arguments about whether it was frivolous

on the basis on which it was removed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the potential 

liability on the frivolous claim is much greater than 

the potential liability on the factually interrelated 

non- frivolous claims, and the defense argues that we 

spent a lot of time on -- a lot more time on these 

interrelated factual issues because of our fear of the 

greater liability on them than the frivolous claim?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: All right. Not this case, 

of course, and you know this is a hypothetical. The 

answer to that would be, I can imagine a district court 

being allowed to carve out an exception where they can 

say, well, we hired much more high-powered lawyers than 

we would have otherwise, and that was the -- responsible 

for an incremental increase.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, did the -- the 

district court here said they're intertwined claims, 

they all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled 

to full fees. The Fifth Circuit seemed to do the 

but-for test. Are you agreeing with that?

 It's -- the language it uses sounds like a 

but-for test: "A defendant is only entitled to 

attorney's fees for work which can be distinctly traced 

to frivolous claims. We are confident that the district 

court can assess the amount of attorney's fees

attributable exclusively to a plaintiff's frivolous

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is a correct quote, of 

course, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think they 

misapplied that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: What I would say, Your 

Honor, is not that they misapplied it. They uttered one 

sentence that was correct. And then -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Two.

Ninth and the -- and the other circuits that have the

joining what the majority of the circuits are doing.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, correct. So -- so 

they uttered those sentences, those are correct. The -­

the Fifth Circuit then applied a series of standards 

that bear no relation to the but-for test. The Fifth 

Circuit -­

every sentence after that is a direct contradiction of 

the but-for test. I mean, for one thing, it cannot 

possibly be true that you can apply a but-for test when 

no one has ever looked at the underlying records. The 

district court said it didn't have to.

 The Fifth Circuit said that the reason the 

district court was correct was because the main focus of 

the parties, what they had in their heads, was the 

Federal case.

 Under a but-for test it doesn't matter what 

they had in their heads. It matters whether the work is 

wasted, whether it's transferrable -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So they messed up the 

application of the but-for test. I thought the issue 

before us whether -- was going to be whether the but-for 

test is a proper test, not whether this particular 

court, having expressed a proper rule, misapplied it. 

don't care about that.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I -- I 

understand your point. We're disagreeing about whether 

this is simply a factual misapplication, which I believe 

it was not, or a statement of a series of standards that 

when district courts in the Fifth Circuit now apply 

those standards we'll never get to the but-for test, 

because they will always ask, well, what was on their

minds or what forum -- was the next sentence -- what 

forum was this litigation in? Well, it was in the 

Federal forum, therefore, they are just Federal fees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rosenkranz, I'm 

looking at the billing sheet, August 14, 2007, 32 hours, 

miscellaneous cost, online research. Is that for 

Federal or State?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's general 

research that I would say if the lawyers did not specify 

that this was for specifically incremental increase in 

the cost of the lawsuit on the Federal theory, then 

they've lost the opportunity to try to make that case.

 This is not a unique observation in civil 

rights litigation. Plaintiffs lawyers have to do that 

all the time. They -­

you've done this several times in the course of your 

argument, sort of equating, you know, the attorney's 

fees for frivolous suits with the normal attorney's fees 

that the plaintiff gets when the plaintiff is 

victorious. I'm not sure that we should treat the two 

situations about the same, because the plaintiff gets 

his attorney's fees whenever the plaintiff wins, 

whenever the plaintiff wins, whereas the defendant gets 

those fees only when the plaintiff has brought a

frivolous suit, which should not have been done, which 

is wrongful, which is perhaps sanctionable under Rule 

11. I'm not sure that we have to evenhandedly apply the 

same kind of rules.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I actually 

believe that the Court should not be evenhandedly 

applying the same set of rules, but we reached the 

opposite conclusion about which side gets the benefit of 

the burden. It is for plaintiff's benefit, for the most 

part, that this fee shifting provision was in the 

statute.

 Now, this Court has so drastically narrowed 

the range of cases within which a defendant is entitled 

to fees, that all we're talking about now is whether the 

Court is going to open up a new avenue of fee 

litigation, and that is not for the frivolous lawsuits 

but for the frivolous theory layered onto an otherwise 

meritorious lawsuit. If I -­

be no award of fees?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to focus first on the question 

of eligibility, but I do want to return later to why 

Hensley supplies the correct analysis for calculating 

fee awards.

 Much of Petitioner's eligibility argument 

rests on the notion that frivolous section 1983 claims 

imposed only modest or as he described them today, 

trivial burdens on defendants. And that's simply not 

the case. As amici who deal with these cases on a daily 

basis have confirmed, inclusion of even a frivolous 

section 1983 claim imposes significant additional 

burdens as part of the litigation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't you prove 

that?

 MR. STANCIL: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why can't you prove that 

in a but-for situation? Why don't you tell me what 

you -- your proposed standard is. As I understand it, 

you would say if the Federal claim is frivolous, then 

you're entitled to all fees, even if the State law 

claims overlap and have merit or potential merit. I 

think -- is that your position?

 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. I would like 

to clarify it. We are talking now about calculation of 

the award, assuming eligibility aside for the moment. 

And I'll come back -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Eligibility, it has to 

be a frivolous claim, that's -­

MR. STANCIL: Where eligible, the standard 

is, as under Hensley, what is the degree of overall 

success in proving that these claims are frivolous? 

Simply put, how much of the action or proceeding to 

enforce section 1983 was frivolous? And that's the 

standard set forth in section 1988.

 Section 1988 does not reference State law 

claims that may be factually overlapping.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the liability 

under the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability 

under the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the 

Federal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I

were the client, I would say your degree of success was 

zero. I still have to pay $100,000.

 The fact that you won on one claim but then 

lost the whole issue -- the whole value on another, I 

wouldn't call that a degree of success.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, that would be something 

that a district court would take into account as part of 

its discretion, and that's exactly the point of Hensley. 

Hensley says it's hard to pull some of these hours apart 

in the ordinary case.

 Now, this is not the ordinary case. I think 

that's clear. Here the plaintiff did not even press his 

State law claims in Federal court. Those claims, the 

district court found, were so deeply buried in the 

complaint that the plaintiffs were not even on notice 

that a defense to them was required.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how that -­

one can say that looking at the complaint. It said 

extortion, emotional distress -- where is the complaint? 

Let's look at it.

 MR. STANCIL: It's at pages 37 to 43 of the 

joint appendix, Your Honor. And I would -- I direct the 

Court to page -- specifically to pages 41 and 42 of the 

joint appendix.

actions of defendants; and that's where he lists past

claims were not sufficient reply pled -- this is on

characterized as State law tort law claims, but

Louisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the 

basis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal 

theories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant 

removed this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted 

to keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the 

Louisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly 

appropriate.

 The -- the claim alleged gave rise to 

extortion claim, the defamation claim; so this complaint 

was filed in Louisiana court that has a rule that says 

tell us what happened, and then you can have whatever 

legal theory you're entitled to.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor, but it 

included a Federal cause of action that allowed removal 

to Federal court, and once it's in Federal court, it's 

subject to the Federal rules for pleading a claim 

adequately and in specificity, and here the district 

court found these State law claims, there was not a 

whiff of them until the very tail end, 18 months later, 

when it was actually in response to the town of Vinton 

saying, by the way, just to be clear, there are no State 

law claims here.

extortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a 

criminal proceeding? So if you're looking look and you 

say what is the outstanding claim here, I would assume 

that it was the extortion.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, again, look 

at how the plaintiff used the fact of extortion. If you 

go -- this is the correspondents -- pardon me, the 

pleadings on summary judgment when plaintiff filed a 

motion for summary judgment. The defendant said you've 

said nothing about under color of law; this is an 

anonymous claim. He says he -- he didn't say this was a 

State law claim for extortion. He said, and this is a 

quote, he says: "It is not necessary to show that Vice 

was acting under color of law. The simple act of 

extortion is sufficient." He picked the section 1983 

horse. He rode it as far as he possibly could, and only 

at the 11th hour, when the district court finally called 

him on to the carpet, did he say, okay, I concede these 

claims have no merit, and then he backed off and then he 

wanted to go -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court was 

prompted to do that by your motion for summary judgment.

brought that motion very early on. If this is a 

frivolous claim on its face, then why didn't you move to 

have it dismissed immediately?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, that's a very important 

point, Your Honor. It I think is a false assumption 

that every claim or this claim or pieces of this claim 

are frivolous on their face such that you can look at 

the complaint and have it thrown out of court. I would 

like to point, Your Honor, specifically to the 

allegation -- this is on page 49 I believe of the 

appendix -- in which -- this is an allegation of the 

complaint where plaintiff says that Vice printed the 

extortion letter at the police station. Presumably this 

is in support of his under color of law theory.

 He's deposed -- this is on page 330 and 332 

of the joint appendix -- and Fox admits he had no basis 

for that claim. We can't walk into Federal court and 

say we know this is false, we know he didn't print this 

at the -- at the police station, he didn't use police 

resources to do it. We have to depose him, we have to 

marshal the facts, and then we have to go in on summary 

judgment and prove that.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil, can I get you 

to just think about a hypothetical with me? There's a

and a Federal claim; and the Federal claim is a really 

bad claim, it's frivolous; and it eventually gets tossed 

out, and it's -- it's labeled frivolous. But the State 

claim is a really good claim and it wins, all right?

 The plaintiff has requested $100,000 and the 

plaintiff gets $100,000 because he's won on the State 

claim. Now, here are the legal fees. The legal fees 

are 20 percent was incurred solely for the State claim, 

20 percent was incurred solely for the Federal claim, 

and 60 percent was incurred in both because there were 

overlapping issues and it's just impossible to tear them 

apart.

 MR. STANCIL: Okay.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: What are the fees in that 

case according to you?

 MR. STANCIL: It would be within the 

district court's discretion. I think it's going to be 

closer to 20 percent than to 80 percent. But again, 

this is the central message of Hensley, and I think 

it's -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So -- but -- so in 

other words, you're saying he gets all the work, the 

defendant gets the work done on the Federal claim 

notwithstanding that the plaintiff has gotten his entire

 MR. STANCIL: The burden -- the question is 

what is -- what does section 1983 authorize? It 

authorizes fees if you're a prevailing party entitled to 

fees in an action or proceeding to enforce section 1983. 

In Your Honor's hypothetical and in this case, there was 

only frivolous section 1983 claims. So in terms of 

fulfilling the -- the mission, the statutory purpose 

underlying section 1988, I think it would be incumbent

upon the district court to say, you know what, this 

entire -- you -- you triggered a fee-shifting statute, 

the entire section 1983 action was frivolous. And so I 

think it's within the district court's discretion to 

give them something more, between 20 and 80 percent 

under those -- under the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So but on that theory, 

the -- the plaintiff would be paying the defendant's 

fees for work done where the plaintiff won.

 MR. STANCIL: Because the plaintiff levied a 

frivolous -- not just a faulty or unsuccessful, a 

frivolous cause of action under section 1983, and this 

is the point of -- of why 1988 is different from, say, 

rule 11 and other provisions that limit bad faith 

actions. It's a policy choice by Congress. There are 

burdens allocated to both sides, and there are 

consequences or may be consequences within a district 

court's discretion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I thought what 

Congress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the 

only thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is 

the burden of the frivolous Federal claim. Your -- your 

answer to Justice Kagan is suggesting that even if the 

plaintiff wins, wins everything they were seeking, 

you're still entitled to 80 percent of your fees, even

though the Federal claim didn't add anything to your 

work -- to your work, except 20 percent?

 MR. STANCIL: To be clear, Your Honor, I'm 

not saying we would be automatically entitled to 80 

percent. I'm saying Hensley, under the principles of 

Hensley, the district court would have discretion to 

award more than 20 percent.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me why we 

would, given the differences that we've announced in 

Hensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing 

defendants -- because you can only prevail as to a 

frivolous fee. Why do we start with your entitlement to 

your entire fee and deduct from it, instead of starting 

the other way, which seems more logical, which is you're 

entitled to the fees related to your frivolous claim, so 

why don't you have to prove that first?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, I don't think it would 

matter to the outcome of this case, and I would like to 

come back to that. But the reason for starting at what 

does -- what is the 1983 fee in total, and working 

backwards from there, is based on -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. No, no, no. We're 

assuming a lawsuit that has -- as this one, that has 

both Federal and State claims and only one -- whether 

it's one frivolous Federal claim or multiple Federal

claims and two are frivolous, one is not, and there is a 

bunch of State court claims.

 MR. STANCIL: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do we start with 

your total fee and deduct down, rather than start where 

all the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can 

be attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only 

thing you're entitled to fees from?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, section 1988 is the 

answer, Your Honor. It says you get your fees, and -­

if you're a defendant and if it's frivolous. With 

respect to an action or proceeding to enforce 

section 1983, I think the but-for rule would make more 

sense if we were talking about non-frivolous 

section 1983 claims alongside frivolous section 1983 

claims, because there the pie that section 1988 is 

concerned about, the 1983 pie, is chopped up, but here 

we have a State law pie and we have a 1983 pie, and all 

of this pie, if you'll pardon the tortured metaphor, is 

frivolous.

 So you look at the terms of the statute. 

What has Congress authorized? Your fee for a frivolous 

section 1988 claim. We say, and for, I think, good 

reason, that it's consistent with the congressional 

purpose to consider whether to reduce that award. You

do not have to award them the entire pie, but I think it 

is a faulty assumption. It doesn't fulfill the purposes 

of section 1988 to say, well, if you invoke this 

frivolous claim and you put this fee shifting on the 

table, that you're immune from fee shifting as long as 

these claims are -- certain fees are relevant to both.

 But I do want to come back to why this makes 

no difference to the outcome of this case. Not only is 

that the standard that the Fifth Circuit announced and 

applied, but it is also the case that the only claims 

prosecuted in Federal Court were section 1983 claims. 

And here, we have to come back to -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stancil, the first 

magistrate to get this case said explicitly that the 

discovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court, 

would be usable in State court proceedings where those 

materials might aid in obtaining a judgment. So doesn't 

that have to be taken into account, that the discovery 

materials developed in Federal Court will now be used in 

the State court proceeding?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, there's a 

difference between saying these depositions may be used 

and saying they will be useful or finding that they 

would be significant to the disposition of the State law 

claims. The District Court said only -- the first

magistrate judge's opinion said only that these 

depositions may be used. This is a simple way of 

telling the parties, you know, don't come back to me and 

argue about whether this deposition was properly noticed 

and, you know, these questions and answers have been 

asked.

 But I think there's a more fundamental 

point, Your Honor, which is the District Court, in 

awarding fees, found there was no whiff of State law 

claims until the very -- very much the 11th hour in this 

claim. And this is precisely why, Justice Sotomayor, 

back to your question, we really need district courts to 

have discretion. If, as in this case -- we'll assume 

there are State claims and Federal claims, but as the 

District Court found, those State claims are deeply, 

deeply buried in the weeds. That's precisely the case 

in once -- in which the District Court needs to have 

discretion to say -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I assume you 

agree that discretion can end up going either way? You 

could submit time sheets that show 35 percent of our 

time was spent on the Federal case, and the district 

judge can say, you know, time sheets are subject to -­

manipulation is too strong a word, but I'm just not 

going to give you 35 percent; I'm going to give you 10

percent. That's a reasonable exercise of discretion. 

The judge doesn't have to say a whole lot about it and 

it's certainly going to be upheld on -- on appeal, 

right?

 MR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and this 

goes to the question of whether these standards are 

administrable. The abuse of discretion standard in fee 

awards has worked and worked fairly well for the better 

part of three decades. The surest way to invite 

satellite litigation over fees is to -- is to announce a 

rule in which you have to say, well, does it meet the 

but-for test or does it not meet the but-for test? Or 

with respect to even eligibility, to say, well, are they 

related or are they unrelated?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, every other 

circuit except for the Sixth has dealt with the but-for 

test or some variant of it. Even the Fifth did it in 

this case and ruled in your favor.

 What you're asking for is, I think, very 

akin to the opposite rule of saying if we dismiss the 

Federal litigation, you're not entitled to any fees, 

because this case was about -- is in Federal Court, so 

that's the only thing that matters. That seems to be 

your rule. Every other circuit has some variant of 

but-for, and they seem to manage it just fine. Nobody

likes attorney's fees.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, I think 

the -- I think the statement of the but-for test in 

application will become very -- will be very close to 

the test that we're espousing here, and here's why.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Espouse your test for 

me, because I still don't understand it except for 

flipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different 

predicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win, 

they're entitled to fees.

 MR. STANCIL: The district court has 

discretion to award fees fairly attribute to the portion 

of the lawsuit that is declared frivolous. That's the 

test. And here's why, in many cases, that's going to be 

similar to -- not identical, but similar to a but-for 

test. Usually, you will push these claims 

simultaneously, Federal claims and State claims 

simultaneously, and so there will be a lot of things 

that are -- that go in both directions.

 But in this case, a special case where you 

have -- Federal, Federal, Federal, that's all they said 

in District Court, this is -- and this is all over the 

record, where every time the case is described back and 

forth between counsel, after the moment of filing of the 

complaint until we get to the summary judgment

proceeding 18 months later, everybody calls this a 

section 1983 suit. And then at the last second, there 

is, oh, we have State law claims; let's go back to State 

court and litigate those. And where the District Court 

grants the Petitioner's -- the plaintiff's request to go 

back to State court, that's the right time when you need 

discretion to be able to award what just happened.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you reconcile the 

test that the Fifth Circuit said it was applying, which 

is -- seems to be a but-for test, with the fees that 

were actually awarded here?

 MR. STANCIL: Because the only work done at 

the time of the fee request was on a section 1983 claim, 

because the State law claims were not pursued. And that 

was the finding of the District Court that says, these 

claims were so deeply buried, you weren't even on 

notice. Now, there's a difference.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that certainly 

conflicts with the first magistrate. The first 

magistrate said use the material in the State for the 

State court proceeding.

 MR. STANCIL: Your Honor, I don't disagree 

that there are questions and answers in these 

depositions that will be used in State court, 

absolutely. But there's a difference.

What matters when a District Court is 

assessing fees and evaluating a fee request is, how was 

the case litigated while it was an action or proceeding 

to enforce section 1983? Not how could the case have 

been litigated; not how if you had also pursued State 

law claims, would these things have been relevant. And 

once these section 1983 claims, all of them, are out and 

declared frivolous, section 1988 ceases to operate in 

the sense that it's no longer an action or proceeding to 

enforce section 1983.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question I 

asked Mr. Rosenkranz?

 Here, the argument seems to proceed on the 

assumption that the State law claims are not frivolous 

and may well be meritorious, but suppose that the 

Federal Court was in no position to make that 

determination at the time of the remand. What is the 

Federal Court to do then?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, there are several 

options, and I would be remiss if I didn't specify that 

those State law claims will be hotly contested when they 

go to trial next month, and I don't want to leave any 

misimpression on that. But the District Court has a 

series of options.

 First of all, if the cases -- if the claims

are going back to State court, the party does have to 

file the motion for attorney's fees under rule 54. You 

have -- you have to go in and say, if you're -- if 

there's a judgment being entered, we want our fees. The 

District Court could stay the request, defer it until 

the State court rules on the State law claims. Those 

requests were not made here.

 So the District Court has lots of options. 

But where -- particularly where the plaintiff desires to 

go back to State court and the Federal case is coming to 

an end, the District Court must have the discretion to 

enter a fee award at that time. And in fact, that has 

been the case, and it's specifically mentioned in the 

House report to section 1988. The interim fee awards, 

where there's an order that disposes of substantial 

rights, are permitted. And again, this is why you want 

discretion in the hands of the District Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to us decide this 

case on the basis that it was only -- it was only a 1983 

claim for the entire time it was in Federal Court until 

the -- until the very end, right?

 MR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and that 

it was not -­

do? I mean, is that why we took this case?

can give attorney's fees right up to the limit of the 

fees expended, right?

announce the principle, that would helpful, which is, if 

the fees are fairly attributable, within the District 

Court's discretion, to the frivolous claim, they may be 

awarded, and then say "in this case," because it was 

only a 1983 -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think nobody doubts 

that, do they?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, the fees 

fairly attributable to a 1983 claim, Petitioner says 

they have to be only attributable to a 1983 claim. 

That's very much in dispute.

they were only attributable to a 1983 claim during all 

of this litigation except the very end.

would be happy to win on that basis. The Fifth Circuit 

said it and there was a reason that it was not an abuse 

of discretion, an abuse of discretion for the District 

Court to award them under these circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you disagree with 

the statement in the -- in the Court of Appeals opinion 

about, only for fees that can be distinctly traced?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. We think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your 

adversary to agree with that position. You'll need to 

switch sides, right?

 MR. STANCIL: We almost did, Your Honor. It 

would be -- it would be -- we win under either test, 

Your Honor, but I don't think that section 1988 is fully 

served by litigation over whether something is in the 

but-for clause -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument 

has focused, in reference to the complaint and all that, 

on the legal theories. Your friend has focused on the 

underlying factual basis, and all the litigation -- all 

the background work on the underlying factual basis, I 

don't know why that can be fairly attributed only to the 

1983 claim.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, because only the 1983 

claims were pressed. But -- but there's a -- I think, a

faulty premise in his position, which is that there are 

facts over here and law over here. Questions that are 

specific to section 1983, such as under color of law, 

municipal policy or custom are highly specialized, fact 

bound, mixed questions of law and fact.

 The idea that when we're deposing somebody 

on, say, Sheriff Vice or Chief Vice on his conduct in 

office that we're just looking at what happened, and 

that this is just a factual question, I think that's 

inaccurate.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what percentage of the 

work done has actually been useful to you in defending 

the State court claims, approximate?

 MR. STANCIL: I'm not in a position to 

answer that, Your Honor, because I'm not representing 

these parties in the State court, but I'll concede for 

purposes of today that some significant portion. I 

wouldn't put a number on it, but certainly the who, I -­

who, what, when, where, why is relevant to both, but 

it's relevant to how it was prosecuted in front of the 

district court.

 And again, I think we have to put ourselves 

back in the chair of the district court on the bench 

when that fee request comes in. Under Petitioner's rule

and they're going to be remanded at the plaintiff's 

request, the district court has to speculate, well, how 

is this all going to go in State court, how is this 

going to play out in practice? Are these claims going 

to be meritorious? Are they not going to be 

meritorious? Are they -- how much of this is going to 

go to that, and I think that's, frankly, not the 

burden -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's disembodying 

what -- we have a factual scenario here. Some of the 

discovery was spent in determining what happened with 

the alleged racial slur. Investigating the facts of 

that claim are certainly relevant to the State court 

proceeding.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor, and we 

don't -- we don't contest that investigating the facts 

are relevant to both, but it has to be pressed in 

Federal court. It has to be during the action or 

proceeding to enforce section 1983.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure what that 

means, because if you're taking discovery on the State 

law issues, defamation, extortion, et cetera, you're 

pressing it. At the point that the Federal action is 

dismissed you no longer can pursue that in Federal court 

to its conclusion.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then why would -- if you 

have a bunch of different claims and the facts support 

some of the State court actions, why should you be 

entitled to fees that you would have incurred in State 

court no matter what?

 MR. STANCIL: Because the district court 

here, and in this case, and it may not be in many cases, 

but in this case the district court found the complaint 

did not sufficiently allege these State law causes of 

action to put the defendants on notice that a defense 

would be required.

were part of this case? I'm hard pressed to believe

violations in the complaint such that defendants were

litigation. The record -- this is on -- that's on 32A 

of the petition appendix. It goes on to say, the record 

reflects that throughout the litigation the focus of 

both plaintiff and defendant was plaintiff's section 

1983 claim. And if you look at the -- the 

correspondence between the parties, the summary judgment 

papers, it is 1983 from start to finish, until -- well, 

until the 11th hour. And in fact there's even a 

specific statement in which the city, in an abundance of 

caution says, just to be clear, there are no State law 

claims here; and I think the district court is within 

its discretion. I would point the Court to the cases in 

which this Court has examined the standard of review for 

rule 11 decisions, and the Court has held in Cooter & 

Gell and in Pierce that we give district courts very, 

very wide berth on these questions, precisely because 

they're on the ground, they recognize what the -- what 

the standards are for pleading who is going to be on 

notice as to what, and this is a funny case in that 

regard. It's unusual in that these things were really 

put to the side and parked until the 11th hour.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In answer to Justice 

Scalia's question, basically the only difference you 

have with the -- with the Fifth Circuit is that you 

would say fees fairly attributable to Federal claims as

opposed to fees exclusively attributable to Federal 

claims; is that correct?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your presumption 

would be that if the fees are -- support both State and 

Federal claims, you're still entitled to fees?

 MR. STANCIL: But they have to be judged, 

and this is under the eighth of these Johnson factors, 

they have to be judged in the context of the overall 

suit or the overall action to enforce section 1983.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I still -- I don't 

understand what that means.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, if we were -- if we had

add-on claim, that it was a section 1983 claim, and by 

the way, you know, here are my breach of contract 

claims, and, you know, it may also be a taking; and 

nobody spent any time doing it and nobody spent a whole 

of lot of -- you know, worried about the taking claim.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want district courts 

to determine how important the 1983 claim was in 

relationship to the State claim?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.

 I actually like Mr. Stancil's cake metaphor. 

What matters is not how big -- how much of the cake was 

devoted to one claim versus another. What matters is 

how much more energy it takes to bake this particular 

sliver of the cake. It is all the same energy. The 

central piece of Mr. Stancil's argument is that the 

district court found that the focus was only on the 

Federal claims.

 That is a misreading of that one sentence, 

and Mr. Stancil keeps eliding the one critical word of 

that sentence, which was the district court said that 

they were not on notice that they needed to separately 

defend the State law claims. Our whole point is they 

did not need to separately defend the State law claims.

The district court was all turned around about the need 

to do something separate.

 And the reason we can be sure that Justice 

Sotomayor's reading of the complaint is the same as 

everyone else's is because the lawyers in this case, the 

defense counsel, did realize that there were State law 

claims. Their answers are rife with State law defenses, 

and I refer the Court to pages 50, 56, and 66 of the 

joint appendix. Each one of them has three separate 

reference to -- references to, if we are found liable 

under State law.

 The summary judgment motion to which Mr. 

Stancil refers has a response, an opposition by the -­

by the defendants, in which they caption -- this is on 

page 122B -- the caption is "State Law Claims Against 

the Town of Vinton." Now, that's that earlier summary 

judgment motion, that wasn't the 11th hour.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the Fifth's Circuit's 

statement -- if the Fifth Circuit's statement of the 

test it was applying is correct, would you say that that 

is a discretionary determination? The district court 

should have discretion in making the -- an 

apportionment?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, 

absolutely. There's a huge amount of discretion. Once

we set the rule, then the hours expended, were they 

reasonable, the rates, were they reasonable. At what 

point does the -- does the -- do the fees trigger, 

because it was unreasonable to delay, all of that is -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree an 

assessment of the relative significance of the frivolous 

and nonfrivolous claims would also be a factor that 

would go into that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I do not agree, Your Honor, 

because if you are -- if the defendant is properly in 

court and properly being forced to do discovery, the 

relative importance -- what was in their heads, what was 

motivating them is irrelevant, unless of course apropos 

of the earlier question, what was going on was they 

really ratcheted up because they lose sleep over Federal 

claims more than over State claims.

 But, you know, a slip and fall, if you layer 

on top of it a 1983 claim, no one's losing more sleep 

over it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if there's a cap on the 

liability for the nonfrivolous claim but not -- maybe 

treble damages on the frivolous claim?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I think that would be 

exceptional circumstance under which the district court 

would be entitled to take into consideration something

that's quite a bit more extraordinary. And so I'm not 

advocating an -- you know, hard and fast absolute rule, 

just a guideline of the sort that this Court routinely 

adopts. I mean, the notion that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was wondering kind 

of as a starting point, and I don't know why you would 

fight so vigorously against the verbal formulation 

"fairly attributable." I assume most district courts, 

when they get it, they're going to start by looking at 

whatever his affidavit, this is how much our fees were, 

and then if there's some reason, perhaps Mr. Stancil's 

case, where everybody thinks it's a Federal that's all, 

or maybe not, then they can just go "fairly 

attributable" rather than but-for, which gives the 

district court a lot more leeway and the sort of leeway 

we have always held in this area they should have.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I -- I 

actually believe -- if I may answer the question, it is 

quite a bit easier to apply a but-for test and review it 

on appeal than it is to apply a test that is just a 

mishmash of factors over, if which the stakes are high 

enough, and they will be under Mr. Stancil's rule, there 

is an enormous incentive to litigate to death.

 If there are no further questions -- I thank 

the Court for its attention.
