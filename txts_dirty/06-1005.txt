 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-1005, United States versus Santos.

 Mr. Roberts.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Seventh Circuit misconstrued the Federal 

money laundering statute by interpreting the term 

"proceeds" to mean profits. The statute prohibits the 

laundering of all the gross receipts of a crime, not 

just its profits. The primary meaning of "proceeds" is 

gross receipts, and the statutory context makes clear 

that's the meaning Congress intended here. The statute 

is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits 

of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal 

activities. But a profits definition of proceeds would 

constrict the statute in ways that can't be squared with 

that statutory objective.

 Because the word "proceeds" appears in 

the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of 

restrictions would apply to both concealment and 

promotion cases.

For example, the statute wouldn't cover 

expense payments that are structured to conceal the 

unlawful nature and source of the funds involved. That 

means that if an illegal gambling operator recorded the 

compensation that he paid his collectors as salary 

payments by a legitimate business that he owned, that 

that would not be covered under the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- so what?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Congress was trying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some rule up there 

that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as 

possible?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. That's not 

what we're arguing. What we're arguing is that there is 

no reason that Congress wouldn't have covered these 

transactions and that they implicate the objectives of 

the statute as revealed by its text, just as much as the 

transactions that are clearly covered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it -- I think it 

much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than 

that, that Congress would want to make all -- all 

betting operations like this a violation automatically 

of two criminal statutes.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I find that sort of, you

know, very strange.

 MR. ROBERTS: -- it is certainly true that 

illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur 

together, but that isn't a cause for concern. It just 

reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal 

businesses like gambling operations, like drug dealing, 

frequently generate large amounts of cash and they need 

to launder that cash in order to survive and to prosper.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is hard to see this --

that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being 

concealed. They're not -- the money that's being paid 

to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and 

necessary expense of the illegal business.

 So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing 

that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete 

statutes, one with much heavier penalties. That makes 

it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower 

penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's 

the same conduct that's violating both.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, it's not the same 

conduct in that the conduct here, the paying the winners 

and paying the collectors is not a required element of 

the gambling offense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh well, I mean -- come on. 

Nobody -- nobody runs a gambling operation without

paying off the winners. It's not going to last very 

long.

 MR. ROBERTS: And, true --

JUSTICE SCALIA: To make the paying off of 

the winners a separate crime from running the gambling 

operation seems to me quite extraordinary.

 MR. ROBERTS: It -- it -- it's true, Your 

Honor, that they're not going to last very long. 

They're not going to survive. They're not going to 

grow. That's because they need to commit money 

laundering in different ways to do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what 

happens if there's a -- two bank robbers, the one's with 

the get-away car; the other one going into the bank 

teller, and the robber that goes into the bank gets 

$1,000 and comes out and gives 500 to the get-away guy. 

Is that a violation of the statute?

 MR. ROBERTS: That is, if the -- if the 

payment would promote the continuing -- if they've got a 

continuing robbery operation and by paying him he's 

going to say, he's saying, you know, keep on continuing 

in the operation and let's expand it further.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then under your theory the 

employee who gets paid shows up for work the next

morning; and so, of course, under your theory it would 

be promotion.

 MR. ROBERTS: Your Honor, your question and 

a lot of the questions I'm getting, I think express 

concern about treating these transactions as promotion 

under the statute. But the question --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I would have the same 

concern if we were dealing with concealment.

 MR. ROBERTS: What I don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If the robbery takes place 

in a dark alley, is that automatically concealment?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, because what needs to be 

concealed, what there needs to be is a financial 

transaction that's designed, the transaction itself, to 

conceal the nature and source of the proceeds.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's going into the alley 

instead of doing it out on the --

MR. ROBERTS: I don't think that doing a 

robbery in the alley would be a financial transaction --

would be designing a financial transaction to conceal 

the unlawful nature and source of the proceeds.

 But if I can give you an example of --

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Roberts, isn't it true 

that the problems that are being highlighted are 

problems that result from expansive interpretations of

other concepts that are not before us here, expansive 

interpretation of promotion, expansive interpretation of 

concealment?

 The Seventh Circuit in the first appeal in 

this case interpreted promotion very broadly. And then, 

I guess it felt that it had boxed itself in and that's 

what led to this interpretation of proceeds. But if you 

interpret those other concepts more narrowly, you don't 

have the same kind of overlap.

 MR. ROBERTS: I agree with that, Your Honor. 

I was going to try to say to Justice Souter's question 

before that if you have concerns that these kind of 

expense payments should not be treated as promotional 

money laundering, the way to address those is not by 

adopting a profit construction of proceeds, because that 

would do tremendous violence to the statute in other 

ways.

 And I do think that there are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said, 

at least where the crime is a business-like operation? 

He gave the example of gambling, he gave the example of 

selling contraband.

 And it seems to me that he was narrowing his 

definition of proceeds to cases where the crime is not

robbery or a one-time event, but a business-like 

operation.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think it's difficult 

to interpret the proceeds, the term "proceeds," to mean 

something different for business operations than for 

other crimes because it's the same word. But even so, 

Your Honor, there are other ways --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you 

continue. I'm sorry. I didn't know you weren't done.

 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. I'm sorry.

 Even so, there are other ways in which a 

profits definition just makes no sense under this 

statute, besides the numerous concealment transactions 

that would be excluded that Congress would have no 

reason not to cover. It also would make no sense as 

applied to professional money launderers. Those are 

people who are hiding money for criminals as a matter of 

their business. Because they wouldn't be guilty of 

money laundering, even if they knew that they were 

concealing money that was generated by a Federal felony, 

unless they also knew that the money was profits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

answer to the line of questioning that we were having 

was that the problem would still be there, even if you 

limited this statute to profits. You take the two bank

robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that 

robs the bank, the other in the get-away car. If before 

the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away 

car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I 

had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get 

400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting, 

you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you?

 MR. ROBERTS: That's right. That's another 

point, Your Honor, that a profits definition itself 

isn't going to solve the problem of where the underlying 

crime and the money laundering --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It will solve a lot them. 

And unless you're willing to come in and say, yes, do it 

to us, give us a narrower definition of concealment and 

a narrower definition of what's a transaction, but 

you're not willing to do that. You're going to stretch 

that as broadly as you can.

 MR. ROBERTS: It's not going to -- it's 

not -- first of all, this case doesn't present the 

interpretation of promotion and the Court would be free 

to address that in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe the question 

presented doesn't present it -- -

the case do present it. I mean, it's theoretically 

possible we could agree with you on the profits issue, 

but nevertheless say this doesn't fit the promotion.

 MR. ROBERTS: You certainly could, Your 

Honor. But that would not be an alternative ground that 

would be appropriate for you to rule on in this case, 

because that issue was raised on direct appeal. It was 

decided against Respondents by the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand all that, but 

we can still do it if it's perfectly obvious that that's 

the right way to dispose of the case.

 MR. ROBERTS: You can obviously address any 

issue that you want to, Your Honor. But the ordinary 

rule is that issues that have been decided on direct 

review shouldn't be relitigated on collateral attack. 

The issue wasn't addressed by either of the courts below 

in these collateral proceedings.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't it be --

MR. ROBERTS: We do submit that it was 

resolved correctly in this case, because, as the Seventh 

Circuit held and as all the other courts of appeals have 

held about promotion, the payments to the winners and 

the payments to the collectors encourage the continued 

participation of the collectors and encourage the 

increased participation by gamblers.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, the Seventh 

Circuit in this case was following a precedent in 

another case and it thought that the defendant was would 

prevail under its theory.

 If this Court should say that that theory, 

that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't 

it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the 

question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit, 

your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a 

question that was not necessary for you to reach because 

you had your precedent on the profits issue?

 MR. ROBERTS: You could do that, but the 

question that I think that is concerning the Court was 

resolved by the Seventh Circuit in this very case on 

direct appeal. So on direct appeal, the argument was 

made by Mr. Santos that these transactions can't count 

as promotional money laundering because they're 

essential transactions of the business and that they 

don't promote the carrying on of the business, and the 

court of appeals rejected those arguments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You might well reject it if 

you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds. I 

mean, that rejection was connected with its acceptance 

of a narrow definition of proceeds. And if you're 

asking us to obliterate the latter, I don't know why it

isn't reasonable to send it back to the Seventh Circuit 

and say, well, you still said the same thing if you came 

out differently on the proceeds question.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we certainly would 

prefer that you did that than that you interpreted 

proceeds to mean profits because of the violence that it 

would do to the remainder of the statute, Your Honor.

 I was talking about professional money 

launderers before and how they wouldn't be guilty of 

money laundering if they were concealing money that they 

knew that was generated by a crime. And Congress --

there's no reason that Congress would have considered 

those professional money launderers to be less culpable 

merely because they might be laundering only illicit 

receipts.

 And It would be very difficult for the 

government to prove that professional money launderers 

knew that they were laundering profits because they 

haven't participated in the predicate crime.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I've got that point, but 

what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is 

underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of 

others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you 

launder money where the activity is an essential part of 

the underlying crime itself? And there are three ways

of dealing with that:

 One is this gross receipts method, which has 

the defects you mentioned.

 The second is a definition of "promotion" 

which says when you promote a crime that's different 

from engaging in the crime.

 And the third is sentencing; because it's a 

real offense sentencing method and where what you've 

done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the 

sentence should be nothing more than the underlying 

crime. I see three ways to get to the same problem, and 

you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're 

related. What do I do?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think you decide the 

question presented here and you decide that proceeds 

means that -- that proceeds means gross receipts, 

because that's the only meaning that makes sense with 

the statute.

 But the sentencing point you make is a very, 

very good one, Your Honor. And the fact is that the 

Sentencing Guidelines were changed in 2001 to align the 

punishment for money laundering when people participate 

in the underlying crime much more with the punishment 

level for the underlying crime.

 And -- you know, in addition, as we know,

the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and so courts 

could certainly take into account concern about 

overlap --

JUSTICE BREYER: But still your answer 

leaves me -- and I have no answer to this; I want yours. 

I want you to see that I'm in -- at risk here as a judge 

of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for 

you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear 

that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case, 

again. But if I could have them somehow together, I 

could look at the least evil way or the most efficient 

way of achieving the congressional objective.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that you can't 

have all of them together, Your Honor, unfortunately. 

But I do think that we would say that out of the three 

that you raised, the best way to deal with concerns 

about this would be in the sentencing context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find that extraordinary. 

You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume 

Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it 

this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same 

activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry 

about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing.

 I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad.

just not exactly the same activity, because people can 

commit gambling without commit money laundering. They 

can be guilt of illegal gambling without being guilty of 

money laundering --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Straighten that out in the 

definition of the crime, rather than in the --

MR. ROBERTS: But they can be -- even under 

this definition, Your Honor. In this very case there 

were restaurant and tavern owners that permitted the 

gambling bets to be taken on their premises because it 

increased their -- the patronage of their businesses. 

And they were convicted of participating in illegal 

gambling operations. They didn't commit money 

laundering, because they didn't engage in a financial 

transaction that's not an element of the gambling 

offense, that involves the proceeds of the offense, and 

that's intended either to conceal the proceeds --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Mr. Roberts -- that the 

gambling offense is conducting a gambling business, so 

it makes it -- it is not just the gambling itself --

MR. ROBERTS: It is -- but the statute 

defines what the three -- the statue defines what the 

three elements of the gambling business are, Your Honor. 

That it's illegal gambling that's illegal under State 

law, that involves 5 or more persons, that it has --

continues for more than 30 days or has more than $2,000 

in gross revenues in a day.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What continues? The 

business has to continue. You are not engaging in a 

gambling business if you're not paying off the winners. 

That's all. That's not a good decent honest gambling 

business.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ROBERTS: The gambling business -- it 

might be gambling and fraud, Your Honor. But the 

gambling business can continue for more than 30 days 

without having paid the winners if they had a lottery 

every month, and it was at the end of the month -- they 

hadn't paid the winners yet, it would have gone for the 

30 days, in a 31-day month without -- without having 

paid the winners.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- if your definition 

of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an 

abstract question you're asking us to answer. If this 

-- if we say well, we're not sure this is proceeds but 

if it is proceeds, it is defined as gross receipts.

 That's an artificial context in which to 

address the issue.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. I think that what 

they're asking you to do is to interpret -- and what the

Seventh Circuit has done, is to interpret proceeds in a 

way that makes no sense for the statute in order to deal 

with these concerns about promotion cases that can be 

dealt with in the other ways that Justice Breyer raised. 

And there are really four --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Robert, may I go back 

to something you said about -- of the options that 

Justice Breyer mentioned.

 You said the way to handle it is in 

sentencing.

 Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the 

gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering. You 

said the statute has been changed. So what would be the 

sentence under the statute as it now exists? And this 

is vastly disproportionate. 60 months for gambling, and 

210 for money laundering.

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I 

probably should know the answer to what the precise 

range would be under the guidelines. Now, I don't. But 

what I do know is before, the way the guidelines worked 

was that the base offense level for a money laundering 

crime was not tied to the offense level for the 

underlying offense. So it was set I think starting at 

23 for promotional money laundering.

 But what happened in 2001 is that the

commission changed the rules so that when you -- when 

the money laundering involves the person who 

participated in the underlying offense and has also done 

the money laundering, you start with the offense level 

for the underlying offense and then you make some minor 

increases depending upon the type and the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have it in front of me 

actually. I was looking at it. And it seems to me what 

it assumes is that the underlying offense is different 

from the money laundering. And do you have any 

rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true 

that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying 

offense, why should he receive one day more than 60 

months?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, because he does engage 

in something more than what he needs to do to be 

punished for the underlying offense, and that conduct is 

-- and that conduct is -- promotes ongoing crime or can 

conceal ongoing crime in ways that are just what 

Congress was getting at in the statute. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because gambling under the 

definition has the three elements that do not include 

paying off the winners. That's what it all represents 

MR. ROBERTS: Because -- well, that's one

thing, but the other thing is, Your Honor, if I could 

talk about the ways that the proceeds definition just 

doesn't make sense here. If these expense payments --

the expense payments for instance, the payment of the 

salary that Mr. Santos made to Mr. Diaz -- it happens in 

this very case, although we didn't prosecute it as 

concealment money laundering -- that he recorded those 

payments as salary payments by a printing business that 

he owned.

 And he's doing that to conceal the activity, 

to enable it to keep going. And that's just what 

Congress was trying to get in the statute. Wouldn't be 

covered under a profits definition. If criminals 

concealed the gross receipts temporarily until they pay 

the expenses -- for instance, if a gambling operator 

takes the money that -- his illicit receipts from the 

gambling, and he puts it in the bank account of the 

printing business. And then later he uses it to pay the 

winning betters, he's doing that to hide it so the 

gambling operation can keep going. That's what Congress 

was trying to get at here. That wouldn't be covered.

 That -- that evades detection just as much 

as transactions that hide profit.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are saying it would 

not be covered as money laundering, but nevertheless it

would be illegal and be punished as gambling.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, it would, Your Honor. 

But the conduct, the concealment conduct --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And everything they've 

done here would be punished as gambling --

MR. ROBERTS: -- the concealment conduct is 

additional conduct, and it is what Congress wanted to 

get at here, and a profits definition would mean that it 

is excluded from the statute.

 And it would exclude the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you see the problem 

we have is we're not sure that it is within the statute. 

So then you're asking us to say how to make the statute 

work when we don't think the statute's applicable at 

all.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I guess if you don't 

think that concealing expense payments should be 

covered, if you don't think concealing money that is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you imagine running a 

illegal gambling business and advertising your expenses? 

I mean, you have got to conceal these --

MR. ROBERTS: It's not a question of 

advertising them, Your Honor. It's not a question of 

advertising them, but it is a question of taking 

additional conduct to conceal them.

 MR. ROBERTS: It is additional conduct. He 

didn't need to record it on the books of the -- on the 

books of his printing business.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if he puts it in a tin 

can and buries it in the garden? Is that additional 

conduct?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it is.

 MR. ROBERTS: It's additional conduct, but 

it's not designed to conceal the unlawful nature --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it? Do you put 

your salary in tin cans in the garden?

 MR. ROBERTS: I might like to keep my money 

in the cookie jar -- and it's perfectly legitimate 

money, Your Honor -- because I don't want when someone 

comes into my house that -- for them to steal the cash.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I just don't see how you 

can make the distinction you're making, and therefore I 

don't see how you can avoid Justice Stevens's problem.

 MR. ROBERTS: If he takes the money, Your 

Honor, and he structures his payments to his employees 

by making them -- or to his suppliers, by making them in 

$9,000 increments in order to evade transaction 

reporting requirements, that wouldn't be covered either

under this interpretation of the statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Roberts, isn't it true 

that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds 

doesn't really solve these problems except in the case 

of an unprofitable business? In the case of a 

profitable illegal enterprise, all of the same problems 

exist.

 MR. ROBERTS: I think there are many 

situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a 

profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it. 

For instance, just a drug dealer accepts payment for the 

drugs. If that money exceeds the cost of the business, 

it would presumably be profit and without some other 

requirement in the statute, it would count as money 

laundering. And for instance, when street-level dealers 

that are employed by a drug kingpin turn the receipts 

over to the kingpin even after they've take out their 

share, let's say -- under a profits definition if those 

receipts exceeded the costs of the business that would 

also be covered as money laundering. So I think it's 

very true that the profits definition isn't going to 

solve all the problems as well.

 That's a -- you know -- another point about 

it.

 It also means that what we have to prove

profits that that's going to be very difficult for us to 

do even in cases that don't involve these expense 

payments because criminals often don't keep accounting 

records. They certainly don't keep records that are 

accurate and complete and decipherable by law 

enforcement. And Congress recognized the lack of hard 

evidence of criminal profits, and for that reason 

Congress provided for the forfeiture of proceeds rather 

than profits in the RICO and drug forfeiture statutes. 

And there's no reason to think Congress took a different 

approach here in the money laundering statute, two years 

later, when it used the same term "proceeds."

 There's also -- there's the issue of the 

uncertainty that would be created by a profits 

definition, because it would raise all these questions, 

and there are no accounting rules to resolve them.

 And even the court below acknowledged that 

it's difficult to determine what is and isn't net 

income, and that the line between paying expenses and 

reinvesting that income is murky.

 And I don't think the Court should lightly 

assume that Congress intended a definition of an element 

of the offense that's going to raise these numerous 

issues about the scope of that essential element of the 

offense. And the Court is going to have to resolve them

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. VARE

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. VARE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 Justice Ginsburg, you have suggested 

correctly that the only conduct in this case was the 

payment of ordinary and necessary expenses of the 

business.

 Justice Scalia, you correctly suggested that 

paying off winners is necessary to every gambling 

operation.

 Justice Breyer, you have correctly suggested 

and stated that the money laundering statute is intended 

to punish different conduct, different criminal activity 

than the underlying criminal activity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Didn't Justice Alito 

correctly suggest that these merger problems would still 

persist even under your definition of "proceeds"?

 MR. VARE: I think that that is not

necessarily true. The merger problems would -- would 

exist except for the "profits definition," certainly on 

the facts of these cases -- on this case.

 On this case the only facts that were 

presented by the Government -- and they have conceded 

that they did not present any evidence of profits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I mean if 

you have a "profits" definition and the enterprise has 

profits, all of these problems we've been talking about 

in terms of the merger, as I call it, between the money 

laundering and the underlying offense would still be 

there, right?

 MR. VARE: Yes, Your Honor. There would. 

There would. And, in fact, Justice Alito also correctly 

suggested that the reason why the Scialabba panel 

decided the "proceeds" definition is profits was because 

of the expansive interpretation and application of the 

other aspects of the statute, and that they were left 

with essentially no choice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why are you urging us to 

create two problems, to drag along all of the problems 

that you object to with -- with interpreting proceeds to 

include simply covering your expenses? You acknowledge 

that the problems you point out would continue to exist 

if we accept your definition.

On the other hand, I think you have to 

acknowledge that accepting your definition creates other 

problems of its own, such as the difficulty in every 

case of showing that an illegal operation made a profit, 

such as the difficulty of deciding what kind of criteria 

you use for determining what are the -- what are the 

ordinary and necessary expenses of a criminal 

enterprise.

 Why should we -- why should we choose to get 

the worst of both worlds? And why isn't the proper way 

to attack the difficulty to focus in on what constitutes 

a transaction and what constitutes concealment --

something other than the "proceeds" definition?

 MR. VARE: I think you're absolutely 

correct, Justice Scalia. And, in fact, in our 

opposition to the petition for cert in this case, we 

made this very point as to why this was not the right 

case to determine all of these issues, and particularly 

the burdens that have been presented by the government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you argue at any point 

that these were not proceeds?

 MR. VARE: Yes, Your Honor, we did. 

Justice Kennedy, in the briefing in the opposition to 

cert and in our response brief, we have set forth 

distinct arguments that there are not separate

transactions distinct and different from the underlying 

criminal activity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you argue that in the 

court of appeals?

 MR. VARE: That was presented as -- that was 

presented as part of the Febus decision as an argument 

that those transactions did not constitute distinct and 

separate transactions from gambling. That was presented 

in the pro se petition and acknowledged by the 

government in responding to the pro se petition below.

 The government acknowledged that the 

question in Febus, the question in Scialabba, the 

question in this case on habeas are legally and 

factually indistinguishable. And I think Justice 

Stevens has suggested that all of this is inherent in 

the question presented.

 A fair -- it is fairly included because to 

look at the statutory context of the word "proceeds" is 

necessary for an intelligent resolution of the meaning 

of that word as well as how it plays throughout the rest 

of the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is can you 

violate the statute by financial transactions which --

have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are 

no more than part of the crime itself?

That's basically the question. And I think 

Justice Kennedy is asking if, in fact, we wanted to 

reach that question, is this a case in which we could do 

it, through reargument or in some other way?

 MR. VARE: I think that that is a question 

that this Court could resolve on the facts of this case, 

or --

JUSTICE BREYER: And was it raised in the 

court below?

 MR. VARE: It was -- it was raised in the 

court below as -- as inherent -- well, it was certainly 

raised in the Febus, in the direct appeal.

 It is inherent in the 2255 petition filed 

pro se by my client, Mr. Santos. It was acknowledged by 

the government that these issues are not legally or 

factually distinguishable.

 And again, it is inherent in the question 

that's presented. The money laundering statute requires 

conducting a financial transaction involving the 

proceeds of the specified unlawful activity with the 

intent to promote the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it is a 

stretch so far as the question presented. The question 

presented is very clear whether or not it is gross 

receipts or net profits. That's what we're asked to

resolve.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not your question 

presented.

 MR. VARE: Absolutely not, Justice Ginsburg. 

It is not our question presented, but we do feel that, 

even in answering that question, whether or not it is 

net or gross does require looking at the term in 

context. And -- and the context, we're not looking at a 

different statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't see that 

you presented -- a separate question presented in your 

opposition.

question presented there was --

question presented.

 MR. VARE: No, we did not -- in the 

opposition to the cert petition we did not present a 

different question presented as a question presented.

 But we did present the argument --

Mr. Santos did and Mr. Diaz did -- that there were no 

separate transactions that promoted the carrying on of 

the specified unlawful activity. Rather, all that the 

government had presented in this case was merely 

conducting the illegal gambling business.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we adopt your 

position, we will have to decide a question like, for 

example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits 

because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill 

somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision 

that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary 

business expense in carrying out illegal gambling 

operations, right?

 MR. VARE: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in 

any case you're going to have to look at what the 

specified unlawful activity is in the context of a money 

laundering prosecution, because that is part of the 

context.

 And so in this case you have to look at what 

is the ordinary conduct of an illegal gambling business.

And I would suggest that paying off a hit man most 

likely would not fall into that category. But, 

certainly, as many of the Justices, including Justice 

Scalia and Justice Stevens and others have suggested, 

that when a gambling business pays off its winners, that 

is inherent -- that is integral -- to conducting a 

gambling business. It is not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's take two 

illegal gambling operations that are identical in every 

way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200 

a week. The other pays the runners $500 a week. And 

the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because 

he's paying too much to the runners.

 The first one, the more successful 

operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money 

laundering because its has profits. The other one 

doesn't. So incompetence is rewarded.

 MR. VARE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. I would 

say that neither one could be prosecuted for money 

laundering because in both situations --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the --

MR. VARE: -- when in both situations the 

gambling operator is simply paying off ordinary business 

expenses. Just the collectors who are part and parcel 

of running the illegal gambling business, they're one of

the participants. And that's part of the illegal 

gambling statute, is that you have to have five or more 

participants.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm focusing on 

the question presented -- that was the only question 

presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari 

by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the 

question of whether "proceeds" is considered gross 

revenues or profits.

 MR. VARE: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what I 

-- what I believe is the answer to your question is --

is you cannot look at the term "proceeds" in isolation. 

And Justice Breyer, you know, suggested that the reason 

why we're even here today, arguing about what I believe 

is just absurd and unwarranted results on the facts of 

this case, is because the courts below -- and the 

government has proposed expansive interpretations -- the 

courts below have adopted, in some cases and not others, 

these expansive interpretations.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But this doesn't --

"proceeds" must mean the same thing in every money 

laundering case, doesn't it? And every money laundering 

case is not based on a gambling business. There are 

drug businesses and all sorts of other predicates.

 MR. VARE: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can it mean something 

different in -- depending on the underlying illegal 

activity?

 MR. VARE: I think there is certainly a 

suggestion, but that this Court itself has made recently 

in the Duke Energy case, that a term can have multiple 

meanings, multiple shades of meanings, and that will 

depend upon the context. So you have to look at the 

context and the specified unlawful activity is context.

 Now, I'm not suggesting that we adopt a 

definition of proceeds as net profits in one case for 

one unlawful activity or gross profits for another 

unlawful activity or gross receipts for another one.

 But the problem that we have presented to us 

today is due to the piecemeal construction and 

application of this statute and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Vare, you know, I'm --

I'm unwilling to decide the definition of transaction 

question in the present case because, frankly, I think 

that's a -- in itself, a very difficult question which 

we haven't had adequately argued. For example, while I 

believe, as I've indicated earlier, that paying off the 

winners is -- is an essential part of a gambling 

operation, I don't believe that paying off runners 

necessarily is. You can have a gambling operation

without runners, can't you? You can --

MR. VARE: You could have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can -- you can view 

that as something beyond the mere -- the mere gambling 

crime. I don't -- I don't think you can view that 

paying off the winners is beyond the gambling crime, but 

I do think having a bunch of runners and paying off each 

of them is not necessarily part of gambling.

 MR. VARE: Well, you can have a gambling 

business without runners per se.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

 MR. VARE: But you do need, Justice Scalia, 

you do need five or more participants. And the courts 

below have defined participants as -- as owners or 

partners, bartenders, cocktail waitresses, doormen, 

employees of the business.

 And if those are qualifying participants to 

even establish the -- the predicate for an illegal 

gambling business, then those participants are most 

likely going to get paid, and if they get paid, then 

that is simply part of conducting an illegal gambling 

business.

 I think the fact -- I mean, the fact that 

the runner in this case, the bet collector, Mr. Diaz, is 

probably -- you know, illustrates best the unwarranted

result in this case. Mr. Diaz did nothing more in this 

case than collect wages of about $150 a month or a week, 

something along those lines, for simply collecting 

debts, and he was convicted of money laundering and 

sentenced to 9 years in jail.

 Mr. Santos, my client, all he did was pay 

winners and pay those bet collectors to collect debts, 

and he -- his sentence was nearly quadrupled.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So someone who 

simply paid off whoever it is that ships in, you know, a 

ton of heroin, you'd say is not guilty then? Same 

thing. I mean, you're just paying off the people who 

engage in the activities that are necessary for the 

continuation and promotion of the illegal enterprise.

 MR. VARE: Well, I -- I think in that case, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I would -- I would suggest it might 

be an incomplete hypothetical, because simply paying the 

expenses of a crime or simply buying more drugs is not 

in and of itself -- and I think the government has 

conceded that in their opening -- that's not in and of 

itself money laundering. There has to be a transaction 

that is conducted with the intent to promote the 

carrying on or separately a transaction that is designed 

to conceal the legitimate or the illegitimate source of 

-- of the funds received.

So simply receiving proceeds from an 

unlawful activity is not enough. And that's clear on 

the statutory language. You either have to have some 

promotion element or some concealment element.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me go back to the 

question of the definition of "proceeds."

 Isn't it very unlikely that Congress would 

have wanted -- wanted to adopt the net income definition 

in light of the legal issues and the problems of proof 

that that would involve?

 Let's take the example of an international 

drug ring that has assets in a foreign country. They 

may have crops. They may have processing plants, 

warehouses, trucks, airplanes, et cetera. They ship 

millions of dollars of drugs into the United States. 

They get millions of dollars in gross revenue here every 

year. They hire a professional money launderer to 

launder the money here. Now, the Government wants to 

prosecute the money -- the person they hired plus 

members of the organization.

 The person they hired may not know and may 

not care whether the money that was being laundered was 

profits or not. And how are you going to prove what --

whether this enterprise was a profitable enterprise or 

not? They may have -- and they may have enormous gross

revenue, but they may have -- they may have enormous 

expenses overseas. They may have bought a lot of 

warehouses and equipment. They may have lost a lot of 

things because they were raided by the government, 

destroyed the factory, killed the plants.

 It becomes as impossible situation, and why 

would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that?

 MR. VARE: Well, Justice Alito, I don't 

think it's an impossible situation, number one, and I'll 

get to that in a second. To address your first 

question, could Congress have intended this to mean 

profits knowing that the burdens were so difficult?

 To answer that question, then you must look 

at what else Congress intended, and there's no question 

that Congress intended to punish different conduct than 

the underlying criminal activity.

 And then you have to look at what Congress 

intended to get at when they wanted to fill the gap in 

criminal law, when they want wanted to punish crimes 

that were not previously punished.

 They focused on getting at ill-gotten gains 

of criminal enterprises. They focused -- and our 

briefs, you know, set forth the statements that are 

replete through the debates on the floor, that the 

Congress was focused on profits of criminal enterprises.

Congress was not focused on the unprofitable 

criminal enterprise because --

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sure that's true. They 

wouldn't be that worried about the unprofitable criminal 

enterprises because they wouldn't last very long. But 

there's the -- there still is the problem of proof --

MR. VARE: Absolutely, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- proving that it's 

profitable.

 MR. VARE: And the proof problem --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just proving that it's 

profitable; proving that the person laundering it knew 

that it was profits because that's part of the 

definition of the crime, that scienter. And how can you 

prove that the fellow knew that it was profits? He 

would very rarely know whether it was or wasn't. So he 

skips off scot-free free of the laundering crime.

 MR. VARE: Well, Justice Scalia, the intent 

or the knowledge or the scienter requirement is going to 

be present. It's going to be a burden on the government 

to prove, no matter what definition of proceeds is.

 But in terms of proving profits, the 

government is able to prove profits in other criminal 

financial transaction-type cases in a number of ways. 

They're not limited to a particular accounting method.

They can choose the accounting method that they want. 

They're not limited to looking at day after day after 

day, week after week after week of financial records. 

They can aggregate records that are selected from 

particular points in time. And even in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do they 

know even what the fiscal year of these enterprises is? 

I mean let's suppose you have some costs.  They have to 

buy the poppy field or wherever, but, you know, over 3 

years, they're going to make a lot of money. You're 

saying you can't prosecute them in year 2?

 MR. VARE: No, I'm not saying that at all, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think my point would be the 

government would not even need to look at a fiscal year 

to prove profits. They would be able to look at a 

period of time and through their extensive search and 

seizure efforts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is the 

profits may not come in immediately, even though the 

underlying activity is exactly the same.

 MR. VARE: That may be the case. They may 

have a difficult burden of proving profits in the early 

stages, but most of these prosecutions practically occur 

after a period of time.

total stage you look at? Suppose it's profitable 1 

month and not the next month, and the loss the second 

month more than undoes the profits of the first month. 

Can you still prosecute them for the profits in the 

first month?

 MR. VARE: Certainly, based upon the profits 

in the first month. They're not limited to that. I 

mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: One day they could pick 

then, they have one good day. And they could --

MR. VARE: And they could profit on that one 

good day if there are other transactions involved in the 

profits.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the bank robber 

-- there's just one bank robbery. They spend $500 to 

each, to people for their airfare and car rental. They 

rob the bank. They only get $800. They lost $200. 

They then give the $800 to the attorney to please -- or 

to somebody to please launder the money. No profits?

 MR. VARE: I don't think that that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That would be a very silly 

result.

 MR. VARE: Well, I -- I don't think that, 

under that hypothetical, even the government would 

charge those criminals with money laundering.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. They gave it to a 

third person to conceal it, $800.

 MR. VARE: Well, if there's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 8,000, 8 million.

 MR. VARE: Simply giving money to somebody 

else does not meet the concealment and disguisement 

element. I mean, there has to be an effort made to 

disguise the source of the income as being illegitimate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that it's proceeds. 

Assume that they have a money launderer. Under your 

definition there's still no violation?

 MR. VARE: I suppose I would say no. And 

I'm going to explain why I have to say no, and I'm going 

to give you a medical word. The profits construction is 

not perfect. There's no question about that.

 But we're here today because it's the only 

way to resolve the case that came up to this Court based 

upon the expansive interpretations of the rest of the 

money laundering cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well that's -- but 

we don't try to solve every case. We look at particular 

questions presented. And maybe there's going to be 

another case coming up in which the issue of how broadly 

you should construe promotion is, or whether you should 

have a different definition when the offenses are merged

or not. And we'll confront that when it gets here.

 It seems to me that your argument is --

maybe your best argument, but your argument, anyway, is 

let's avoid this question because of these other 

mistakes that have been made, mistakes which are not 

presented to us on the question on which we granted 

cert.

 MR. VARE: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm 

not asking this Court to avoid any question. What I am 

saying is that there is a profits construction that if 

you apply the traditional rules of statutory 

construction, if you look at the text -- the word 

itself, "proceeds," does not have a single plain meaning 

as gross receipts. It is ambiguous. And it has 

multiple shades of meaning depending upon the context.

 If you look at the term "proceeds" in 

context then, then it will depend upon how one is using 

it. If I were selling a house, and I asked somebody on 

the street what would be my proceeds from the sale of my 

house, in that -- and only in that context, some would 

say it is the gross. Some would say it is the net. 

Some would say it depends.

 Well, it depends upon what? It depends upon 

context. That is included in the question presented.

context.

 There is, if you are going to go with 

profit, a question of what expenses? That's one of the 

difficulties of working with a net proceeds, because we 

don't know what the expenses that you would deduct, and 

the hit man was given as one example. You said no, not 

that one. But salaries to the runners, yes.

 To figure out what would count to come up 

with a net figure is the least difficult, is it not?

 MR. VARE: Justice Ginsburg, I think that it 

is slightly more difficult in the case the government 

has now, which is really no difficulty at all. I think 

that it would depend upon the unlawful activity, the 

specified unlawful activity, what would be the ordinary 

expenses associated with doing that crime.

 And lower courts are well equipped and 

juries are well equipped to hear evidence, direct and 

circumstantial, and make inferences and decide those 

issues.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does it have to be the 

ordinary expense of that? I mean, let's assume the 

charge is murder, and I happen to use a hit man for the 

murder. That's proven and whatnot.

 Why -- you mean, that isn't part of the 

murder conviction, simply because I could have done it

without a hit man, I could have done it myself?

 MR. VARE: No, I don't think so at all, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think paying the hit 

man would be part of the murder transaction?

 MR. VARE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Uh-huh.

 MR. VARE: But I don't think that that 

necessarily parlays into whether or not it is money 

laundering or not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand.

 MR. VARE: If, for example, the murderer 

paid the hit man with money to kill somebody and then 

paid -- you know, used proceeds from the insurance 

premium that somebody might have been his wife or her 

husband, and used the proceeds to pay off the money --

the hit man for the next crime or to reward him or 

something else, to carry on the business or used the 

insurance proceeds to conceal where they came from, then 

I think you could create a hypothetical situation of 

money laundering.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it would 

depend on whether or not the insurance proceeds exceeded 

how much he had to pay the hit man, right? Let's say 

he's not doing it to get the insurance money. It just

so happens he had a $50,000 policy on the victim --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He wanted to kill his wife, 

right?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. He just wanted 

to commit the murder, not get the money. And so he pays 

the hit man $100,000, he gets the $50,000, and then uses 

it for all these other activities, you'd say no money 

laundering, because no profits?

 MR. VARE: If we assume the expansive 

interpretations of a transaction promoting the 

underlying crime that have been presented in this case 

and then we apply the profits definition, that might not 

be money laundering. But, the money laundering statute 

is not designed to cure that evil. That evil is 

punished and punished severely by the murder statute. 

It is punished as the underlying crime.

 And so in this case, Mr. Santos and 

Mr. Diaz -- or Mr. Santos was punished up to the maximum 

of five years for running an illegal gambling business. 

He didn't do anything else other than run a gambling 

business.

 And so I think the point is at the end of 

the day, there are certainly a lot of hypothetical 

situations that suggest a profits construction might 

pose some burdens, might not make sense. But if you're

going to look at the burdens on the government in terms 

of construing the term "proceeds," then you also must 

look at the consequences of accepting the gross receipts 

construction. And I think at the outset, nearly every 

justice up here suggested -- well, that turns every 

illegal gambling business into a money laundering 

violation.

 The government has no answer to that. Under 

their interpretation as applied today, then every 

illegal gambling operator will be guilty of money 

laundering.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought their 

answer was the money laundering statute covers a whole 

waterfront of activities besides illegal gambling. And 

the question is, what did Congress intend when they 

passed the money laundering statute.

 This is kind of the tail wagging the dog. 

The tail is, well, it presents these problems when 

you're talking about gambling operations, but there's a 

whole rest of the dog area where it doesn't present a 

problem.

 MR. VARE: Well, I think what the money 

laundering statute was intended to do was punish 

different conduct, separate and distinct from the 

underlying crime. And that different conduct is

inherent in conducting a financial transaction with the 

intent to promote the carrying on of the unlawful 

activity.

 I do not think that you can parse the 

statutory language and only address the term "proceeds" 

irrespective of its consequences.

 In fact, I think the questions directed to 

me as to the harsh consequences on the government 

approving profits shows that you have to look at the 

term "proceeds" in its context. In its context includes 

not only the burdens on the one hand, but it certainly 

includes the situation we have here, that every illegal 

gambling business is automatic money laundering. And 

that is not what money laundering statute was enacted, 

it's not what it was written or intended to address.

 Thank you.

First of all, it's not the question 

presented here which is limited to the meaning of the 

statutory term "proceeds." Respondents didn't present 

any alternative question in their briefs in opposition. 

And, in fact, they don't present an alternative question 

presented even in their briefs on the merits. They're 

just using the concern about merger as a reason to 

decide that proceeds means profit.

 The separate transaction issue was decided 

against Respondents adversely on direct appeal in the 

Febus case, as my brother on the other side 

acknowledged. And those kinds of issues that are 

decided adversely on direct appeal shouldn't be 

relitigated.

 The issue wasn't raised in the separate 

transaction issue, it wasn't raised in the Section 2255 

issues, and wasn't addressed by the courts below in 

these collateral proceedings.

 At most, we say it should be left open for 

another case that presents -- that presents the issue. 

Beyond that, if this Court thought that something should 

be left open for the court below to address, the court 

below could address a range of possible ways to deal 

with ensuring a separation, for example, Justice 

Stevens's suggestion that an illegal gambling business

under the statute itself entails the payment of winners 

and the payment of employees, although we don't think 

that it does.

 But a profits definition is not the way to 

address concerns about overlap for the underlying 

offense, because it makes no sense in the broader 

context of the statute.

 It would create significant uncertainty 

about the scope of the statute because of the absence of 

accounting rules. It would make proof very difficult as 

a general matter because of the absence of those rules 

and because criminals often don't keep accounting 

records. It would exclude numerous concealment 

transactions that Congress had no reason not to cover, 

and it would cripple the government's ability to 

prosecute professional money launderers, which are 

really a significant part of the problem that Congress 

was addressing.

 If the Court has no further questions, we 

would ask that the judgments of the court of appeals be 

reversed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
