CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 12-10, Agency for 
International Development v. The Alliance for Open 
Society International. 

Mr. Srinivasan. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Congress's comprehensive program to address 
the worldwide problem of HIV and AIDS includes a policy 
of opposing prostitution and sex trafficking because 
they contribute to the diseases' spread. And 
correspondingly, Congress determined -- determined that 
the government should partner with and should grant 
limited competitive Federal funding to those 
organizations that agree with the policy opposing 
prostitution and sex trafficking because organizations 
that agree with that policy are most likely to carry out 
the Federal program in conformity with the Federal 
policy priorities. 

Now, no organization that carries out HIV 
programming is required to subscribe to the Federal

government's views, but, if an organization wants to 
partner with the Federal government and get Federal 
funds to carry out the Federal program, well, that 
organization --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I guess 
the problem is that there are a number of different ways 
you could carry out the program. And let's say you have 
an organization that focuses on a particular -- you 
know, the administration of hospitals or whatever it is 
that's covered by the program, and they regard this 
issue as collateral to what they're concerned with. 

There -- there have to be some limitations 
on what type of loyalty oath you can require them to 
sign, isn't there? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think, 
Mr. Chief Justice, the way that Congress looked at this 
was to look at -- at the organizations with which the 
government is going to partner across the mine run of 
situations, and I think what one can do is look at 
Respondents' brief because Respondents encompass a 
variety of different types of organizations. 

But Respondents' brief itself tells you, at 
pages 11 to 12 and at pages 32 and 33, that there are 
going to be situations, in their own experience, in 
which these issues about prostitution and --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if 

they --
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- and sex trafficking come 

into issue. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I appreciate that. 
What if they're not? What if the government 

has, in addition to this policy, a strong policy in 
promoting -- you know, recycling, and so they require 
everybody with whom they're going to do business, every 
grantee, to adopt a policy in favor of using renewable 
resources? Any problem with that? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think 
that would present a different question. Of course, you 
know that it presents a different question, but it would 
be a little bit more difficult for the -- for the 
following reason: That there is a germaneness component 
to Congress's -- the constitutionality of Congress's 
funding decisions in this area. And the more sweeping 
and the less germane the condition would be, the more 
it's open to constitutional attack. 

Now, this condition is very, very germane 
because as -- because, as Congress found, prostitution 
and sex trafficking contribute to the spread of the 
disease, and so it makes good sense that Congress would 
have imposed this condition. And I think it's important

to understand --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, on that 
particular point, what should we do -- as far as I can 
tell from the briefs, the people who work with the 
prostitutes to try to prevent AIDS uniformly tell us 
that, if you go to those prostitutes and you try to get 
them to take steps to stop AIDS, it's very hard to do 
if, at the same time, you've announced you're against 
all prostitution. 

So what they're saying is that the condition 
imposed will interfere with the objective, and if there 
is a germaneness requirement -- and nobody says the 
opposite. I mean, I've noted nobody denies what they're 
saying in terms of the effectiveness of their work, 
so -- I don't think. 

At least, I didn't read them all with great 
care; maybe you can point to somebody who does. But, if 
everyone is telling us that this is counterproductive 
and the exact opposite -- then can we say, well, it 
isn't germane? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Justice Breyer, I 
don't think so, and two responses on that score. First 
of all, everybody is not telling you that, and I'll tell 
you who's not telling you that in a second. 

But the more -- but the overarching point is

that this is a policy determination that Congress, of 
course, took into account when it fashioned the statute, 
and it concluded that it was important to have an 
opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking. 

Now, as far as the organizations that aren't 
telling you that, there is an amicus brief that's filed 
by 46 organizations that it's in our support --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's quite a few, 
yes. That's true. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- that's in our support, 
and the lead organization is the Coalition Against 
Trafficking in Women, and they -- they support us, and 
they think that the best way -- and they -- and they 
argued this passionately in their brief -- they think 
that the best way to provide services to the target 
audience is under a rubric of opposition to prostitution 
and sex trafficking. 

And I would urge you to take a look at that 
brief because it explains why the program should be 
conducted in this fashion. 

Now, is there a debate about --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, there 

isn't -- at least I'm not familiar with anything quite 
like this, where, if you're not told, if you want to run 
a government program, you have to speak the government's

speech. 

This doesn't require the recipient to speak 

to anybody at all, except to the government itself, to 

say, I pledge that my policy is the government's policy. 

So it's making somebody adopt, as her own, the 

government's policy, rather than saying, I understand 

that I get my government money, I have to follow the 

government's rules about what I can say to the public. 

Here -- and is -- is there anything else 

quite like this, where you make a pledge to the 

government, but with respect to third parties doesn't 

apply? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I 

could just fight the premise of your question just very 

slightly and then explain why I think this kind of 

requirement makes sense in this particular context? 

The goal of this is not to persuade somebody 

to change their view. The goal of this is to partner 

with organizations that self-identify as organizations 

that agree with the government's policy priorities. And 

the reason the government has done that and the reason 

why Congress couldâ€™ve thought that that was a good idea is 

straightforward, and that is that those organizations 

that agree with Congress's policy priorities are going 

to be more likely to be reliable and effective partners

in carrying out the government's program. 

And one way to think about it is to envision 
this: You have a circumstance in which you're down to 
your last few dollars of a discretionary Federal 
funding, and you're looking at two different 
organizations that are competing for that money. 

One of them comes to you and says, we agree 
with your policy of an opposition to prostitution and 
sex trafficking; and the other one says, we're not going 
to tell you whether we agree, we're going to remain 
studiously neutral, but we'll tell you that we'll 
conduct our affairs in a manner that's not inconsistent 
with your policy priorities. 

I think it makes all the sense in the world 
for Congress to decide that the government should 
preferably partner with the former organization, rather 
than the latter, because they're going to be more 
reliable and more effective at carrying out the 
government's program. 

And there's another aspect of this that I 
think that is important to highlight, and that is that 
we're not just talking about circumstances in which the 
conduct is -- is, arguably, going to be neutral, so that 
there's going to be no position taken. 

There's also going to be occasions in which

the organizations that are providing services are going 
to have the opportunity to affirmatively embrace the 
government's policy in opposition to prostitution and 
sex trafficking. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not aware of any case in 
which this Court has held that it is permissible for 
Congress to condition Federal funding on the recipient's 
expression of agreement with ideas with which the 
recipient disagrees. I'm not aware of any case in which 
that kind of compelled speech has been permitted. 

And I would be interested in -- and it seems 
to me like quite a -- a dangerous proposition. I would 
be interested in whatever limitations you think there 
might be on that rule, which seems to be the general 
rule that you're advocating. Other than the requirement 
of germaneness, is there anything else? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there is 
germaneness, Justice Alito, and I can point to a couple 
of other limiting principles that have been noted in 
this Court's decisions and I think that are satisfied 
here. 

One is that Finley talked about -- and I 
think it captures some other decisions in this -- this 
respect, disallowing the government from leveraging its 
control over funding conditions in a manner that

services a speech-suppressive objective. And so you 
have to be careful, and I think this maps --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again. I didn't 
understand the point. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- it -- the government 
is limited from leveraging its control over funding 
conditions, so that it can achieve a speech --
speech-suppressive objective. 

And I think what the Court was getting at is 
that you want to be careful that the speech condition --
the speech-related condition is tightly tethered to the 
programmatic objective and not allow the government 
to -- to have the program seep into other areas where it 
doesn't have to go. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this 
example, which is mentioned in one of the amicus briefs. 
The government provides lots of funding to universities 
to -- in various forms, either directly or through 
student loans, in the form of tax exemptions, so 
anything that would be germane to the general purpose of 
higher education, presumably, could be attached as a 
condition to those funds. 

Would that be correct? 
MR. SRINIVASAN: With -- with certain 

limitations. I mean, I think germaneness is a -- is a

criterion. 

JUSTICE ALITO: With what -- with what 
limitations? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think --
JUSTICE ALITO: The government could have a 

whole list of things -- of principles that it thinks 
should be incorporated into higher education, and it 
could require a university, as a condition of receiving 
these -- this money, let's say directed through student 
loans, to express agreement with all of these 
propositions. Would that be true? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- well, I'm not 
sure, Justice Alito, and of course it's going to be hard 
for me to decide that we are not going to defend 
something. But let me just give you a limiting idea 
that's out there, which is that I think there is an 
important distinction between circumstances in which the 
government is partnering with an organization to carry 
out a government program and circumstances in which the 
government is extending a Federal subsidy to an 
individual organization as kind of an across-the-board 
entitlement. 

So in the generally applicable 
across-the-board --

"partnering"? How does this partnering differ --
partnering differ from just giving them the money to do 
the job? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know that it 
the differs from giving the money to do the job. I 
guess what I'm saying is there are going to be 
circumstances, for example, like in Speiser, where the 
financial question doesn't have to do with the 
expenditure of the money by the recipient in a manner 
that's commensurate with congressional goals. 

In that context, you're giving a generally 
applicable entitlement, and you're not so worried about 
how the money is being spent because that person is not 
partnering with the government in carrying out a Federal 
program. Here, the organizations are partnering with 
the government in carrying out the Federal program 
because it's the Federal HIV program that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you --
what do you mean by, "partnering"? You're just saying 
they are given money to carry out a particular program. 
Is that all --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes.

"partnering"?

carry out --

JUSTICE SCALIA: To carry out a particular 
program? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: But in concert with Federal 
policy priorities, so it's not just -- it's not just a 
naked grant of money. If you had an entitlement, 
Justice Scalia, for example, let's just consider your 
classic entitlement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. It is -- it 
is a naked grant of money to implement a particular 
program. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: To implement a particular 
program and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And you call that 
"partnering with the Federal government"? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I do. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Terrible verb, anyway. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. SRINIVASAN: Okay. My apologies for 

that. For associating with the organization recipient 
in carrying out a Federal program. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, on this, 
what does seem to me unusual, as Justice Alito brought 
out, requiring somebody to say, "I believe this" or "I 
agree with the government on that." The Rust v.

Sullivan, which is one of the precedents on which you 
rely, made it a point that the doctor was not required 
to represent -- as his own views, not required to 
represent an opinion that he doesn't hold. 

He has to adhere to the government's program 
in his dealings with the public, but he doesn't have to 
say, "I agree with the government." 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. That's true, Justice 
Ginsburg. But here's why --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that just an 
irrelevant consideration in Rust, that no one -- no one 
was being obliged to say, I believe something, that they 
don't believe? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, here's why I think it 
makes sense in this context -- it is distinct in that 
respect, but here's why I think it makes sense in this 
specific context: What Congress wanted to do is secure 
an ex ante commitment from the organizations with which 
the government works to assure that they agreed with the 
government's policy priorities. 

Now, where these programs are carried out is 
in the main, in foreign territory, in distant lands, 
and, in that context, I think Congress would have 
understood that monitoring of conduct can be 
particularly challenging.

 And that monitoring is made all the more 

challenging because these issues can come into play 
through a myriad of interactions between the 
organizations that are working with the government and 
the local communities and local officials. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I see that, and I see you 
have two sides to the policy question. And then it 
seems to me that the case that Justice Ginsburg was 
speaking of is pretty relevant. Why? Well, that case, 
Regan and League of Women Voters, all seem quite 
comparable. 

They are trying to balance the -- the desire 
of the government to further a policy objective with the 
undesirability of the government invading what would 
otherwise be a constitutional protected right to speech. 

And the way they have done it is quite 
technical and narrow, but it may be applicable. In 
both, what they said was, don't worry about your 
protected speech as much as you are because there is 
another way you can do it here. You go through a -- an 
independent structured organization. And where that 
wasn't present, namely, the League of Women Voters, the 
Court struck it down. 

Now, if that's the right framework, then, 
here, I don't see how you could have an independently

structured organization for the reason that a group that 
said, I am -- I am opposed completely to prostitution, 
publicly, to get the money, and then set up a structure 
that said the opposite, would be seen as totally 
hypocritical. They wouldn't be able to get their 
message across. 

They wouldn't be able to express, in any 
way, what it is they think about the -- the 
administration of AIDS in the context -- anti-AIDS in 
the context of prostitution. 

That's a long question, but you see 
where -- where I've ended up. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I think I do. 
JUSTICE BREYER: At the moment, for purposes 

of the question. So why isn't this case more like 
League of Women Voters and less like the other two? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: For the following reasons, 
Justice Breyer: There is an alternative affiliated 
organizational vehicle in this case as well, and I think 
that's constitutionally significant. Now, I'm not going 
to quibble with Your Honor's point about how the 
organization that's the funding recipient has made this 
policy agreement and that that can have ripple effects. 

But here's why that matters: The point of 
having an alternate vehicle is not that it remedies a

constitutional problem that already exists. The point 
of it is to get to this leveraging purpose that I was 
talking about earlier, and it's to show that what the 
government is doing is keeping the condition within its 
appropriate confines, and it's not allowing that 
condition to spread beyond that, into other realms. 

And that purpose is fully served by the 
organizational affiliate alternative here. And I think 
it's important --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Srinivasan, 
there is a difference in this international setting --
you know, most of those separate affiliates was in 
Taxation Without Representation, and it was the cure for 
the Legal of Women Voters. But here, as the D.C. 
District Court said in its opinion, which was in your 
favor, oh, all you have to do is spin off a subsidiary 
that gets the government money; it's just a simple 
matter of corporate reorganization. 

But you know that getting an NGO -- a new 
NGO recognized in dozens of foreign countries is no 
simple thing to accomplish. I mean, to take a concrete 
example, look what happened about a year and a half ago 
in Egypt, when the U.S. NGOs were indicted for 
criminal -- for not complying with the permit 
requirements of the country.

 So it's one thing to set up a 501(c)(3) and 

501(c)(4) operating in the United States, each does its 
thing. But to require an NGO to then, in the countries 
where it's operating, get the necessary permits is quite 
an arduous thing. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 
guess it depends on which direction it runs as a 
principal point. I mean, of course, the recipient 
organization that's been conducting the program, to 
date, can continue to conduct the program, and the 
affiliate that's set up could be the alternate channel. 
And so you could run in the opposite direction, and I 
think you wouldn't run into that problem. 

But I would like to address on this score an 
important point, which is that I think Respondents have 
suggested that there is a material distinction between, 
Justice Breyer, the circumstances in Rust and the 
circumstances in this case because Rust involves 
separate programs within a legal entity, and this case 
involves separate organizations. 

And I think the point the Respondents are 
trying to make is that there is a distinction because at 
least, there, one legal entity could have multiple 
programs, some of which are subject to the condition and 
some of which are not, whereas, here, there is a

difference because this condition applies to an entire 
organization. 

But I think that's a false premise, which --
JUSTICE BREYER: I wasn't excepting that 

one. 
MR. SRINIVASAN: Okay. 
JUSTICE BREYER: I was -- I mean, the main 

difference it seemed to me is, assuming all of that 
away, is that, here, the separate structure does not 
fulfill the constitutional need simply because the basic 
condition has to do with express speech, because when A 
says, I believe in X, and then they set up a separate 
structure -- and every one knows they have set it up; I 
mean, that's the point of it -- and the structure says, 
"just kidding," nobody believes them from day one. 

And so you can't do it, and, if the 
government has its way and has awarded the thing 
properly, according to your criteria, the part that 
won't be believed is the "just kidding" part. And so 
the structure -- separate structure -- just doesn't work 
in terms of communicating their belief. And I don't 
think that's true in Rust, and I don't think it's true 
in Regan, and I do think it's true in FCC v. League of 
Women Voters. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I guess I'd -- I'd make two

points, Justice Breyer. 

One is, as I was suggesting earlier, the 
purpose of having this alternate channel is not to 
remedy a constitutional violation that otherwise would 
exist. I mean, of course, we start from the premise 
that it's okay to require this condition at the front 
end. It's not that it's unconstitutional, and the way 
to compensate for that is to create this affiliate 
alternative. 

We think the condition's okay ab initio. 
What the alternate vehicle does is to address this other 
problem, that it shows that the condition is 
appropriately tailored. It's not reaching beyond its 
appropriate confines because it's allowing --

JUSTICE BREYER: Boy, if -- if the 
structure -- the separate structure is not really part 
of a constitutional analysis, then the government could 
say, why not? It's easy to find policy reasons, and 
really find very, very decent and thoughtful people who 
agree with the policy reason, you know? 

There -- there are people on both sides of 
these questions, and they come in and they say, okay, 
we're giving money for an anti-abortion purpose or a 
pro-abortion purpose, you know --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and -- and, suddenly, 

people can't say anything in these areas in face of such 
a condition. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, itâ€™s part of the -- as 
part of the constitutional analysis, I guess it's just 
addressing a different part of the constitutional 
analysis than -- than what Your -- Your Honor is 
addressing. 

I guess the other points that I'd make are 
twofold. One is that I think there is something to the 
notion that, if the organizations are sufficiently 
separate, then -- as they have to be, to comply with the 
regulations -- then it does work that one organization 
can say that we have a particular policy, and the 
organization -- another organization -- another 
organization can say that we have a different policy, 
precisely because of the premise that they're 
sufficiently distinct. 

So I'm not seeing the same degree of 
cognitive dissonance you are --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's --
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- and the other point I'd 

make --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. 
Finish answering him, and then I'll --

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Justice 

Sotomayor. 
The other point I'd make is this: That the 

speech-related objections that Respondents levy are 
twofold, one is they complain about the threshold 
condition. But the second is -- and this is -- made --
manifests at pages 11 to 12 and 32 and 33 of their 
brief -- is that they want to engage in activities that 
involve affirmative speech. 

They want to be able to participate in the 
dialogue about prostitution and sex trafficking and 
whether they should be legalized. And, with respect to 
that aspect of what Respondents are complaining --
complaining about, I think the alternate affiliated 
organization opportunity is a perfect remedy, in the 
same way that it was in Rust and in the same way that 
it -- that it was in Regan. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem that I have 
with that answer is that it doesn't cure the 
organization's need to stay true to its own beliefs 
because if -- and I think this is what Justice Breyer is 
trying to get to -- if itâ€™s truly an independent 
organization speaking, then that's that organization's 
belief; it's not an alternative under Rust to the needs 
of that organization to have its own personal views.

 And -- and so I have that problem, which is 

how is it an alternative for that organization to be 
able to have its views? 

Let me posit a hypothetical that I'm 
actually very troubled by. Let's assume a city 
government is undertaking a campaign to prevent teen 
pregnancy and its associated problems, and it wants to 
promote the use of contraceptives that protect from 
contracting -- you know, diseases, things like that. 

And some of its programs involve the 
distribution of contraceptives, but others involve 
parenting classes for teenage mothers and offering them 
free daycare. And a church seeks funds for the daycare 
part and the parenting part. 

Can the city now say, because we have this 
really important need to avoid sexually transmitted 
diseases, anyone who seeks our funds also have to say 
they believe in the use of contraceptives? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The church there would 

say, we don't believe, and why should we say we believe? 
MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I'd certainly 

understand why a church would be reluctant to do that. 
I mean, I guess -- you know, one way to look at it is 
that the city, I think, would have to think very long

and hard about whether that's a -- a desirable policy 
objective, precisely because some of the organizations 
with which it wants to work are going to have difficulty 
abiding by it. And so there's going to have to be a 
front-end determination, as a matter of policy, about 
whether that's an appropriate thing to pursue. 

But, if the city, as Congress did in this 
case, thought that it was an appropriate thing to do, 
then I think I would -- I think I would defend that --
apart from -- you know, free exercise issues of other 
things that aren't in play here -- I think I would 
defend it, as long as it's sufficiently germane and as 
long as it's in furtherance of the policy objectives 
that Congress -- or by, in your hypothetical, the 
city --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you 
another example that's along the same lines. The 
Federal government provides lots of funds to entities 
and individuals who are involved in the provision of 
health care. 

So let's suppose Congress says that, we 
think that the issue of guns is very germane to public 
health, and therefore, we will not allow anybody to 
receive any of these funds directly or indirectly, 
unless that entity or person proclaims agreement with

whatever we happen to think at the moment about guns. 

So they must either say we believe that guns 
should be strictly limited -- access to them should be 
strictly limited for public health purposes or that guns 
should be freely available because we think that 
promotes public health. That would be permissible, 
wouldn't it? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that it would, 
Justice Alito, on that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would it not? 
MR. SRINIVASAN: -- because -- because I 

think, first of all, it would depend on whether 
there -- there is the requisite germaneness. It would 
depend on whether, in fact, the organizations are 
working with -- I'm trying to avoid using the word 
"partnering with" -- but are working with the -- the 
government in carrying out the program. It would depend 
on those kinds of considerations. 

And whether -- another point to be made here 
is that a limitation that's been recognized in this 
Court's cases is that, at the end of the day, the 
government -- the government can't be seeking to 
suppress speech or to suppress disfavored viewpoints, 
even in the context of subsidization. 

And you'd have to ask the question whether

that scheme is designed to do that. Now, if -- if it 
crossed all those thresholds, then I think, yes, I would 
defend that as well, but I do think that it presents 
different and more difficult questions. 

I would like to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- one thing before 

your time is up. I have the same concerns that Justice 
Ginsburg expressed about the difficulty of simply 
creating structures in -- in foreign countries. If --
and I've looked through all of your cases. 

What's your closest case -- your best case 
for the fact that you should get extra deference because 
this is the foreign affairs field? I mean, I think of 
U.S. v. Curtis Wright. Anything more specific than 
that? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that I have a 
particular case, other than the doctrine, generally, 
Justice Kennedy. But I do think that the foreign 
location of this is significant vis-Ã -vis the concern 
that I think many of you have raised about why have an 
affirmative condition that requires espousal of a 
policy. 

Precisely because the conduct here is 
carried out in foreign areas and precisely because it 
can involve myriad interactions with local officials and

local policymakers, as Respondents admittedly want to 
do, on these sensitive questions, it makes sense in this 
context -- particular sense in this context to secure an 
ex ante commitment of agreement with the government's 
policy because that will have a self-policing aspect to 
it. 

It will be more designed to secure conduct 
in those areas that, in conformity with Federal policy, 
in a realm in which that conduct is particularly --
particularly difficult to monitor. 

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. BOWKER 
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. BOWKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 
please the Court: 

Respondents do not dispute that the Spending 
Clause gives the government significant authority to 
fund the programs of its choosing and to control speech 
and conduct within those programs. 

The problem with the policy requirement is 
that it aims at grantees, requiring that they profess a 
personal belief and refrain from certain private speech

outside the context of the government program. 

In Rust v. Sullivan, the Court held that the 
government could ban abortion-related speech in the 
government's own family planning program, but the 
grantees there were left unfettered in their personal 
beliefs and in their private speech outside the program. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see why this 
is a -- you talk about banning their speech. The 
government is just picking out who is an appropriate 
partner to -- to assist in this project. It wants to go 
and find people who, like them, are opposed to 
prostitution, and all they want to do is make sure that 
you're opposed to prostitution. 

It's like any other sort of condition -- you 
know, we want to make sure that you haven't been 
convicted of tax fraud over the last 10 years, so sign a 
certification that you -- you haven't. Yes, it's 
related to speech, but the whole program is about that. 

Why would they want to sign up with somebody 
who didn't share the objectives of the program? 

MR. BOWKER: Well, I think the policy 
requirement here has been applied a little differently 
than Mr. Chief Justice suggests. It -- it is applied in 
a way that is a funding condition, not part of the 
selection criteria.

 When the government goes out to select its 

partners in this case, it -- it goes out with requests 
for applications, and those requests for applications 
pertain to the particular program at issue. And they 
are very detailed about what precisely is required for 
that program, including --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it would be a 
different case, in your -- your view, as if -- when they 
have those criteria, they have one of them is, oh, by 
the way, you must agree with the objective of the 
program, which is to eliminate, to the extent possible, 
prostitution and sex trafficking? 

MR. BOWKER: No. I don't -- I don't think 
that's right. I -- I think the government absolutely 
can pick partners who are dedicated to the particular 
program for which they are applying, but there are 
constitutionally permissible ways to do that. 

One of the ways to do that is to look at 
technical capacity, past performance, references, what 
have you done before that shows you're able to do this 
particular program? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't just able to 
do. Are -- are you saying that they -- they just can't 
make it a prior condition, but they can select 
applicants on the basis of which ones they know agree

with the government's objectives? 

You -- you have two equally qualified --
technically, two equally qualified applicants, and the 
government intentionally picks the one whose views on --
on prostitution are -- are similar to the government's. 
Is -- is that bad? 

MR. BOWKER: Yes. And -- and the reason 
it's bad is because the government there is focused on 
viewpoint and not on ability to perform the program. 
The problem -- the problem with focusing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But let -- let me -- let 
me ask you this: Suppose that you're a Congressman or a 
Congresswomen, and you are a constitutional expert, and 
you take your oath to uphold the Constitution very 
seriously. 

A funding bill comes before you. You're the 
chairman of the committee, and you decide that you're 
going to fund A, rather than B, because you like their 
speech much better. Is that a violation of the 
Constitution? 

MR. BOWKER: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because you like their 

policies much better? 
MR. BOWKER: The -- the Congress can 

certainly fund a particular program and not fund others.

And we have no -- we have no argument with that. The 
spending condition -- the Spending Clause definitely 
comes with that ancillary power. And, in fact, that's 
what the Congress did here. It said, we want to -- we 
want to fund a fight against HIV/AIDS. We don't want to 
support that disease, and we want to oppose 
prostitution, we don't want to support that practice. 

What it cannot do, then, is take its 
viewpoint and impose its viewpoint on the grantee and 
make it a -- make it a condition. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not quite 
sure I -- I see the difference, that the -- a 
conscientious Congressperson cannot -- can, in your 
view, say, I'm going to prefer organization A over 
organization B because I like their policies better --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- across the board, with 

reference to drugs, with reference to guns, with 
reference to public health. 

MR. BOWKER: If -- if Congress is looking at 
the viewpoint of an organization and deciding whether to 
fund it based on its viewpoint, I think that's 
problematic. And the reason I think it's problematic is 
because this Court has said to deny a subsidy or a 
benefit on the basis of the exercise of one's First

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, my goodness. They

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they can't fund the Boy 

Scouts of America because they like the programs that 
the BSA has? They -- they have to treat them 
equivalently with the Muslim Brotherhood? Is that 
really what you're suggesting? 

MR. BOWKER: Not at all. I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, you can take 

into account the -- the principles and the -- and the 
policies of -- of the organization that you're giving 
funding to. 

MR. BOWKER: Well, this Court has never said 
that the Congress can make a decision based on viewpoint 
alone. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But there's no way to 
separate -- with an organization in the field that does 
things, there is no way, I don't think, to separate what 
they do from what they say. Congress has two opposite 
views on this in front of it. 

MR. BOWKER: Sure.

way to fight AIDS is consistent with and is furthered by 
longer term efforts to abolish trafficking in women, 
okay? Prostitution. 

All right. The other view is the better way 
to do it is to go into the active sex worker area and --
and not express views on the merits of what they are 
doing, okay? 

So they have two opposite views, and -- and, 
moreover, the groups that do this act on those views. 
So why can't they say, we prefer view A or B, whichever 
it is, and -- because that's what our program is about? 

MR. BOWKER: Congress can -- can certainly 
decide what programs to fund and what programs not to 
fund. But, when Congress makes that decision, Congress 
then can't take the next step to say the only people who 
can get funds under this particular program are people 
who agree with us and who will refrain from saying 
anything inconsistent in their private speech. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you go further 
than that. In answer to my question, you -- you go 
further than that, and you say, moreover, even without 
making it a condition precedent to getting the money, 
Congress can -- the government cannot intentionally 
select those people that it thinks are in accord with 
its views. Right? Isn't that what you said?

The government can't take that into account?

when the government hires a spokesperson. When the 
government hires a spokesperson, the government has the 
right under the -- under its ancillary power, under the 
Spending Clause, to control what that spokesperson says 
for the government. And --

favor -- or you're not opposed to it because you have

does say that. The government says, what we need to 
prevent is the situation where the -- the government 
spokesperson says one thing with public funds, turns 
right around and says the opposite with private funds.

challenge. We have -- it's -- the government concedes

spokespersons and they are not responsible for conveying 
any viewpoint or any message. 

And I'd like to talk for a moment about what 
my clients really do. In the field, my clients provide 
services in the fight against HIV/AIDS, things such as 
preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in 
Tanzania, caring for orphans of AIDS victims in Kenya, 
and providing HIV/AIDS support services in places like 
Vietnam. 

And -- and this is at JA 88 and 89, where you 
can see the list of things that my clients do. None of 
those things relate to an opposition to prostitution and 
none of those things relates to messaging. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. That's my 
problem, which is I'm trying to tease out what your 
position is, okay? I -- I have an understanding of 
you're saying, you can't compel me to say I don't like 
something. And -- and that's like a oath of loyalty. 
That -- that's understandable. 

But, if the government said the following 
more clearly -- this is an oddly phrased policy, okay, 
because it seems to be requiring this oath. But if it 
simply said, if you're an organization that wants our 
funds, you have to say that you're not going to promote 
actively the contrary policy, would that be okay?

 You're not going to go out there and do 

things to promote the legalization of prostitution 
because that's going to undermine our message. Those 
are two different positions, so tell me where you draw 
the line. 

MR. BOWKER: Certainly, that would be okay 
within the four corners of the government program. The 
government controls speech and conduct within its 
program. It can tell us what not to say within the 
program. And that's Rust. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, that's Rust. 
MR. BOWKER: And that's Rust. And what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is a step further. 
MR. BOWKER: And what Rust says, and I -- I 

think we fall back on Rust, which we think is just on 
all fours with where we are here, and that is what the 
government cannot do -- and I think this answers your 
question -- is, outside the government program, the 
government cannot control private speech. 

And it was critical in that case -- Justice 
Rehnquist, at pages 196 and 197, said, "The doctors 
there and the public health organizations there are free 
to engage in their own private speech and their own 
activities, and they are not required to endorse any 
viewpoint they don't, in fact, hold."

 And here --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is saying 

this is what's happening in Rust, okay? And Rust is 
okay. That's very different from saying, it has to be 
that way, and, if it's any other way, it's no good. It 
seems to me that you're just taking the limitation on 
the facts in Rust and saying that is an absolute 
requirement, which is a misreading of the case. 

MR. BOWKER: Rust does not say that, to be 
clear. But the reasoning of Rust -- and the majority's 
reasoning there makes quite clear that the reason the 
Court was comfortable there is that the recipient was 
not the target of the control. The control was around 
the program, and the recipient was free outside the 
program. 

And -- and Respondents here have respected 
that line. There is no question that, for the past 10 
years, even though the policy requirement has not been 
enforced -- initially because the Department of Justice 
concluded that it is unconstitutional and then, 
subsequently, because the district court enjoined it --
it has not been enforced for the last decade, 
essentially. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --
MR. BOWKER: And there's no evidence of harm

at all here, so there's none of this undercutting the 
program that the government is alleging here. 

Sorry, Justice. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. I cut you 

off. 
But -- but I guess what I'm -- I keep going 

back -- you keep going back and forth on this it -- it's 
not okay to tell me to take an oath of loyalty. But 
would it be okay for you to step outside the doors of 
this program and pass out literature that promotes the 
legalization of prostitution? 

Am I making my question clear? 
MR. BOWKER: Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is how do you --

how do you answer the question of why does the 
Constitution bar the government from saying, look, if 
you're going to work with me, you can't go out there and 
promote a -- actively promote --

MR. BOWKER: Right. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a different message? 
MR. BOWKER: That's not the case here, but 

taking that case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well --
MR. BOWKER: Taking that case, I think the 

government can't do that. I think the government cannot

gag an organization's private speech outside the 
program. 

Now, even the government says there has to 
be some germaneness between what they are doing in the 
program and what our requirement is. So I do think it 
would be a tougher case for us and a stronger case for 
the government if my clients were engaged in a program 
that opposed prostitution -- we're not, but if we 
were -- and then we went right outside and said the 
opposite with our private funds, I think they would have 
an easier time showing that there is some compelling 
interest that overrides the First Amendment interest. 

Now, I think it would depend on the facts, 
and those are not the facts here. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Only because -- see, it's 
not -- it's not, in my opinion, not a viewpoint matter, 
if they're going to fund a -- a group that wants to end 
discrimination against women around the world because 
they think all kinds of good things will flow from that. 
The government wants to fund it. Of course, such a 
group has a viewpoint; that's why they're in the 
business. 

So the word isn't "viewpoint." And you 
started to say something about that there is more than 
that here, it has to do with the express nature. And,

then, in answering Justice Sotomayor, you went a little 
bit further on that. And what are the form of 
words -- if you were me and if I were to decide in your 
favor, what form of words would you dictate to describe 
where it is in your opinion that the First Amendment 
cuts in with a preventative restriction? 

How do you describe it? I -- I don't think 
you can, in terms of viewpoint. 

MR. BOWKER: I don't think you can, in terms 
of viewpoint, either, Justice Breyer. I do think that 
the key -- the key that this Court outlined in Rust is 
the government's authority to control its program. And, 
if there is a threat to its program and the government 
needs to take some action in order to protect its 
program, prevent the message from being garbled or 
distorted, whatever the language is, then the 
government's case is strongest. 

Here, that is not at all what is happening. 
As I described, our programs are not opposition to 
prostitution programs. Our programs are HIV testing. 
These are mother-to-child transmission situations, where 
we're trying to stop the disease from spreading. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- can I -- can I be 
sure --

MR. BOWKER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I understand what you've 

just conceded in -- in your response to Justice Breyer? 
The government could require, as a condition 

to come into this program and become a partner with the 
United States, that the recipient not have the viewpoint 
of favoring prostitution? 

MR. BOWKER: No. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you said it's not a 

viewpoint thing. 
MR. BOWKER: No. The government cannot 

target viewpoint, and, for us, that's -- that's a 
bright-line rule. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's what you 
just said to Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I did, too, because I -- I 
didn't see the reason. I thought that was -- I can 
think of dozens and dozens of programs all over the 
world that the government supports, in some way or 
other, and, of course, the people in those programs have 
a certain viewpoint, and, of course, they don't hold the 
opposite viewpoint. 

Otherwise, they wouldn't be in the program. 
So -- so that's why I didn't find that useful. But, 
now, I don't think you can have it both ways between 
answering these questions. What is the answer?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can always

MR. BOWKER: Well, our position here is that 

viewpoint is not the basis on which a decision can be 
made. That is our position. We think the government 
has a multitude of permissible grounds on which to make 
these types of decisions, and they do it every day in 
every other program where they don't have this odd 
policy requirement. They do it every day. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your approach, it 
seems to me, is just dealing with the breadth of the 
program. If the program here solely concerned 
prostitution and sex trafficking and not other areas 
where you say, look, we do a great job in these other 
areas, we just don't get involved in that area. 

But, if the sole program was on prostitution 
and sex trafficking, you -- you wouldn't have a leg to

stand on, would you? 

MR. BOWKER: We absolutely would have a leg 
to stand on, and let me just explain --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're an 
organization --

MR. BOWKER: -- what I attempted to concede 
before, and that is, if -- if the government -- in that 
narrow case, where the government is hiring a 
spokesperson, which is what they've focused on, saying 
one thing with public funds and turning right around and 
saying another with private funds, there is no case that 
says they can gag the private speech of that 
spokesperson. 

But what we're saying is it is certainly 
possible that they would have a stronger case in that 
particular circumstance; however, this is an as-applied 
challenge. My clients are not spokespersons; they 
concede that. My clients are not delivering a message 
or any particular viewpoint on behalf of the government, 
and they concede that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- let me just 
ask -- ask this one more time. It seems -- because it 
seems to me that, when you get into the details of your 
answer, you indicate, oh, well, the government has lots 
of other criteria it could use, which seems to me just

an invitation to disguise what the government's real 
motive is. 

Suppose the government's interested in 
preventing and stopping the spread of malaria. And 
there's an organization that's marvelous at delivering 
the proper message for this, but they criticize the 
United States often. So they choose an organization 
that's not quite as good, but is quiet on these other 
issues. 

Is that permissible for the Congress to do? 
MR. BOWKER: No, I don't think it is. To 

the extent the -- the criteria used by the Congress are 
merely pretext to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this isn't -- no. 
My concern was that your position was pretext. Here, 
the Congress is right upfront. 

MR. BOWKER: And says this is the reason. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And they say, the reason 

we're not giving to organization A is because it's 
always critical of the United States, even though its 
technical skills are better, we prefer organization B. 
Congress cannot do that? 

MR. BOWKER: Congress cannot do that.

that proposition is what? 

MR. BOWKER: Well, even the government 
concedes that -- that they can't do that. They -- what 
they say is that in -- it must be germane. That's their 
limiting principle. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure 
they should if they're going to -- if they're going to 
be able to establish the principle that allows them to 
prevail in this case, and that's why I'm asking. 

MR. BOWKER: I -- I don't think that that's 
permissible because all that is, is penalizing a 
particular viewpoint and withholding a subsidy or 
benefit based on viewpoint. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just want to make 
sure I -- the government has a program to develop water 
resources, and let's say it's in South Africa before the 
abolition of apartheid. And there's a pro-apartheid 
group and an anti-apartheid group. 

And you're saying the government can only 
decide which one is better at digging wells, and it 
can't say, we're going to prefer the anti-apartheid 
group? 

MR. BOWKER: Well, that -- I don't think it 
can make that decision based on viewpoint. However --

apartheid. It can't say -- so the other one shows we've 

got a better record, we dig the wells quicker. 

MR. BOWKER: I mean, the -- the reason that 

that case is so much tougher than this one is because, 

in this one, they're not attempting to select 

organizations that will do the best job by using the 

policy requirement. 

The policy requirement is being used after 

the organization has been selected to say, now that 

you've been selected, we want you to toe the line. We 

want you to profess your belief in our viewpoint and not 

to say anything with your private funds outside the 

program. So it is so far beyond this -- this weighing 

in a selection situation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It goes to the 

effectiveness of the program. It's related to it. The 

United States doesn't want the company or the organization 

that goes into a village and says, we're going to bring â€“ 

you know, this is from the United States, we're bringing 

you fresh water, and it's a -- it's a pro-apartheid group. 

That does undermine what they are trying to 

do, just as in this case, to have the organization 

providing the services that your organization provides 

be identified as as an organization that doesn't want to 

abolish prostitution.

 MR. BOWKER: Yes, I understand. 
I -- I think the government could -- if it 

could make the case that an organization will be unable 
to do this effectively because of what it has said in 
the past -- or what it has done in the past or how --
how the population associates -- what the population 
associates with that organization. 

But here -- here -- and the government even 
concedes -- there would -- there has to be some -- I 
think the word was -- it has to be tightly tethered to 
the programmatic objective. Now, we think that's --
that's way too easy to fulfill; that should not be the 
standard. But that's what they say the limiting 
principle is, is germaneness, tightly tethered. 

In -- in your example, I think that probably 
doesn't even meet their limiting principle. But, in our 
case -- in our case, there is no tethering at all. We 
are out testing for the disease by extracting blood and 
running tests. We're out caring for orphans. We are 
out improving public health services that NGOs deliver, 
and they're saying, now, you have to profess your belief 
in our particular viewpoint --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it say, "profess 
belief." I was going to ask you about that. That's not 
what the statute says. It just says they have to have a

policy. 

MR. BOWKER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: A policy. Which means, I 

suppose, they have to tell their employees don't do 
anything to -- to foster prostitution, but they don't 
have to get up -- get up and announce publicly, we 
oppose prostitution, do they? 

MR. BOWKER: Well, as it's been applied 
to us, it's more than just have a policy. It's have a 
policy and then tell us you agree with our policy, and 
we want to make sure that you believe it, so we know 
that you will do a good job in the program. So the 
purpose here is to police --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They can get all that 
without making you profess it, unless -- unless you 
consider the only -- only profession to be the assurance 
to the -- to your partner, the United States government, 
that you -- that you, in, fact oppose prostitution. 

MR. BOWKER: Well, that's -- that's 
precisely it, Justice Scalia, is we are required to 
profess our allegiance to the government. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: To tell the government. 
Okay. That's -- that's the only profession you're

we're required to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 
MR. BOWKER: -- that's the pledge. As -- as 

the author of -- of the provision called it, it was the 
pledge. That's the pledge to the government. Now --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then they're doing 
that, they say, because we're part of the belief, as a 
matter of policy, that the best way to go about this, 
whether you think so or not, is to restrict the grants 
to those people who will oppose the long-term extension 
of prostitution expressly. 

Now, that's their view of how to get rid of 
AIDS, you say. Might disagree with it, but there are 
plenty of people who think the opposite. So they're 
saying we're not doing it for any reason other than to 
further our policy. 

MR. BOWKER: The government, no doubt, has a 
good reason for putting it there. The problem is the 
First Amendment, and where does that -- where does that 
end? What is the limiting principle? If all that's 
required here is germaneness and then you give a dollar 
and you own the viewpoint and you own the private 
speech, where does that end? 

What that means is -- on the government's 
theory, the government can give you -- can give anyone

now that you've taken a dollar of our money, we want you 
to profess your agreement with the Affordable Care Act, 
and we want you to never say anything inconsistent with 
that in your private speech. 

That is -- that is wildly inconsistent with 
the First Amendment. That's exactly what's happening 
here. The only difference is the subject of 
prostitution. That's what makes it less palatable. 

But for us --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- what -- are 

you saying that you can -- within the government 
program, within the government program, the government 
can specify whatever it wants, including this -- this 
policy, but it can't then say, and the organization 
outside the program is also bound by this profession? 

MR. BOWKER: Within the program, they can 
tell us, if we are speaking for them, what to say, 
and -- on their behalf, not ours, and they can tell us 
what not to say, which is Rust. They cannot command 
fealty to their viewpoint, and they certainly cannot 
control our private speech outside the program. 

Now, to be clear, I just want to address one 
last thing before my time runs. To be clear, 
Respondents here do not promote prostitution, nor do

they approve of it. They merely want to be free in 
their own private programs to operate those programs as 
they see fit, consistent with public health objectives, 
and they want to be able to participate in the policy 
conferences. 

They want to be able to publish papers, and 
they want to be able to be a part of the discussion in 
the marketplace of ideas right here in the United 
States, not in the -- in the nether reaches of the 
world -- right here in the United States. 

They would like to be free to engage in this 
important discussion and to be unfettered by a policy 
requirement that demands fealty to the government's 
viewpoint. 

Now, the First Amendment gives Respondents 
that right, and -- and that's why we are here. 

So unless the Court has further questions?

 First, by -- by way of characterizing this 

requirement, I think there has been a suggestion made 
that what we are trying to do is impose a viewpoint on 
organizations. This is not a matter of imposing a 
viewpoint on somebody. 

It's a matter of picking organizations with 
which to work who self-identify as having views that are 
commensurate with the government's views, so that they 
will be reliable in carrying out the government's 
program. 

Now, Justice Kennedy, you'd asked about 
why -- whether the foreign context of the case--

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't -- I don't want to 
interrupt your rebuttal, but I don't see the difference 
between those two -- those two things that you just 
tried to distinguish. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Because it goes to 
the -- the limitation that the Court has imposed in its 
decisions about leveraging funding so as to suppress 
viewpoints. That's not what's going on here. This is 
not a case in which funding is being leveraged to 
suppress a viewpoint. 

It's a case in which we are trying to get an 
ex ante determination of whether the organizations that 
are going to carry out the Federal program agree with

our policies. If they do, they can participate --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose you have an 
organization that previously has expressed support for 
the legalization of -- of prostitution, but, then, when 
you tell them, well, if that's your policy, you can't 
get our money, they say, well, we need your money, so 
we're going to have to say uncle and, now, we are 
opposed to the legalization of prostitution. 

That then -- that isn't trying to change 
people's viewpoint? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think --
JUSTICE ALITO: To change the viewpoint that 

they are expressing? 
MR. SRINIVASAN: It's not -- Justice Alito, 

with all respect, I don't think it's trying to change 
their viewpoint. I think if they decide, later on, that 
they would affirm to us that they agree with the policy 
at that point in time, well, we may -- we may take that 
observation and engage them. 

But I don't think that effort is to try to 
change their viewpoint. It's to try to get them to 
self -- to self-identify that they are going to be 
reliable in carrying out the government program. 

Justice Kennedy, you'd asked the question 
about whether the foreign context matters, and I talked

about why it matters, in the sense that monitoring can 
be challenging in this context. It also matters in 
another sense, that I should add, which is that, when 
the organizations are doing this work in those areas, 
they are identified as working with the United States 
government. 

There is a statutory provision at 291(a) of 
the Petition Appendix, which is 22 U.S.C. 7611(h), and 
that requires the global AIDS coordinator to develop a 
message that enhances awareness by program recipients 
that the program is an effort on behalf of the citizens 
of the United States. 

So there is a real perception out there 
that, when the organization is carrying out its 
functions, it's doing so at the behest of the United 
States citizens. And part of what Congress wanted to do 
was to avoid a misimpression about why -- about what the 
United States' policy priorities are. 

And one way to do that is to assure that the 
organizations with which the United States works share 
the United States' policy commitment against 
prostitution and sex trafficking. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would have less 
problem accepting your message if there weren't four 
major organizations who were exempted from the policy

requirement and -- medical science -- vaccinators are 
exempted. 

There seems to be a bit of selection on the 
part of the government in terms of who it wants to work 
with. It would seem to me that, if you really wanted to 
protect the U.S., you wouldn't exempt anybody from this. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Sotomayor, Congress 
is not required to -- to pursue every objective, no 
matter what the cost may be. The Court confronted a 
similar situation in Regan. That case involved an 
exemption for veterans. The Court applied a rationality 
standard and said -- said that was fine. And there's, 
certainly, a rationale here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, that was 
one -- one -- veterans. Everybody else was subject to 
the lobbying restriction. Here, it's 20 percent of the 
funds go to the organizations that are free from this 
pledge. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, I think 
the exemption for these organizations makes good sense 
if you consider the character of the organizations. 
Three of the four are -- have members that are sovereign 
entities. And so one can understand --

thought? 

One can understand why Congress would have 
wanted to tread with sensitivity when -- when we are 
dealing with foreign countries, especially foreign 
countries that have different views about prostitution. 

And there's less of a danger -- and this is 
the final point -- there's less of a danger in that 
context that those entities' views are going to be 
misattributed to the United States precisely because 
they are foreign countries. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 
Counsel. 

The case is submitted.
