 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1423, Costco 

Wholesale Corporation v. Omega.

 Mr. Englert.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case is a repeat of Quality 

King v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference. Both 

cases involve goods not authorized for importation into 

the United States. Both cases involve arguments that 

the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus 

the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be 

given less than its supposedly intended scope. The only 

difference is place of manufacture of the goods. 

Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case 

involves goods made in Switzerland.

 According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega, 

Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods 

better in this respect than goods made in the United 

States. It is wildly implausible that Congress had any 

such intent.

From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were 

categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights. From 

1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against 

foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a 

series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including 

section 601 of the 1976 Act. If Congress intended to 

make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of 

foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect 

some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative 

history, but none is. And yet the Ninth Circuit held 

that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first 

sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign 

manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through 

the obscure phrase, "lawfully made under this title," in 

section 109.

 No one in all the briefs in this case has 

identified a single reason why Congress would have 

wanted to do so. Moreover, the words "lawfully made 

under this title" are used elsewhere in the Copyright 

Act, and they never mean what the Ninth Circuit said 

they mean in section 109.

 Most instructive is the very next section 

after section 109, section 110, which governs 

educational use of copyrighted works and was enacted 

contemporaneously with 109. In describing the kinds of

works teachers may show students in their classroom 

without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred 

to works lawfully made under this title. Our briefs 

have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase 

in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and 

it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have 

tried to answer that point.

 Omega says "lawfully made under this title" 

means either made in the United States or authorized for 

distribution in the United States. That argument gives 

up any pretense -­

what your exact meaning is? There -- your blue brief 

and your reply brief appear to give two different 

meanings.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your reply brief 

suggests that if Omega grants foreign reproduction and 

distribution rights but retains U.S. rights, that the 

first sale doctrine would allow Omega to bar 

importation.

 MR. ENGLERT: If it grants exclusive foreign 

distribution.

Because your blue brief says that "lawfully made" means 

anything that was made with Omega's consent or 

authority. So why the difference at all?

 MR. ENGLERT: It matters, Your Honor, 

because of the underlying rationale of the first sale 

doctrine and the underlying rationale of the import ban 

in section 602.

 The purpose of the first sale doctrine is to 

make sure that the copyright owner gets one and only one 

recompense for each copy, for each lawfully made copy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if he sells his 

rights to a foreign manufacturer and distributor, he 

gets paid for those rights. Why should he now have any 

additional rights to bar that authorized copy -­

MR. ENGLERT: The reason, Your -­

into the United States?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes, Your Honor. The -­

MR. ENGLERT: The reason is to give effect 

to the examples given in the legislative history of 

section 602.

in Quality King?

 MR. ENGLERT: Oh. The Quality King has a 

paragraph, much discussed in the briefs, which cites to 

the legislative history of section 602 and in 

particular, cites to witness statements that are in the 

committee prints that are part of the legislative 

history of section 602.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do you think that 

there is a difference between assigning a copyright to a 

foreign entity or merely licensing a foreign entity? 

One of the criticisms of your approach is that you would 

draw a line between those two.

 MR. ENGLERT: We don't draw a line between 

those two, Your Honor.

 The line is -- depends on whether the 

copyright owner has given exclusive foreign rights to 

someone else. And the reason the exclusivity of the 

foreign rights matters is because that is the example 

given in the legislative history of 602 and in the 

paragraph in Quality King.

 And to give meaning to section 602 and to be 

completely consistent with the rationale of the first 

sale doctrine, one must draw some line. Drawing a line 

between the U.S. manufacturer and the foreign 

manufacturer makes no sense. It's not consistent with

the purposes of anything.

 Drawing a line between the exclusive grant 

of rights, whether by license or assignment to a foreign 

manufacturer -- or a foreign distributor, rather, and 

not granting such exclusive rights is perfectly 

consistent with the rationale -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You are talking about the 

first sale doctrine. The perfectly consistent rationale 

would be whether there is a first sale. So -- so 109, 

though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history 

and title, there has to be a transfer.

 So in fact, if a British publisher with a 

British right given by an American author or publisher 

makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't 

apply until there's a sale.

 Now, that makes -- you -- you haven't 

adopted that. Nobody -- I guess maybe one of the amicus 

briefs does, but I don't see why that isn't perfectly 

sensible and I find no authority against it.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, since that's 

a -- a broader position than ours, and we would -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I know it is, but it -- the 

trouble with your position is it gets everybody, I 

think, going to be -- I mean, I don't know what all 

these contracts say. There are hundreds of thousands of

them, if not millions. What I don't see is why you 

don't just say: The first sale doctrine has always 

meant there was a transfer or sale.

 It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil 

Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up. 

You go back to the 18th century. It's always meant 

there has to be a sale or transfer. So why don't we 

just read 109 that way, and there you give meaning to 

everything, and there is just no problem?

 Now, I raise that not because -- I raise it 

because since there's only a few people really 

supporting this, there must be some problem with what I 

say. So what is it?

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, the issue, Your Honor -­

and you're putting me in a position of arguing against 

myself a little bit, but the issue is a fair reading of 

the legislative history of section 602 -- not the text, 

but the legislative history -- is that Congress did 

intend to allow certain blocking of imported goods when 

there had been -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, if you say there 

has to be a first sale, there is no problem. You block 

that British manufacturer from sending his books to the 

United States, but you don't block the person to whom he 

sells it. Gives meaning to everything.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, no, I'm putting 

that to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I 

must be missing something, and I'm not an expert in 

copyright law. What am I missing?

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, there is a dictum in 

this Court's opinion in Quality King that suggests that 

if a publisher and a -- an American publisher gives 

exclusive rights to a British publisher, if an American 

author or a British author gives exclusive territorial 

rights to two different publishers, then 602 retains 

meaning in that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Exactly, and that's what 

it does under my theory, because there has been no first 

sale.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, but -- with respect, Your 

Honor, it's my understanding of both the legislative 

history and this Court's dictum that they refer to 

second and subsequent sales.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you mean you are 

talking about jobbers? Somebody goes and buys, and so 

they're -- and so then you lose, because if that's what 

we are supposed to follow, those excerpts in the 

legislative history, then it would mean that a person 

who buys from the British publisher cannot import into

the United States because 109 doesn't apply.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, that's not what the 

example means. It doesn't say categorically all second 

sales from British publishers are not subject to the 

first sale doctrine. What it says is in a situation in 

which rights have been divided and exclusive territorial 

rights have been given in two different countries, or to 

put it in copyright language, in the language you also 

used in the legislative history, when the copyright 

owner has divided its rights because an innovation of 

the '76 act, the Copyright Act, the copyrights became 

divisible.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where do you get that in 

the text? I mean, that's lovely, and you're saying that 

what Justice Breyer suggests makes perfect sense except 

for dictum and legislative history. Does your position 

make any sense with regard to text?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where? Where is that 

limitation in the text?

 MR. ENGLERT: The other side's effort to 

read 602 broadly has no support in the text after 

Quality King, but -­

 MR. ENGLERT: You cannot.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Well, that's the end 

of it for me.

 MR. ENGLERT: Let us -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I have to say, I didn't 

even see it in the legislative history. I didn't think 

they made a big deal about jobbers. I like history 

here. Go back to 1792.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert, also talk 

about what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then. It seems 

602(a)(2) is dealing with infringing goods, with pirated 

goods. So given the first sale doctrine as you construe 

it, what does 602(a)(1) protect?

 MR. ENGLERT: 602(a)(1) is limited to 

imports and doesn't confer a private right of action. 

602(a)(2), which was enacted after the Ninth Circuit 

ruled in this case, adds a private right of action and 

adds exports. But it is -- 602(a)(2) is a new statute. 

It was not part of the 1976 Copyright Act. So it -- it 

is a subsection in which Congress expanded on what was 

already prohibited in 602(a)(1).

Court is construing is five words, "lawfully made under 

this title." And those five words are used several 

places in the Copyright Act, including section 110, "for 

educational use." The government says "lawfully made 

under this title" can mean two different things in 

section 109 and section 110, provisions of the same 

chapter of the Copyright Act enacted contemporaneously.

 As a fallback position, the government says 

there is nothing wrong with having copyright liability 

for teachers who show foreign-made films in the 

classroom as long as they know they weren't made in the 

United States. So, for example, showing an Ingmar 

Bergman film, The Seventh Seal, in class would be 

copyright infringement according to the government.

 Even the people who make movies don't agree 

with that argument. The Motion Picture Association of 

America has filed an amicus brief in this case, and on 

page 19 of its brief, the MPAA says that the result the 

government says is A-OK is, quote, "a nonsensical and 

unintended consequence." The MPAA goes on to say there 

is no evidence that such liability has ever been 

imposed, but that argument misses the point. We are 

trying to ascertain what Congress meant by using the 

phrase "lawfully made under this title," not making a 

policy argument about consequences, and section 110

remains a powerful argument that Congress didn't use the 

phrase to mean "made in the United States."

 There is nothing extraterritorial about 

construing "lawfully made in this title" as a choice of 

law clause, which means: Lawfully made according to 

standards of the U.S. Copyright Act anywhere in the 

world. In that respect, this case is no different from 

Quality King, in which the court rejected an 

extraterritoriality argument in a two-sentence footnote.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really mean -­

your position is that "lawfully made under this title" 

means that -- means "would have been lawfully made under 

this title if this title governed." Isn't that 

basically what you are saying?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But there is another 

provision of the statute -- I forget where it is -­

which says that in so many words.

 MR. ENGLERT: Not quite, Your Honor. In 

section 602(a)(2) and in section 602(b), Congress used 

the phrase, "would have constituted an infringement if 

this title had been applicable," and it says -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: "If this title had been 

applicable," right? We say "applicable." Much 

prettier.

MR. ENGLERT: Okay, sir. Yes, that is the 

phrase Congress used to express a certain disfavored 

class of goods, goods that would have been infringing if 

this title would have been applicable. 110 -- 109, 

excuse me, and 110 are a different purpose. They are 

the purpose of favoring goods, goods that have been 

lawfully made under this title.

 So, yes, Congress could have chosen to use a 

variation of the phrase "if this title had been 

applicable" under 109, but it didn't. And we are left 

with the language Congress enacted, but it is language 

that Congress uses at least four different places in the 

Copyright Act, and we have a pretty good idea that it 

doesn't mean "made in the United States" and it doesn't 

mean what Omega says it means, which is "made in the 

United States or authorized at any time for distribution 

in the United States."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you -- I see 

that 602(a) is now broken into (1) and (2) and it's 

602(b) that you put entirely in quotes. But what does 

602(a) shelter? How does it coexist with the first sale 

doctrine?

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, as you know, 

there is no reference in the legislative history to the 

interaction between 602(a) and 109, and therefore, this

Court had to address that question for the first time in 

Quality King, and the Court rejected the argument that 

109 is inapplicable to imported goods altogether.

 The Court did say in a dictum which has been 

discussed already this morning that if a British and an 

American publisher divide rights, then section 602(a) 

does have a role to play. But the Court did not say 

books manufactured in Britain are not subject to the 

first sale doctrine.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a concurring 

opinion that says -- that said this case is about a 

round trip and doesn't talk to goods that -­

MR. ENGLERT: Correct, and the concurring 

opinion cited two distinguished copyright treatises that 

suggested there was some concern about 

extraterritoriality in this case. Well, even the 

government has conceded there is no concern about 

extraterritoriality in this case, so the rationale of 

those treatises, learned though they are, is undermined.

 If one looks more closely at those 

treatises, they argue the language is so plain that it 

can only be construed one way. The government concedes 

that's not true. They argue extraterritoriality, as 

I've already said, and they argue that this court's 

dictum in Quality King -- the later additions to those

treatises argue that this Court's dictum in Quality King 

drew a distinction based on place of manufacture, but 

it's only the concurring opinion, not the dictum in the 

court's opinion that mentions place of manufacture. So 

it's a vert thin reed to say that the case turned on 

place of manufacture. And again, one can find nothing 

in the Quality King dictum, nothing in the legislative 

history of 602, nothing in the legislative history of 

109 that talks about place of manufacture.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And nothing in the text 

that supports your position.

 MR. ENGLERT: No. What supports our 

position, Your Honor, is the text of 109, the use of the 

phrase "lawfully made under this title," and the use of 

that phrase "elsewhere in the Copyright Act."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You pulled out of the sky 

this distinction between having created exclusive rights 

abroad and having created nonexclusive rights abroad. 

Where does that come from?

 MR. ENGLERT: That comes from the 

legislative history, Your Honor. And for those who 

prefer not to look at legislative history -­

publisher dividing rights, and they want them to do 

that. There is no problem with that, because there has 

never been a sale. So they divide the rights.

 And there isn't even a problem with -- with 

buyers from the British publisher, because a reasonable 

vertically imposed territorial agreement or other 

restriction on resale is lawful.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, if -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And if it's reasonable, 

they don't even need copyright.

 MR. ENGLERT: That was not true at the time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If it isn't reasonable, why 

should they have it?

 MR. ENGLERT: Pardon me, Justice Breyer.

JUSTICE BREYER: That's all you -- yes, I 

just want you to respond.

 MR. ENGLERT: It was not lawful at the time 

of the enactment of this statute. This Court had not 

yet decided GTE Sylvania, and territorial restrictions 

were per se unlawful at the time Congress enacted this 

statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Here. But in Europe, I 

guess, they were lawful.

 MR. ENGLERT: I don't know the state of the 

law in Europe.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think -- I think it's 

always been true.

 MR. ENGLERT: But, again, what the Court has 

asked me many questions about is whether I'm giving too 

broad a scope to section 602 and too narrow a scope to 

section 109.

 Our position is that section 109 has a 

necessarily broad reach, and we have tried to 

accommodate the legislative history and the dictum in 

Quality King to give some role for section 602 to play 

in the case of nonpiratical goods. If the Court wants 

to reject anything, if it wants to reconsider the dictum 

in Quality King or not rely on legislative history, that 

makes my position -­

JUSTICE BREYER: My question really wasn't 

to argue with you. My question was: Where in the 

legislative history does it say that the point of 602 is 

to prevent a foreign publisher from selling copies to a 

distributor and then that distributor resells them to 

the United States? I'm not saying it doesn't; it's just 

that I didn't focus on those particular words directly.

 MR. ENGLERT: And Justice Breyer, to be fair 

about what the legislative history says, it is 

statements by witnesses. It is not statements by 

committee, so it's a little bit hard to tell where 

they're drawing the line.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. In other words, 

somebody wanted that. I understand the industry wanted 

it. But -- but I -- is there anything in there that 

suggests that this is what Congress wanted to do, 

members of Congress? Even I draw the line somewhere.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me write that down.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ENGLERT: Justice Breyer, we do know 

that section 602(a) has some role to play. And when 

this Court was trying to figure out in Quality King what 

role it had to play it did look to the statements of

Mrs. Harriet Pilpel, Mr. Horace Manges from the American 

Book Publishers Council. And those are the statements 

that the Court said in dicta presumably reflected 

congressional intent, and so I am relying on those 

statements for the limitation of section 109 to 

accommodate section 602.

 But again, if the Court disagrees with me 

and wants to give less of a role to 602 and more of a 

role to section 109, that is, of course, further 

assistance to my position.

 I would like to reserve the balance of my 

time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section -- section 602(a)(1) allows the 

distribution of foreign-made copies abroad without the 

U.S. copyright holder forfeiting the exclusive right to 

distribute copies domestically, which is guaranteed by 

section 106(3), and that provision applies in this case. 

And unlike in Quality King, section 109(a) provides

Costco with no defense because the copies at issue were 

not lawfully made under this title. That is, the making 

of the copies was not subject to or governed by U.S. 

copyright law.

 The decision of the court of appeals should 

not be affirmed for three basic reasons, and the first 

depends on the plain language of section 109(a), which 

applies only to copies that were lawfully made under 

this title.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say "made" 

means?

 MR. PANNER: Well, "made" certainly includes 

the creation of the physical copy. It also includes the 

addition of any necessary intellectual property rights 

that would permit distribution in the United States.

 So that is to say that we understand section 

109(a) should be read to reach a situation in which copy 

has been subject to an authorized sale in the United 

States.

 JUSTICE ALITO: See, I'm with you, and I 

think you -- the text supports you up to the point where 

you add the qualification. But once you've added that 

qualification, I think you're -- you're outside the 

text, just as Costco is outside the text with the 

qualification that they had.

MR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

and let me try to explain why. Section 202 of the Act 

draws a -- a distinction between the material object and 

the intellectual property rights that are involved in 

the copyright. And it makes sense. The word "made" is 

not -- does not correspond to the word "reproduced" in 

section 106(1). It's a broader term that can also refer 

to the addition of these necessary intellectual property 

rights.

 And the -- what is, I think, important is 

the decision whether the copy was lawfully made under 

this title will, of course, be made at the time of the 

sale. It is not -- the decision doesn't need to be made 

at the time of -- of manufacture, because the question 

is: How should section 109(a) or another provision 

apply to that particular copy?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in their brief, the 

brief for the National Library Association indicates at 

the bottom -- the American Library Association indicates 

at the bottom of page 38 that "made" might mean cause to 

exist, cause to appear, and so that it applies the first 

time that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so 

that if you lawfully import it into the United States, 

it would then apply at that time.

 MR. PANNER: Well, I think that that

probably gets us to pretty much the same place, 

Justice Kennedy. I think the point is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it makes the exemption 

work, then, too.

 MR. PANNER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And the -- that also gives effect to the language of 

602(a)(1), because section 602(a)(1) is actually written 

in a very broad term. It's written to apply to copies 

that have been acquired outside of the United States. 

think -- that is, I think, an answer, Justice Breyer, to 

your objection that any sort of sale ought to suffice.

 Section 602(a)(1) is designed to permit a 

U.S. copyright owner to exclude legitimate copies, and 

if you ask where Congress said that, it's right in the 

House Committee report, in the legislative history.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it can. It can exclude 

legitimate copies before there's a first sale.

 MR. PANNER: But the -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the -­

question is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands 

or falls within 106. All right?

 So that's what it says. It says -- it says 

it's an infringement of the exclusive right to 

distribute copies. That's the 106 right.

 MR. PANNER: That's correct.

JUSTICE BREYER: And then 109 is an 

exception from 106. So it's automatically an exception 

from 602.

 MR. PANNER: And I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the text. And 

therefore, you are back at what the meaning of 109 is, 

if I understand your argument. And it seems to me 

that's the choice. If you are going to take 109 

literally, then everything that comes into the United 

States can't, without the permission of the copyright 

holder, but for the exception in (a)(3), and a library 

that brings them in under (a)(3) cannot even lend out 

the books. That's one choice.

 And the other choice is to say that 

"lawfully made" means it's made without contravening any 

provision of the Act, if the Act were applicable.

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What's a third choice? 

Maybe you want a third choice.

 MR. PANNER: Well, a small qualification, 

Your Honor. The exception in section 602(a)(3) does 

allow libraries to lend copies that are imported 

pursuant to that section. It's for archival or lending 

purposes.

 But in any event, I think that that's -- I

don't want to get caught up on the small point. The 

more significant point is that section 602(a)(1) is 

designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner -- as Costco 

admits, it's designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner 

to exclude legitimate copies that are made overseas.

 If the only issue were one of contract, 

there would be no need for section 602(a)(1) because 

there would be no need to create a copyright remedy 

where contractual remedies are sufficient; that is, in 

circumstances where there is privity between the U.S. 

copyright owner or the U.S. copyright owner's direct 

party and the foreign copyright owner.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I started with 

the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first 

sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and 

if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is 

loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act. That's all the 

instances where the British publisher published -- makes 

the book. What they do is they have a license and they 

try to send it to the United States and they can't 

without permission because of 602(a)(1), and then 109 

doesn't come into play because there's been no first 

sale. That's the part of this case that I'm finding the 

hardest, because, literally, 109(a) -- as you correctly 

point out, 109 doesn't say that literally.

MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, section 

602(a)(1) refers specifically to copies that have been 

acquired outside of the United States. So it does not 

make sense to say that it's limited to the publisher, 

because the publisher hasn't acquired the copies. It 

has produced the copies.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right.

 MR. PANNER: So I think that the difficulty 

with Costco's reading, by contrast -- and I think that 

some of the Court's questions brought that out this 

morning -- is that either they -- Costco's reading tends 

to eliminate any practical effect for section 602(a)(1) 

by making it not apply to legitimate copies or it makes 

substantive rights turn on formalities of title, which 

is quite inconsistent with the structure of the 

Copyright Act, which actually goes out of its way to 

make clear that the nature of the rights that are held 

by the copyright owner, which is defined to mean the 

owner of any of the many rights that comprise the 

copyright, are the same regardless of whether there's 

been a transfer.

 And so when Costco says, for example, that 

Omega would have the right to exclude foreign-made 

copies that were produced by a transferee, but cannot do 

so if it manufactures the copy abroad itself, it really

draws a distinction that has absolutely no basis in the 

text of the Copyright Act and that would make 

substantive rights, the value of the rights under 

602(a)(1) and 106(3), turn on formalities and, again, 

transfers that really should make no difference in terms 

of the substantive rights that are available to the 

copyright owner.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me -- why 

didn't they say -- instead of "lawfully made under this 

title," why didn't they just say "made in the United 

States"?

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what you say 

it means. "Made under this title" means "made in the 

United States."

 MR. PANNER: That is not our position, Your 

Honor. Our position is that "lawfully made under this 

title" would include a copy that was manufactured in the 

United States, but that it is not so limited, and that 

if you look at section 1(e) of our brief, we discuss the 

fact that an interpretation of "lawfully made under this 

title" to include a copy that includes the necessary 

licenses for distribution in the United States is a 

consistent reading -- is consistent with the language of 

that provision and gives -- and is consistent with the

traditional understanding that section 109(a) is 

intended to reflect an exhaustion principle.

 So where a U.S. copyright owner has 

exhausted rights with respect to a particular copy by 

having been compensated for a right that has been 

invested into that copy, that can be included in the 

making.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's just not in the 

text. I mean, like the other side, in order to make 

your theory of the text appear reasonable, you have to 

bring in a skyhook with a limitation that finds no basis 

in the text.

 MR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

Again, there is -- because the textual evidence is that 

there is a distinction between reproduction, which is 

the narrow term used in section 106(1), and the broader 

term that is used in section 109(a), which is "made" -­

and again, that inquiry is always going to occur at the 

time of the challenged sale in the United States.

 And so the question is as to that topic.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then you are trying to 

rewrite Quality King. Now you are saying that the 

entire premise of Quality King is wrong.

 MR. PANNER: Not at all, Your Honor, because

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where in Quality King do 

you see anything Quality King turning on where the goods 

were made?

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the reason -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read the decision and 

it barely mentions that, if at all. Its whole premise 

was on what the owner did: Did the owner sell this 

copy?

 MR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

What -- there was no challenge in Quality King to the 

idea that the copy was lawfully made under this title, 

precisely because the copy was made in the United States 

where the Copyright Act governs.

 This Court said in our Descani case that the 

natural reading under this title is subject to or 

governed by this title, and therefore it is a perfectly 

straightforward reading of the text.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't say that. 

mean, you bring in this other qualification.

 MR. PANNER: But Your Honor, again, the 

distinction is between the question whether -- what the 

conduct that is being addressed is simply the 

manufacture. That's the case here.

There's -- all that happened here is that 

the copies were manufactured in Switzerland and sold in 

Switzerland for distribution abroad. That does not 

implicate U.S. copyright law at all. U.S. copyright law 

provides the copyright owner with certain rights to 

exclude. It has no right to exclude the making of a 

copy, whatever you want to say the making means, in 

Switzerland. And it is for that reason that the Ninth 

Circuit correctly determined that the copies at issue 

here were not lawfully made under this title.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How often does this 

situation -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it would be lawfully 

made under this title, even though it was made -- you 

know, made abroad, if what?

 MR. PANNER: If it were made, for example, 

pursuant to a license that allowed for distribution in 

the United States, there would be an affirmative 

exercise of the exclusive right that the copyright 

holder has under section 106(3) with respect to that 

particular copy. And so it makes perfect sense to say 

that that copy is lawfully made under this title, 

because you need to look to U.S. law to determine 

whether the making of that copy -- even though it took 

place overseas, for example -- was governed by -- was

lawful as determined by the rights that are granted -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is isn't the making that is 

rendered lawful. It's the importation into the United 

States that is rendered lawful by the agreement that you 

are relying upon.

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

making -- the question is whether it was lawfully made 

under this title. If it was made for distribution in 

the United States, it could only be lawfully made for 

distribution in the United States if the appropriate 

rights were granted by the owner of those rights. And 

that is why it makes perfect sense to say -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying -­

you are saying that whether or not it's lawfully made 

depends on something that happens after it's made?

 MR. PANNER: In a particular case, it might 

be, Your Honor, but in the typical case -- let's say the 

Heartland case -- if a manufacturer has a license under 

U.S. copyright to distribute in the United States, it 

could be lawfully made at that time.

 But I think, Justice Alito, you were going 

to ask a question about how often the situation arises, 

and I think it's important to point out that there is no 

case that Costco has pointed to, and we are not aware of 

them, where a U.S. copyright owner has sought to

challenge the resale of a copy where there was an 

acknowledged, authorized sale in the United States.

 Obviously, this is a significant issue to 

bringing -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they still 

have that right. You say there is no case. But under 

what theory of yours do they not have that right?

 MR. PANNER: Because if the sale is 

authorized in the United States, then that copy would be 

considered lawfully made because it includes the 

license. That copy carries with it a license to be 

distributed in the United States, which would include 

then the right for a lawful owner to resell it. Again, 

that's consistent with the language of "made" and it 

gives proper effect both to section 602(a)(1), which is 

clearly intended to allow the owner of the U.S. 

distribution right to exclude legitimate copies that 

were made overseas, and it also sensibly construes 

section 109(a) to give affect to the exhaustion 

principle that underlies it. Which is where a U.S. 

copyright owner has exercised his U.S. distribution 

rights with regard to a particular copy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Panner, can you 

answer Mr. Englert's point what earthly sense would it 

make to prefer goods that are manufactured abroad over

those manufactured in the United States?

 MR. PANNER: Your Honor, it doesn't create 

any sort of a preference, as Mr. Englert -- Mr. Englert 

suggests that this is somehow -- prefers the -- the -­

the copies that are made abroad. But in the same 

breath, he suggests that this will actually promote the 

sale of U.S. -- U.S.-manufactured goods because 

foreign-manufactured goods may therefore be of suspect 

legitimacy for purposes of resale in the United States.

 But the key point is that in Quality King 

this Court looked at the language of section 109(a), and 

it says -- and -- and -- and it emphasized that to 

determine the scope of the first sale doctrine that text 

is what matters. And it says section 109(a) applies to 

goods that are lawfully made under this title.

 There was no dispute that goods that are 

reproduced in the United States are lawfully made under 

this title, because one must have a U.S. -- the U.S. 

right in order to lawfully make a copy in the United 

States.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There's a whole brief filed 

that traces the history of that language, and I think 

comes to a somewhat different conclusion. Do you want 

to say anything about that? It was on the other side.

the -- the tracing of the language is -- is helpful, 

actually, to understand how section -- the current 

section 60 -- excuse me current section 109(a) differs 

from section 27, which is, in section 27, what happened 

was is that Congress codified in 1909 the idea that the 

material object is different from the copyright. And 

when it did that, it added that language as a tag-on to 

that principle to ensure that it did not end up 

overruling legislatively Bobbs-Merrill.

 And when the -- when the Congress recodified 

the provision in 1976, it actually took section 202, put 

it separately, and it -- it codified 109(a) in a way 

that is significantly different and then it says 

notwithstanding the rights under 106(3) the owner of a 

copy lawfully made under this title is entitled to 

resell it.

 And that needs to then be read in harmony 

with section 602(a)(1), which after all, was part of the 

same act in 1976, it must be read in such a way as to 

give section rule 602(a)(1) sufficient room to perform 

the function that it was intended to perform, which is 

to ensure that a U.S. copyright owner could protect 

domestic distribution rights against competition from 

legitimate foreign copies. And that's what it -- that's 

precisely what's at issue here.

JUSTICE ALITO: How often do issues 

involving 602(a)(1) come up with respect to things like 

books, musical recordings, movies, as opposed to the 

copyrighted -- the -- the -- the material that is 

copyrighted here, a little -- a little insignia, a place 

to a label -- put on a label or put on a -- on goods?

 MR. PANNER: Thank you, Your Honor, that's a 

very good question. There are a number of cases coming 

up right now through the Second Circuit that involved 

textbooks. This has been -- this has been applied to 

all sorts of traditional copyrighted materials, and 

indeed that's why the amici who have filed in this case 

are not at all limited but include all of the 

traditional copyright industries, software, publishing, 

movies, music.

 And, indeed, Costco does not argue that 

there is any legal significance to the fact that -- to 

the nature of the image or the fact that it -- that it 

is placed on a watch, because I think that Costco is 

quite aware that what is really at stake here is whether 

section 602(a)(1) will continue to provide effective 

protection for the exclusive -­

could only use it for homes and not for offices? Does 

that kind of thing worry you?

 MR. PANNER: No, Your Honor, it doesn't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason it doesn't 

is because there is a first sale doctrine. Now, aren't 

you importing those very things that don't worry us 

about Home Depot into the entire world of books, 

everything you are talking about?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer, 

counsel.

 MR. PANNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I don't think so. And the reason why is 

because, first of all this doctrine has existed for 

nearly 30 years. It's hornbook law that -- that the 

first sale doctrine does not provide a defense in 

circumstances where a -- a -- a copyrighted article is 

manufactured or reproduced abroad. That has been 

well -­

you have a second quickly?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 If the government's interpretation of 

section 109(a) is a little bit different from either of 

the parties, since I want to make clear precisely what 

it is, in our view, the words "lawfully made under this 

title" mean made subject to and in accordance with Title 

17. And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad, 

in order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it 

would have to be created in the United States.

 Now, I think our interpretation of the 

statute still gives it a slightly different meaning from 

the alternative "lawfully made in the United States," 

because at least in theory, it would be possible for the 

creation of a copy to entail a violation of 

environmental laws, workplace safety laws, minimum wage 

laws, et cetera. And it wouldn't be accurate to 

characterize a copy made in that way as lawfully made in 

the United States, but it would be made -- it would be

lawfully made under this title, because it would be made 

subject to and in a manner consistent with the 

requirements of the Copyright Act.

 Now, with respect to the types of copyright 

materials at issue here, the watches are clearly very 

different from what Congress had in mind when it enacted 

section 602(a)(1). But in other respects, what Omega 

was trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress 

intended to allow when it expanded the importation 

provisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical 

copies. The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to 

segment markets either to give -- either retain for 

itself or to give to another entity exclusive rights 

within the United States, but give other rights abroad 

to other producers.

 And consequently, we argued in Quality King 

and we are arguing here that the Court should construe 

section 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section 

602(a) from performing that function.

 And the Court in Quality King grappled with 

the question of whether applying the -- section 109(a) 

to the labels that were at issue in that case would have 

the effect of negating 602(a)(1) and the Court said no 

it wouldn't, because section 109(a) applies only to 

copies that are lawfully made under this title. And the

Court specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that 

were made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign 

country.

 Now, the Court didn't refer specifically to 

the place of manufacture. In giving the example of the 

British publisher who would be creating copies under the 

law of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's 

because British law would apply when the copies are made 

in England. But I think that's the necessary inference, 

because the Court's analysis made quite clear that it 

viewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under 

the law of one and only one question -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is your answer to 

the argument that if "lawfully made under this title" 

means basically made in the United States, that provides 

a great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that 

can't possibly be what Congress intended?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think there are -- I 

think we would say a couple of things. The question has 

been raised whether this gives favored status to a 

foreign manufactured goods. And in one sense our 

reading -- from -- from the perspective of the copyright 

owner, it's true, that this creates something of 

potential incentive to manufacture abroad. Now, from 

the perspective of the potential importer, you could say

this makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because 

they were harder to get into the country than would be 

the case if they had been manufactured within the United 

States and had then been sent abroad and -- and 

reimported.

 I guess the best we can say about the 

treatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the 

differential treatment of foreign and domestic 

manufactured goods is that at least with respect to 

goods that were made within the United States, the 

copyright owner has exercised rights under United States 

law. He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to 

produce the copies in the first instance, whereas the 

manufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then 

selling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its 

Title 17 rights.

 And the theory underlying the first sale 

doctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the 

first articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine 

of the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright 

owner who sells the goods, places them in the stream of 

commerce, has exercised, as the Court put it in 

Bobbs-Merrill, its exclusive right to vend, and 

therefore it can claim no more rights under the 

copyright laws.

Omega with respect to the 

watches at issue here, never exercised any its rights 

under title 17, not -- not when the watches were made 

and not when they were sold.

 I do also want to address the question of 

what happens in the circumstance where Omega 

manufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily 

imports them into the United States, sells them here; 

can it place restrictions on resale because I think it's 

an important policy question and here again we get to 

the same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we 

have a somewhat different textual route to get there.

 Our view is that in that circumstance 

section 109(a) still would not apply, because even 

though the goods were imported into the United States, 

they were made abroad, and that's what counts for 

determining whether they were lawfully made under this 

title. But section 109(a) is simply a safe harbor. It 

doesn't prohibit anything. Section 109(a) says if your 

conduct falls within these contours then what you are 

doing is legal, whether or not it would otherwise 

violate the copyright act.

 But if there is a dispute as to whether 

section 109(a) applies, and a court held that it 

doesn't, the consequence is not necessarily that the

conduct is unlawful. The consequence is that you look 

to other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is 

lawful or not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in your example, if 

there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good, 

then if you interpret "made" as causing to exist of 

appear or under these laws, as the library brief 

suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate.

 MR. STEWART: I think we would say the first 

sale doctrine as articulated in Bobbs-Merrill would 

operate, but we wouldn't place this within section 

109(a).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the 

problem I have with your position. You are suddenly 

saying a copyright -- these issues have to be resolved 

not within the confines of the Copyright Act, but then 

you have to look to -- to common law as well, which is a 

very confused situation.

 MR. STEWART: I think we would still be 

looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather 

than to common law. That is, in the hypothetical I 

describe, clearly there could be no violation of 

602(a)(1), because the copies would have been imported 

by Omega itself. And so the question is if Omega sells 

them within the United States and the buyer attempts to

resell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's 

rights? And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean 

that -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance 

would be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive 

right to distribute copies to the public protected by 

section 106(3).

 And I think the response would be under 

Bobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the 

copyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -­

the word which appeared at the statute at the time -­

once it had exercised its exclusive right to vend the 

copies, it was done with them and had no more rights to 

assert.

 And there is no reason to give the right to 

vend -- the right to distribute under the current law a 

broader reading than the right to vend had at that time, 

simply because Congress has enacted section 109.

 And -- so I think that the -- it would still 

be the case that in order to prevail in a copyright 

suit, Omega would have to show that not only that 

section 109 was inapplicable, but there was a violation 

of the exclusive rights and I don't think it would be 

able to do that here.

 Now in Bobbs-Merrill, the Court was 

certainly drawing on common law principles but it said

in the end, its words: "This is exclusively a question 

of statutory interpretation." It -- it based its 

holding on the language of the Copyright Act as it 

existed at that time, specifically the exclusive right 

to vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to 

the public is no different for these purposes under the 

current statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I found the brief I was 

looking for which is the American Intellectual Property 

Law Association. And they trace this back to Professor 

Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there 

was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a 

pre-emption question, that they thought that the 

copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract, 

and State law of contract had the exception in it which 

applied the first sale doctrine. Now if that's the 

reasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply. We 

could look up what the State law is, but my guess is 

that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to 

goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at 

home.

 MR. STEWART: I -- I think with -- with 

respect to the pre-emption question, what they had in 

mind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a 

reseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance,

that the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or 

do particular types of advertising, and the reseller 

sells them in violation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What Nimmer said is, he 

said we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64, 

'65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual 

restriction on the right of the owner of the particular 

copy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same.

 MR. STEWART: Exactly. I think the language 

was chosen in part at least to make clear that although 

Omega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have 

no remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially 

have a breach of contract suit against the retailer if 

the retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and 

that nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to 

preempt the State law contractual remedies that would 

otherwise be available. And I think the language 

adequately accomplishes that purpose.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Panner what 

policy Congress could have had in mind to give this 

different status to foreign-made goods than to U.S. made 

goods, and Mr. Panner's answer, and Mr. Stewart said 

something similar, was that in one respect Congress is 

disfavoring foreign goods under their interpretation by 

making them harder to import. That's not true.

 Under both of their theories, as long as the 

manufacturer chooses to authorize importation, which is 

Omega's test, or as long as an authorized first sale 

takes place in the United States, then the first sale 

doctrine does apply. So the copyright holder has 

control under their theory and it's not harder to import

the goods.

 In the briefs in this case you will not find 

anyone making any policy argument as to what Congress 

could have had in mind to favor foreign-manufactured 

goods.

 The heart of Mr. Panner's argument was that 

Costco's position either eliminates any significant role 

for section 602(a)(1) or makes section 602(a)(1) turn on 

formalities of transfer of title. Neither of those 

propositions is true. This Court in Quality King 

addressed the role that section 602(a)(1) has to play if 

section 109 is applicable to imported goods, and the 

answer was it still applies to nonowners. That was the 

Court's first answer.

 The dictum that has been much discussed this 

morning was another answer but the Court's first answer 

was that it still applies to nonowners, and because, for 

example, software is licensed there is a very live issue 

about whether the first sale doctrine applies to 

lawfully acquired copies of -- of software. So 

602(a)(1) has a role to play under anyone's 

interpretation.

 Now Mr. Panner asserts that our answers to 

some of the questions that the Court has asked in our 

efforts to harmonize our position with the dictum in

Quality King make 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of 

transfer of title. Our position can perhaps be 

criticized and has been criticized this morning not for 

having a textual basis, but it cannot be criticized for 

making anything turn on formalities.

 Our position turns on the economic realities 

of the situation. If the copyright owner gets its one 

reward, the first sale doctrine applies; if the 

copyright owner doesn't get its run reward, because for 

example it has given the exclusive foreign manufacturing 

rights to someone else, and retained or assigned or 

licensed the exclusive U.S. manufacturing rights, then 

602(a)(1) has a role to play. So neither of Mr. 

Panner's criticisms of our position is correct.

 Mr. Panner asserted that section 109(a) 

differs from section 27, the predecessor statute in the 

1947 Act, which in turn was Section 41 of the 1909 Act. 

This Court said the exact opposite in Quality King.

 It said there is no evidence of any attempt 

to narrow the first sale doctrine through the language 

of section 109(a). And if one looks at the House 

report -- again, getting into legislative history, which 

some members of the Court do not like to get into -- but 

if one looks at the House report, the first sentence of 

the relevant part of the House report is section 109(a)

restates and confirms the principle that where the 

copyright owner has transferred ownership of a 

particular copy or phonorecord of a work, the person to 

whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled 

to dispose of it by sale, rental or other means. No 

hint that using "lawfully made" under this title to 

narrow the doctrine.

 The last sentence of the relevant part of 

the House report: To come within the scope of section 

109(a) a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully 

made under this title though not necessarily with the 

copyright owner's authorization. For example, any 

resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an 

infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord 

legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions 

of section 115, would not.

 So what does the House report on section 109 

tell us? It tells us that lawfully made under this 

title was intended to expand the category of covered 

works beyond just those made by the copyright owner, or 

with the authorization of the copyright owner. But 

under Omega's and the government's position, that phrase 

is used to contract the scope of the first sale doctrine 

in derogation of the common law, imposing a restraint on 

alienation for foreign-made goods that is not imposed on

U.S.-made goods.

 With respect to the policy incentives that 

it creates it's undeniable that it creates an incentive 

for outsourcing of manufacture. The government admitted 

that in its cert stage brief, and again, in its brief in 

this Court. Obviously if Congress wants to create an 

incentive for outsourcing, that's probably within its 

power as long as it can be said somehow to advance 

science and the useful arts; but there is simply not a 

shred of evidence in text or legislative history that 

Congress intended to encourage outsourcing; quite the 

contrary.

 The very controversial section 601, the 

adjacent section to section 602, required that 

nondramatic literary works in the English language be 

manufactured in the United States or Canada or else they 

would not be eligible for a U.S. copyright. So we know 

that the 1976 Congress wanted to favor the domestic 

printing industry, not to disfavor it; and yet their 

interpretation of 602 and 109 would disfavor domestic 

printing industry and any domestic manufacturing 

industry. Thank you.
