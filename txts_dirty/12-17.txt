 Mr. Gupta? 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8  MR. GUPTA: Thank you, and may it please the 

9  Court:

 All 50 States have public records laws. 47 

11  of those States make access available to residents and 

12  nonresidents on equal terms. Virginia, by contrast, 

13  enforces a discriminatory access policy, and, because 

14  commercial requesters make up the vast majority of

 records requesters, out-of-State businesses bear the 

16  brunt of Virginia's policy. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when was the first 

18  of those laws enacted? Do you know? I think it's -- I 

19  think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the

 first to enact a sunshine law. Is that -- am I correct 

21  about that? 

22  MR. GUPTA: That's right. All of these 

23  laws -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: In the '60s.

1  MR. GUPTA: In the '60s and the early '70s. The 

2 Virginia law was enacted in 1968. And we don't deny 

3  that -­

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that's a

 fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by 

6  Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until 

7  the 1960s? 

8  MR. GUPTA: Well, to be clear, the modern 

9  transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of

 well-established common-law right -- rights to access 

11  that are based, not on modern notions of transparency, 

12  but on the right to secure property and other basic 

13  interests -­

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: But those -- those rights

 still exist in this State, don't they? Cannot you get 

16  records of deeds and whatever the common law would have 

17  covered? 

18  MR. GUPTA: Well, it's true that -- that 

19  Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of

 Information law, but, if I understand their position 

21  correctly, they would be entitled, as a constitutional 

22  matter, under their theory, to preclude people from 

23  other States from accessing even deeds. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'll ask them -- I

 didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but

1  I guess we can ask them. MR. GUPTA: Well, my 

2 client, Mr. Hurlbert, 

3  is in the business of gathering property records for his 

4  clients. Now, it's true that, in Virginia, he could get

 the deed, but what he can't get and what he principally 

6  gathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment 

7  records, and those are a much richer storehouse of 

8  property-related information than simply the deed. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you

 explain that business a little more fully than you did 

11  in the briefs? He's in the business of collecting 

12  records from all the States about tax assessments. 

13  MR. GUPTA: That's right. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And he -- and he does

 that for a client who could very well ask himself. So 

16  what is the service that's being performed? 

17  MR. GUPTA: Well, he -- you know, he doesn't 

18  just do the routine request. The -- the large data 

19  companies are the ones who hire him. And they -- if

 they're routine requests, they can do them themselves; 

21  although if they're not based in Virginia, they would 

22  still have to hire a Virginian to do it. 

23  But they bring him in when there's some flaw 

24  in the -- the routine process where the -- the State is

 being recalcitrant or the local official is being 

5

1  recalcitrant. And he's an expert in being able to gather 

2 these -- these records and knowing the process is 

3  knowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not 

4  allowed to do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All -- all he has to 

6  do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him, 

7  right? 

8  MR. GUPTA: Well, he could hire someone from 

9  Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort

 of precisely what the -­

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you don't 

12  have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a 

13  letter saying, give me these documents, right? 

14  MR. GUPTA: He would still have to hire

 someone, and that would be an increased cost. And -- for 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, an increased 

17  cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right? 

18  Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and, 

19  when they come to your house, give them to me.

 MR. GUPTA: Yeah. For the large data 

21  companies -- you know, they will hire someone other than 

22  him to perform this service. They will -- if you're 

23  talking about routine requests. But even -- you know, 

24  even for them, if you're talking about a -- a request

 that isn't routine, if he has to do something further to

1  enforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his own 

2 name, or the data company will have to hire someone 

3  other than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that 

4  for them. And then he will lose that business.

 So the lower you go down in the food chain 

6  of the data industry, the bigger the effect of 

7  Virginia's policy. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much -- how much of 

9  an impact, in fact, does it have on his business? I

 mean, there are 47 States who will provide this 

11  information. 

12  MR. GUPTA: Well, for -- for him, in the 

13  Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing 

14  access -- business in the Virginia market.

 And, if other States were to have policies 

16  like this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those 

17  States as well. So if -- if the focus is on him and his 

18  business in Virginia, it completely cuts him off. 

19  If the focus is on -- on what the effect is

 in the aggregate, on the market as a whole, because most 

21  public records requests are commercial requests, it's 

22  going to have an effect on most commercial requesters 

23  who are out-of-State. And -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gupta, I -- I

 understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not

25

Official 

1  allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA requests 

2 is the following: That the purpose of these -­

3  these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were 

4  enacted -- government in the sunshine. The purpose of

 it was not to enable people to get information, per se; 

6  it was to enable people to see how their government is 

7  working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance 

8  that is occurring in the process of government. 

9  It seems to me entirely in accord with that

 purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens 

11  who -- who are concerned about the functioning of 

12  Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever 

13  records Virginia agencies have. 

14  What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?

 MR. GUPTA: A few responses, Justice Scalia. 

16  First, transparency was one purpose, but, as 

17  I said, these laws also carried forward the much more 

18  longstanding rights to access based on personal 

19  interests and property interests. Also, even at the

 time that these laws were enacted -­

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you don't need 

22  any personal or property interest under these laws. You 

23  can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a 

24  Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have

 no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency 

8

1  for records about this or that. It -- it can't be 

2 based on -- on the 

3  traditional property interest. It's based on the 

4  ability of the citizens of the State to find out what

 the -- what the government of the State is up to. 

6  MR. GUPTA: Even -- even at the time that 

7  these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was 

8  well-understood that they were going to have a big 

9  commercial impact. The property records industry was in

 full swing by the end of the late 19th Century. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point is that 

12  FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens 

13  should know what their government is doing. And you 

14  don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part

 of that political community. Now, Virginia doesn't 

16  allow people from out-of-State to vote. They're not 

17  part of Virginia's political community. 

18  So why isn't this -- if you're not part of 

19  the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA,

 which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is 

21  covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't 

22  have to give any reason for it. 

23  MR. GUPTA: Right. Well, elections just 

24  simply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to

 participate in elections or if you can't wall off the 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1  State in that respect. But what the State can't say is, 

2 simply because one purpose of this law is that we want 

3  to constitute ourselves as a political community, that 

4  we can exclude activities that have a big commercial

 effect. 

6  And -- you know, when we're looking under 

7  the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and 

8  Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said 

9  repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original

 legislative purpose, you look to whether there is 

11  discrimination, which there is here, on its face, and 

12  you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect. 

13  One example of how this policy is actually 

14  being -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: And is the only thing that's 

16  necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's 

17  necessary that the law affect a few people commercially? 

18  I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to 

19  be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order

 for your arguments to work? 

21  MR. GUPTA: Well, what this Court has said 

22  is that there is no de minimis exception, if there's 

23  discrimination against commerce, but, here, what's going 

24  on is anything, but de minimis. Virginia does not deny

 that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are 

10

Official 

1  commercial requesters -- the vast majority of out-of-State 

2 requesters are commercial requesters. 

3  Their -- the amicus brief supporting their 

4  side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus

 brief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -­

6  policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial 

7  requests are typically honored, but out-of-State 

8  requests by data miners are being categorically denied 

9  under the policy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this -- this is 

11  not -- this is not a regulation of commerce. It's a 

12  State practice that may have an incidental effect on 

13  commerce, and the incidental effect may be 

14  disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or

 local, but it's not a regulation of commerce. 

16  MR. GUPTA: But that's -- that was the 

17  Fourth Circuit's theory, and I think incidental can mean 

18  a few different things, and I think in -- in their 

19  opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different

 things. So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack 

21  that. 

22  If it means incidental in terms of the 

23  effect on my client's business, I think, as I've 

24  explained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely

 forecloses him from the market. If it means incidental

1  in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute, 

2 again, it's not incidental because the vast majority 

3  of -- of affected parties under this policy are 

4  out-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data

 companies. 

6  And -- you know, if it means incidental 

7  compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said, 

8  transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws, 

9  but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the

 longstanding rights of public access that have been 

11  around since the -- the first settlements in the United 

12  States -- or before the United States, when, in order to 

13  have a functioning property system, we recognized that 

14  you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and

 those records have to be made available to anyone in 

16  order to exercise property rights. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State of 

18  Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia 

19  businesses, and so we're going to open a business

 training, best practices institute, where you're going 

21  to learn how to be a better business person, but the 

22  only people who can come in are -- are Virginia 

23  businesses. 

24  MR. GUPTA: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under your theory,

1  because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect on 

2 commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is 

3  that unconstitutional? 

4  MR. GUPTA: I don't think so. And there are

 a couple of distinctions. 

6  First, that's not something that the State 

7  exclusively is able to provide. It's not like the 

8  courthouse or the public archives across the street or 

9  the road that runs between them that only the -- the

 State is able to provide. 

11  Anyone can provide a business training 

12  institute, so the State is just one player among many. 

13  Also -- running a 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that just goes

 to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the 

16  principle. And you say extent doesn't matter. You say 

17  there's no such thing as a de minimis exception. 

18  MR. GUPTA: No -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So that -- that explanation

 doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water. 

21  MR. GUPTA: Well, maybe I didn't explain it 

22  very well. To be clear, I think it's more than just a 

23  difference in degree; it's a difference in kind. These 

24  are fundamentally different when -- when you're talking

 about running the courthouse or running the public

4  official public archive of those things. That -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So what? So what? Except 

6  to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an 

7  imposition this is upon interstate commerce. It seems, 

8  to me, that's the only relevance of that point. 

9  MR. GUPTA: Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you dismiss that 

11  relevance. You say it doesn't matter how extensive the 

12  impact is on -- on interstate commerce. 

13  MR. GUPTA: Well, to the extent that you -­

14  you think it does matter, I mean, that -- that

 distinction doesn't matter in this case because the 

16  impact is -- is great. The principal impact is an 

17  impact on out-of-State commerce. 

18  But let me -­

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- when

 you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis? 

21  MR. GUPTA: No. I think this -- if you were 

22  in -- in the dormant Commerce Clause, this would be the 

23  per se rule of invalidity. You have facial 

24  discrimination. The -- the -­

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought a question

 of talking about the effects on interstate commerce, 

6  that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis. 

7  MR. GUPTA: No. What this Court has said is 

8  that -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny, 

9  the per se rule is -- is for cases where there's

 discrimination on its face or discrimination in effect. 

11  And then you've got this other category for the -- the 

12  Pike analysis, where the State regulates evenhandedly.

14  in support of the proposition that this is impermissible

 as a discrimination against interstate commerce? What's 

16  your best case?

 had facial discrimination against commerce because there 

6  were people operating these summer camps, and they were 

7  treated differently -­

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I'll look at those. But I

2  judicial records, there is a different statute that 

3  makes judicial records public. 

4  MR. GUPTA: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we're, now, 

6  talking about the class of information, other than the 

7  two classes I've mentioned. 

8  And I then ended up -- and I'd like you to 

9  add something to this, if you can, that, really, this is

 about -- since getting information involves usually a 

11  benefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the 

12  person the information is about, that willing to run 

13  that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good 

14  government, okay?

 MR. GUPTA: Uh-huh. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if that's the 

17  interest, that's an interest that probably a State has 

18  the right, just as it has the right to say other people 

19  can't vote in State elections, if that's the interest,

 then I guess it could take reasonable measures related 

21  to that interest. 

22  All right. Now, that is the -- the argument 

23  or the position that I would appreciate your addressing.

1  don't deny that that's an interest that the State has, but 

2 then you have to see whether the -- the interest is 

3  reasonably furthered by the statute. And, here, you 

4  have a resource that is not finite, and the statute

 allows the State to recoup its expenses. 

6  So nothing is lost to Virginians. There 

7  isn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by 

8  extending access to out-of-State data companies. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it costs for

 Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and, 

11  if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's 

12  going to cost the State. It's going to have to hire 

13  people to do this. They're going to have to spend many 

14  hours going through these records, so the State

 doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its 

16  own people. 

17  MR. GUPTA: But -- but there's no loss in 

18  resources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows 

19  Virginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses.

6  transparency. It actually makes it less transparent. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I -­

8  there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental 

9  belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the

 alliteration -- simply because the statute discriminates 

11  between citizens and noncitizens. Is that your 

12  position? 

13  MR. GUPTA: No, not at all, I mean -­

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if it's not, what are

 the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that

18  MR. GUPTA: It's the privilege or immunity 

19  of pursuing a common calling across State borders. So

 there's no dispute here that Mr. Hurlbert's common 

21  calling is -- is gathering data. In fact, those are the 

22  principal users of public records laws.

8  that is his common calling and that this law has the 

9  effect of completely cutting him off from pursuing his

 common calling in the Virginia market and that 47 other

13  something very strange with this statute because you 

14  would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because

 it's his business. But the statute, the character of 

16  this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the

 argument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason 

21  for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's

8  that's how he wants to work, correct? 

9  So what's the added value that gives him a

 right to demand it merely because a statute exists? He 

11  doesn't have a right to the information.

13  for is information that's available in the public

 way that -- that someone who -­

21  part is this: It seems that the work is sort of

 I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn

13  it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it

 MR. GUPTA: Right. But this is -- this is a

19  search the records for them before engaging in property

 transactions. By the late 19th Century, you had an 

21  enormous industry that was designed to do this.

8  MR. GUPTA: No, no. Not to this kind of 

9  information. The -- the information that Mr. Hurlbert

 is gathering, tax assessment information, is essential

14  information.

 That -- that information is essential to 

16  these activities. And Virginia, virtually alone among 

17  the States, is -- is erecting this barrier to access 

18  that market and reserving the right to access that

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- I'm still trying to

4  passes a statute that says, We'll let nonresidents have

 access, but they have to pay all the costs. 

6  Nonresidents don't. 

7  Would that satisfy you as valid? 

8  MR. GUPTA: I think that would be a closer 

9  question, but I think that presents some problems as

 well. I mean, so, in your hypothetical, it's free to 

11  the citizens of the State, but they're just passing the 

12  cost on to out-of-Staters. 

13  And -- you know, this -- this Court, in 

14  cases like Toomer and Mullaney, have said that at

 least -- you know, where the State can show that the 

16  nonresidents pose some unique evil, that the -- the 

17  State is entitled to pass the costs on.

19  just being costs them more?

 MR. GUPTA: Right.

22  Ginsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a 

23  request, you're costing them more money.

 discriminating against non as -- noncitizens solely

 MR. GUPTA: Right. Well, that's -- that's 

6  precisely the rationale that -- that in 

7  Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Barnard v. 

8  Thorstenn, this Court rejected. This -- the Virgin 

9  Islands wanted to say if we open up our bar to people

 from all over the country, it's going to increase the 

11  administrative resources. And this Court said, no, 

12  that's not a good enough reason. That's just 

13  discriminating on the basis of citizenship. 

14  But if, for example, the State could show

 that there was -- you know, there were shipping costs 

16  that were uniquely posed by nonresidents and they wanted 

17  to assess a $5 shipping fee for all nonresidents, that 

18  might be permissible.

 like to reserve my time.

4  could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and

 probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not 

6  you, and get the very same information. 

7  So how do you justify this discrimination? 

8  Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is 

9  going to be imposed anyway.

 MR. GETCHELL: I would -- would suggest that 

11  the purpose of the statute, which is political, not 

12  commercial, left the State with the position that it was 

13  going to subsidize with tax dollars this function 

14  because we can't recover our overhead; we can over -­

only recover the actual cost.

18  out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA 

19  requests?

 MR. GETCHELL: No, Your Honor. I don't 

21  think anybody was thinking about businesses of any sort.

3  And I do want to -- want to repel the notion 

4  that there is even substantial discrimination in this

 case because Mr. Hurlbert, in his admission that this is 

6  an as-applied challenge, has a difficulty with 

7  substantial equality of access, because it turns out 

8  that Mr. Hurlbert, in his reply brief, when he teed up 

9  the 1786 statute, which does give access -- did give

 access, he focused his argument on that statute. 

11  And if you run that statute, you will find 

12  that between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not 

13  have general access. They went back to having to show a 

14  particular interest. But that -- from 1840, '41 until

 today, through the codes of 1819 and -- and up until the 

16  present code, Section 17.1208, he has the right of 

17  access to tax assessment records. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- if I 

19  understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only

 reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is 

21  because of the added overhead costs?

3  MR. GETCHELL: The thing that is of -- of 

4  great concern -- why do we care, why do we bother -- is

 the principle that when a government is providing a 

6  taxpayer-subsidized service of recent origin to its 

7  citizens, that it does not have to explain its choice, 

8  either under the Privileges and Immunities Clause or 

9  under the Dormant Commerce Clause.

 It is very important that we not find 

11  ourselves with lawsuits that say, "services." Voluntary 

12  services are, in fact, things that, now, have to be 

13  justified under those two provisions of the

14  make -- better than we have done in the past -­

predictions about what is likely to happen to States

17  That's -- that's the kind of argument he's 

18  making. And he says, so, therefore, there is a national 

19  interest in the flow of this information. And that

 means you have to have a better than "uh-huh" kind of 

21  rationale. That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.

2  MR. GETCHELL: But, in point of fact, 

3  because he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the

 went, you go in the same building and -- if you're 

6  Mr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction, you go to the 

7  clerk's office. 

8  And, if somebody in Virginia and wants to -­

 book, instead of from the clerk's book, you turn in the

14  people who are engaged in the kind of business that

 Justice Breyer was talking about, is that right?

18  summary judgment, and the district court and the court of 

19  appeals, both in our judgment, correctly ruled that

 there's a two -- two-step inquiry.

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He claims that the 

4  dormant Commerce Clause has been effected because he

 reads this statute as saying only Virginia recording 

6  companies have access; out-of-State can't. And it's a 

7  fair reading of the statute. It only permits Virginia 

8  residents, which include commercial and noncommercial, 

9  to access the information.

 So assume, hypothetically, that the statute 

11  reads "only Virginia commercial businesses have access 

12  to this information" -­

13  MR. GETCHELL: If -- if, in fact, you want 

14  to rewrite the statute to -- subject to -- it to attack,

 obviously, that would then raise questions about a 

16  nongovernmental protectionist intent, but that's not the 

17  way this statute was written. It's not how it was 

18  crafted. It -- it has nothing to do with commerce. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the

 question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your 

21  adversary, okay? 

22  MR. GETCHELL: Right.

2 draw the line between direct and indirect, when the 

3  bottom-line consequence is the same? 

4  MR. GETCHELL: I would -- I would have about

 three answers to that. The first -- the first one is 

6  that we don't trigger the dormant Commerce Clause 

7  analysis, unless we are exercising the police power of a 

8  State to regulate commerce. And that means -- it does 

9  mean that not every statute a State passes triggers an

 inquiry, even if it has an indirect effect on commerce. 

11  Whereas, here, we have a statute that has a 

12  solely political intent, the fact that -- that now that 

13  the amici want to tell us about this great burgeoning 

14  enterprise, they -- they want the Court to take that

 into account. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you telling 

17  us that there is simply no commercial consequences to 

18  this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of 

19  no commercial value, in any instance?

 MR. GETCHELL: I am totally agnostic on this 

21  record because we don't have any data on that. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you were the one

 summary judgment in favor of -- of the losing party.

 to this information.

9  on this record, the position that was accepted by the

 two courts below, entirely in accordance with this 

11  Court's existing doctrine, was the first inquiry under

13  fundamental right. If there -- if there is not, then we 

14  make no further inquiry.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's talk about -- let's 

16  talk about the Commerce Clause. You are saying you are 

17  agnostic. You have no idea whether or not there might 

18  be some commercial value to this information. I would 

19  think, as an officer of the State of Virginia or as a

 matter of judicial notice, we could -- we could take

JUSTICE KAGAN: The statute does exactly the

13  way your government operates, and the other is about 

14  free flows of information in our economy.

 And, if both of those things had gone into 

16  the mix to create statutes of this kind, would you 

17  be up here saying the same thing or not? 

18  MR. GETCHELL: I would be saying something 

19  at least slightly different, if I had different facts

 that I had to deal with, but I think, in principle, I 

21  would be arguing the power of the State to pass this 

22  kind of act without having to submit to the dormant

4  government in Virginia is for Virginians. Big game

 hunting, scarce resource can be reserved for in-State

9  things including have in-State tuition. It can have -­

it can subsidize its own businesses, either by training 

11  programs or even by other direct subsidy from public 

12  FISK. It limits welfare payments to residents of the 

13  Commonwealth. 

14  When the Commonwealth is just acting as a

 government and not as a regulator or taxer of interstate

17  in its own sphere, is allowed to do its own policy 

18  choices. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: I think the thing, General,

 that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a

3  Virginia's maintenance of this kind of -- no, it's 

4  Virginians -- you know, Virginia information for

 Virginians, looks very different from what it might have 

6  looked like when the statute was originally passed. 

7  MR. GETCHELL: If -- if we were going to 

8  say, if you were going to say that -- that this is an 

9  inquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause,

 this would be a particularly poor vehicle for doing it 

11  because the Fourth Circuit held that the Pike analysis 

12  of the district court was not appealed, and, therefore, 

13  this case could not be sent back on remand to develop a 

14  burden analysis of a record -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Pike is not relevant 

16  here. Pike involves -- the Southern Pacific v. Arizona 

17  the -- where there were -- where there were melons -­

19  that you had labels and packing of the melons in

 Arizona. That was -- that was discriminatory against -­

 statute has a function. It's a legitimate function 

6  and -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you could say the 

8  same thing, we don't discriminate against Californians 

9  who want to come and pack their melons in Arizona.

 MR. GETCHELL: Well, I would say that -­

11  that whether or not somebody can deal with an item in 

12  commerce is -- is -- raises Commerce Clause questions. 

13  And just, like in Reno v. Condon, where the State of 

14  South Carolina was choosing to take its records and sell

 them into the stream of commerce, there, the Court held 

16  that -- that they thereby became a thing in commerce. 

17  The records of the tax assessor of the 

18  County of Henrico, which are available through the 

19  clerk's office to Mr. Hurlbert, are not things or

 persons in commerce, nor are they -­

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would surprise me 

22  if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting

2 through this adjunct service. All -- all FOIA is, is a 

3  device where you don't have to go and look. There has 

4  always been public access for these -- these records.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so suppose -- I mean, 

6  I think they have an argument, saying, of course, this 

7  information would be useful for gathering national 

8  statistics and helping the national economy. I think 

9  that's true.

 On the other hand, you say, well, but, look, 

11  there must be something left that the States can reserve 

12  to their own citizens, there must be something. They 

13  can't protect their own commerce; that's clear. They 

14  can't discriminate against people who want to come here

 and live here. That's clear. 

16  They can't do this and that and the other 

17  thing, but, gee, there must be something. I mean, can't 

18  they reserve at least their -- their beaches for their 

19  own citizens? No. Parking near their beaches? Well,

 maybe. And -- and maybe deer. And, if not this, what? 

21  That's the end. Okay? 

22  So that's, basically, what you are saying. 

23  This is just an interest in trying to find out how State 

24  institutions work, and the voters have the main interest

 there, and this is other -- so you say the other one is

6  (Laughter.) 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: What is the standard, 

8  because you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities 

9  Clause is -- is considerably opaque, and there are very

 few cases on it. And so what -- how would you tell me 

11  to -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a 

12  tension. 

13  MR. GETCHELL: I -- I think there that -­

14  that the important policy issue in this case for us is

 precisely as you articulated. There -- there is 

16  residual sovereign power in the State to act, and we 

17  have to violate the Constitution, clearly, before we 

18  lose that authority. 

19  And, under existing privileges and

 immunities doctrine, the privileges and immunities 

21  are -- are few; they are -- they have been enumerated in 

22  the courts, they are similar in character, having to do 

23  with commerce, not governmental action. So I would say 

24  you would not extend privileges and immunities.

12  jurisprudence -- and I have some colleagues who don't -- who

14  Why is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?

 MR. GETCHELL: Because it is not an exercise 

16  of the State police power to regulate commerce. The 

17  documents in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the 

18  County of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce, 

19  nor are they channels or instrumentalities of commerce.

 They are just the records of the sovereign, which we 

21  will allow our citizens to obtain.

2 limiting principle on the justification side. 

3  But -- but that's right, Mr. McBurney does not have a 

4  dormant Commerce Clause claim. His claim is based on

 equal access to proceedings. 

6  He wanted to get recovery of child support 

7  that he was owed. So he is a creditor seeking to pursue 

8  a debt on equal terms with people in the State of 

9  Virginia, and the State set up a process. As one step

 along the way to court, you go to the agency, you ask 

11  the agency to enforce. The -- the agency has unique 

12  enforcement tools. 

13  It can suspend someone's driver's license, 

14  for example. It can -- it can intercept income tax

 refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf. And all 

16  he's asking for is the rules of the game. He wants to 

17  know what procedures apply to that process. And at 

18  least where a -- an agency has a process that directly 

19  affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are

 saying is that equal access to the proceedings means 

21  equal access to the information governing those 

22  proceedings.

1  justification because the State can recoup its costs. And so 
they are not saying that this will cost them 

2  anything more, which was the only justification they 

3  pressed in -- in the courts below. 

4  And so they are left with the position that

 they can discriminate simply because they think they 

6  can. And, if you look at the Privileges and Immunities 

7  Clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit 

8  Clause, which indicates, if anything, that the framers 

9  thought that the movement of public records across State

 lines was important to interstate comity. 

11  They changed the Articles of Confederation 

12  version, which did not include public records; it only 

13  referred to judicial records. They added a mention of 

14  judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that

 that was important to -- to comity across State lines. 

16  But -- but their position is about the step 

17  before that. It's about whether you get the records in 

18  the first place. 

19  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

21  The case is submitted. 

22  (Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the 

23  above-entitled matter was submitted.)
