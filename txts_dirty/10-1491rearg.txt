3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Petroleum. 

6  Mr. Hoffman? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. HOFFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The plaintiffs in this case received asylum 

12 in the United States because of the human rights 

13 violations alleged in the complaint. They sued the 

14 defendants for their role in these human rights 

violations in U.S. courts because the defendants are 

16 here and subject to the general personal jurisdiction of 

17 our courts. 

18  There's nothing unusual about suing a 

19 tortfeasor in our --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may I ask you 

21 about the statement you just made? Personal 

22 jurisdiction was raised as a defense, right? 

23  MR. HOFFMAN: Personal jurisdiction was 

24 raised as an affirmative defense, but not raised in a 

motion to dismiss.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so your position is

3  MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not 

adjudicated. Is there --

6  MR. HOFFMAN: It was not adjudicated in this 

7 case. Our position, it was waived when it was not 

8 raised in a Rule 12 motion. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What effects that 

commenced in the United States or that are closely 

11 related to the United States exist between what happened 

12 here and what happened in Nigeria? 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: The -- the only connection 

14 between the events in Nigeria and the United States is 

that the plaintiffs are now living in the United States 

16 and have asylum because of those events, and the 

17 defendants are here. There's no other connection 

18 between the events that took place in the -- in Nigeria 

19 and the forum. The -- the basis for suing the 

defendants here was because they are here and because it 

21 was possible to get jurisdiction. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And just to make it 

23 clear --

24  MR. HOFFMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it's your

1 position -- and I believe it's the position of the 

2 United States; I'm not sure -- that if a U.S. 

3 corporation commits an international law violation in 

4 the United States, that U.S. corporation can be sued in 

any court in the world? 

6  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it is -- it is possible 

7 that other countries would assert jurisdiction. I think 

8 that, generally speaking -- and it might well have been 

9 the case in this case had the issues been raised -- most 

of the time, alternative doctrines like the requirement 

11 of personal jurisdiction, or the requirement -- or forum 

12 non conveniens or other doctrines would -- would have 

13 those cases litigated in other places. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then -- but the way I 

stated the hypothetical, or the proposition, that is 

16 your beginning proposition -- although there might be 

17 some defenses. But as a beginning matter, that they can 

18 be sued in any country in any court in the world. 

19  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think it would depend 

on what the events were and what the claims were and --

21 and what the law in that jurisdiction was. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we assume --

23  MR. HOFFMAN: I think that this -- sorry. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we assume a violation 

of international law --

1  MR. HOFFMAN: Okay.
 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as part of the
 

3 hypothetical.
 

4  MR. HOFFMAN: Yeah. Well, I think that
 

if -- if, in fact, the U.S. corporation committed a 

6 violation of a universal jurisdiction norm, for example, 

7 as we believe these norms are in this case, there are 

8 many jurisdictions in which U.S. corporations could be 

9 -- could be sued.

 In fact, in the United Kingdom and -- and 

11 the Netherlands, I believe their juris -- their 

12 provisions enforcing the international criminal court 

13 might --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose, if you 

have -- I suppose, if you have, as I think there 

16 probably is in this case, a number of plaintiffs, they 

17 can sue in a number of different countries, right? Some 

18 will sue in the United States, others in the United 

19 Kingdom, others in the Netherlands?

 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it -- it is possible 

21 that the plaintiffs could have sued in other places. 

22 They sued here because this is where they live. This is 

23 their adopted homeland because of that. 

24  The United States, under international law, 

clearly has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims between

1 parties properly before them. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some -- is there 

3 some super body that decides what constitutes a 

4 violation of the particular norms of international law? 

That is to say, these other countries that have
 

6 jurisdiction, they decide for themselves, don't they,
 

7 what -- whether there's been a violation of the
 

8 international norm or not?
 

9  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, if -- if there are
 

proceedings with respect to those norms or violations, 

11 yes, they do. 

12  I mean in domestic courts, there are 

13 international tribunals that have a limited 

14 jurisdiction, and they decide. There are some ad hoc 

tribunals that decide other cases. And the national --

16 national courts have always been engines of decision 

17 making on -- on international law. 

18  In fact, that's the foundation of this -- of 

19 this statute comes from the founders' desire to have 

Federal courts decide what law of nations claims --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, national courts have 

22 been the deciders when -- when the violation occurs 

23 within the nation. But to give national courts 

24 elsewhere the power to determine whether a United States 

corporation in the United States has violated a norm of

1 international law is something else, it seems to me. 

2  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's -- it's unlikely 

3 that -- that that would come up, because the suit could 

4 be brought in the United States. It's also unlikely, 

because, based on most forum non conveniens doctrines, 

6 the suit would be heard here, because --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention 

8 exhaustion of administrative remedies. 

9  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, there is the possibility 

of exhaustion of local remedies. I know the European 

11 Union brief suggests that that's part of the 

12 international law package that one has to accept. And 

13 this Court in Sosa did say that it would consider an 

14 exhaustion of local remedies doctrine if that was the 

case. 

16  And, of course, exhaustion of local remedies 

17 would be an additional safeguard against the issue that 

18 Justice Kennedy and Justice --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a case like this is 

brought in the United States and the State Department 

21 tells the district court that allowing this case to go 

22 forward will have a very deleterious effect on U.S. 

23 foreign policy and on the welfare of U.S. -- U.S. 

24 citizens abroad.

 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think there --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: The district court says: 

2 "Well, there's nothing I can do about it. This case is 

3 just going to forward." That's your position? 

4  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, no, not at all. I mean, 

I think --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would happen in 

7 that situation? 

8  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think the political 

9 question doctrine would clearly apply, and -- and -- and 

a court would decide whether to go forward. If the 

11 United States believed that -- that the case should be 

12 dismissed, as I understand the U.S. position in past 

13 cases like Doe v. Exxon, is that -- that there should be 

14 interlocutory appeal from -- from a denial of a 

political question doctrine decision to go forward in 

16 light of that. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: What if a district court 

18 won't certify a question for interlocutory appeal? 

19  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, but I think what the 

U.S. position is, and I think -- I think it would -- I 

21 assume it would be accepted -- is that if the United 

22 States says going forward at all raises those questions, 

23 that it would be able to go up on a Cohen v. --

1 me you're walking away from it. The question as I
 

2 understood it assumed that there is a violation of
 

3 international law.
 

4  MR. HOFFMAN: Right.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that proceeding with 

6 this particular case will, because of some other 

7 reasons --

8  MR. HOFFMAN: Right --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- involve the United 

States or its citizens living abroad in serious 

11 complications with a foreign Government. That's not a 

12 political question. 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it could be. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's political 

consequences, but that's the whole point. 

16  MR. HOFFMAN: Well --

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's -- there's -- you 

18 can't cite a case -- but maybe you can, please do if you 

19 can -- that this is part of the political question 

doctrine. 

21  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that in 

22 Corrie v. Caterpillar, for example, there were alleged 

23 human rights violations, and the United States said that 

24 because U.S. aid was involved in providing the 

bulldozers that were involved in that alleged human

1 rights violation, that the court should dismiss on 

2 political question grounds, and the courts did dismiss 

3 on political question grounds. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Couldn't you just say if --

would we have the power to say, looking at Sosa and the 

6 principles that narrow considerably the subject matter 

7 of this statute, to add a requirement that if the State 

8 Department says that it interferes with foreign 

9 relations it doesn't fall within the statute, can't 

bring it? 

11  MR. HOFFMAN: Well --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: That would get rid of this 

13 problem, wouldn't it? 

14  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, that would get rid of 

the problem. I think that in truth, the -- the way the 

16 political question doctrine would work would probably 

17 end up being the same when it's that kind of rule. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: It would be the same thing. 

19 By the way, did we sign the torture treaty?

 MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. We've ratified --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: We've signed the torture 

22 treaty. 

23  MR. HOFFMAN: We've ratified --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: The torture treaty does 

provide for -- for what is it called, universal

1 jurisdiction? 

2  MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if in fact 

4 a corporation in the United States, in cahoots with the 

Government or something, should do the unusual thing of 

6 violating the torture treaty, Tasmania or any country in 

7 the world that signed the torture treaty would have 

8 jurisdiction under that treaty to proceed, is that 

9 right?

 MR. HOFFMAN: Right. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: So the situation that we're 

12 talking about already is in existence. 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: That's right. I mean, there's 

14 nothing that the Court would do in this case that would 

change --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it was the 

17 corporation, it wouldn't fall under the torture --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- no, the 

19 torture treaty says nothing about corporations.

 MR. HOFFMAN: Right. I mean, that's 

21 different from the ICC. 

22  But the -- the -- yes, Justice.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it provides for a 

2 very simple rule. Please explain to me what's wrong 

3 with it. It basically says you have to borrow both the 

4 substantive and procedural international law norms; that 

those norms do permit these foreign-cubed cases only so 

6 long as either, it appears to me, the defendant is a 

7 citizen of the country, the acts occurred within that 

8 country, or the alien has exhausted both domestic and 

9 international avenues for relief, a sort of forum by 

necessity, which apparently most countries have, 

11 including the ones who have submitted amici arguing --

12  MR. HOFFMAN: Right. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- different points, 

14 like England and The Netherlands.

 MR. HOFFMAN: Right. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me like a 

17 fairly simple set of rules clearly defined and limiting 

18 the application of this statute in a way that sort of 

19 makes sense.

 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's wrong with the 

22 rule? 

23  MR. HOFFMAN: I don't think there is a lot 

24 wrong with the rule, actually. In a foreign-cubed kind 

of case, it seems to me the EU position is, number one,

1 that there is universal jurisdiction, no matter whether 

2 you consider the Federal Commonwealth cause of action 

3 prescriptive or not. And so, the countries of the world 

4 have agreed that all states have an interest in 

enforcing these fundamental norms and that's part of 

6 international law. And that -- that what goes with that 

7 are limits of exhaustion of remedies under international 

8 law, which guard -- safeguards the interests of third 

9 states before the United States can --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So answer me why is this 

11 not the case where on the facts there has been a failure 

12 to exhaust. 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that we would --

14 we would -- there's no record, obviously, about that. 

And one of the arguments we would make about exhaustion, 

16 I believe, is that it would have been futile to exhaust 

17 under international law -- under international law 

18 standards. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Might be -- Nigeria is 

one question, but other potential forums are the U.K. 

21 and the Netherlands. 

22  MR. HOFFMAN: Right. And I think that we --

23 you know, we have -- if there was an exhaustion of local 

24 remedies requirement, then we would have to see if we 

could satisfy that.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think -- haven't both

3 case? 

4  MR. HOFFMAN: It's not clear. I mean, in 

fact, the -- you know, there is a recent Dutch decision 

6 that goes perhaps farther than the Alien Tort Statute, 

7 the Al Brujaj case. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you would agree, Mr. 

9 Hoffman, that if there were an exhaustion requirement, 

it would not apply only to Nigeria, but also to the 

11 Netherlands and to the U.K.? 

12  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I mean, it depends on 

13 how the Court frames it. I mean, there's the exhaustion 

14 requirement under the Torture Victim Protection Act, 

there are other arguments about what that looks like 

16 under international law. I mean, I think that -- to 

17 follow up on Justice Sotomayor's point, I think that if 

18 that's deemed by the Court to be a requirement of 

19 international law, then international law rules on 

exhaustion should apply, and we would either be able to 

21 satisfy them or not or take whatever position we would 

22 take with respect to that. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the U.K. -- the U.K. 

24 and the Netherlands, I -- well, I'll ask you. Do you 

disagree that those are fair judicial systems where a

2  MR. HOFFMAN: Yeah. No, I don't think that 

3 anybody disputes that -- that the legal systems in the 

4 Netherlands or the United Kingdom are fair. I mean, 

they obviously are. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's so, then 

7 what does this case -- why does this case belong in the 

8 courts of the United States --

9  MR. HOFFMAN: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- when it has nothing to do 

11 with the United States other than the fact that a 

12 subsidiary of the defendant has a big operation here? 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it -- it -- from our 

14 standpoint it's here, the way I started the argument, 

really, which is that our clients are here, they're 

16 here. Their -- personal jurisdiction has not been 

17 contested and no one made a forum non conveniens motion 

18 in this particular case. Now, there was a forum non 

19 conveniens motion in a companion case. So -- but I 

think that that's a problem that goes more toward --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what happened to 

22 that? 

23  MR. HOFFMAN: It -- the Second Circuit 

24 overturned the district court on forum non conveniens.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Overturned it which way?

4 non conveniens.

 MR. HOFFMAN: Rejected forum non conveniens 

6 in that case. And I know that the United States brief 

7 believes that that was wrongly decided. But from our 

8 standpoint, the -- if we're talking about the way that 

9 the ATS should be structured, our belief is that forum 

non conveniens, generally speaking, is going to deal 

11 with the problem -- the problems that the Court has 

12 raised. If -- if the Court believes that the Wiwa 

13 decision was wrong or that that doctrine's wrong, that 

14 doctrine should be changed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question 

16 about your reliance on the Alien Tort Statute, but if 

17 your theory is that this is a violation of a universal 

18 norm, and that Federal common law makes it a claim 

19 available in the United States, now there is 1331 

general Federal question jurisdiction. 

21  Couldn't you have said, never mind the Alien 

22 Tort Statute, I'm suing under 1331 Federal question 

23 jurisdiction, and I have got the -- the claim for relief 

24 is the U.S. common law implementing the international 

law?

Official 

1  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think this Court in 

2 Sosa said that its analysis did not necessarily apply to 

3 1331, and I think that's because of the history of 1350. 

4  The history of 1350, as the historians' 

brief lays out, is that the Founders believed that 

6 certain law of nations norms could be implemented by 

7 common law tort actions. And this Court in Sosa found 

8 that without further congressional action, the courts of 

9 the United States would be available to enforce norms 

that were similar to those norms. 

11  And in fact, the norms that the Founders 

12 were familiar with were very similar in kind to the 

13 universal jurisdiction norms that Justice Sotomayor --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but general --

general common law was not considered to be Federal law, 

16 neither Federal law nor state law. If that were so, 

17 every tort action, which in those days were decided 

18 under -- under a general law that was up there in the 

19 sky, would have been a Federal -- a Federal claim.

 MR. HOFFMAN: But there were -- there was 

21 certain -- there were certain norms that were believed 

22 to be part of the law of nations, including piracy and 

23 attacks on ambassadors, and they were governed by 

24 universal standards.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Common law. It's general 

18

1 common law. 

2  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, but I think this Court 

3 found in Sosa that that -- that that part of common law 

4 at the time has become customary international law, and 

that -- that the courts of this country have not lost 

6 their ability to enforce the same kinds of law of 

7 nations norms as the Founders wanted to be -- to enforce 

8 in the Alien Tort Statute in the context of universal 

9 human rights norms.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that isn't the issue. 

11 The issue is whether when they do so they are enforcing 

12 Federal law or not. 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: I think this Court said that 

14 it's the Federal common law within one of the exceptions 

to Erie and -- and I think this Court, right after Erie, 

16 found that there were enclaves of Federal law, one of 

17 them being the area of foreign relations, where Federal 

18 common law should be viewed as Federal --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that answer would 

apply if you were answering Justice Ginsburg's question 

21 in the affirmative by saying that there is 1331 

22 jurisdiction, but you need not go so far, given Sosa. 

23  MR. HOFFMAN: We don't. We don't, and I 

24 think the distinction is that in Sosa and in the Alien 

Tort Statute the statute itself speaks about torts.

1  This Court found, based on the history and 

2 intent of the Congress, that there was no reason to wait 

3 for any congressional authorization to go forward on 

4 those claims, and -- and therefore it was available to 

bring claims. So --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe they had --

7  MR. HOFFMAN: -- we're not taking the 

8 position that 1331 --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- maybe they had to 

provide that in 1789 because there was no -- there was 

11 no general Federal question jurisdiction existing at the 

12 time. 

13  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it could be, but what 

14 seems more obvious about the reason for the Alien Tort

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You point out, I think,

asylum in the United States, so they are here. But 

11 someone who is here all the time, someone who is a

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

8  MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

9 please the Court:

 This case has nothing to do with the United 

11 States. It's Nigerian plaintiffs suing an English and 

12 Dutch company for activity alleged to have aided and 

13 abetted the Nigerian Government for conduct taking place 

14 entirely within Nigeria.

 And, Justice Ginsburg, to the personal 

16 jurisdiction question, Shell did not waive personal 

17 jurisdiction objections to the suit. The court in the 

18 companion Wiwa case determined -- rejected the personal 

19 jurisdiction affirmative defense, and the Second Circuit 

affirmed. 

21  So if you look at Joint Appendix pages 111 

22 to 112, you'll see that we absolutely preserved the 

23 personal jurisdiction defense.

3 question presented on this round of the argument, which

common law be applied to conduct taking place entirely 

6 within the borders of a foreign country? And our answer 

7 is it should not, under the --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that mean, 

9 Ms. Sullivan, that you -- and do I understand your 

argument on brief correctly, that you would say from --

11 the revival of 1350 from Filartiga was wrong because 

12 nothing happened -- nothing happened in the United 

13 States there? Marcos was wrong because nothing -- the 

14 wrong occurred abroad?

 Does your -- the argument you're making now 

16 that this is not applicable to things that happened 

17 offshore exclude Filartiga and Marcos? 

18  MS. SULLIVAN: We do not believe that you 

19 need to address Filartiga because Filartiga is taken 

care of entirely by the proper body, which is Congress. 

21 Congress, in enacting the TVPA, the Torture Victim

granted cert in Filartiga before Congress acted? 

6 What -- under your position, what should have been the 

7 result? I think that was the purport of her question, 

8 and I would appreciate an answer to it. 

9  MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Kennedy. We 

think the current correct result is that the ATS and 

11 Federal common law, which is substantive and remedial 

12 law of the United States -- and here, we agree with the 

13 United States on page 2 of its brief -- ATS plus Federal 

14 common law is the substantive and remedial law of the 

United States. And we think, under the well-established 

16 canon against extraterritorial application of U.S. law, 

17 absent congressional clear indication, there should not 

18 be such an extension. So, therefore --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Sullivan, can I ask you 

about your position on extraterritorial application. I 

21 believe strongly in the presumption against 

22 extraterritorial application, but do you know of any 

23 other area where extraterritorial application only means 

24 application on the territory of a foreign country and 

not application on the high seas?

statute applies on the high seas. 

6  MS. SULLIVAN: We -- we don't concede that 

7 the statute applies on the high seas. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you don't? Okay. I 

9 thought that was common ground. I'm glad to know it 

isn't. 

11  MS. SULLIVAN: Sosa said, looking to the 

12 three Blackstone paradigms, assaults on ambassadors, 

13 interference with safe conducts, and piracy, that 

14 certainly the antecedents to the ATS, the Marbois 

incident of an attack in Philadelphia, and the New York 

16 constable entering the home in New York City of the 

17 Dutch ambassador, those were incidents on U.S. soil. 

18 And Sosa says perhaps also the third paradigm, piracy, 

19 might also be covered.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that 

21 was the most clear violation of an international norm.

2 piracy is this. Even if you think the ATS and Federal 

3 common law can extend to conduct on the high seas, which 

4 are stateless, a place where no foreign sovereign rules, 

that does not mean that the ATS and Federal common law 

6 can apply to conduct within a foreign sovereign's 

7 borders --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't mean that. 

9 It doesn't mean that, but if the -- what is the question 

we're asking. If, when the statute was passed, it 

11 applied to pirates, the question to me is who are 

12 today's pirates. And if Hitler isn't a pirate, who is? 

13 And if, in fact, an equivalent torturer or dictator who 

14 wants to destroy an entire race in his own country is 

not the equivalent of today's pirate, who is? 

16  And we have treaties that say there is 

17 universal jurisdiction. Other countries take it. 

18  MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: We took it in Filartiga. 

We took it in the cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned. 

21 So I absolutely grant you could make the distinction, 

22 but, given the purpose and an objective of the statute, 

23 why should we make it? 

24  MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, with respect, 

the United States has not acceded to the principle of

1 universal civil jurisdiction. And with respect --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we did explicitly in 

3 the torture treaty in respect to that particular 

4 incident.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, in our brief 

6 at 48, note 11, you'll see that that's not quite the 

7 case. I'm sorry -- I'm sorry. 

8  We object -- the United States objected to 

9 the universal civil jurisdiction aspect of the 

convention against torture. We have never acceded to 

11 that. And the reason is that we fear exactly the 

12 consequences Justice Kennedy began the argument with. 

13 We fear that if we say that a United States court can be 

14 open to try any accused law of nations violator for 

anywhere in the world regardless of the place of the 

16 conduct, the other nations of the world might seek to do 

17 the same to us. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: They do that, don't they, 

19 with torture? I mean, isn't that -- it's criminal, not 

civil, quite right. Does that make it better? 

21  MS. SULLIVAN: Criminal is very different 

22 from civil. And what we -- the precise argument we are 

23 making here is that the presumption against application 

24 of U.S. law to conduct within foreign sovereigns -- and 

remember, the purpose of the presumption,

Official 

1 Justice Scalia, is to avoid conflict with foreign 

2 sovereigns. There is no foreign sovereign over the high 

3 seas. 

4  The conflict arises, and the presumption 

protects against this conflict, when we go into a 

6 foreign nation, we project our law. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. That's 

8 the worst. But I really don't -- you appeal to the 

9 general principle of territoriality of our laws. And, 

as I say, I don't know any other case where -- where 

11 that principle allows our securities laws to be applied 

12 on the high seas, for example --

13  MS. SULLIVAN: Well --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even though they can 

apply in Australia. 

16  MS. SULLIVAN: -- Your Honor, if you wish to 

17 say no extraterritorial application, we think Sosa does 

18 not foreclose that, because Sosa simply said piracy 

19 might be one of the -- the actions covered.

 But I want to get back to the key point, 

21 which is --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask this about piracy? 

23 In 1789, do you think that Congress was contemplating 

24 tort actions against pirates in courts of the United 

States?

Official 

1  MS. SULLIVAN: No, we do not, Your Honor, 

2 because we think that in rem actions were the typical 

3 things contemplated. And as soon as 

4 United States v. Palmer comes along, this Court applied 

the presumption against extraterritorial application of 

6 U.S. law to -- the application of the then-extant piracy 

7 statute to a foreign-flagged vessel on the high seas. 

8  The thought was, don't apply it to the 

9 foreign-flagged vessel because that's like a mini-

foreign country on the high seas. So we would argue 

11 that the presumption against extraterritoriality 

12 actually applied in the founding era even to piracy. 

13  But even if you were to say, well, piracy is 

14 covered now, it doesn't follow that the norms that are 

invoked here under the law of nations can be subject to 

16 a U.S. civil cause of action. 

17  And I want to stress that our point is that 

18 the U.S. is projecting here -- and I don't believe 

19 through the statute, the ATS, but through the causes of 

action under Federal common law -- our law onto foreign 

21 countries. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Sullivan, your 

23 argument is very broad, and I want to ask you a 

24 question. Your case might properly be dismissed. But

4 citizen, who then comes home to the United States, seeks 

refuge in the United States. And the French 

6 ambassador -- the French ambassador wants to bring an 

7 action. 

8  Wouldn't the ATS have contemplated exactly 

9 that sort of action? I mean, why would it make any 

difference whether the attack on the French ambassador 

11 by a United States citizen occurred in Philadelphia or 

12 occurred in London? 

13  MS. SULLIVAN: The difference it makes is 

14 that in your hypothetical, the reverse Marbois case, the 

proper remedy would have been to seek -- for France to 

16 seek extradition of the U.S. assailant and --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think I'm advised by 

18 the Solicitor General's office that there were very few 

19 extradition treaties at that time. And even if 

extradition was a possible remedy, I mean why shouldn't 

21 we understand the ATS to provide supplemental remedies 

22 as well, civil as well as criminal, civil as well as 

23 extradition?

1 avoid all of the judge-made possible qualifications that

 Congress doesn't get to say anything if it's 

6 the courts deciding, through their own prudence, 

7 together with the advice from the Department of State. 

8  And, Justice Alito, in answer to your 

9 question whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Excuse me. Do 

11 you mean that the courts -- in those areas where you 

12 acknowledge the statute applies, that the courts will 

13 not apply doctrines of exhaustion, of, you know, comity, 

14 of -- the appropriateness of bringing the action here? 

Of course they will, won't they? 

16  MS. SULLIVAN: They're not always applied, 

17 Justice Scalia. And if so, it sometimes takes many 

18 years before they happen. And the State Department is 

19 not always listened to.

 In the South African apartheid case, not 

21 only did the State Department seek to protest the 

22 action, but the Government of South Africa filed a 

23 letter, and the district court ignored both.

then. But that's not the question here, right? The

1 question here is -- is the different one of whether you 

2 ever get to the exhaustion question. 

3  MS. SULLIVAN: Correct. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: And if you go back to the 

reverse Marbois, you said Congress didn't speak, but I 

6 think what we said in Sosa is that Congress did speak, 

7 that Congress was referring to exactly that kind of tort 

8 when it passed the Alien Tort Statute. 

9  And you are saying it would have made a 

difference to Congress that the incident occurred in a 

11 different place even though the attacker was a United 

12 States citizen seeking refuge in the United States and 

13 leaving the French with no remedy. 

14  MS. SULLIVAN: With respect, Your Honor, the 

French had several remedies. The French victim could 

16 have sued in tort in the United States. And under the 

17 transitory tort doctrine that was adopted at the time, 

18 which is not a precedent for the ATS, would have allowed 

19 a suit under French law. French law would have been 

imported to try that claim. So it could have been tried 

21 in State court as an assault. 

22  Second, there could have been extradition. 

23  Third, the point of the Marbois in 

24 stimulating the ATS was that if -- if a U.S. citizen 

attacks the French ambassador on U.S. soil, and we then

2 But there is no incident of war or conflict posed in 

3 your hypothetical because extradition was possible, and 

4 State court tort violations -- State law tort -- State 

court jurisdiction over a transitory tort should 

6 have obtained. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think it matters 

8 that the harboring is after the fact or not? Meaning if 

9 the -- if the mercenary fled France and was hiding from 

the French here, why is there any less chance of a war? 

11  MS. SULLIVAN: Well --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand. The 

13 apples and apples don't -- seem to not match in my mind. 

14  MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Sotomayor, I -- there 

is theoretically the possibility that if State law 

16 transitory tort didn't work, and if extradition didn't 

17 work, and if the French didn't just seek to punish the 

18 assailant in their own country, maybe there would have 

19 been international conflict, but there is no evidence 

Congress was thinking about that at the time. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Pirates could have been 

22 sued in State court, too, and yet the ATS -- I know that 

23 you quarrel about whether an act of piracy qualifies as 

24 an international norm, but assuming that I accept it is, 

pirates could have been -- under your theory, pirates

2 found it important to pass the ATS. 

3  MS. SULLIVAN: It did. But, Your Honor, 

4 there is not a single founding era precedent, not a 

single one, that involves the reverse hypothetical. 

6 Every single founding era precedent that stimulated the 

7 ATS or came soon in its aftermath involved international 

8 law violations alleged to have occurred on U.S. soil or 

9 in U.S. waters.

 The two cases most soon after the ATS were 

11 Moxon v. The Fanny and Bolchos v. Darrell, which 

12 involved supposed law of nations violations on U.S. 

13 waters and on U.S. soil. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: What should happen when the 

injury occurs within the territory of a foreign country, 

16 but it is alleged that the injury was directed by 

17 someone in the United States? 

18  MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Alito, we would 

19 respectfully urge that direction is -- is not enough. 

If the place of the injury and the place of the last 

21 conduct was on foreign soil. We think ordinary 

22 restatement of conflict principles would suggest that 

23 you look to the law of the place of injury, not to the

they have to entertain private civil litigation. And

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan, before your 

7 time runs out, I mean, you have said, candidly, that if 

8 Filartiga were to come up today, if Marcos were to come 

9 up to this forum, there would be no basis under the 

Alien Tort Statute. 

11  But assume for the moment that those two 

12 cases -- that we accept them -- Sosa seemed to accept 

13 them. Is there anything different about your case? 

14  MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor. There are 

many -- many differences between us and Filartiga. For 

16 one, this is a case in which there is a -- a class 

17 action against a corporation. And if you don't agree 

18 with us on the lack of extraterritorial application, we 

19 still maintain that the ATS does not apply to 

corporations. 

21  Second, there is -- there was a -- there's 

22 an allegation here of aiding and abetting a foreign 

23 Government. It was unclear in Filartiga whether the 

24 Paraguayan was acting within or without the state's 

authority, but -- and he was later deported, so we don't

where the offense to the principle against international 

6 friction is at its highest. And so if you weren't to 

7 adopt our position in full, at a minimum we think you 

8 should hold that the presumption applies to 

9 foreign-cubed cases involving aiding and abetting a 

foreign government, where everything is foreign. 

11  But we don't think you should do that in the 

12 first instance. We respectfully submit the better 

13 approach is to apply the presumption as a categorical 

14 matter.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in Filartiga, why

17 pretty clear. He probably was working for the 

18 government, which is even worse.

6 that? Maybe the facts didn't, but certainly the 

7 reasoning of the case addressed that issue very directly 

8 and -- and basically said it does. And then it talked 

9 about how you limit it. That's what Sosa did.

 MS. SULLIVAN: To answer the Chief Justice's 

11 question, you don't need to overrule, so to speak, 

12 Filartiga on Justice Kennedy's question. You can simply 

13 say that in the intervening period, Congress did, as is 

14 appropriate in the area of applying law to foreign 

conduct, pass a specific statute, the TVPA, that applies 

16 exactly to the conduct in Filartiga. That should inform

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Sullivan, I'm going 

3 to read you something from Sosa, which -- it talks all 

4 about the rule that it adopts and then it says: "This 

is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of 

6 the courts and judges who faced the issue before it 

7 reached this Court. See Filartiga." And then it quotes 

8 Filartiga: "For purposes of civil liability, the 

9 torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader 

before him, an enemy of all mankind." 

11  So we gave a stamp of approval to Filartiga 

12 and Filartiga's understanding that there were certain 

13 categories of offenders who were today's pirates. 

14  MS. SULLIVAN: If -- the fact that the 

nations of the world agree on norms does not mean the 

16 nations of the world agree on remedies. And what the 

17 ATS and Federal common law, as interpreted in Sosa, do 

18 is project a U.S. civil cause of action with U.S. rules, 

19 punitive damages, no attorney fee shifting, contingent 

fee and punitive damages. That should not be done 

21 except by Congress. They did it in the TVPA, but you 

22 should not permit it to be done here. 

23  Thank you.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

3  FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

4  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

6 may it please the Court: 

7  The Alien Tort Statute should not afford a 

8 cause of action to address the extraterritorial conduct 

9 of a foreign corporation when the allegation is that the 

defendant aided and abetted a foreign sovereign. In 

11 this category of cases, there just isn't any meaningful 

12 connection to the United States. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that the same -- is 

14 that your simple rule? Is that how you want us to 

rule --

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that there could 

18 never be aiding and abetting on behalf of a corporation? 

19 Is that your simple answer to this case, or what's the 

general --

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: It's -- it's a narrower 

22 statement than that, Justice Sotomayor. It's that there 

23 shouldn't be a cause of action to address the 

24 extraterritorial conduct of a foreign corporation that 

is alleged to have aided and abetted the acts of a

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about in your -- you

4 within the Alien Tort Statute.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, we do, 

6 Justice Ginsburg. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't -- don't adopt 

8 a theory that many of the -- briefs do, that there has 

9 to be some connection, some nexus to the United States. 

You just tell us that Filartiga is okay. And how about 

11 Marcos, is that okay? 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we think in 

13 Filartiga, Justice Ginsburg, that the -- the -- that 

14 there is a nexus to the United States. The actual 

perpetrator was -- A, it was a case against the actual 

16 perpetrator.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you don't offer us a 

21 nexus. You don't offer us that reason why Filartiga was 

22 okay. 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, I think our reasons 

24 for why Filartiga was okay is that -- that it was the 

actual perpetrator, not an aider and abettor, and the

4 features of the Filartiga situation that justified --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What else? What else? 

6 You -- you say Filartiga. You don't mention Marcos. Is 

7 Marcos in your view a proper exercise? 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I think Filartiga is 

9 the paradigm, and cases like Filartiga are the paradigm 

that -- where we think ATS -- ATS causes of action 

11 should be recognized. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: General Verrilli, the --

13 that's -- that is a new position for the -- for the 

14 State Department, isn't it?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: It's a new --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: And for -- and for the 

17 United States Government? Why should -- why should we 

18 listen to you rather than the solicitors general who 

19 took the opposite position and the position taken by 

Respondents here in other cases, not only in several 

21 courts of appeals, but even up here? 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, Justice Scalia, in 

23 a case like this one, in cases under the Alien Tort 

24 Statute, the United States has multiple interests. We 

certainly have foreign relations interests in avoiding

1 friction with foreign governments; we have interests in 

2 avoiding subjecting United States companies to liability 

3 abroad. We also have interests in ensuring that our 

4 Nation's foreign relations commitments to the rule of 

law and human rights are not eroded. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but --

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: It's my responsibility to 

8 balance those sometimes competing interests and make a 

9 judgment about what the position of the United States 

should be, consistent with existing law. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it was --

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: And we have done so. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it was the 

14 responsibility of your predecessors as well, and they 

took a different position. So, you know, why -- why 

16 should we defer to the views of -- of the current

19 they are persuasive, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your successors may 

22 adopt a different view. And I think -- I don't want to 

23 put words in his mouth, but Justice Scalia's point means 

24 whatever deference you are entitled to is compromised by 

the fact that your predecessors took a different

1 position. 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: So, Mr. Chief Justice, 

3 let me be clear: In this case our position is that the 

4 Court ought not recognize a cause of action.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that the defendant 

6 in this case were a U.S. corporation, but the case were 

7 otherwise identical. What result then? 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: In that case the possible 

9 risk of foreign relations friction would be comparable. 

The risk of reciprocal exposure to American companies 

11 would also exist. The difference between that case and 

12 this case, Your Honor, is that there'd be a much more 

13 substantial connection to the United States because it's 

14 an American company. The question in the case would be 

whether the -- that substantial connection provided a 

16 sufficient justification for subjecting the United 

17 States company to these international law norms to avoid 

18 undermining the credibility of our Nation's commitment 

19 to those norms. We haven't taken a position on that 

question in this case because we think that the Court 

21 ought to proceed incrementally here. The case before 

22 the Court involves a foreign corporation in which there 

23 just isn't any connection to the United States at all, 

24 and it's our judgment that the Court should decide that 

case --

2 you are disavowing any forum of necessity view of the 

3 ATS? You are disavowing what other countries do or say 

4 with respect to citizens -- to aliens who are attacked?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Our view about that, 

6 Justice Sotomayor, is that the key determinant here, and 

7 the reason why there ought not be a cause of action 

8 here, is the absence of any meaningful connection to the 

9 United States. And the question is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I asked you a question 

11 directly. Are you foregoing -- are you foregoing any 

12 forum necessity exception to the rule you've just 

13 announced? 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: We don't think that the 

question of the availability of a forum or 

16 nonavailability of a forum is sufficient to override the 

17 absence of any connection to the United States. 

18  Now, I will say --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: If I could follow up on the 

question I asked before. I'm not asking you to say 

21 definitively which way you would come out in this

4 Sosa norms in order to avoid undermining the 

credibility --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose everything is the 

7 same except for --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't -- we are not 

9 very good at figuring out the foreign policy interests 

of the United States. And, you know, in the past we 

11 have tried to get out from under our prior case law in 

12 the sovereign immunity area of asking the State 

13 Department. And the State Department would come in 

14 here: This is good; this is bad. We abandoned all that 

in the sovereign immunity field. Why should we walk 

16 back into it here? Or do you intend to have us make 

17 these foreign policy decisions? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: Congress can always act 

19 in this area, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but assuming Congress 

21 doesn't act. Why should -- you know, you want us to 

22 listen to the State Department case by case. Is that --

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, actually what we 

24 are advocating here, Your Honor, is that the Court can 

make categorical judgments, not pure case by case 

47

1 factual judgments. We just think there is more than one 

2 category. There are salient differences between a 

3 situation like this one, in which there is no connection 

4 to the United States at all, or a situation like the one 

Justice Alito raised about an American corporation. And 

6 there are also cases in which the suit is against a 

7 direct perpetrator. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But we listen to the State 

9 Department as to what those categories ought to be.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think the 

11 categories are evident from the kinds of cases that have 

12 been brought. But -- but certainly, the views of the 

13 State Department do deserve deference. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about a 

nexus test? That's what it sounds like to me. Has to 

16 have either an actor nexus or a act nexus, effect nexus? 

17 What are you talking? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think what we're --

19 we're not -- we're talking about something different, 

Justice Sotomayor. The question is whether to recognize 

21 a Federal common law cause of action. I think that 

22 depends on --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Either it exists or it 

24 doesn't.

1 of interests, I believe, Your Honor, and that there are 

2 interests that cut against recognizing causes of acts in 

3 this area, and that's what Sosa said. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is -- that -- I'm having 

trouble with this. We -- without question, piracy, 

6 attacks on ambassadors, we know that those were 

7 international norms in 1789. If one of those acts 

8 happened, you seem to be suggesting that, answering 

9 Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that if a Frenchman 

attacks an English ambassador in Switzerland, that case 

11 would never be heard in the United States because there 

12 is no nexus to the United States; is that correct? 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if no one ever came 

14 to the United States.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, assuming someone 

16 came. So how is that different from here? 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: No. It's just -- it's 

18 not -- the connection is not an on/off switch. But our 

19 position is you need a connection in order to assess 

whether there is even an interest in having cause of 

21 action --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't presence 

23 alone in the United States a connection?

14 is carried out by Torture, Inc. Because my actual 

question is about aiding and abetting. I mean, the

17 Filartiga or not -- in your view?

19 If they are the direct violator of a norm that they can 

violate directly, then yes they can.

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: The difference is that
 

9 while you would have a comparable -- you would have a
 

risk of friction in subjecting a foreign sovereign's 

11 acts to scrutiny in the United States, you have the 

12 reciprocity risk I mentioned. You would have to make a 

13 judgment about whether those concerns are overcome by 

14 the countervailing concern of applying the -- finding an 

ATS cause of action to apply U.S. norms. If it's an 

16 entirely foreign corporation with no connection to the

1 you read the diplomatic materials that we placed before 

2 the Court, it's absolutely clear that what the British 

3 were concerned about was pillaging and plundering on 

4 land in the Sierra Leone colony. They were seeking 

redress for those things, for destroying libraries, for 

6 destroying Freetown, not just about things that happened 

7 on the high seas and not just about things that happened 

8 in territorial waters. It's absolutely clear that 

9 that's true, but obviously you have those materials and 

you can read it. And Attorney General Bradford said 

11 there was no doubt that there was an ATS action. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was also a U.S. 

13 perpetrator. 

14  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, that's true, but with 

respect to the presumption against extraterritoriality, 

16 it wouldn't matter if it is a U.S. perpetrator or not. 

17 And it shows exactly why the presumption can't apply 

18 because it would undermine the very purposes of the 

19 statute in the best available evidence that we have 

about what it meant in the era. 

21  I would like to give a hypothetical that I 

22 think reveals why the U.S. Government position should 

23 not be accepted. 

24  Suppose there is -- there is an Iranian 

corporation that secretly supplies poison gas to the 

52

5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 current Syrian regime in order to kill tens of thousands 

2 of Kurdish citizens. And suppose after the Assad regime 

3 is overthrown, those -- the documents revealing that 

4 poison gas transfer to the Syrian regime was made public 

and that Iranian corporation does business in the United 

6 States, asylum seekers who were driven out by the poison 

7 gas attacks are in the United States, maybe living in 

8 the same communities as the plaintiffs in our case, 

9 having gotten asylum in this case. Would it be the case 

that the Alien Tort Statute should not apply to a claim 

11 of aiding and abetting the Assad regime and murdering 

12 tens of thousands of its people? It is the modern day 

13 example of I.G. Farben. Is it the case that a modern 

14 day I.G. Farben would be exempt from the Alien Tort 

Statute? There is a clear, well-established doctrine of 

16 aiding and abetting in international law. It has been 

17 accepted by the lower courts. The lower courts have 

18 uniformly rejected the arguments that have been made by 

19 Respondents in this case. And I would say that the Sosa 

framework is -- should be given a chance to work. This 

21 Court dealt with these issues eight years ago. It set 

22 up a historical paradigm test based on many of the 

23 concerns that have been expressed here, and there are 

24 alternative doctrines that can be applied to deal with 

these concerns. Political question, active state, 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company

10

15

20

25

Official 

1 international comity, forum non conveniens, personal 

2 jurisdiction, those have not really been litigated. 

3 Whether they have been waived or not is something that 

4 the lower courts can deal with. Whether they apply the 

lower court --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Given the court's recent 

7 decisions on personal jurisdiction, and I have in mind 

8 particularly the Goodyear Tire case, is there personal 

9 jurisdiction in this case or in the case of your 

hypothetical? 

11  MR. HOFFMAN: One of the problems that --

12 that we would have, Justice Ginsburg, in answering that 

13 question is that there is no record about the contacts 

14 between these defendants and -- and the jurisdiction in 

2002. The Wiwa case, for example, where it was 

16 litigated was dealt on a factual record that went back 

17 to 1996 and 1997. So there is no record here about 

18 personal jurisdiction because it hasn't been asserted. 

19  Now if the defendants have not in fact 

waived personal jurisdiction, then presumably the lower 

21 courts would apply the tests that this Court has -- has 

22 established or in the 2011 decisions. And the same 

23 would be true of forum non conveniens or any of the 

24 other defenses. They have raised other defenses in this 

case that have not been fully litigated. So -- so my 

54
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 basic position is that the Sosa framework actually is --

2 works. It has actually weeded out cases. These 

3 alternative doctrines have weeded out cases, but the 

4 Court should not accept the categorical positions 

asserted by either of the Respondents, which are the
 

6 broadest categorical positions even rejected by the
 

7 Government, or the Government's modified categorical
 

8 position. Those kinds of issues can be dealt with
 

9 within well-established doctrines where lower courts
 

have a body of jurisprudence that they can use to do 

11 this. 

12  The Alien Tort Statute as was applied to 

13 human rights cases from Filartiga on is part of a trend 

14 in the world today. The trend in the world today is 

towards universal justice for people that -- and 

16 corporations that violate these kinds of norms. That's 

17 the trend. In fact, the United States has been the 

18 leader in that. Our Government has proclaimed our 

19 leadership position to U.N. bodies and around the world.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the United 

21 Kingdom and Netherlands don't think so. 

22  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the United Kingdom and 

23 Netherlands have obviously asserted this position. But 

24 the Netherlands have asserted that position while at the

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It may have been wrong. 

6  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it may have been but 

7 actually it seems perfectly consistent with Dutch law, 

8 it is consistent with the exercise of universal 

9 jurisdiction in many pieces of legislation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would rather listen to 

11 the Dutch Government than one, one Dutch judge, frankly. 

12  MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the Dutch Government, 

13 though, and one of the significant pieces in this case 

14 is that the Nigerian Government doesn't have a position 

on this case any longer. The United States Government 

16 has never asked for this case to be dismissed on foreign 

17 policy grounds. The United Kingdom and the Dutch 

18 Government have never asked for this case to be -- to be 

19 invalidated on foreign policy grounds. They have stated 

their position about what they think the Alien Tort 

21 Statute should mean. And if you look at the European 

22 Union brief, of which the United Kingdom and Dutch are 

23 members, the European Union says there is no issue about 

24 universal jurisdiction, there is no issue about civil 

jurisdiction that falls within universal jurisdiction.

1 Their only argument is that if you accept that, you 

2 should accept international opposition and exhaustion of 

3 local remedies. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: And isn't that really the 

way to reconcile the Dutch positions? The Dutch are 

6 objecting because they think they have a fair forum, but 

7 when the judges were faced with a case arising from 

8 Libya, they thought that there was no fair forum there. 

9 And that's the difference, that in one case there was 

exhaustion and in the other there wasn't. 

11  MR. HOFFMAN: I think that that's probably 

12 what the basis of the Dutch position. Our position, 

13 though, is that this -- the framework that this Court 

14 established in Sosa to -- to take the pirates of the 

18th century and deal with the Alien Tort Statute with 

16 the torturers and those who commit genocide in the 21st 

17 century was correct, and that doesn't need a radical 

18 re-evaluation as suggested by the Respondents and the 

19 United States.
