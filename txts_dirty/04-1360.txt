[10:02 a.m.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

in Hudson versus Michigan. 

Mr. Moran. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Over the last 50 years, courts in virtually 

every American jurisdiction have suppressed evidence 

seized inside homes following knock-and-announce 

violations -- including this Court, on two occasions. 

Those suppression orders reflect an understanding of 

two points key to this appeal. The first point is 

that the manner of entry -- and, in particular, a 

knock-and-announce violation -- is not somehow 

independent of the police activity that occurs inside 

the house. And, as this Court directly recognized in 

Wilson, the reasonableness of police activity inside 

a home is dependent on the manner of the police 

entry. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask you whether 

there are statutes in various States that allow an 

officer to get a no-knock warrant?

 MR. MORAN: Yes, there are, Justice 

O'Connor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And does Michigan have 

such a statute? 

MR. MORAN: I do not believe so, Justice 

O'Connor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How common are those 

statutes? 

MR. MORAN: I believe about half the States 

have such no-knock -- no-knock statutes. So, in 

Michigan, a police officer -- if the -- if the 

circumstances on the scene justify a no-knock entry, 

then the officer is permitted, by case law and, of 

course, by the precedents of this Court, to go ahead 

and do so. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why would an officer, 

without such permission, want to make a no-knock 

entry while possessing a warrant --

MR. MORAN: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- a search warrant? 

MR. MORAN: -- as this case illustrates, 

sometimes officers believe that it is to their 

advantage to perform a no-knock entry, or to fail to 

comply with the knock-and-announce requirement. And 

that is why --

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why? 

MR. MORAN: Well, Officer Good apparently 

thought that his safety would be better served he if 

disregarded the knock-and-announce requirement; and 

so, he candidly testified, at the evidentiary 

hearing, that it's essentially his policy, in drug 

cases, to go in without a -- without performing the 

necessary knock-and-announce. And that was 1 year 

after the -- this Court's decision in Richards, 

saying that there is no per-se exclusion of drug 

cases from the knock-and-announce requirement. 

But that brings me to the second reason why 

courts have almost universally, until the Stevens 

case in 1999, held that suppression of evidence is 

necessary, and that is deterrence; because, without 

the suppression of evidence, there is very little 

chance that the officers will be deterred from 

routinely violating the knock-and-announce 

requirement, from adopting a sort of personal 

violation of the requirement, just as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know, I'd be 

worried -- you know, bust in somebody's door -- that 

the homeowner wouldn't shoot me. Without announcing 

that I'm the police, he had every reason to believe 

he's under attack. Isn't that a considerable

deterrent? 

MR. MORAN: Yes, that's the one purpose of 

the knock-and-announce requirement that doesn't 

protect the homeowner's interest, that protects the 

officer's interest --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 

MR. MORAN: -- against being shot. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MORAN: However, what we'll see then, 

if there is no exclusion of evidence following knock-

and-announce rules, are entries precisely like the 

one we have here, where the officers will, in fact, 

announce -- they yell, "Police, search warrant" --

but then they'll immediately go in. Officer Good 

said that he went in real fast. He went in, and it 

took him just a few seconds to get in the door. So, 

that's what they'll do. They'll announce -- some 

officers will announce, because they'll want the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. MORAN: -- people inside to know that 

they're police, but they will not wait for a refusal, 

and they certainly will not wait for a reasonable 

amount of time for some --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I agree with 

a point that you make in your brief that civil

actions simply are of no use. That might have been 

the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule, 

but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by 

prisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of 

these cases are successful below. What reason is 

there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate 

deterrent? 

MR. MORAN: Simply, Justice Scalia, that, 

as far as we can determine, no one wins a knock-and-

announce case, or we haven't been able to find a 

single case in which someone has actually recovered 

damages for a knock-and-announce violation. So, if 

this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 

damages are slight or because there's a defense that 

is successful? What has been the defense in these 

tort cases? 

MR. MORAN: Both, Justice Ginsburg. First 

of all, in many cases, such as this one, where the 

police don't actually destroy the door, it would be 

very hard to quantify the damages, and it would be 

very hard to find a lawyer to take a case such as 

this. But the second barrier is the various 

immunities, tort immunities. In section 1983 

actions, there are qualified immunities that make it

difficult to win a suit. And because it is not a 

bright line as to when the police officers have to 

knock and announce, and when they do not -- that is, 

Is there a reasonable suspicion that a quick entry or 

a no-knock entry will be met with violence or that 

the evidence will be destroyed? -- courts tend to be 

very generous in granting qualified immunity to 

officers -- that is, concluding that some reasonable 

officers might have concluded that it was justified 

to dispense with the knock-and-announcement 

requirement. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that same 

problem exists if the consequence is exclusion of 

evidence. Courts are going to view it the same way. 

You're not going to avoid that problem by excluding 

evidence. 

MR. MORAN: Well, there -- but there is not 

a qualified-immunity defense to the exclusionary 

rule. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. MORAN: And so, if the Court concluded 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, your point 

is, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long 

enough, right? And that's why they don't win a lot

of these cases. But the same thing is going to be 

true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is 

the exclusion of the evidence. The court is going to 

be very -- it's going to be very difficult to tell if 

they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court 

is likely to say, you know, "Let it go." 

MR. MORAN: That's true, to some extent, 

Justice Scalia, but, as an empirical matter, I've 

cited many cases, in my brief, over the last 50 years 

where courts from a vast majority of American 

jurisdictions have found knock-and-announce 

violations in criminal cases, and have, therefore, 

excluded the evidence, including this Court, on two 

occasions, 1958 and 1968. So, courts do find knock-

and-announce violations in criminal cases. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Our two cases did not --

did not raise that issue. The issue was not decided 

in those cases, was it? 

MR. MORAN: The issue of a knock-and-

announce violation leading to exclusion of evidence--

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MORAN: -- was decided. The -- there 

was not an inevitable-discovery issue raised in those 

two cases, because those cases predated the 

inevitable-discovery doctrine. But, of course, in

1958 and 1968, this Court was very familiar with the 

independent-source doctrine. And, really, the 

argument that the Michigan Supreme Court has adopted 

-- they call it an inevitable-discovery argument; 

it's really an independent-source doctrine. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you 

don't dispute the application of the inevitable-

discovery principle here, do you? 

MR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice -- Mr. 

Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

MR. MORAN: No, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you don't 

dispute that the purpose of the knock-and-announce 

rule is not to allow the targets of the search to 

dispose of evidence, or anything of that sort. 

MR. MORAN: Absolutely not. The purpose of 

the knock-and-announce rule is to protect the 

homeowner's privacy rights. It's one of the core 

parts of the right of the people to be secure in 

their homes against unreasonable police invasions. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a 

limited privacy right, of course. These people have 

a warrant, right? 

MR. MORAN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how would you 

describe the privacy interest that the knock-and-

announce rule is protecting? 

MR. MORAN: Well, I think this Court has 

described it well in the -- in its most recent cases 

-- in Banks and Richards, in particular, as well as 

Ramirez and Wilson -- that it is a right against 

being terrified by having the police come in. It is 

a right against being embarrassed. People might be 

in all stages of undress or in compromising positions 

when the police come in. And it is a right against 

having one's door destroyed. The English cases, the 

early English cases, first recognized that it's a 

right against having one's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it doesn't go 

at all to the items that are the target of the 

warrant. 

MR. MORAN: No. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, why should 

the remedy for the violation be to exclude those 

items? The privacy that's protected isn't the 

cocaine, the weapons, the other items that were 

discovered. 

MR. MORAN: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I think you could say the same thing about

the warrant requirement. The purpose of the warrant 

requirement is also to protect the sanctity and the 

privacy of the home; it's not to protect contraband 

that one might have in the home, or whatever it is 

that the police are looking for. It's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's to protect 

privacy in the possessions and papers and effects. 

And these are possessions, papers, and effects. It 

goes right to what the police are trying to seize, 

and you have an independent magistrate make a 

determination that there's probable cause to believe 

it, et cetera, et cetera. The knock-and-announce 

rule is an entirely -- concerned with entirely 

different things. And yet, you're enforcing it by 

excluding the papers, effects, and possessions. 

MR. MORAN: And I think the courts have 

recognized that it's necessary to enforce it that 

way, because other methods of enforcing it will not 

work. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but just --

MR. MORAN: -- I think it's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just on the point of 

the causal relation that the Chief Justice was 

exploring, I mean, there is a causal relation in a 

but-for sense. We know that.

 MR. MORAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose the position of 

the Respondent is that the minute there's an entry 

after the knock violation -- the no-knock violation -

- the minute there's an entry, that injury ceases, so 

that it's different from a warrantless rummaging-

around through drawers and so forth. I suppose that 

would be their argument. 

MR. MORAN: I think that is their argument, 

Justice Kennedy, and I respectfully disagree with it. 

As a historical matter, even the early English cases 

recognized that when an officer illegally entered --

a sheriff illegally entered a home with a valid writ, 

that officer became a trespasser, and the activity 

that he performed in the home was, therefore, 

illegal. In the reply brief, I cited several early 

American cases, from the 1830s and 1840s, holding 

that when an officer had a valid writ to seize a 

debtor's goods, but illegally entered the home, then 

that writ became no good; and, therefore, the officer 

-- the sheriff, in those cases -- could be sued, not 

only for the illegal entry, but also for the seizure 

of the goods that he had a valid warrant, or a valid 

writ, to seize, and that that --

warrant to enter the home, not to seize particular 

goods. So, the entry of the home was not illegal. 

The entering of the home was perfectly okay. What 

was illegal was not knocking and announcing in 

advance. It seems to me that's quite a different --

quite a different issue, and the causality is quite 

different. 

MR. MORAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

respectfully disagree that the entry was not illegal. 

I believe the entry was illegal, because what a 

warrant authorizes an -- a -- an officer to do is to 

make a legal entry. It does not allow the officer to 

enter however he pleases; it allows the officer to 

make an entry that complies with the law -- in 

particular, the fourth amendment. And so, the entry 

was illegal. They could have performed a legal 

entry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but the 

essence of the violation was not the entering; 

whereas, in the cases, the old common law cases 

you're talking about, the essence of the violation 

was the entering. Here, the entering was perfectly 

okay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give 

the advance notice, that made it bad. And that, it 

seems to me, creates a different situation.

 MR. MORAN: I think, starting in Semayne's 

case, the Court recognized that even if the officer 

would have a right to knock down the door after a 

refusal of entry was obtained, that if the officer 

did not wait for that refusal, then the entry was 

illegal. And so, I think the common law cases do 

support -- the old English common law cases, starting 

with Semayne's case -- do support the notion that the 

entry -- the entry does become illegal if the officer 

does not wait for the refusal. And in this case, of 

course, the officer did not wait at all for any 

refusal, candidly admitted that he went in as soon as 

he could get through the door, as quickly as he 

could. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Moran, would you 

clarify an answer you gave to Justice O'Connor at the 

outset of the argument? You said there is no 

statutory right to get a no-knock warrant. But did 

you say, as a matter of case law and practice, that 

can be done in Michigan? 

MR. MORAN: I don't believe so. I don't 

believe that Michigan still allows for no-knock 

warrants. But officers, of course, can perform no-

knock entries when arriving at the scene, the 

circumstances justify a no-knock entry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean, if you 

had a case where the reason you were arresting the 

guy is because he's shot through the door the last 

three times somebody knocked and announced, you still 

have to knock and announce, under Michigan law? 

MR. MORAN: No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief 

Justice. I think, in that case, that would satisfy 

the Richards standard. In that case, the officer 

would have particularized suspicions amounting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he couldn't get 

a warrant saying that. 

MR. MORAN: I don't believe Michigan has a 

procedure for granting no-knock warrants, not --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's -- that's 

actually what's disturbing me about this, because I 

thought the knock-and-announce rule was a rule that 

would allow a policeman to go in without knocking and 

announcing when he has reasonable grounds for 

thinking he might get shot if he didn't. So, I -- as 

I read the briefs, I thought maybe that's not how 

it's being implemented, that the policemen are 

supposed to run the risk of being shot. I didn't 

think that was the situation. So, I'd appreciate 

your explaining that to me.

said that if there are particular facts about this 

particular entry that would make an officer have 

reasonable suspicions that he is going to be shot at 

or the evidence is going to be destroyed, then the 

officer may dispense with the knock-and-announce 

requirement. There were no such suspicions in this 

case, and that's why the prosecution conceded, at the 

outset and at every step since, that it was a knock-

and-announce violation. The officers had no 

information about this particular --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would it be sufficient if 

the officer says, "One, this is a drug gang; two, 

they don't let people into the house whom they don't 

know; and, three, they have guns"? 

MR. MORAN: That might be sufficient, after 

Richards, but that's not the facts of this case. We 

have none of those facts in this case. They were 

serving a warrant, and they had no information that 

they were going to be in particular danger. They had 

no information, for example, that there were drugs, 

stored near the toilet, that were going to be flushed 

down. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I 

understand the hypothetical case, where, three times 

before, there had been warrants served, and, each

time, the homeowner shot at the officer, the fourth 

time, they could go in without waiting. 

MR. MORAN: I think that would be an easy 

case, Justice Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think it would, okay. 

MR. MORAN: Because then you would have 

particular facts about this particular residence and 

the people involved. I think that would be a very 

easy case for a no-knock entry. We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can't get a 

warrant that says he can do that. 

MR. MORAN: I don't believe Michigan has 

that procedure. Perhaps Mr. Baughman can correct me. 

He's a -- he's with the prosecuting attorney's 

office. But I don't believe Michigan has that 

procedure. Not all States do have that procedure. 

And, instead, States that don't have that procedure 

simply leave it to the officer to determine if there 

are those facts that justify a no-knock entry. So, 

there are many entries in Michigan, that occur all 

the time, that do not comply with the knock-and-

announce requirement. And that's fine, because the 

officer does, in fact, have the particularized facts 

justifying a no-knock entry.

route before in other cases, like Wilson, but it's 

still a troublesome measure. It's hard for me to 

believe that if a person has drugs in the pockets of 

his trousers or on the -- next to the chair where 

he's sitting, that he wouldn't immediately run and 

try to dispose them. I just think that it's ordinary 

behavior. And, if that's so, then it would follow 

that you never have to knock if you're looking for 

drugs that might be on the person. Do you have any 

comment as to that? 

MR. MORAN: Well, then that would -- this 

Court, I think, would have to reverse Richards, 

because Richards said that the fact that it's a 

felony drug investigation does not justify a blanket 

exclusion from the knock-and-announce requirement. 

And this Court unanimously held, in Richards, that 

the knock-and-announce requirement applies in felony 

drug cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --

MR. MORAN: -- unless --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if we say that a 

likelihood -- or that the -- or substantial 

probability that the evidence will be destroyed 

allows the no-knock, why won't that be true in every 

drug case, other than for what we said in Richards?

 MR. MORAN: Well, because in Richards --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, do people say, 

"Oh, they've got me now. I won't get rid of the 

drugs"? 

MR. MORAN: Well, first of all, Justice 

Kennedy, I think the law presumes that homeowners 

will either make an explicit refusal, "No," or will 

answer the door; and primarily that they'll do the 

latter. The presumption of the homeowner that we're 

talking about is an innocent homeowner, somebody who 

is either -- has nothing to do with whatever the 

police are looking for. There are many cases where 

the police are looking for goods that are not 

connected to the people who are home. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when there's 

probable cause to enter, there's no presumption of 

innocence, is there, or am I wrong? 

MR. MORAN: Well, it -- with -- probable 

cause is a standard at somewhere around 50 percent, 

and a very large number of warrants are executed on 

the homes of people who have nothing, or people who -

- there is something that the police are looking for, 

but they don't have anything to do with it; they're 

third-party homeowners. And, for that reason, the 

knock-and-announce requirement recognizes that many,

many warrants -- many, many searches -- will be 

executed on the homes of perfectly upstanding, 

innocent people. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- do 

you have any empirical basis for your statement that 

many warrants are executed and they don't find 

anything? 

MR. MORAN: Well, I don't have any 

statistics. I'm sure the FBI keeps statistics on at 

least Federal warrants. But it's true that in a 

large number of warrants, the police don't find what 

they're looking for, because probable cause is a 

standard that is not particularly high. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any 

basis for your statement that, in a large number, 

they don't find what they're -- anything that they're 

looking for? 

MR. MORAN: I don't have any empirical 

evidence, but certainly lots and lots of anecdotal 

evidence, from reading newspaper accounts of police -

-

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you --

MR. MORAN: -- searches. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you don't dispute the 

fact that presumption of innocence -- the presumption

of innocence survives an indictment, doesn't it? 

MR. MORAN: It does, and I think it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. MORAN: -- survives the search warrant. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So probable cause is not 

enough to eliminate the presumption of innocence. 

MR. MORAN: I certainly would argue that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. MORAN: -- Justice Stevens, that 

probable cause it not a very high standard. And in -

- many search warrants are, in fact, served on the 

homes of people who are not suspected, because 

they're thought to be the place where stuff was 

stored, but not be the people who are suspected of 

doing anything wrong in the first place. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Moran, these old 

common law cases you referred to, which held that a 

failure to knock and announce renders the entry 

unlawful, what was the consequence, in those cases? 

MR. MORAN: Those were cases in which, 

typically, the sheriff was sued for trespassing. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And the evidence 

would -- if found, was not excluded, right? 

MR. MORAN: No. There was --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we wanted to be 

faithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't 

exclude the evidence. 

MR. MORAN: I think things have changed, 

Justice Scalia, since those common law days, for that 

reason. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then you shouldn't 

have cited the common law case. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. MORAN: Well, Justice Stevens -- I 

mean, excuse me, Justice Scalia, things have changed, 

in the sense, first of all, that in those days there 

was a common law writ of trespass. If one were to 

file, in Michigan, a complaint for trespass against 

the sheriff, one would be laughed out of court today, 

because all that you have is a tort suit, which you 

have to show an extreme violation -- I cited the 

Michigan statute that requires extreme recklessness 

on the part of the police officer. 

The second point is that in those days the 

sheriffs were -- there were adequate means to control 

the behavior of sheriffs, because they were seen as 

arms of the judiciary. That, of course, was before 

the rise of the independent police forces that we 

have today. And so, the exclusionary rule, of

course, was adopted in the late 1800s, early 1900s --

in part, in response to the changing circumstances of 

the police. The police were no longer under the 

direct control of the judiciary; and so, different 

remedies were necessary in order to assure compliance 

with constitutional rights. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the courts that have 

allowed this action to go forward, has the rationale 

been that there is no other effective deterrent to 

ignoring or violating the knock-and-announce rule? 

MR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. At last 

count now, 11 State and Federal appellate courts have 

directly rejected the Michigan Supreme Court's 

reasoning. The Idaho Court of Appeals just joined 

the list 2 weeks ago, in a -- in a case that I -- is 

not cited, because it's so recent. And they have 

uniformly -- I believe all 11 of those cases have 

said that, "Were we to hold otherwise, the knock-and-

announce rule would become meaningless," a worry that 

this Court expressed in Richards. This Court was 

very concerned, in Richards, that simply excluding 

drug cases from the knock-and-announce rule would 

make the knock-and-announce rule meaningless. And 

these courts have noted that statement -- the courts 

that came out -- this -- the decisions that came out

after Richards, and have said, "If that is 

meaningless, then it would be especially meaningless 

if we were to exclude the entire knock-and-announce 

rule from the exclusionary rule, that there would be 

virtually no reason for police officers ever to 

comply with a knock-and-announce requirement. 

And so, I think the deterrence rationale is 

a large part of this, and that's what distinguishes 

this case from the inevitable-discovery cases, which 

the Michigan Supreme Court relied on. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose there are 

a lot of other violations of constitutional rights by 

the police that are very hard to get at, and that 

cannot be remedied. And I suppose we could punish 

them by excluding all the evidence, as well. We 

don't do so, simply because there's no causality. We 

insist upon a causal connection between the two. 

It's not enough just to say the -- this is the only 

way to stop the police from making the violation. 

MR. MORAN: No, it is not enough, but what 

is critical in this case is that the knock-and-

announce violation goes to the manner of entry, and 

the Court has long recognized that the two predicates 

for seizure of goods inside a home, or arrest inside 

a home, are authority to enter the home, which is not

contested here, and a lawful entry. And if either 

one of those two predicates is missing, then you have 

grounds to suppress the evidence; that is, the 

evidence inside the home is in the fruit of the 

unlawful entry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about our opinion in 

Ramirez, where the manner of entry was such that 

there was damage to property? 

MR. MORAN: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't exclude the 

evidence there, did we? 

MR. MORAN: No. First of all, this Court 

didn't find that there was a violation in the -- in 

the damage in property; this Court found no -- did 

not find, as a matter of law, any fourth amendment 

violation. But I read the Ramirez -- that language 

from Ramirez as saying that as long as the entry 

remains lawful -- and, in Ramirez, the entry was 

lawful, because there were valid grounds to dispense 

with the knock-and-announce requirement. You had a 

known dangerous fugitive, who had bragged that he 

wouldn't be taken alive. And so, there was every 

reason for the officers to dispense with the knock-

and-announce requirement. Therefore, the entry was 

legal. They had both authority -- that is, the

warrant -- and they had a valid entry -- that is, a 

no-knock entry that was justified by reasonable 

suspicion that the officers would be met with 

violence if they did knock and announce their 

presence. And so, we -- in Ramirez, we have a lawful 

entry. The language that's quoted from Ramirez 

directly says, "the entry remains lawful," or words 

to that effect. And you have a different case if you 

had --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what had happened? 

Had they broken a window on the way in? Is that --

MR. MORAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the entry remains 

lawful, despite the fact that the manner of the 

entry, which included the breaking of a window, was 

unlawful. I think what the Court meant was not, as 

you're portraying it, that, objectively, the entry 

was lawful. I think they were speaking: as a matter 

of law, despite the fact that the breaking of the 

window was wrong, the entry was lawful. Just as your 

opponent is saying here: despite the fact that there 

was no knock-and-announce, the entry was lawful. 

MR. MORAN: Justice Scalia, I don't see any 

language in Ramirez saying that the breaking of the 

window was unlawful. I think the breaking of the

window -- I read the Ramirez opinion as saying the 

breaking --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But even if it was 

unlawful, it was not unconstitutional. 

MR. MORAN: It wasn't -- certainly wasn't 

unconstitutional. Often, when the police perform a 

valid no-knock entry, they will damage property. 

Typically, they will destroy the door. And so, the 

breaking of the window in Ramirez, I don't believe 

was unlawful. I believe it was perfectly valid way 

for the officer to perform the entry; that is, to put 

the gun through the window in the garage area in 

order to prevent -- they believed that the homeowner 

had guns there and was going to use the -- run to the 

guns in order to repel the entry. And so, I believe 

it was a perfectly lawful entry. 

I think what Ramirez was saying was that 

not all fourth amendment violations bear fruit. And 

I agree with that. We do not have -- we do not 

propound here a theory of everything, having to do 

with all fourth amendment violations and the fruit 

that they propound. We simply say that, with a 

knock-and-announce violation that makes the entry 

unlawful, the evidence found inside the home, and 

only inside the home, is the fruit of that violation,

unless there truly is an inevitable-discovery or

independent of the entry, which can't be done here, 

when the police simply barge in and, in a matter of 

seconds, perhaps minutes, find the evidence. So, the 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Moran, is it 

undisputed by you that the client would not have 

disposed of the drugs if the police had waited a few 

seconds? 

MR. MORAN: Yes, we presume that he would 

have come to the door. He was just a few feet from 

the door, in fact. He was right in front of the 

door. We presume that he would have come to the 

door, answered the door, admitted the police, and the 

police would -- then would have performed the search. 

If the Court has no further questions, I'd 

like to reserve the balance of my time.

it please the Court: 

The metaphor of "fruit of the poisonous 

tree" is frequently employed when the exclusionary 

rule is discussed. And that metaphor is apt. It is 

apt, because the sanction of exclusion, which is not, 

itself, constitutionally required, is designed to 

deter, and to deter in a specific way: to deter by 

depriving the police of the result -- the fruit, the 

product, the evidentiary advantage that has been 

gained by their improper conduct. And so --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you agree there is 

a knock-and-announce requirement --

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- even though there is 

a warrant? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do you agree that 

that was violated here, that there wasn't really a 

knock-and-announce here? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there was a -- an

evidence in these circumstances a deterrent, so that 

the police would be less likely to do that? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: It may be. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: But I believe that, before 

the question of deterrence is reached, the question 

of causality must be addressed. This Court has 

always said that causation is a necessary, though not 

always sufficient, predicate, for a application of 

the exclusionary rule. The way this Court has put it 

is that it is clear that implementation of the 

exclusionary rule in particular cases begins with the 

premise that the challenged evidence is, in some 

sense, the product of the improper police activity. 

So, I believe --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't it --

MR. BAUGHMAN: -- the question --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the product, here? I 

mean, if they had not -- if they had not entered, 

they would not have gotten their evidence. Their 

entry, because it violated knock-and-announce, was 

unlawful. So, it is a product, isn't it? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I think -- I think where I 

would disagree, Your Honor, is that the entry is 

lawful -- in fact, it's not simply authorized, it's

commanded by judicial order. The use of force --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, an entry that 

conformed with knock-and-announce would have been 

lawful. This entry didn't. This entry was 

unreasonable. So, I don't see how your argument fits 

the facts. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: The way I distinguish it, 

and what I -- where I believe the distinction lies is 

that what was improper was not the fact of entry; 

what was improper was the use of force in entering. 

The --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but --

MR. BAUGHMAN: -- knock-and-announce --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I mean, how do you make 

that distinction? I mean, it's like the -- you know, 

the Cheshire cat and a -- and the smile; you can't 

distinguish the two. There was one entry, and that 

entry violated the knock-and-announce rule. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, again, the use of 

force in making the entry violated the knock-and-

announce rule. The entry itself was commanded by the 

order of the court. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is that 

different from saying the entry is lawful, its only 

problem is, it was done without a warrant? I mean,

there is no judicial command to enter, so the entry 

is completely unjustified. Here, we have not set the 

appropriate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you might have 

probable cause, but just not have the -- have the 

warrant. So, what is the difference between having 

probable cause to enter, but failing to get a 

warrant, and having a warrant, but failing to knock 

and announce? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Because the fourth amendment 

commands that the police not enter without judicial 

authorization. The police don't get to make the 

probable cause decision in advance. And we wish to 

have a judge make that decision, so we won't, in 

hindsight, say, "Had you gone to the judge, the judge 

would have found probable cause, so we'll ratify what

just the manner of entry -- the entry is invalid, 

unless the judge authorizes it, or unless some 

exception exists. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it your view the entry 

was lawful or unlawful, in this case?

lawful. The manner of entry would be unlawful. And 

the consequence of that entry would turn on what 

force was used. As, in this case, they opened the 

door and walked in. There was no -- there was no 

injury to person, there was no injury to property. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, basically, your 

argument rests on the fact that we can draw a 

distinction between entry and manner of entry. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. My principle that I am 

advocating is that any police error in the execution 

of a search, or in the accomplishment of a search, 

bears fruit only in relation to the purpose, or 

purposes, served by the principle violated. One --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a --

MR. BAUGHMAN: -- has to ask --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a -- it's a 

strong argument, on the other side, that if we adopt 

your position, the officers would have no incentive, 

other than their own judgment about their personal 

safety, whether to comply with the knock-and-announce 

rule. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: That is if one assumes that 

the civil remedy -- that the 1983 actions has no 

teeth and has no force, and I don't believe that's 

true at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the experience 

in Michigan? The Michigan Supreme Court has had this 

rule for some time, that you don't exclude the 

evidence. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many successful 1983 

actions have there been --

MR. BAUGHMAN: I am not -- I am not aware 

of any. On the other hand, like Mr. Moran, I --

other than anecdotal evidence, I have no statistical 

evidence that the police are violating the knock-and-

announce principle since the decision in Stevens. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have not even 

one case that you can cite where a 1983 remedy was 

resorted to and was successful. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: In Michigan, I don't. There 

are cases cited in our brief where, in fact, there 

are actions -- such actions brought. There are 

several recent decisions in the Seventh Circuit, for 

example, where qualified immunity was denied on a 

knock-and-announce violation in the cases in the 

district court for trial or settlement. And there 

may be many cases that don't make the reports, what 

actions are brought and settled. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not aware of

any case --

MR. BAUGHMAN: I am not aware of any case -

-

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- where anyone has 

recovered --

MR. BAUGHMAN: And, again, I think Mr. 

Moran correctly points out, in -- many of these cases 

are resolved by finding that the Richards v. 

Wisconsin exceptions have been met. It is not, to 

me, remarkable that there are not a lot of civil 

actions. I believe there are not a lot of 

violations, because, while no-knock entries may 

occur, they are justified, under Richards v. 

Wisconsin, in most cases. This case is an 

aberration. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the no-knock warrant, 

do you agree that it's not possible to get one in 

Michigan? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there is no statute in 

Michigan where one can go to the judge in advance and 

say, "Here are the facts, known to me already, before 

I even get to the scene, that should justify a no-

knock." That doesn't exist in Michigan. Michigan 

follows Richards v. Wisconsin, and, in -- had case 

law, even in advance of that, which simply said,

"Whether known in advance, or whether the facts 

occurred at the time of the execution of the warrant, 

if the Richards exceptions are met, you can go in 

without knocking and announcing." So, we do follow 

that rule. You just simply can't get advance 

judicial authorization. It doesn't exist. But it is 

certainly permissible, and it -- as Mr. Moran 

indicated, it happens on a fairly regular basis, 

because, unlike Mr. Moran, I believe the notion that 

-- even in this case, I'm not saying there was no 

violation; there was a violation, because the police 

didn't know in advance that the defendant was sitting 

in a chair with the cocaine in his pocket, on the 

chair in front of him, and a gun by his side. I 

think that he would have answered the door. It's 

highly speculative, and somewhat fanciful, in that 

circumstance. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they get to make 

-- do they get to make "inevitable" arguments on 

their side? I mean, let's say, as what happened 

here, or as seemingly happened, the fellow is found 

near the chair with the drugs. Can't they argue, 

"Well, if you had knocked and you had waited 10 

seconds, he would have gotten up from the chair and 

gone somewhere else"? And you wouldn't have been

able to argue, at trial, "He was sitting in the chair

MR. BAUGHMAN: That's true, but the drugs 

were -- in this case, the drugs were in his pocket. 

So, it wouldn't have helped him. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was something 

in the chair, right? I mean, the --

MR. BAUGHMAN: There was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the gun, or what 

MR. BAUGHMAN: The gun was in the -- in the 

chair, but he was only convicted for the drugs in his 

pocket. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Hmm. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I don't think he -- he could 

say, "If you would have -- I would have gotten up and 

answered the door; and, therefore, you wouldn't have 

had to come in without knocking, you wouldn't have 

had to break the door, you wouldn't have had to scare 

me." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't have 

been able to tell the jury, "I was standing next to 

the chair, because if I had -- I obviously would have 

gotten away from the chair, because I knew that's 

where the gun was."

 MR. BAUGHMAN: That's -- that may well be. 

And I want to be clear, I am not here arguing that 

this Court should decide that there is no 

circumstance possible where something that occurs in 

the premises is not causally connected to the failure 

to knock and announce. All I'm asking the Court to 

decide is that causation is required before the 

exclusionary rule is implemented, and physical 

evidence found within a proper search of -- search of 

proper scope, pursuant to the warrant, that that is 

not causally connected to the -- to the knock-and-

announce violation. There may be other --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you -- so, you think 

it's possible that the defendant could argue that the 

evidence should be excluded because, "Had he knocked 

and announced, I would have run to the toilet and 

flushed it down, rather than" --

MR. BAUGHMAN: No. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "answering the" --

MR. BAUGHMAN: No, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I think the only thing he 

could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's causal.

the causal connection to the purposes -- as I have 

tried to indicated -- to the purpose, or purposes, 

served by the principle violated. What is the 

purpose of knocking and announcing? And I think --

Your Honor indicated -- it's to protect against 

injury to the police, injury of people inside, and 

property. It has no purpose to protect against the 

invasion of the privacy of the dwelling and the 

discovery of the evidence. In fact, if the police 

knew in advance that the defendant might flush the 

drugs down the toilet, they wouldn't have to knock 

and announce at all. So, I think we have to relate 

the causal question to, What is the principle 

violated? What purposes does it serve? And, in the 

case of knock-and-announce, it does not serve the 

purpose of allowing evidence to be destroyed. That, 

in fact, serves as an exception to knocking and 

announcing at all. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say the 

purpose of knock-and-announce is? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: This Court has identified it 

on several occasions as to avoid unnecessary violence 

to the property, avoid unnecessary possible injury to 

people, both to the officers who are executing the 

warrant and people inside, and to allow the person

inside to prepare to answer -- as Mr. Moran 

indicated, if they might be in a state of undress or 

something, they could avoid that embarrassment. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, I take it your 

argument is that, except in cases in which the people 

inside the house are not dressed, or cases in which 

there is, in fact, a gun battle of some sort, that a 

knock-and-announce violation will, in fact, never be 

the cause of any damage at all. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: It will never be the cause 

of the discovery of the physical evidence found --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, it -- no, but 

it'll never be the cause of any compensable damage at 

all. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, if a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Because I take it your 

argument is: what you can recover from requires 

causation. And what I mean by "causation" is the 

causation of the harms which the rule is intended to 

avoid. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the only harms that 

the rule is intended to avoid is the exposure of 

nakedness and violence, once inside, and there are 

cases without nakedness or without violence, then, in

those cases, there will never be a recovery. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Oh, in those cases, correct. 

In cases where there is violence, there will be 

recovery. In a case such as the instant one, where 

there is no nakedness, there is no violence, they 

simply opened an unlocked door, I would say, yes, 

there would be no recovery, in that circumstance; 

there would be no damages. There may be cases -- and 

this is why not -- I'm not arguing there was no 

knock-and-announce violation, in that the police 

shouldn't knock and announce, because, in different 

cases, the consequences may be dramatic, they may be 

severe, and damages may be severely assessed. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But, basically, your rule 

is, the police are entitled to take the chance. If 

they -- if they get inside, and people have got their 

clothes on and there's no gun battle, no problem; 

nothing that the police are exposed to, either by an 

exclusionary rule or by a civil recovery. And if 

they want to take that chance, if they want to take 

the chance that somebody will not be dressed or a gun 

will be pulled, basically that's their option. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I think, as in other 

situations where this Court does not apply the 

exclusionary rule, simply on a deterrence basis --

because the Court does not always apply the 

exclusionary rule, even when there would be 

deterrence -- that that is correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 

true. I mean, there are going to be situations, or 

at least possible, where evidence is going to be a --

causally connected to a violation of the knock-and-

announce rule, right? The situation -- the warrant 

is because these people were involved in a shootout 

with the -- you know, the Johnson gang; they knock 

the door down and somebody yells, "Look out, it's the 

Johnson gang." 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they had 

knocked and announced, and "It's the police," they 

wouldn't have that statement that's incriminating. 

Now, you would agree that that statement would be 

excluded because of the violation, right? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, exactly. That was 

precisely the point I was going to make, in terms of 

a hypothetical. We're not arguing -- as I tried to 

indicate earlier, we're not arguing that you need to 

resolve every question today about what is, or is 

not, causally related. And there are circumstances 

where a spontaneous declaration -- you know, the

police break through the door, and the defendant 

says, "The drugs are in the closet," and you want to 

use that declaration to tie him to the drugs -- that 

may well be causally connected. All we're asking 

today is for this Court to decide that the items --

the physical evidence found within a proper scope, a 

search of proper scope of the warrant that's being 

executed -- is not causally connected. Other 

questions of spontaneous declarations, tying the 

defendant by position to the chair, those may present 

different issues. But the drugs that were named in 

the search warrant as items to be searched for and 

seized are not causally connected; they are the fruit 

of the execution of the judicial command, not of the 

knock-and-announce violation. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I can understand the 

requirement there be causal connection. Are there 

cases in which courts have held that there was a 

knock-and-announce violation, and there is a general 

remedy of exclusion, unless -- except when there's a 

causal connection; but, in fact, the evidence was 

admitted because it was not causally connected to the 

entry? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I'm not aware of any.

the hypothetical, but it seems to me it's really a 

hypothetical. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yeah. And I think the 

reason that that exists is because, up til today --

and Mr. Moran's correct, most courts go the other way 

-- up until the Stevens case, the assumption had been 

-- and I think the assumption has come from Miller 

and Sabbath -- the assumption has been, if there's a 

knock-and-announce violation, you exclude the 

evidence. So, questions of causation have not been 

explored until the Stevens case, and then the Seventh 

Circuit, in several opinions, has also reached the 

same conclusion. But I think Sabbath and Miller 

present very different circumstances. Sabbath and 

Miller, as the Court will recall, were arrest cases. 

And the arrest situation does not translate into the 

execution of a search warrant, because knock-and-

announce serves a different purpose, an additional 

purpose, in the arrest situation, that is not served 

when -- in the search situation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see your argument 

now. I think your argument is, most of the fourth 

amendment rules are really designed to prevent 

warrantless entries. But this one isn't. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This one is designed to 

prevent damage to property --

MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- et cetera. So, let's 

not have the exclusionary rule and rely on the damage 

remedy where that kind of thing actually occurs, 

which isn't often. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And if we buy that 

principle, suppose we were to apply it in the Miranda 

area -- purpose of a Miranda warning is really to 

make certain he can have a lawyer, if he wants one, 

for example. So, now we prove this guy wouldn't have 

asked for a lawyer anyway. All the evidence comes 

in. 

I mean, it's an interesting principle. I 

see the logic. But it seems to me to have a lot of 

implications that this Court has never bought. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I think it's much more 

speculative in the -- in the fifth-amendment area, 

but I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I can't think of any other 

area, fifth or fourth, where we've bought it. And 

I've tried to explain, in the question, why we 

haven't bought it. Now, you go ahead.

 MR. BAUGHMAN: But I think to not accept 

causation as a requirement, which I think this Court 

has always done -- as I said at the outset, this 

Court has said that implementation of the 

exclusionary rule is premised on the evidence being 

the product of the police misconduct. To not do 

that, to not have a causation requirement, I believe, 

severs this Court's current exclusionary-rule 

doctrines from its moorings. There are many 

circumstances that this Court has, at this point, at 

least, seen fit to rest with the lower courts, such 

as the execution of a search warrant. You search 

within proper scope, you're looking for computer 

monitors, you find them, but, as you're executing, 

you open a desk drawer and you shut it, you exceed 

the scope of the warrant. The law is pretty uniform, 

currently, that you don't suppress the computer 

monitors because you exceeded the scope by opening 

the drawer. If you found drugs in the drawer, you 

make -- you'd exclude those. But you don't exclude 

the monitors, because there's not a causal connection 

between the wrong in exceeding the scope of the 

warrant and the discovery of the monitors. 

All those cases are up for grabs again if 

this Court severs the causation requirement from the

application of the exclusionary rule. And that's 

just one example; there are others. This Court has 

always required that there be a causal connection, 

and I believe that it should simply continue to do 

so. 

We're not asking this Court to overrule any 

cases, to create any really new principles, we're 

simply asking this Court to understand that Sabbath 

and Miller were knock-and-announce for arrest. With 

an arrest situation, if a person surrenders at the 

door, you don't go in and search the premises 

thoroughly. There's a different purpose served in 

arrest. With a search warrant, knock-and-announce 

has no purpose of protecting the privacy of the 

dwelling itself with the discovery of the items named 

in the warrant, and they shouldn't be suppressed. 

Things that are causally connected can be left to an 

argument that may be made by counsel in different 

situations, but, as to the items named in the warrant 

-- contraband, fruit, spirits, instrumentalities --

that should not be suppressed. It is simply not 

causally connected to the entry, and we would ask 

this Court to so hold. 

Thank you.

 Mr. Salmons. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT 

MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The knock-and-announce rule, unlike the 

warrant and probable cause requirements, does not 

protect the individual's privacy interest in the 

items to be searched, and does not relate to the 

officer's authority to conduct the search and obtain 

the evidence. An unannounced or premature entry, 

therefore, does not detract from the officer's legal 

authority reflected in the warrant to enter and 

conduct a search. Instead, as this Court held in 

Segura, an untainted warrant provides an independent 

source for the search, even where the entry is 

illegal. There was only one entry in the Segura 

case, since the officers remained in the apartment 

until a warrant was finally obtained. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It depends, of course, on 

whether you -- what you're doing. Now I see what 

you're doing. You're applying a kind of Palsgraf 

causation analysis within the risk -- I think that's 

what you're doing -- to saying it's outside, it's not

necessary condition of his being there. It is. You 

do say, "Well, the being-in-the-room-there is not 

within the risk, the reason for which we have a 

knock-and-announce rule." But, of course, that's a 

matter of judgment. I mean, you could say the 

purpose of the cause -- of the knock-and-announce 

rule is to keep people out of there without knocking 

and announcing. And if that's the purpose of it, 

it's right within the risk, right cause. 

MR. SALMONS: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: You just are looking at 

the harms that his being there in that room without 

announcing might bring about. That doesn't mean 

that's why we don't have the rule. We have the rule 

to keep him out of there without announcing. 

MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, there are --

there are several reasons why the Court has -- the 

Court has articulated several reasons for why there 

is the knock-and-announce rule. We think the 

important point, though, with regard to Segura 

case is that the entry, in Segura, was unlawful both 

because the officers did not announce and because 

they did not have a warrant. They, nonetheless, 

stayed there for 20 hours, and, when they finally did

obtain a warrant, they conducted the search. And 

this Court had no difficulty in saying that, even 

though the initial entry was unlawful, the warrant-

authorized search -- the warrant was an independent 

source for the search, and that the legality with 

regard to the initial entry was, quote, "wholly 

irrelevant to the evidence that was obtained pursuant 

to the warrant." And we would submit that it would 

be an odd fourth amendment rule that would allow 

admission of the evidence where the officers failed 

to obtain a warrant. They entered without a warrant 

and without announcement, and only later obtained 

one, as in Segura; and then suppress all evidence, in 

this case, where the officers did obtain a warrant in 

advance, and their only illegality was the much more 

minor one of entering a few moments prematurely. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What was the --

MR. SALMONS: Nothing in this Court's cases 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry, I didn't mean 

to interrupt. 

MR. SALMONS: No, that's fine, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, What 

was -- what were the grounds upon which the warrant, 

in Segura, was obtained?

 MR. SALMONS: The warrant, in Segura, was

existence prior to the unlawful entry, so that it was 

an untainted warrant. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, it didn't -- it didn't 

depend on the entry or anything gained as a result of 

the entry, right? 

MR. SALMONS: Well, of course, the officers 

-- once that warrant was obtained, officers would 

have to enter the apartment in order to conduct a 

search --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the --

MR. SALMONS: -- here, except for the fact 

that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but the --

MR. SALMONS: -- they had already entered 

illegally and were already present illegally --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the warrant --

MR. SALMONS: -- in the apartment. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the warrant -- the 

warrant itself didn't depend on anything they had 

gained as a result of the entry. There was no --

MR. SALMONS: That's correct --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, you do --

MR. SALMONS: -- a requirement for --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the difference, 

though, with this case? Because, here, there is a 

causal continuum, at least, as Justice Breyer said, a 

but-for causal continuum. They wouldn't have been in 

the apartment but for the entry. And so, the 

authority of the warrant and the manner of executing 

the warrant are not divisible the way they were in 

Segura. 

MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, with respect, I 

think that's -- it would be an improper reading of 

Segura. There was an illegal entry, in Segura, that 

was just as necessary in order to conduct the search 

and obtain evidence in that case as there was at 

premature entry here. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But, in Segura, the court 

issuing the subsequent warrant says, "You can -- you 

can go in there and do this." The court -- by the 

way, I -- maybe this makes it even easier -- did the 

court, in Segura, know that they were in the

MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. SALMONS: Their -- they had no 

knowledge of the illegality, and the evidence that 

was -- that was the basis for the affidavit for the 

warrant was untainted by the illegal entry. But, of 

course, the same is true here, there was -- there is 

no allegation at all that --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no --

MR. SALMONS: -- the warrant in this case -

-

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the difference is --

MR. SALMONS: -- is tainted. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, look, this --

you know, I'd appreciate your explaining this -- this 

seems to me what you're saying in your brief was the 

inevitable discovery. The inevitable-discovery rule, 

in my -- the way -- the way I've thought of it, and 

I'd like you to correct me if I haven't thought of it 

correctly -- to use a kind of analogy, it's like a 

primitive tribe that beats a tom-tom every morning so 

the sun comes up. Hey, the sun's going to come up 

anyway, and the bodies are going to be discovered 

anyway, in those cases. And, in Segura, the warrant

is going to be issued anyway. So, it isn't a 

question of whether it would have been issued if they 

had behaved properly, it's a question of what will 

really happen in the absence of the illegality. 

MR. SALMONS: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's what I thought 

inevitable discovery here was, and, in the absence of 

these people entering the apartment illegally, they 

wouldn't have found a thing, because --

MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- there was nothing else 

in motion. 

MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, with respect, 

that is -- that is directly at odds with the way the 

Court, in Segura, approached --

MR. SALMONS: In fact, that is precisely 

the analysis --

JUSTICE BREYER: The sun rose, anyway. 

MR. SALMONS: -- that's precisely the 

analysis the Court ordered -- took in Segura. It 

said, if there had been no illegal entry, the 

officers --

evidence --

JUSTICE BREYER: Exact --

MR. SALMONS: -- the same way --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. Well --

MR. SALMONS: Well, Your -- I'm just 

informing Your Honor what the Segura case says. It 

says the court -- the courts would have found --

excuse me -- the officers would have found the same 

evidence that they found pursuant to the warrant if 

they had complied with the fourth amendment. That's

because the court viewed the -- that warrant as a 

separate independent source for the authority to 

enter and conduct a search. One would have to posit, 

I guess, that the officers in this case, if they --

if they would rather not execute the warrant than 

delay a few additional moments before entering, but I 

think that would not be a very realistic hypothesis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then your --

MR. SALMONS: Now, with regard --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- position is that you 

never -- if you have a warrant, then you can seize 

what the warrant lists. So, if you have a warrant, 

then there is never a reason that the police would 

have to knock and announce, because the warrant gives 

them independent authority to enter. That seems to 

be what you're saying, that as long as you have a 

warrant, there -- the knock-and-announce does not 

have to be complied with. 

MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The knock-

and-announce requirement is -- we take no issue with 

that. That is required by the fourth amendment. 

With regard --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --

MR. SALMONS: -- to deterrence --

MR. SALMONS: That's not --

if the rule you propose is adopted, then every police 

officer in America can follow the same policy. Is 

there no policy of protecting the homeowner a little

MR. SALMONS: -- our position. And we, 

respectfully, would argue that that's not an 

appropriate way to conduct the deterrence analysis. 

Even just on the terms of deterrence, we think that 

suppression here would be a disproportionate remedy.

 And that's because, as this Court has repeatedly 

recognized, the officers already have an incentive, 

inherent in the nature of the circumstances, to 

announce and delay some period of time before entry. 

Now, there may be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But what --

MR. SALMONS: -- not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Wait a minute. What is 

this incentive inherent in the circumstances? 

MR. SALMONS: It's not to be mistaken for 

an intruder and shot at, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't seem to 

work. 

MR. SALMONS: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, you've got -- this 

is a case in which the officer testifies, "It never 

works, I always go in." 

MR. SALMONS: That's not really -- I mean, 

to be fair, Your Honor, that's not what he testified 

to, exactly. What he said was, he's been shot at 

several times, and he went in early, in this case, in 

part because of his safety concerns. But he didn't 

speak to any broader policy. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: When is it going --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, what reason do we 

have to believe that this incentive inherent in 

circumstances is ever going to work in the absence of 

an exclusionary rule? 

MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, I think --

I think there are several reasons. One -- and, 

again, this Court -- these are -- all of the things 

I'm going to list come from this Court's cases, 

including Nix and Murray and Segura, where the Court 

has applied the doctrines we ask the Court to apply 

here. And what you have is, you have the inherent 

incentive to knock and announce, because of their own 

safety concerns. We think the only thing that might 

not cover, in terms of deterrence, would be the 

additional few moments you may want them to wait. 

They will announce, and they will delay some period 

of time. 

Now, in the absence of concerns about 

safety or destruction of evidence, the officers have 

nothing to gain by entering prematurely. And so, in 

doing a deterrence analysis, I think it's important 

to keep that in mind. It's not like there's a huge 

gain for the officers --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't they --

MR. SALMONS: -- when they don't have

legitimate concerns. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't they have 

something to gain? If they're right that there is 

evidence inside, they gain. They're -- I mean, 

they're perfectly rational --

MR. SALMONS: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in this. They gain a 

greater chance of getting that evidence than if they 

let a few seconds elapse and the evidence can be 

flushed away. 

MR. SALMONS: To be sure, Your Honor, there 

are times when they may miscalculate the nature of 

the concerns about safety and destruction of 

evidence, but, in cases where there aren't those 

concerns, they have nothing to gain. And, in 

addition, entering prematurely may make them a 

defendant in 1983 or Bivens actions, which I'm sure 

that no officer --

JUSTICE SOUTER: For --

MR. SALMONS: -- relishes and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: For which there is no 

record of any recovery in any court in the United 

States, isn't that correct? 

MR. SALMONS: May I answer, Your Honor?

 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would -- I

Court, in particular, to a recent case out of the 

Seventh Circuit, Jones versus Wilhelm. The seventh 

circuit has announced the position -- it decided the 

position that we advocate. There are many cases, 

Your Honor -- the courts -- the courts are replete 

with them -- where people --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank --

MR. SALMONS: -- bring those types of 

claims, and win, and then they settle.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. MORAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

First of all, as to the evidence that is 

causally connected to the knock-and-announce 

violation, there are two reasons why the remote 

possibility of such evidence will never deter police 

officers from violating the knock-and-announce 

requirement. The first is that it's very remote. 

I'm not aware of a single case in American history

where there has been identified such evidence that is 

directly causally related only to the knock-and-

announce violation. But the second reason, more 

fundamental, is that even if there were such 

evidence, by definition the possibility of finding 

such evidence will not deter the police from 

committing a knock-and-announce violation, because 

they wouldn't have found that evidence had they 

complied with the knock-and-announce requirement. In 

other words, the police would only gain that evidence 

by committing the knock-and-announce violation, so 

there would be nothing lost in going ahead and 

risking an excited utterance that they wouldn't be 

able to use, because, by definition, they wouldn't be 

getting that excited utterance, anyway. 

I think it's important, with the Solicitor 

General's brief, to rebut the claim that Miller and 

Sabbath had something to do with the fact that there 

was no warrant in those cases. Nothing in Miller and 

Sabbath turned on the absence of a warrant. And, in 

fact, in Miller the Court specifically said, "The 

requirements stated in Semayne's case still obtains. 

It applies, as the Government here concedes, whether 

the arrest is to be made by virtue of a warrant or 

when officers are authorized to make an arrest for a

felony without a warrant." The Government conceded, 

in Miller, that whether there was a warrant or not 

had nothing to do with the knock-and-announce 

violation in that case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the Government's 

distinction was based on the fact that they were 

arrest cases. I thought that's the distinction they 

were making. 

MR. MORAN: Perhaps I misread their brief, 

Justice Scalia, but I thought it was that there was 

an absence of a warrant. Of course, this is an 

arrest case, as well. The -- Mr. Hudson was seized, 

and was searched, incident to arrest. And so, this 

was also an arrest case, much like Miller and 

Sabbath. 

As for the causal-connection argument, if 

this Court were to accept it, I listed, in my 

principal brief, a litany of cases that I think would 

have to be overruled -- Katz, Knowles, Silverthorne 

Lumber -- for that matter, Kyllo. All those cases 

say that it doesn't matter that the Government has a 

clear, lawful route to get the evidence; the fact 

that they didn't follow that clear, lawful route 

prevents the Government from using that evidence. 

And it's impossible to explain how Mr. Baughman's

causation theory is consonant with all of those 

cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

MR. MORAN: I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the --

isn't the reason it's consonant is because, in those 

cases, there is a -- the connection, in terms of the 

purposes of the rule that was violated and the 

evidence that was seized? 

MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think the 

same thing applies here. I think that the knock-and-

announce rule is about the sanctity of the home. And 

this Court could not have said it any more clearly in 

Wilson, that the reasonableness of a search or 

seizure inside a home is connected to the method of 

entry. In fact, the Court said it three times, in 

Wilson, in various ways. And so, I think it is the 

purpose of the knock-and-announce rule, is to protect 

the homeowner's right of privacy against shock, 

fright, and embarrassment that can come with a 

precipitous police entry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not the general 

privacy of the home, because you don't dispute that 

if he had waited an additional 4 seconds, he could 

have entered the home and executed the warrant.

 MR. MORAN: No, we don't dispute that at 

all, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Finally, I have to ask why this Court has 

decided all these knock-and-announce cases in the 

last 10 years, if my opponents are right. This Court 

shouldn't have -- they're all criminal cases, and 

this Court should have simply said the Petitioners or 

Respondents, as the case may be, cannot obtain the 

relief they are seeking, because the knock-and-

announce rule is not causally related to the evidence 

that they're trying to suppress. And so, if this 

Court were to adopt my opponent's position, the 

knock-and-announce rule will become a dead letter. 

There will be virtually no cases, there will be 

virtually no more development of this rule. This 

Court would have been wrong in Miller, it would have 

been wrong in Sabbath, and it was wrong to reach the 

substantive constitutional questions it reached in 

Banks, Richards, Ramirez, and Wilson. And all the 

other courts, the -- virtually every State currently 

suppressing evidence seized after a knock-and-

announce -- well, they would have to be wrong, too. 

And so, a lot of courts, including this Court, have 

been wrong a lot of times, if my opponent is correct. 

Finally, one last word on Segura. Segura

is the sort of case where one can make a respectable 

inevitable-discovery -- in fact, a winning 

inevitable-discovery or independent-source argument. 

But the key thing in Segura is, this Court did not 

disturb the fact that the evidence that was seized 

during the initial entry was suppressed, because that 

was directly connected to the unlawful entry. And 

so, the evidence that the police initially seized, 

before the 19-hour wait in Segura, was suppressed. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

[Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
