[10:03 a.m.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 

in Brown vs. Sanders. 

Ms. Kirkland, proceed, please. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE N. KIRKLAND 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MS. KIRKLAND: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Whether a capital sentencing statute is 

categorized as "weighing" or "non-weighing" determines how 

courts assess the impact of an invalid death eligibility 

factor on a jury's sentence selection. To decide whether 

a statute is "weighing" or "non-weighing," we look to the 

function, if any, of an eligibility factor in the 

statute's sentence-selection process. 

In a "weighing" scheme, as this Court first 

stated in Zant, a jury is specifically instructed to weigh 

the statutory eligibility factors, along with any 

mitigation, to choose the sentence. In a "non-weighing" 

scheme, the eligibility factors have no role above the 

role of "all other sentencing evidence." 

California is a "non-weighing" State, for two 

primary reasons. First, the only reference whatsoever to 

"eligibility factors" in California's statutory list of 11

open-ended sentencing factors is in its sentencing factor 

(a), but that reference has no significance, because, 

under the language of the statute and the holdings of the 

California Supreme Court, factor (a) means the jury is to 

consider, if it's relevant, the facts and circumstances of 

the offenses, including the facts and circumstances that 

underlie the eligibility factors. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the difficulty with that 

argument that that, at least, is not the way the jury was 

instructed in this case? As I understand it, the -- and I 

don't have it in front of me, but I looked when I was 

going through the briefs -- the jury was instructed to 

consider the special circumstance, or -stances, as such. 

They were not instructed that, "You will simply consider 

the facts that underlay whatever conclusion you drew at 

the -- at the earliest stage about special circumstances." 

They are instructed to consider special circumstances. 

MS. KIRKLAND: They're instructed in the 

language of the statute. And in that sentencing factor 

(a), there is a reference to those special circumstances. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: As such. I mean --

MS. KIRKLAND: So that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- it calls them special 

circumstances, right? 

MS. KIRKLAND: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MS. KIRKLAND: But it's not reasonably likely 

that the jury would have understood that to mean that they 

should accord any special weight to the title of special 

circumstances, apart from the overall umbrella of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- special circumstances that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- well, that may be an 

argument for the way we have looked at special 

circumstances, is as something -- as factors that do carry 

a special weight, but I don't see any reason to 

differentiate the instruction to consider special 

circumstances here from the instructions in law to 

consider eligibility factors in other States, which we 

have called "weighing" States. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, in "weighing" States, the 

eligibility factors form the primary aggravation for the 

jury to consider at sentencing. In California, the 

reference to the eligibility factors is that one subpart 

of one of otherwise completely distinguished from 

eligibility factors --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- sentencing factors --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I know what you're saying, 

because, in California, you've got a long list of other

things, and you're entirely right. But, as I understand 

it, in the States that we have classified as "weighing" 

States, the juries were not -- were not strictly limited, 

on the aggravating side, to consider only the special 

circumstances or the aggravating factors, as they have 

been previously defined; they could consider other things. 

And that's the case here. So, I don't see how we can 

draw a categorical distinction between California's 

situation and that of States we've called "weighing" 

States. 

MS. KIRKLAND: There's two differences between 

that. In any of those "weighing" States -- well, in 

Mississippi and Florida, for example -- the eligibility or 

aggravating factors are -- are the sole aggravation at 

sentencing, and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought in --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- that's really --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I thought in Mississippi 

they could take into consideration other facts. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, they couldn't at the time 

of Clemons and Stringer. Apparently, in the interim, in 

the 1990s, as is discussed in our brief, they --

Mississippi changed the interpretation of its statute, so 

it now has, sort of, an overarching circumstances-of-the-

crime aggravation consideration in its sentencing. But

that was not the time as of Clemons. And, in the footnote 

in Clemons, which -- this Court referred to the statute of 

Mississippi -- it was clear that, at least at the time of 

Clemons, the eligibility factors were the sole 

aggravation. But the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you would say Clemons 

should come out the other way, given the current state of 

the Mississippi statute? 

MS. KIRKLAND: It depends how else the 

aggravating factors are; what kind of a role the 

aggravating factors play now under Mississippi 

statute. If the role is de minimus, then it's probably not 

a "weighing" State. But the "weighing" States -- in the 

"weighing" States, the eligibility factors are the 

lynchpin of the sentencing decision. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose the reason 

behind this distinction -- and it's, in a sense, 

artificial, because we made it up -- I suppose the reason 

is that, in the "weighing" State, the concern is that if 

there is an ineligible -- or an invalid factor in the 

eligibility determination, it carries over with a degree 

of force and weight -- it's almost -- it's a presumption 

that the jury is liable to treat it -- or, at least the 

jury is liable to treat it as such. And I see that same 

aspect to this case, when the instructions refer -- as you

indicated in your colloquy with Justice Souter -- that the 

instructions specifically say "any special -- any special 

circumstance which has been found." 

MS. KIRKLAND: It's -- that is a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Am I right that the special --

MS. KIRKLAND: That's what it says. It's a --

it's a phrase, just as it's in the California statute, 

that directs the jury, as a sentencing factor, to consider 

the facts and circumstances of the crime along with any 

special circumstances found to be true. And this Court's 

made it clear, in Stringer and in other cases, that how 

the State court sees its statutory language ought to be 

dispositive. And California has repeatedly held -- and we 

submit it's not reasonably likely a jury would interpret 

it any other way -- that that means that the jury is to 

consider the facts and circumstances of the case, all of 

those facts and circumstances, including those that 

underlie the special circumstances. That --

JUSTICE BREYER: See, I'm not -- this is a 

fairly complex area. 

MS. KIRKLAND: I'd agree. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And, as I understand, at this 

moment -- and I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- in 

a "weighing" State, we look at the aggravating side, and 

there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could

take into account and weigh them against all the 

mitigation. I'm imagining that. And you might have 

thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason 

that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have 

weighed something against all that mitigating evidence 

that it shouldn't have. And what's something? There 

would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it --

evidence into account it shouldn't have. So, I might have 

thought that was so. 

But when I read the cases, that isn't so, 

because I think it's -- in Clemons the evidence would have 

come in anyway. So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong 

with this problem in the "weighing" State? And the 

answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the 

State said, "Jury, you look to these three things," with a 

tone of voice that really made them important. And the 

jury then weighed one and two and three. It didn't have 

anything to do with the evidence. 

Well, if that's the problem, California seems to 

have that problem, because one of the things it says to 

weigh is, "Weigh circumstances of the crime." And that 

means that's not everything. That's not the history of 

this defendant. 

And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and 

in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error

seems to be there in California's case, too. 

Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my 

little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out. 

[Laughter.] 

MS. KIRKLAND: In California -- well, first of 

all, if this is new jurisprudence to you, or unfamiliar, 

the critical difference is that most States, and most of 

this Court's jurisprudence, uses the term "aggravating 

factor" and "eligibility factor" interchangeably, because 

in most States, and particularly in the "weighing" States, 

"aggravating factor" is the eligibility factor that makes 

the defendant eligible for death, but it's also the sole, 

or primary, factor that the jury is to take into 

consideration on the side militating in favor of death. 

In California, we have "eligibility factors," 

which are the special circumstances, and those happen at 

the guilt phase of the trial. And then we have 

"sentencing factors," 11 factors that are totally 

different from the special circumstances or --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not totally 

different, because one of them is special circumstances. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, one part of one of them. 

In factor (a), there is one reference to special 

circumstances, and that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it distinguishes those

from circumstances of the crime, and then it -- then it 

says, "and special circumstances." So, it seems to me 

that "special circumstances" is a discrete factor, 

different from "circumstances of the crime." 

MS. KIRKLAND: The way that California has 

interpreted that -- in fact, there is a case that's cited 

in these briefs, People versus Cain, and Morris -- which 

is on our merits brief, in page 27, and in our reply 

brief, on page 6 -- where a defendant in California argued 

that that reference to "special circumstances" ought to be 

excised from the direction to the jury of what they're to 

consider at sentencing. And in rejecting the idea that 

that should be excised, the California Supreme Court said, 

"An instruction not to consider the special circumstances 

would defeat the manifest purpose of factor (a) to inform 

jurors that they should consider, as one factor, the 

totality of the circumstances involved in the criminal 

episode that's on trial." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is, indeed, very 

complicated, Ms. Kirkland. And, I forget, which provision 

of the Constitution is it that contains this complexity? 

[Laughter.] 

MS. KIRKLAND: All of this jurisprudence is 

based on the eighth amendment requirement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That says?

 MS. KIRKLAND: -- that says that, "A valid

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what the eighth 

amendment says? 

MS. KIRKLAND: That's the way the eighth 

amendment has been interpreted in its application of cruel 

and unusual --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Cruel and unusual punishments 

are forbidden. And this is where that comes from? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And may I ask you a question 

about the California statute, if I may, please? In 

subsection (a) of 190.3, it says that the trier of fact 

"shall" take into account any of the following factors, if 

relevant. And one of those is the existence of any 

special circumstance found to be true, pursuant to 190.1. 

And under 190.1, one of the special circumstances is 

number 14, "heinous, atrocious, or cruel." Does that mean 

the statute required in the weighing process -- that the 

jury take into account that factor? And is it not true 

that factor was held invalid? 

MS. KIRKLAND: That factor was held invalid, but 

what --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, they were -- they were 

directed to take into -- they "shall" take into account an

invalid factor. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, yes. "Shall" -- as 

interpreted in California versus Brown by this Court and 

in the California Supreme Court jurisprudence, "shall" is 

a directive, it's not -- it's not -- California does not 

have a mandatory statute. In fact, none of these factors 

are labeled as either aggravating or mitigating. It's 

possible --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the -- number 14 

clearly is not mitigating. 

MS. KIRKLAND: No. But whether or not a crime 

is heinous, atrocious, and cruel is part of -- apart from 

its labeling as a special circumstance, that's certainly a 

valid consideration for the jury to be thinking about when 

it's engaged in its normative process of choosing 

sentencing. The only thing that's different under the 

California statute -- when "heinous, atrocious, and 

cruel," as a special circumstance, is out of the mix -- is 

whether it can be labeled "heinous, atrocious, and cruel," 

and whether that label has any independent weight. But 

all of the evidence and the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: All of the evidence --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- description of the crime --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you agree, though, that, 

if you had a separate sentencing jury, one that did not

have all the evidence, and that jury was instructed that 

at the guilt phase a determination has been -- that has --

it has been found that the crime was especially heinous, 

atrocious, and so forth, that that finding might tip the 

scales in favor of imposing the death penalty? 

MS. KIRKLAND: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

since that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the underlying facts 

are already before the jury, and they can make their own 

judgment about them. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Right. And that instruction 

specifically directs the jury to all the facts and 

circumstances of the crime; and so, not only the 

characteristics of all those facts, but it would even be 

appropriate for the prosecutor to refer to the crime as 

"heinous and atrocious." 

JUSTICE STEVENS: See, one of the -- one of the 

things that concerns me about this case -- unlike Zant, 

most of the cases in which we have found the label of 

aggravating -- immaterial -- or findings like prior 

criminal histories -- robbery, or something like -- but 

whenever a pejorative factor of this kind has been found, 

we've generally found it did tilt the scales a little bit 

on the -- on the -- in favor of death. Clemons and the 

other were cases of this kind of aggravating --

factors are at the core of the sentencing decision. And

irrelevant, was harmless? I think the cases are all the

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, in "weighing" States, 

that's true, but --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Kirkland, assume for a 

moment -- I know you don't agree, but assume that the 

Court, or a majority of it, were to hold that California 

appears to be a "weighing" State. This case arose before 

the enactment of the Federal law that we call AEDPA. So, 

I guess pre-AEDPA law governs. And we would then have to 

consider -- what? -- whether this is harmless error? But 

the third question that you raised was -- apparently did

not incorporate any consideration of the Brecht standard. 

Is that what would be applied if we had to address the 

consequence here, of holding it to be a "weighing" State? 

MS. KIRKLAND: No. We believe the Brecht 

standard would not apply --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why? 

MS. KIRKLAND: -- in this instance, and that's 

because what happens --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Wasn't that the pre-AEDPA 

standard? 

MS. KIRKLAND: Yes, that's the pre-AEDPA 

standard, and --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, why wouldn't that apply? 

MS. KIRKLAND: Because, in this -- if California 

were a "weighing" State -- and therefore, the Clemons 

ruled applied -- in the first instance, the State court 

has the opportunity to cure the error. And if the error 

is cured by re-weighing -- appellate court re-weighing the 

evidence, or appellate court harmless-error analysis, then 

there is no error to be assessed under the Brecht 

standard. And when it comes to the Federal court on 

habeas corpus, the error has been cured. And so, Brecht 

does not apply.

question. And maybe I've missed something. Number 14, 

"murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel" --

taken alone, that would be vague. But I thought that in 

Profitt we said that if it were -- if there were a gloss 

given by the courts in interpreting that standard so that 

it was made more specific, evidenced in a pitiless 

attitude, pitiless crime, that then it was valid. 

Has a Federal court, or have we said, that this 

provision is unconstitutional? Or do we just assume that 

in this case? 

MS. KIRKLAND: Do we --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I missing --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- assume that the "heinous, 

atrocious, and cruel" special circumstance in this case 

was invalid? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Yes, it -- we assume that, 

because, in this case, the California Supreme Court held 

that to be invalid. In Profitt -- and that's Florida 

statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Invalid as a matter of Federal 

law? 

MS. KIRKLAND: It's invalid as a matter of State 

law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.

 MS. KIRKLAND: So, the -- California's holding 

on "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" in its Engert case, 

which is cited in these briefs, pre-dates this Court's 

holding in Maynard that "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" 

was invalid under the eighth amendment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, now we have an extra layer 

of complexity, because something that's been held 

unconstitutional under State law is said to skew the 

weighing, if it is weighing, as a matter of Federal law. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Yes, it can be looked at --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. 

MS. KIRKLAND: -- that way. But the other thing 

that I wanted to say about your question about Profitt is 

that Florida, like some of the other States, after Maynard 

v. Cartwright declared that "heinous, atrocious, and 

cruel" was an inappropriate eligibility circumstance under 

the eighth amendment, some States have fashioned either 

instructions or changes in their law to tailor their 

"heinous circumstance" to meet the concerns that are 

expressed in Profitt. But California has never done that, 

because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- it held it invalid under 

California law --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- was it this case in which

the Supreme Court of California made the definitive 

interpretation --

MS. KIRKLAND: No. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that this is -- what was --

MS. KIRKLAND: That case is Engert, which is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Engert. I can find it, thank 

you. 

MS. KIRKLAND: It's in the -- it's cited in the briefs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did -- what did the 

California Supreme Court hold? Did it hold that 

considering the "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" nature of 

the crime as part of the totality of the balancing was 

improper, or did it hold that that language is 

insufficient to form one of the narrowing functions that 

the aggravating circumstances provided. 

MS. KIRKLAND: The Engert case specifically held 

that the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" circumstance was 

only invalid as an eligibility determinant, because it 

failed to adequately narrow. So, it specifically --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if I think something is 

"heinous, atrocious, or cruel," I can use that in the 

balancing, even though I can't use it as one of the 

narrowing factors. 

MS. KIRKLAND: That's correct. And in the Engert case 

itself, the California Supreme Court indicated that

"heinous, atrocious, and cruel" would be a valid 

sentencing consideration; it just wasn't a valid narrowing 

consideration. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, this goes to 

a question, really, for the Respondent. It helps -- there 

is a paradox here. To the extent that a State attempts to 

guide and to limit what the jury can consider in the 

selection phase, it's held to a higher standard. There is 

-- there is certainly a paradox there. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was confused 

by your answer to Justice O'Connor's question. Do you 

think the -- we should review the California Supreme 

Court's harmless-error analysis, or should we undertake a 

Brecht analysis? 

MS. KIRKLAND: In this case --

MS. KIRKLAND: Yes. Assuming --

question.

State --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

this Court -- as the Ninth Circuit did, is to look at 

whether California performed a proper Clemons review, 

which is that the appellate court looks to see whether 

there is a principled and complete harmless-error review. 

The Ninth Circuit held that there was no such principled 

and complete review, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

that that might have collapsed into the Brecht analysis. 

MS. KIRKLAND: It could have, but it -- the 

court did it in two steps, and we believe it's because the 

Ninth Circuit recognized that it couldn't get to Brecht 

unless it found that California's attempt to cure the 

error under Clemons failed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, you said that 

the error was harmless under Chapman, the higher standard 

MS. KIRKLAND: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and that the California 

court so ruled. And if that ruling is correct, then you 

would never get to any Brecht standard; the Federal court 

would have to say California applied the proper harmless-

error analysis, and that's the end of the case. 

MS. KIRKLAND: That's correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the -- so the second 

question, once we get past weighing, is whether

California, in fact, did do what Chapman said. Is that 

right? 

MS. KIRKLAND: That's correct, that they not 

only have to have applied the appropriate standards --

that is, the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, which 

is the same as California's "reasonable possibility" 

standard -- they not only have cried -- applied the 

correct standard, but they have to have done so in a 

principled and complete way so the reviewing court can 

make sure that they've actually cured the error. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the problem --

MS. KIRKLAND: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- here is that the 

California Supreme Court decision is rather skimpy once 

you get to harmless error. 

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, we think that their 

analysis of the error was fairly complete. They refer to 

the critical aspect of it. They talked about the standard 

that should be applied. And they made clear, as they have 

-- consistent with their holdings, that because all the 

other evidence that related to the burglary, felony 

murder, special circumstance, or eligibility factor and 

the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" eligibility factor, 

since all of that evidence was properly before the jury 

and the prosecutor, and nothing about the arguments or the

instructions emphasized the independent weight of those 

eligibility factors in the sentencing, that, therefore, 

there was no harm. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was -- the argument was 

that, in California, the burden of proof is on --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the defendant, instead of 

on the prosecutor for the harmless-error inquiry? 

MS. KIRKLAND: We think that the burden-of-proof 

argument is illusory here, that the way that these things 

are analyzed, just as they were in this very case, is that 

it's the court who performs the analysis, and there's no 

discussion of which side has to prove what. It's the 

court who determines whether -- what standard's to be 

applied and whether that standard is met by all of the 

facts and circumstances --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- of the case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so, in this -- or, weren't 

there previous California cases -- or, again, correct me 

if I'm wrong -- where California says the reasonable-

possibility test requires the defendant to establish that 

the error was prejudicial? I thought that was the 

California law. Or am I wrong?

 MS. KIRKLAND: Well, the California -- the 

California Supreme Court has said that "reasonable 

possibility" and "beyond a reasonable doubt" are the same 

thing. And those burden cases are in a completely 

different context than this. In this case, in this kind 

of circumstance, when we're talking about capital-case 

sentencing, it's the court who does the analysis. There's 

no discussion of burden, and there's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but don't --

MS. KIRKLAND: -- no placement of burden. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- don't we assume that the 

court follows California law on the -- on the burden? And 

isn't it clear that, under California law, the burden is 

on the defendant? 

MS. KIRKLAND: No. In this case, the court --

there is no discussion of burden. There --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I know there is no discussion 

of burden. But when there is no discussion of burden, 

isn't the reasonable assumption for us to make, as a 

reviewing Court, the assumption that the California 

Supreme Court followed its own law, and its own law is 

that the burden is on the defendant? 

MS. KIRKLAND: Well, I don't think it's fair to 

assume that in this instance, since burden didn't play any 

role in this, that there was -- neither side had any

burden. The court itself performed the analysis. If the 

court has --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one quick 

question, but you can comment on it –- the statute expressly 

says, "They shall impose a sentence of death if the trier 

of fact concludes that the aggravating circumstances 

outweigh the mitigating circumstances." How do you 

respond to that? Why is it not a "weighing" State when it 

says that? 

MS. KIRKLAND: Because the word "weigh" isn't 

the talisman for the process that the jury goes through. 

"Weigh" is a normative process that -- opposing counsel 

have made the point that, in the 1977 law, which everybody 

agreed was a "non-weighing" law, that when we injected the 

word "weigh" into the 1978 capital sentencing statute, 

that that changed this. But the California Supreme Court 

made clear, in its Frierson decision, that, as far as 

California is concerned, the process -- the mental process 

that the jury goes through under either statute is the 

same, that "weigh," "consider," "balance," so on, none has 

a talismanic thing. It's just a metaphorical 

description for the jury's normative evaluation. So, the 

term "weigh" is not dispositive. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the term "concluding that 

it does outweigh" is something different from "weighing."

 MS. KIRKLAND: No, it's the same process. And 

in California, too, a critical thing is that that 

"aggravating circumstances" mean the sentencing factors 

that militate in favor of death; it doesn't mean that 

"eligibility circumstance." It refers to those sentencing 

factors. 

I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Kirkland. 

Ms. Rivkind. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA RIVKIND 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

MS. RIVKIND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I would like to focus on the observation that we 

need to look at what the jury was instructed, because I 

think that will clarify for the Court that California's 

1978 law is, indeed, a "weighing" statute under the 

established law of this Court. 

In Mr. Sanders' case, the jury was instructed in 

the language of section 190.3, and this language gave the 

jury a very explicit roadmap as to how it was to undertake 

its sentence selection in this case. 

Section 190.3 assigns a specific role to the 

aggravating factors. It tells a jury that, "In 

determining the penalty, you shall consider, take into

account, and be guided by the listed enumerated factors." 

The special circumstances, as the questions from the 

Court have noted, are specifically included. Factor (a) 

has two independent components, and one is the existence 

of any "special circumstance" finding. 

As Justice Stevens noted, this could only be 

considered aggravating. It is, after all, the reason that 

California has said that this case moved from being an 

ordinary murder to being one that was worthy of either 

death or life without parole. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's not -- it's prefaced 

by circumstances of the crime. 

MS. RIVKIND: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this State, and other 

States, can determine, "Oh, the victim was in fear for a 

long time, or was tortured." It seems very odd that a 

State, which is a so-called "non-weighing" State, could 

allow all of this same evidence to come in, but 

California, which tries to give some structure, is suddenly 

held to a higher standard. That's paradoxical. 

MS. RIVKIND: Well, no, I think it's not, and I 

think it's very consistent with what we see in 

Mississippi. In California, factor (a) contains two 

independent components. One is the "circumstances of the 

crime," and one is the "special circumstances." The

California Supreme Court, both before it affirmed Mr. 

Sanders' death sentence and after -- before, in a case, 

People versus Hamilton, and after, in People versus Benson 

-- in the context of assessing invalid special 

circumstances, said that it presumes the jury follows its 

instructions, and considers the special circumstances 

independently of their underlying facts. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it's -- it's 

invalid only because it's too vague for eligibility. It's 

not invalid because it's too vague for selection. 

MS. RIVKIND: I don't think that distinction 

holds up. And I think that we see that both in Clemons 

and in Stringer. 

And this takes us to a misunderstanding of the 

Mississippi statute. In Mississippi, the statute has not 

changed since the time of Clemons, except for one 

provision, and that is the addition of another category of 

capital murder. In Mississippi, death eligibility is 

decided by the definition of "capital murder" in section 

97-3-19. And the State lists, I think, now nine -- I 

think it was eight at the time of Clemons -- categories of 

capital murder. The defendant then goes to a penalty 

phase, and the statute sets forth aggravating 

circumstances in Mississippi's statute, section 99-19-101. 

There is a correlation between many -- at the

time of Clemons, all of the categories of capital murder 

and the aggravating circumstances, much as there is in 

Louisiana. However, there are two additional aggravating 

factors at the sentence-selection phase, and those are the 

"heinous, atrocious, and cruel" aggravator, which, in 

Mississippi, is only a selection factor, and whether the 

defendant had a prior conviction. 

And so, in this sense, we -- the Mississippi 

statute is very comparable to California. And it goes 

further, because, in Mississippi -- in Clemons' case, if 

you look at the joint appendix, at 24, and also in 

Stringer's case, at joint appendix 10 -- the juries were 

instructed, pursuant to the Mississippi standard capital-

sentencing instructions -- the very first opening 

paragraph tells the juries that, "In determining penalty, 

you must objectively consider the detailed circumstances 

of the crime." And I think this instruction helps explain 

the court's footnote 5 in Clemons, which I think is very 

important in terms of understanding why this whole focus 

on circumstances of the crime is not relevant to the 

distinction between "weighing" and "non-weighing." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Rivkind, I really don't 

understand what harm is done here. I can understand 

you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says,

"The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances," 

which are -- have been specified and which are narrowing 

circumstances; there are only five named in the statute --

"shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be 

true against the mitigating," and it turns out that one of 

those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional. 

Okay? Then you have the jury weighing something that it 

shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating 

circumstance was bad. 

I don't see why any harm is done where you have 

a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is 

"heinous, atrocious, or cruel," and that is later found 

invalid by the State supreme court. But then, in the 

weighing process, the jury is told, "Don't just weigh 

aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the 

crime." 

Now, it seems to me that the same jury that 

erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, 

"heinous, atrocious, and cruel," would also have found 

that "heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty" to be one 

of the circumstances to be weighed. So, what harm is 

done? 

MS. RIVKIND: I think the harm is -- there is 

harm. I think the fact that the jury considers the 

circumstances of the crime, in California, as an

aggravating factor. It may go to prejudice. Certainly, 

the nature of a statute will inform a court's prejudice 

analysis. But Mr. Sanders went into the penalty phase 

essentially with four weights on death's side of the 

scale, based solely on the special circumstances, and two 

of those weights should not have been there. And his jury 

was given a very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -- but the 

evidence supporting them was perfectly admissible. So, 

the jury could consider that evidence and come to the same 

conclusion; it's just the label that seems to be giving 

you the most concern. 

MS. RIVKIND: I have two responses, Your Honor. 

First, the rule -- the distinction between "weighing" and 

"non-weighing" is not an evidentiary rule. It is a rule 

about the statutory labels that a State gives to the 

factors that the jury puts on death's side of the scale. 

Even in a "non-weighing" State, as Zant made clear, if and in 

where a harmless-error review need not be done, because 

the court has concluded there will be -- the aggravating 

circumstances have an inconsequential impact, because the 

jury is not required to consider them in the selection 

decision -- even there, if an invalid aggravating 

circumstance permits the introduction of evidence that 

would otherwise have been inadmissible, we have error.

And that's the conclusion that the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but aren't we in, sort 

of, the converse situation here? There isn't any question 

about the admissibility of evidence that shouldn't 

otherwise have come in. I thought your argument here is: 

the error proceeds from the fact that, by using this label 

-- by referring to the circumstance as a "special 

circumstance," having been found at the eligibility stage 

-- that circumstance, and all the evidence that might 

support it, is given extra weight, and that's where the 

thumb on the scale comes. Isn't that your point here? 

MS. RIVKIND: My argument is that the "special 

circumstance" finding, itself, is the invalid aggravating 

factor on death's side of the scale. That is what the 

California Supreme Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's what I thought I was 

trying to say. I mean, am I getting it wrong? Because 

this is the --

MS. RIVKIND: No. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- time to correct me, if I am. 

MS. RIVKIND: No, the -- the jury could consider 

the facts of the crime, as in Mississippi. The jury is 

told to consider all the crime facts when deciding the 

penalty. And in California the jury could have considered 

the manner of the killing and who was killed and how the

crime proceeded. 

The harm to Mr. Sanders was that the jury was 

told that it had a process that was mandated for reaching 

its decision, and that process required the jury to put 

two special circumstances on death's side of the scale, 

that should not have been there, and then required the 

jury to reach the penalty decision by balancing. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying -- because 

this can get pretty complex -- simply, that because 

special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in 

effect, what went -- what the court is instructing is 

double counting that factor? It's a factor in all the 

circumstances how the -- how the crime was committed is a 

factor of all circumstances; and then, in addition, it is 

a special circumstance. So it is, in effect, counted 

twice. Is that the essence of your argument? 

MS. RIVKIND: I think it's more than that, 

because I -- I think if -- the harm is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I hope so. 

[Laughter.] 

MS. RIVKIND: It is more than that, because we 

have to think of how the jury is understanding this. To

California Supreme Court answer that in --

MS. RIVKIND: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- its Bacigalupo --

MS. RIVKIND: No. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- decision, where, as I 

read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances 

any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors 

listed in the statute? 

MS. RIVKIND: I don't read Bacigalupo as saying 

that. Bacigalupo did not deal with the question of 

invalid special circumstances being weighed at the penalty 

selection. I think the more appropriate authority of the 

California Supreme Court are its Hamilton and Benson 

decisions, wherein, addressing exactly the situation, a 

claim that invalid special circumstances tainted the death 

sentence, the court said, specifically, "We presume the 

jury weighs those special circumstances, apart from the crime" 

JUSTICE BREYER: The word "special 

circumstances" is ambiguous, because it might refer to 

something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, 

or it might refer to something in the law, in which case 

it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this 

evidence and give it some special weight. Now, that 

what's confusing me throughout.

 As I understood this area, to go back to what 

Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back 

up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding --

Zant is the key, because Zant says, "Judge, if you have a 

'non-weighing' State" -- that is, everything's relevant 

but the kitchen sink -- "the fact that the prosecutor made 

a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something 

he shouldn't is beside the point." Is that right? 

MS. RIVKIND: That is correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then we look at Stringer 

and Clemons, and they're making exceptions to Zant. And 

they're making exceptions for "weighing" States. So, even 

if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it 

made no difference to the evidence -- that is, to what 

really happened in the world -- still, says Clemons and 

Stringer -- still, you're not home free yet, State. 

Rather, you have to back up and do harmless-error 

analysis. 

So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I 

understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe 

all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the 

product of harmless-error analysis, because you didn't 

grant cert on it, among other reasons. 

Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to 

straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three

cases are wrong? What you really ought to do is say, 

"Court, always conduct harmless-error analysis. Conduct 

it whether you're in 'non-weighing,' conduct it whether 

you're in 'weighing.' We'll simplify." 

Now, what would be so terrible about that? 

MS. RIVKIND: Your Honor, if I were able to 

write on a clean slate, that is the rule I would propose. 

I think that if you -- the whole idea of Zant was carving 

out an exception from conducting harmless-error review, 

and the court was assured that because the aggravating 

circumstance, which was only a death eligibility factor, 

fell away at the selection stage, there was really -- it 

was -- the impact of that aggravating circumstance was 

likely to be inconsequential, as the Georgia Supreme Court 

found, and as this Court found in Zant. The simple 

approach would be to apply harmless-error review, no 

matter what the structure of the statute --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then we would not have this 

crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the 

United States understand, and the worst thing that would 

happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless-error 

analysis, and thus, if Justice Scalia is right about it, 

you would lose, and if -- because it would be harmless --

and if he's wrong about it, you'd win. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming --

 MS. RIVKIND: I think -- I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- assuming the district court 

does the -- the district court in the Ninth Circuit does 

the harmless-error analysis correctly. 

MS. RIVKIND: And --

[Laughter.] 

MS. RIVKIND: And I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it the California 

Supreme Court that has to do the harmless error, in the 

first instance? And here, this is puzzling about this 

case. Defendant said, at trial, to his lawyer, "Don't 

argue any mitigators. I'd just as soon die as spend my 

life in prison." So, no mitigators were argued. So then, 

even if you have a wrong aggravator, you have other 

aggravators that are right, and there's nothing to weigh 

against those correct aggregators. So, what mitigation is 

there to weigh against the valid aggravators? 

MS. RIVKIND: Your Honor, I think we first need 

to distinguish between the lack of a formal mitigation 

case and the absence of mitigating factors. In this case, 

in reviewing a different claim, the California Supreme 

Court -- and I refer the Court to joint appendix 108, I 

believe is the cite -- the California Supreme Court found 

that Mr. Sanders' decision to refuse to take part in the 

penalty phase did not necessarily make a death sentence

more likely, and it also found that the jury could have 

found mitigating factors from the guilt-phase evidence. 

Indeed, the jury was instructed to consider the evidence 

from all parts of the trial. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what were those? I see 

that sentence. The jury --

MS. RIVKIND: So, I think there was a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what were the 

mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the 

guilt phase? 

MS. RIVKIND: The main mitigating evidence was a 

powerful mitigating factor which went to the personal 

culpability of Mr. Sanders, and that was that the 

prosecutor, in his closing guilt-phase argument, told the 

jury, "We don't know whether Mr. Sanders was the actual 

killer or whether his co-defendant, Mr. Cebreros, was." 

And there was evidence from the surviving victim that 

there was a conversation between the two assailants, 

before the surviving victim was struck, in which one of 

the men said he wanted to leave the apartment. And, 

again, there was no evidence as to which defendant this 

was. 

This Court, in Green versus Georgia, has 

realized that whether someone is an actual killer or an 

accomplice is of critical importance in deciding between

life and death. That was the main powerful mitigating 

factor in this case. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I've never heard that described 

as a mitigating factor before. I mean, it's certainly 

worse if you're a triggerman, but I don't know what makes 

it -- somehow it's mitigating if you were not the 

triggerman. I would say that you're not guilty of 

something even worse. But to call that a factor of 

mitigation --

MS. RIVKIND: I think it is mitigating, and the 

fact that there is a question about one of the people, 

perhaps the accomplice, which very well could have been 

Mr. Sanders, wanting to leave before the murder occurred 

was basis enough to give the jury pause. And if we look 

at the deliberations, we realize that there was a jury 

note, about three-quarters of the way through its 

deliberations, asking the jury the consequences if it 

could not reach a unanimous jury verdict. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now you're getting into 

what has sometimes been called "residual doubt." You 

point out that a juror asked, "What if it were not 

unanimous?" And you also pointed out that there was an 

earlier hung jury in this case. But you didn't argue, 

below, that residual doubt counts. It's one thing to say, 

"If defendant argues it, the court should take it into

account." But there was no such argument made in this 

case. 

MS. RIVKIND: You mean in the trial court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: At any time. 

MS. RIVKIND: No, in the -- in the ninth 

circuit, residual doubt was argued. It is a mitigating 

factor in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the trial court, it 

wasn't, because that's when it would count. 

MS. RIVKIND: No, in the trial court, nothing was 

argued, because trial counsel acquiesced to Mr. Sanders' 

request that there be no penalty defense. 

And I want to make it clear, this is not a case 

because Mr. Sanders wanted death. As his trial counsel 

told the court, Mr. Sanders insisted he was innocent and 

wanted to go home. The trial court made it very clear to 

him, that wasn't an option. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- wasn't there a 

statement that he was indifferent between death and life 

imprisonment? 

MS. RIVKIND: It -- there was a statement that 

he did not want either penalty. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you defend that 

the difference in -- our distinction between balancing and 

non-balancing -- or, pardon me, "weighing" and "non-

weighing" States -- your answer to Justice Breyer 

indicates the -- that you would not be disconsolate if we 

jettisoned the whole -- the whole distinction. And isn't 

it true that it's paradoxical that a State which tries to 

structure the selection phase by giving specific factors 

as held to a higher standard than a State that doesn't? 

That seems to me very odd. 

MS. RIVKIND: Well, I don't -- I don't think 

that's odd. I think what that recognizes is that the 

Court has said, "While you do not have to give a -- we do 

not need a guided-discretion statute" -- that, as Zant 

holds, a jury can have complete, absolute discretion in 

choosing between life and death -- that when a State does 

regulate that, it must be done within the contours of the 

Constitution. The essential wisdom in the distinction 

between "weighing" --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is within the contours 

of the Constitution if, in a "non-weighing" State, the 

same evidence could be considered. 

MS. RIVKIND: But it -- I don't -- again, I 

don't think it's a question of evidence, I think it's a 

question of what are those factors that are being put in --

on -- in death's side of the scale, and how are they being 

balanced --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and I can imagine, in

"non-weighing" State, a prosecutor banging on and on, at 

the eligibility stage, on factor X, and really fixing that 

in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor X is 

not an aggravator. Now, the jury might have been 

prejudiced. 

And I can imagine, in a "weighing" State that, 

because the evidence is the same, and because there were 

so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the 

wrong factor didn't really make any difference. 

So, it seems to me the lineup between harm --

real harm in a case, and weighing/non-weighing, it doesn't 

line up terribly well. But you have the experience. And 

that's why I'd like your reaction. 

MS. RIVKIND: In terms of the rule of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. I mean, a serious 

effort to go back and say, "Look, harmless error 

throughout." I mean, I'm pushing the same thing I said 

before. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: He wants to know whether you 

would like to be thrown --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- into the "Breyer" patch. I 

think --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think the answer is yes.

MS. RIVKIND: I -- I'd like harmless-error 

analysis. I think -- I think that would be a simpler 

approach. It would accommodate competing interests, 

because each State's statute would be informing the 

prejudice analysis, and you would be looking at how many 

different sentencing selection factors were before the 

jury. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In that --

MS. RIVKIND: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- analysis, would you use, as 

one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility 

determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the 

prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague? Would 

that be a component of your harmless-error analysis? 

MS. RIVKIND: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't --

I didn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be a --

MS. RIVKIND: -- get the question. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we have the rule, 

already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor 

and it's a "weighing" State, that there's -- that the 

process is defective. Would you carry over that same 

argument just as one component of the harmless-error 

analysis?

 MS. RIVKIND: I think if we had -- well, I first 

would like to clarify something you said. I think, under 

the existing law, it's not -- it is not just eligibility 

factors, the invalidity of eligibility factors -- that 

create -- arbitrarily skew the sentencing, that, as we see 

in Mississippi, the "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" was 

only a selection factor. So, I think it -- this focus on 

an equivalence or a overlap between eligibility and 

selection factors is just not found in the Court's case 

law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was the whole basis 

-- correct me if I'm wrong -- for the Ninth Circuit's case 

in your -- Ninth Circuit decision in your favor in this 

case. In this case, it certainly --

MS. RIVKIND: Well, in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is an accurate description 

of --

MS. RIVKIND: -- in this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what the rule is. 

MS. RIVKIND: -- case, yes. The special 

circumstances that are the invalid aggravating factors 

were eligibility requirements. But that is not -- as the 

Federal death penalty shows, that is not a prerequisite in 

the weighing/non-weighing distinction. 

And I think I didn't answer the second part of

your question, but, I'm sorry, I can't remember it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I --

MS. RIVKIND: -- about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I was just asking if we can 

import the same formal rule we now have and reach -- and 

-- if we don't consider the same things in harmless-error 

analysis. 

MS. RIVKIND: Well, I think they would be. I 

mean, the way I would envision it is that if the jury 

weighs an invalid factor -- and under Sochor, the 

invalidity does not have to be based on Federal 

constitutional law. State-law invalidity creates the same 

harm; you're arbitrarily skewing the process toward death. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it --

MS. RIVKIND: If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but it's only invalid 

as an eligibility factor. It's not invalid as a selection 

factor. 

MS. RIVKIND: In Sochor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In this case. 

MS. RIVKIND: In this case, it's invalid as to 

both, because it serves both purposes. It's -- first, 

sees it as an eligibility factor, and then the -- the 

provision says -- it doesn't say just consider special 

circumstances in some vague, undefined way; it

specifically refers the jury back to its findings at the 

guilt phase. Section 190.3, subsection (a), says, 

"Consider the existence of an -- any special circumstances 

found true at the guilt phase." That's telling the jury, 

"Your -- the findings that made the defendant get the 

death penalty" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same jury. It's the 

same jury. The same jury that found it atrocious and 

cruel in the guilt phase would find it atrocious and cruel 

in the weighing stage. I don't see --

MS. RIVKIND: In --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in -- would you clarify 

something? Is it the correct interpretation of the 

California law that the -- the California court held, in 

effect, that you may not consider the fact that the crime 

was heinous and atrocious for purposes of deciding whether 

he's eligible for the death penalty, but you may consider 

that fact for the purpose of deciding whether to impose 

the death penalty? 

MS. RIVKIND: No, I think if it's invalid for 

one, it's invalid for the other. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is that what the 

California court would say? 

MS. RIVKIND: The California -- the -- in 

Engert, the question was eligibility. In this case, the

question was only selection. And the California Supreme 

Court -- the State conceded that the "heinous, atrocious, 

and cruel" circumstance was invalid, and the court, in 

this case, addressed its use as a selection factor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But what -- the specificity you 

need for the narrowing factor does not exist with respect 

to mitigating factors. We've said anything can be a 

mitigating factor. I find it impossible to believe that 

the California Supreme Court said not only is the phrase 

"heinous, atrocious, and cruel" too -- you know, too vague 

for the narrowing factor, but, when you get to the 

weighing phase, the fact that the murderer sliced up his 

victim with a thousand cuts of the knife cannot be taken 

into account by the jury. That's unbelievable. 

MS. RIVKIND: Well, the eighth amendment, as 

this Court said in Tuilaepa, does apply to the selection 

factors. It looks as -- at whether there's a commonsense 

core meaning. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- I want to 

throw you a suggestion -- isn't the answer to that problem 

that anything may be considered as mitigating evidence, 

but a mitigating factor is a conclusion that evidence has 

a certain significance, and not everything may be taken 

into consideration as a mitigating factor? Isn't -- the 

problem that Justice Scalia raises addressed by

distinguishing between evidence -- consider it all -- and

MS. RIVKIND: Okay. Because we're --


JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 


MS. RIVKIND: Okay. Because we're talking about 


aggravating factors. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. Yes. I misspoke. But, I 

mean, the distinction between "evidence" and "factor" is 

the -- is the key, isn't it? 

MS. RIVKIND: It's the key, because the 

consideration of the circumstances of the crime is not the 

problem that we have. What we have is that the jury's 

told to consider this fact or this finding that the jury 

understands makes the defendant -- because the State has 

said this is a reason both to make him death-eligible and 

a reason to impose death -- creates a weight on death's 

side of the scale. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. That means the 

answer to my question is yes, right? 

MS. RIVKIND: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the statute does not say 

"the finding of any special circumstances found to be 

true." It says "the existence of any special 

circumstances found to be true." That's what they're --

that's what they're instructed to consider. The 

existence. In determining the penalty, the trier of fact 

take into account the following, (a), it says, the 

"existence" of any special circumstances found to be true; 

not the "fact" that they were found to be true. 

MS. RIVKIND: Well, I think the prosecutor's 

argument in this case shows that they understood it as the 

finding. The prosecutor here argued -- in the precise 

language of the special circumstance, argued that this --

"the heinous, atrocious and cruel nature of this crime," 

parroting the language of the special circumstance. 

Clearly, the jury, I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that was correct under the 

law, wasn't it? In other words, "special circumstance" 

means the same thing when it's referred to -- the term 

means the same thing when it's referred to in the statute 

on selection as it means in the statute on eligibility. 

MS. RIVKIND: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MS. RIVKIND: In this case, what we have under

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Rivkind. 

Ms. Kirkland, you have two and a half minutes 

left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE N. KIRKLAND 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MS. KIRKLAND: I'd like to make three quick 

points in rebuttal. 

The first is that, as to the claim -- Ms. 

Rivkind's claim, that she's reiterated here, that the 

California Supreme Court has determined that the "special 

circumstances" label has some independent weight that it's 

important for the jury to consider at sentencing -- she's 

only cited half of the sentence in Benson and Hamilton. 

The other half rebuts her claim. 

The sentence is, "Although we presume that the 

jurors followed their instructions and considered the 

invalid special circumstances finding, independent of thier 

underlying facts" -- that's what she relies on -- they 

say, then, as they've said in a number of cases, "we 

cannot conclude that they could reasonably have given them 

any independent significant weight." 

So, it's just the point we're making. It's just 

a label that does not carry with it any independent

significant weight, because the evidence, the argument, 

the circumstances are all before the jury in the same way. 

The second point is that, while there may be 

some doubt as to whether Mr. Sanders was the actual killer 

in this case, there's no question as to his complete 

culpability in the crime. He was the leader. He led 

Cebreros there. He was the one who incited the crime in 

order to cover up for a prior botched robbery. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that such 

residual-doubt factors are appropriately considered if the 

defendant didn't raise them? I mean, the question of --

that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a 

reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes 

that determination doubtful. 

MS. KIRKLAND: I don't think that's an 

appropriate consideration here, where it wasn't raised, 

ever. 

The third point is that we wouldn't be here, 

except for the overlap in factor -- sentencing factor (a). 

That subclause, which the California Supreme Court has 

repeatedly held, means only that the jury is to consider 

all the facts and circumstances of the crime, including 

the facts and circumstances underlying the special 

circumstance, or eligibility factor. If that subclause 

wasn't in there, our eligibility factors in the special

circumstance, and our sentencing factors, would be
