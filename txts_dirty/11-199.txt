(10:28 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United 

States. 

Mr. Brindley. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BRINDLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

When determining whether an error affects 

substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error 

statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the 

error itself, consider it in the context of the entire 

record, determine what potential impact it may have, and 

then ask the question: Can the government prove to the 

requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair 

assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact 

the verdict of the jury that heard the case? 

It is impermissible for the reviewing court 

to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a 

reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this 

jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness 

on that basis.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem --

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is I can accept that 

formulation certainly for purposes of this case. I just 

don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of 

the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test. 

It didn't use the magic words, and it 

started out with let's look at the big picture, and it 

said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and 

this is a tough sell because. But then it quotes what 

happens with the jury. It -- and it -- and it ends its 

analysis for -- saying: We -- this evidence would have 

moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from 

anything it heard in the government's case. 

I just -- I just don't see that you have 

supported your theory by what the -- by what the court 

says. 

MR. BRINDLEY: Before the harmless-error 

analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have 

to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him 

absent the error. And so, the question that they ask 

doesn't require any consideration of the error. And the 

conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without 

any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the 

error.

They do not address the error or its impact 

at all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the 

extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error. 

They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't 

address it at all. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

the error actually was? I see -- and you can add 

another -- three potential things about these calls or 

three potential errors: One, that they proved as a 

matter of fact that she was biased. But, as the 

majority points out, she already said she was before the 

tapes were played. So, whatever error may have been 

occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, 

it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias. 

The second is some sort of ambiguous 

statement by her that all of them were in trouble, 

meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by 

the -- by Petitioner's lawyer. So, what was it that was 

error that affected or influenced the jury among these 

three choices? 

MR. BRINDLEY: The -- the statements from 

counsel, two statements: One, that everyone was going 

to lose the case, which was repeated several times by 

government counsel during the cross-examination of Ms. 

Perez.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was never referenced 

in the summations, however, or in the reply. 

MR. BRINDLEY: They were not specific -- the 

recordings were referenced, and they told them to look 

at the recordings. They didn't reference that specific 

statement. It was referenced three times in the 

cross-examination. When the witness suggested that 

it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to 

her husband, the government corrected her and said, no, 

it was everyone. And then they played the tape to make 

that clear. 

They also played a portion of a recording 

where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez 

about pleading guilty. Now, if you take those two 

statements together for their truth, what they mean is 

that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he 

should plead that way. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that's the error 

that you think --

MR. BRINDLEY: I think that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- influenced this 

trial? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think that's the most 

substantial one. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, tell me

what in this record reflects that influence. 

MR. BRINDLEY: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The fact that they asked 

for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire 

defense. So, what does the asking for her testimony 

show that they were interested in that particular part 

of the transcript? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Well, asking for her 

testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they 

were asking for a transcript that would have contained 

that part of the record. We don't -- we can't prove, 

and we don't have the burden -- I think that's 

important -- to prove that she -- they were focused on 

that specific statement. However, they did ask for that 

transcript. 

I also think they rendered the split verdict 

in the case, which is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which transcript? The 

transcript of her testimony? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Her testimonies, both on 

direct -- and then they asked for both, plural, 

indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which 

would have included these statements. 

And I don't think there's any way for the 

government to prove on this record to any degree of

assurance that they weren't concerned about that error, 

an error that I think if they took these things for 

their truth, then they could have thought he essentially 

confessed to his lawyer. His lawyer knew he was guilty. 

Those are fair inferences if taken for their truth. And 

then they could have disregarded all arguments that were 

made on his behalf. That's a sort of error that could 

infect the entire proceeding. 

And when you ask --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that the 

difference between your position and the Government's 

position is that the Government says the focus should be 

on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on 

this particular jury? 

MR. BRINDLEY: That is one of the important 

differences. I think --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that I understand. 

But beyond that I really don't understand the difference 

between the two positions. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I -- well, in the 

Government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our 

reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to 

ours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that 

you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they 

would view the evidence.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me -- let me read 

you two sentences and tell me whether you think there's 

a difference between them.  First one: "Is there a fair 

possibility that this particular evidence caused the 

jury to convict?" Second statement: "Is there a fair 

possibility that this jury would have" -- "that this 

jury would have convicted without the evidence?" 

Do you see a difference between those two? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I do. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference? 

MR. BRINDLEY: The difference is one of them 

was going to focus on the entire record, which includes 

the error. The other is going to focus on the evidence 

in the record without the error, and that's important, 

particularly with an error like this, an error that 

could have a pernicious effect that could affect a 

large, substantial part of this evidence, everything the 

defendant presented. It’s really --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I --

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- stop you there? 

I -- where in the Government's brief do you 

see the statement that the analysis should not look to 

the error, should not include the error?

brief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable 

jury would convict him absent the error. That 

assessment doesn't require a consideration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where --

MR. BRINDLEY: -- of the error. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where exactly is 

that in their brief? That the -- the question is 

whether a jury would convict him without considering the 

error. Because I look at the Government's brief, and 

they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error, 

why they think it's not important, why they -- you know. 

But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error 

at all. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think there's a 

significant -- I don't have the exact citation. 

On page 29, Your Honor, it indicates: 

"Although the Court's analysis often has not focused 

exclusively on the overall strength of the government's 

proof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's 

determination of harmlessness can properly rest on the 

conclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is 

sufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of 

erroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have 

altered the outcome."

other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the 

erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered 

the outcome. 

MR. BRINDLEY: If that's the -- and there's 

parts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with 

us in large part on what this test should be. And as 

far as that goes, I think the problem is the majority 

below asked a different question and appeared to do a 

different analysis. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: What would you point at in 

the majority opinion below that suggests that they did 

an analysis that didn't look at the error and its 

possible prejudicial effect? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Two things: First, the 

question that they asked. The question that they asked 

was whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent 

the error. There is no focus on this jury that heard 

the case or this verdict. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where is that 

statement? Where is that statement? 

MR. BRINDLEY: In the -- you mean in the 

majority opinion? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

MR. BRINDLEY: It's immediately prior to the 

harmless-error analysis.

If we go to page 16A of the appendix to our 

cert petition, it states at the bottom of that first 

paragraph: "On appeal, the burden lies on the 

government to prove that a reasonable jury would have 

reached the same verdict without the challenged 

evidence." 

That's the question they're asking. That 

question doesn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but in the context 

of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they 

then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very 

end of its discussion -- what happened in this 

particular case. And it concludes, from this evidence 

we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved 

the jury to convict." 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think the problem is they 

asked that question, which I think is the wrong 

question. Kotteakos says you can't ask that question 

because you can't strip the error from the whole. 

That's the question they ask. And to answer that 

question, you don't have to consider the error. 

Then I think it's important they didn't 

address the error at all; they didn't address its 

potential impact, despite that dissent which laid out 

that this is one of the most prejudicial errors you

could have in a trial. They ignored it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They say --

immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say 

"looking at the evidence as a whole." 

MR. BRINDLEY: They do say that. But then 

later on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that 

here's where the evidence was. And I think it's 

important that the only evidence they talk about is the 

government's evidence, and they talk about it in a way 

that views the evidence in the light most favorable to 

the government. 

In their harmless-error analysis, they don't 

address Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more 

important thing is they don't address the error at all. 

They don't even disagree with the dissent's contention 

that it's this terribly prejudicial error. 

Instead, they do what many of the courts 

below have been doing when they do this guilt-based 

approach to answer this question. They focus on the 

government's evidence viewed in the light most favorable 

to the government and then find, well, he could be 

convicted on that basis by a reasonable jury. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't -- you didn't 

read the whole thing. I -- it's a little hard to 

understand. And looking at the transcript on page 769,

am I right? I want to get my own understanding right. 

At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call 

"Beau" -- is that right? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, that was me, Judge. 

Yes, Your Honor, yes, it was me. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. 

Your client's lawyer, namely you --

(Laughter.) 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- has not yet seen the 

client; is that right? They think you haven't seen the 

client yet. They say somewhere you haven't even talked 

to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau. He 

hasn't seen his lawyer yet. They say that two 

paragraphs earlier. 

So, is that right, basically, that they 

think that, anyway? You see at the top of the page, 

about six lines down: He hasn't even talked to the 

lawyer yet. He hasn't even talked to Beau. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think that actually what 

they're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had 

talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they're talking about 

the lawyer. All right. And what you're trying to do, 

as far as I can read this, is they think what you're

the fair thrust of this? 

MR. BRINDLEY: There's some discussion 

between them --

JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think it means? 

MR. BRINDLEY: There's -- it's hard for me 

to tell exactly what --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, it's hard 

to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that. I 

thought they were talking about trying -- that you 

thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of 

agreement worked out. 

And then she says, Perez's wife: "How can I 

not worry?" He says: "I don't understand what's going 

on." Which is fair comment. "But it's not the way 

Beau -- he's putting it two different ways. If he 

didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's 

a different story. If you don't ask him" --

Then she says: "Yes, he's saying that 

everybody's going to lose. He's saying that whatever 

he wants to say. I don't believe him." 

Well, by the time I got through reading 

that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and 

I thought it sounded like they're talking about: Let's 

all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.

And -- and I could see that you could say 

that's prejudicial. I could also see that the 

government could say it isn't prejudicial. And it's 

pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking 

they were really not thinking about that error. I mean 

that was -- or not an error. I mean, of course, they'd 

be thinking about that; that was the issue. 

And as I read the opinion, they 

said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, 

and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't 

-- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you 

didn't, say, take it for the truth. 

And the other, dissenting judge, common, is 

thinking: No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard 

to understand what it means, but there's an implication 

there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in 

context that might have made a difference. So, he comes 

to a different conclusion. 

That's what I saw going on. And I didn't 

see some big war of standards. I just saw judges 

disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an 

individual case. So, what can you say to make me change 

my mind and think this is a war of standards that we 

ought to --

think the most important thing is what I've already 

said, is the question they ask isn't about the error, 

and they don't address it at all. And when you consider 

a dissent with that robust of language, the idea that 

they wouldn't address it at all is problematic. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, would it satisfy 

you in your opinion if we said: We aren't finding your 

opinion totally clear. And, luckily, people don't have 

the right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we 

have the right to send cases back to you on that basis. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we would 

like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not 

take in the actual transcript page there, when you 

reached your conclusion. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I don't think that would be 

sufficient, because I think the important thing here is 

that they be required to ask the right question, to 

focus on this jury that heard the case. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean, 

I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating 

Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're 

parsing things pretty closely. If I ask the question 

whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm 

asking pretty much the same question as whether without

that verdict the -- whether without that error, the 

verdict would be the same. That seems like just two 

ways of saying the same thing. 

Now, if what you're saying is put aside that 

formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing 

something wrong, which is that they're not looking at 

the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all, 

then I understand the argument; but then I ask the 

question, well, is that what this court did? 

MR. BRINDLEY: And I think that the -- by 

asking the question in that way and talking only about a 

reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying 

absent the error and you start looking at the evidence 

without the error, you're looking at a case the jury 

didn't hear. And I think that's the biggest problem. 

If you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then 

the reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment 

about a case they didn't hear. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, look, if you -- if you 

win, your client will get a new trial. Let's suppose 

that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took 

place. Every single thing is the same except the error 

is corrected. All right. Isn't that essentially the 

harmless-error analysis?

JUSTICE ALITO: No? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I don't think so, because I 

think if you do the analysis that way and you say the 

error is corrected, you don't take into account its 

impact. The question has been to be whether it 

contributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the 

verdict would be the same in another trial. That's 

where that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was 

worried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in 

Neder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's 

province, we have to do an exacting review of the entire 

record including -- that would include the error, 

obviously, and its impact. 

And here this court didn't address the error 

or its potential impact, and I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you -- are you saying 

that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been 

the same by this jury if the error had not been made? 

You're --

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, I am saying that. I'm 

saying that the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the test 

is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did, 

it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have 

been pronounced absent that evidence?

MR. BRINDLEY: That is correct, Your Honor,

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, what is 

harmless error? Every error is harmful. Every error 

that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict. 

There's no such thing as harmless error. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think -- I don't think that 

should be the formulation of the test. I think it has 

to have a -- what the government has to be able to do is 

prove to the necessary degree of certitude that the 

error doesn't substantially impact the verdict. And the 

reason I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does that 

mean? To say that it doesn't substantially impact the 

verdict means the verdict would have been the same 

despite this evidence. But you're saying, no, that's 

not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to 

the verdict. The Government says, well, it did, but the 

verdict would have been the same anyway. 

That's what harmless error is, it seems to 

me. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think what the -- when you 

ask the question about whether the verdict contributed 

substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error 

contributed substantially to the verdict, what you're

doing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire 

record and you have to look at the error's impact. And 

when you do that, you can make a determination whether 

there's anything in the record that would allow the 

government to prove to the right degree of assurance 

that it didn't. 

Now, you could -- it could be the case that 

you look at all of the evidence and you can say, well, 

in light of all the other evidence, the error was 

cumulative, or it was essentially uncontested. And then 

you can find that error is harmless. It couldn't have 

contributed to the verdict, and we know that to the 

right degree of certitude. 

I think the problem comes in when you're 

talking about this reasonable jury and whether they 

would convict without the error. That's some other 

trial. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we get a little 

more practical here? I think I understood your basic 

argument, which is: My defense was by this one woman, 

the wife of one of the codefendants. She tells a story, 

and if the jury had believed her story they would have 

acquitted your client. 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.

assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if 

I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error 

committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way, 

that that deprived you of a defense. Is that what 

you're saying? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of the potential of 

convincing the jury. 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely, in addition 

to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken 

for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for 

conviction, believing he had essentially confessed. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Now, assuming 

that's your argument --

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I go back to my 

question. Okay? Because what you said to me earlier, 

it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about 

believing the defense attorney when -- whether the 

defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or 

not. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think that -- well, I think 

the two go hand in hand. I think that if they take these 

statements for their truth, they could disbelieve her 

and the defense attorney who called her because the

situation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the

analysis --

MR. BRINDLEY: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you 

taking the position in this case that a reviewing court, 

under no circumstance, could conclude that this error 

was harmless? Or are you taking the position in this 

case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think, 

committed review error and we should send it back for 

them to do it the right way? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I -- I am first saying that 

the court committed review error. But I think -- I'm 

also saying on top of that if you do the error -- review 

properly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be 

formulated, then what this -- this case is going to come 

down to is really one question, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you're -- and 

you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think 

did say this error is harmful.

but you would say, given what occurred here, the 

importance of this witness, that -- that this was a --

this was a harmful error? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely. I -- I 

think if you do the test appropriately and do the proper 

analysis focused on this jury and the potential impact 

of the error, then this is a harmful error. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Back to Justice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is your argument something 

like this? Let's assume there are 10 pieces of 

evidence. Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted. 

Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so 

prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at. There 

is a substantial likelihood of that. 

I think this is your argument: If the jury 

was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which 

was improperly admitted, what would happen if we 

concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if 

they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted? 

What result? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think if you did the 

examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what 

you're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through 

9, but you're not considering the possibility that you

government would have to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're not only saying it's 

possible to convict, but that likely, probably would 

have happened. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I don't -- well, if the error 

is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I 

think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as 

it might be, I don't think there's any way on this 

record that the government can prove with fair assurance 

that that didn't infect the jury. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my hypothetical is 

that the court of appeals says that if the jury had 

looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted 

before them in this trial, they would have convicted, 

likely. 

Now, we -- then the hypothetical is: We 

don't think they did because this item was so 

prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they 

looked at. Is that what your argument is? It seems to 

me that's stronger than the argument you're making. I'm 

not sure even that works for you. 

MR. BRINDLEY: I -- the formulation you've 

stated, I agree with that. If number 10 is such that 

there's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact

the jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think 

they can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our 

argument. And the one reason I think it's most 

important in this case is because this case comes down 

to -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --

essentially it's a circumstantial case. This isn't like 

Harrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence 

where this Court has found harmless error. 

This is a case where the ultimate question 

is, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not 

guilty; if you don't, he is. And in order to find 

harmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a 

cold record making that credibility determination, 

something that this Court has continually said a 

reviewing court is not in a position to do. And when a 

case can be ground down to the point where it's going to 

come to a credibility determination about a witness the 

reviewing court did not see --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe the majority in 

the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the 

harmless-error test. I didn’t think that was the reason 

why we took this, why we took this case. What I'm 

concerned about is the test. Now, the only aspect of --

the only thing that I understand that really 

differentiates your position from the Government with

respect to the test is whether the focus is on a 

rational jury or on this particular jury. 

And when you say the focus should be on this 

particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by 

the -- by an appellate court? How is an appellate court 

supposed to tell whether this particular jury was 

different from a hypothetical rational jury? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Because this -- the reviewing 

court has to look at everything in the entire record. 

That includes in this case the jury note. It includes 

in this case the split verdict. All of those things. 

And when you look at all of those things, you can get 

insight into the jury that heard the case and how they 

viewed it. 

You can also look at how a reasonable jury 

would view the case as heuristic device to get back to 

what this jury thought. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought 

your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than 

a hypothetical jury. But I thought your main point is 

that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected 

testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the 

record, and if the rest of the record warrants 

conviction, no harmless error. 

I thought that what you're saying is that

the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to; 

are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they 

just asking the question, let's take out the tainted 

evidence, see if there's enough to convict? 

MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I 

agree with that. The problem is the question asked by 

the majority strips out the error and it also focuses on 

the reasonable jury rather than this jury.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The harmless-error inquiry, as this Court 

explained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately 

on one question: Whether a rational jury -- and this is 

a quote -- "whether a rational jury would have found the 

defendant guilty absent the error." Now --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, that does raise 

the question that I think most separates you and Mr.

Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito 

suggested. So, let me give you a hypothetical. 

Let's say that this jury was not out for 8 

hours but was out for 8 days. And on the 7th day, a 

note came from the jury, and the note said we really 

think that these tape recordings are extremely 

important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how 

important they are, and we'd like to listen to them 

again. And they do that, and then they come back with 

this compromise verdict. 

Now, what you are suggesting is that we 

cannot look at any of that. Essentially, the best proof 

that's available to us about whether the error in fact 

affected this jury's decision, you would have a court 

close its eyes to. And I guess -- why would that be? 

MR. YANG: Well, I don't believe our view is 

quite so firm. I think, as a general matter, our view 

is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury 

might or some subset of the jury might be considering is 

generally very unreliable. And that, in your case, the 

Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what 

it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence 

that was before the jury. Because if we're assuming a 

rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it 

should be an indication to go back and look again.

If the Court were to conclude, wow, the 

evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no 

rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with 

convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the 

situation that your hypothetical poses would result. 

So --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So, let me make sure I 

understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying 

to me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was 

irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court 

should be cautious about it and look at that kind of 

evidence in the -- in light of everything else that 

happened at the trial. 

MR. YANG: Ultimately, the appellate court 

should look back at what the jury was supposed to 

consider, the evidence in light of the instructions. It 

should be a cautionary note but ultimately should 

redirect the court back to the evidence. 

And I think that focuses on, again, one of 

the two related legal points that Petitioner made in 

argument that I think there's real disagreement between 

the Government and Petitioner on: one, the inquiry of a 

reasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the 

Government's view, versus this particular jury; and the 

related claim that the inquiry is how this influenced

the deliberative process, if it was like a factor that 

this jury might have considered in reaching its 

verdict --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how to 

separate out an admitted error situation. And let me 

explain why, okay? Let's assume the facts of this case, 

but instead of this tape recording, the improperly 

admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant. 

Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial 

case of guilt -- now, we've already said that 

confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of 

harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that 

somehow this was still harmful -- harmless? 

MR. YANG: Are we taking Marina's testimony 

out now? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. Yes. 

MR. YANG: Okay. If Marina's testimony was 

not in and you had the evidence here -- now, an 

unconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the 

bar, right? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different 

standard.

the standard we're assessing.

a fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same 

result here, because what you -- when you take Marina's 

testimony out of the picture, there was really no 

defense at all. What the government had was a strong 

case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. He 

testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said. 

Meaning, he -- when I used the word "confession," I'm 

sorry, I misspoke. 

He takes the stand. He -- or doesn't take 

the stand. He says everything he said to the police. 

And that confession that he was there, et cetera --

MR. YANG: So, he testified to the substance 

of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive 

there? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She called him --

MR. YANG: Right.

But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the 

error sort of vary with the strength of the government's 

case? 

MR. YANG: Undoubtedly. I think that's right. 

Now, let --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If he had not run away, 

and the tapes were admitted --

MR. YANG: We would have a weaker case, and 

it would be -- ultimately, these lines that the Court 

has to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond 

a reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by 

the court of appeals. The Court has repeatedly 

recognized that this is a reviewing court's judgment

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. 

MR. YANG: Now -- now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what the defense 

said was there's only one defense here, and it's the 

wife's defense that he was there by accident, not 

intentionally. There was a lot of countervailing 

evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a 

reasonable jury have -- might have or could have 

credited that defense? 

MR. YANG: Well, I'm not sure that that's 

Petitioner's view. I mean, I would -- there's two 

aspects to this case. We can talk about the fact-bound 

ins and outs of that, which is interesting in its own 

right. But I think one of the key legal questions for 

the Court is what's the standard that the Court must 

apply. And there's a real difference between 

Petitioner's and the Government here. 

And that standard the Petitioner has 

advocated is that this jury, as opposed to the 

reasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must 

look at the thought process of this jury to decide 

whether the error might have had some influence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you look at how the 

case was tried.

MR. YANG: Well, no, I think the position 

about this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at 

the deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this 

Court's decision in Shinseki. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Yang --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you just told me it 

wasn't, Mr. Yang. Because -- well, I think that the --

that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury 

is important is whether you're going to take into 

account what you know about what this jury did: how 

long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court, 

what eventual verdict it reached. 

And you just suggested to me that that was 

fair game to consider in this analysis, although one 

should be cautious about doing it. 

MR. YANG: I should qualify that. I didn't 

intend to give the Court the misconception that we're 

looking at this jury. The ultimate question is whether 

a rational jury would have convicted absent the error. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, a rational jury is not 

the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back 

a note on the 7th day. That's this jury. 

MR. YANG: And the reason that I believe 

that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back 

at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what

the evidence should be saying to a rational jury. But 

the ultimate question is the rational jury. 

And let me give you a few examples from the 

Court's case law, because I think this really puts it 

beyond dispute that the real question is the question of 

a rational jury, what they would do absent the error. 

First, in Neder the Court explained that 

erroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of 

evidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an 

element of the offense, or failure to instruct on a 

necessary element of the offense as was the case in 

Neder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and 

will affect the deliberative process in ways that are 

not readily calculable. 

The error in Neder was that the jury was 

instructed not to consider the question of materiality, 

which was an essential element of the defense. And the 

Court specifically rejected that the -- that the fact 

that this jury didn't actually make a finding based on 

the evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error 

analysis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're going back then to 

your position in your brief where you said that you 

would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that 

the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the

length of their deliberations, the divided verdict? You 

said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would 

not include those. 

MR. YANG: That's right. Those types of 

indications are entirely unreliable and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought you 

answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into 

account, the court could take them into account but 

cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight. 

MR. YANG: What I think the court should do 

is when you have a -- what is a much better indication 

or at least a -- of what this jury might have been 

doing, you use that as a reason to go back and look 

again at the evidence. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I suspect --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a case in 

which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for 

a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge, 

and the trial judge said: I now acknowledge that this 

court committed error in introducing item 10 in 

evidence. And the court remembers that when this came 

into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was 

transfixed, jurors were weeping. This was the high 

point of the trial. 

That's wrong for the judge to say. All he

through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a 

rational jury -- so, that's the end of it. Judges do 

the -- do what I suggested all the time. 

MR. YANG: Well, we think that, again, the 

-- the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a 

rational jury would do. And let me give you an 

example --

JUSTICE KAGAN: That's starting to look, Mr. 

Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the 

government on the part of a judge, because you're so 

abstracting it from this case and this jury and what 

this jury's reactions to everything that happened was 

that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict 

route? 

MR. YANG: This Court has repeatedly 

rejected that. The reason it's not a directed verdict 

is you have a jury verdict. You have a jury verdict 

that beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually 

determined that this defendant is guilty of the offense 

charged, on proper instructions. Then the question is: 

What remedy do you have? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: You do have a jury -- excuse 

me. You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a 

formulation of the test that essentially pretends that

the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how 

it reacted to various things. 

MR. YANG: The reason --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. A question mark. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. YANG: This I think can be answered if I 

could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I 

think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows 

that our view has to be the right view. 

For instance, in a series of cases, this 

Court has concluded that the unconstitutional admission 

of a confession, either of the defendant or the 

codefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming 

evidence such that a rational jury would convict without 

the evidence. 

Now, if we're looking at what a jury would 

have considered, whether they were brought to tears or 

whatever, when you're talking about a confession, 

there's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is 

going to have that far in the forefront of their minds 

when they are deciding guilt or innocence. But the 

question --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I just don't 

see how you can do it without the error. I keep going 

back to this point. How about if the prosecutor had

done in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen, 

whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer 

said he was guilty. 

MR. YANG: I'm sorry. I just --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The lawyer -- the 

prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: 

Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the 

lawyer said the defendant was guilty. All right? I'll 

go through all the other evidence I have that might 

prove that she was not telling the truth, but the 

central, most important piece of evidence in this case 

about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty. 

Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced 

by that error? 

MR. YANG: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because under your 

formulation --

MR. YANG: No. You can't --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a rational jury would 

have convicted absent the lawyer saying that. 

MR. YANG: That's right. But this Court has 

repeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the 

question was the jury was told to presume certain malice 

in a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have 

altered the basis on which the jury decided the case is

not the question; you look to the reasonable juror. 

Similarly in Pope, the Court said the 

question does not turn on whether the jury did not, in 

fact, have this error in mind when it found the 

defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would -- you would 

take into account that the prosecution apparently 

thought this was important, so important. The trial was 

over. The prosecutor said: Judge, I'd like to come 

back so these tapes can be introduced. 

That -- the -- we have the witness 

testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not 

part of the scheme. We have no direct evidence, because 

Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez. He's at 

the scene, we know that. And an explanation, an 

innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene. 

And then the government comes back, after everything is 

done, and says: We want the jury -- we want these tapes 

to be before the jury. 

Isn't that -- don't we take into account 

that the government itself thought this was very 

important? 

MR. YANG: I -- I think it's a factor that 

you consider, again, in directing the courts look at 

really what the trial evidence was. I mean it, I think,

belies the facts of this case -- obviously, that's a 

hypothetical. But when you look at how cases really 

develop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you 

know, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes 

that weren't transcribed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my point to you is it 

wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend 

the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them. 

And they contain not just the one statement. There's 

the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial 

will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --

they should take a blind plea. 

MR. YANG: I think when you look at what 

happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played 

for two reasons: one, to show that Marina had bias 

because she was told by Petitioner's counsel that 

Petitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --

Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and 

arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing. 

And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dissent pointed out 

that she admitted that before the tapes were played. 

MR. YANG: Correct.

in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her

husband. So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for 

that. 

MR. YANG: Well, the tapes certainly were 

reinforcing of that. And, in fact, when the 

government's closing argument -- it did not reference 

anything about this -- what I think you and 

Justice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous 

sentence in a series of long tapes. And, remember, 

these --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was --

MR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the 

record are only one portion of the tapes. So --

the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times 

while she was on the stand, the exact line? 

MR. YANG: The exact lines? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. YANG: This is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government thought --

thought it was important for the jury to hear it, 

because they said it three times. 

MR. YANG: Well, to be fair, I think you 

need to look at what's before and after it. The 

government is focusing on three different statements

that are at issue in the case. 

The first one is that -- with some 

profanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to 

succeed at trial. The second one is that defense 

counsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel 

suggested that everybody was going to lose. And then, 

third, she thought everybody was in, again with 

profanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, why does any of 

this have to do with her credibility? Did the dissent 

say that the way this affected the jury was that it 

rendered her less credible? I thought --

MR. YANG: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the dissent just 

said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant 

thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer 

thought he was going to lose. 

MR. YANG: The reason that this was in --

and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the 

argument was made that these statements equating 

Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or 

their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with 

Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you 

know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up 

unknowingly because she asked him. That was the theory.

It's not contested. And, in fact, nothing 

that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's 

theory would be different. The only difference would be 

a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't 

take these statements for the truth of the matter. 

So, nothing that the jury heard would have 

been different. When you read the short passage in the 

context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not 

fully transcribed. Petitioner asked for the entire 

tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial, 

which -- which was -- based on the government's showing 

that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene, 

he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and 

Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there 

when the call was made to the informant that said they 

had the money. 

Now, there's some dispute over whether he 

said that, but certainly he was there when that call was 

made because that's what triggered the raid. All of 

that was basically undisputed. You've got all these 

calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez, 

27 calls --

the evidence. And I may simply be asking the same

you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at 

the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence 

has the defendant saying: I'm guilty, I'm guilty. And 

the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at 

pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what, 

you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting. 

And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes: You 

know, the guy said he was guilty. 

Is that a situation in which we're supposed 

to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence, 

and see if a jury would have convicted? Or can we with 

a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what 

led the jury to convict? 

MR. YANG: Well, I think the former, but let 

me explain. And again, I'm going to go back to Neder, 

if I may, for a second. In Neder, the jury never found 

an element of the offense. Never did. There's no 

question that the jury's verdict was affected by the 

failure to instruct. In fact, it was not just a failure 

to instruct. The district court told the jury this is 

not for them to consider. And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But critical to the Court's 

view in that case was that the -- the defendant could 

not have contested that element.

what a rational jury would do when you excise the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would like very 

much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's 

hypothetical and the Chief Justice's. As I understand 

those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --

MR. YANG: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- where the particular 

piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from 

how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's 

the kind of thing that could really make a difference. 

I mean, they were in tears, et cetera. 

MR. YANG: And --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, in my 

reading of this, which I once had to read about 100 

harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can 

confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the 

judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's 

feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question, 

could this illegally admitted evidence make a 

difference? Could it have made a difference in this 

case? Could it have? And the answer is going to be 

"no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not 

have thought it made a critical difference.

And that's just putting the same thing I 

think slightly differently. But the answer in 

Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going 

to think it has nothing to do with rationality. If the 

jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close 

case. And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a 

difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless. 

And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't 

have made a difference to any rational person, he's 

going to say "harmless." Period. 

Now, that was my impression reading those 

cases. And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting 

at that. And -- use them. Answer them rather than me, 

because that's what I'm interested in. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. YANG: The answer is that in a case 

where the jury -- where you have some very provocative 

evidence, but there's also a very strong case that 

exists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that 

you need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or 

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But even in those 

cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as 

a whole and says that there was so much evidence before 

this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that 

a rational jury would have gotten to the same result,

that it would have convicted, then --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the 

judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some 

hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on 

this evidence that that's all they would have looked at, 

but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible 

evidence, they would still have found guilt. 

Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --

MR. YANG: I think so, but let me give you 

an example. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a proper application of 

the -- of the framework? 

MR. YANG: I think so, but it's not, again, 

what a -- what this particular jury was doing, because 

we know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession 

cases, the jury hears a confession, an 

unconstitutionally obtained confession, 

unconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is 

going to be -- right there. You know? A jury -- a 

juror could say: Let's go home, we have a confession. 

It's out of his own mouth. There's very little else to 

debate. 

But when the evidence is beyond that 

confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would 

have gotten to a different result, and you could say

that with a fair assurance or if there's a 

constitutional error as it would be with a confession 

beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is 

harmless. 

And the reason that the Court's taking that 

inquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long 

recognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very 

significant costs of retrial. And so, the premise 

there --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you are 

essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there 

was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal 

case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a 

verdict here because there's only one way a rational --

rational jury could come out. 

MR. YANG: This -- that argument was 

specifically rejected by this Court in Neder. The same 

question came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more 

difficult case for the government than this, because at 

least in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this 

jury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt 

because it was never instructed to find an element of 

the offense.

shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court 

should look at what would be done by a rational jury, 

except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that 

have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a 

few of the other questions, simply because it's so 

difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was 

actually doing? 

We have a rule that prohibits consideration 

of what goes on in the jury room. But suppose we didn't 

have that. Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the 

jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you 

could watch it and see. If that were the case, then 

surely the rule would be what would this jury have done? 

But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what 

a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly? 

Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it 

caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise 

would have been a difficult case. 

Did they take a long time? Well, it shows 

it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might 

have tipped them one way or the other. 

You just can't tell. 

MR. YANG: I'm -- I don't want to resist 

this too much, because I think we're fighting about 

things at the very extreme. Most of the times that

we're talking about these purported indications from the 

jury, it's entirely ambiguous. And the -- so, there may 

be well be extreme examples. And I think those would 

rightfully influence a court's consideration in a case. 

But, again, when you have harmless-error 

cases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder, 

that the jury did not find an element of the offense, 

the inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court 

has repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19 

of our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error 

inquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact 

that the primary purpose of a trial is the factual 

question of guilt or innocence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you read --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, when you 

began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were 

two ways in which your position was different from Mr. 

Brindley's.

MR. YANG: Well, it's related. His focus on 

the -- this jury I believe is seeing whether there's 

some influence on the process, deliberative process, 

even if the outcome would have been the same absent the 

error. And so, he's kind of trying to get into the 

minds of the jury. And this Court has repeatedly 

rejected that. Again --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you a different 

question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference 

in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to 

wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that 

there's two different ways of saying the same thing. 

But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out 

there which suggests that courts that use one 

formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that 

use the other formulation tend to come out the other 

way. 

And I'm just wondering what your view of 

that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the 

emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other 

formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the 

government's evidence, and that that makes a difference

disagree with about what courts of appeals do in any 

particular cases. But with respect to this formulation 

of the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused 

versus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the 

scholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge 

Edwards' opinion about harmless error. That came out in 

1995, when it was already swimming against -- upstream 

against this Court's harmless-error decisions. 

But he had in his pocket the Sullivan 

decision, which was admittedly a structural-error case, 

but there was language in Sullivan which suggested that 

you need to look at what this particular jury was going 

to do. 

Then we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce 

this very well -- but Recuenco. It's the -- the 

Apprendi application of Neder, which specifically rejects 

this kind of broad logic in Sullivan as being 

inconsistent with the Court's harmless-error cases. 

Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do agree -- you do 

agree that the government has the burden of showing that 

the error is harmless? 

MR. YANG: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the government's 

burden. And you also agree that we should look at the

evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in 

making --

MR. YANG: No. The Court, even in -- I 

think most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki, 

talking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind 

of presumptions or rigid rules. And the reason that you 

do, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of 

a reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the 

defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And then 

the question is, are you setting aside that verdict 

because -- do you think that this error was the thing 

that tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty? And 

so, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all 

presumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how 

this Court has conducted the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what does it mean 

that the government has the burden? What does the 

government have to do? 

MR. YANG: The government has to show, as --

this is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has 

said in Neder is the same thing that applied in 

erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a 

rational jury would have found the defendant guilty 

absent the error, and that involves the three core 

elements we explained in our brief. And then the Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The absent error. So, 

that means -- wait. You look at just the evidence 

that's not tainted? 

MR. YANG: In some cases you can do that, 

where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I 

may finish. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly. 

MR. YANG: Briefly. In some cases, you 

might do that. In other cases where it's close or the 

evidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error 

to see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing 

in getting to guilt. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice allowed 

me to ask one question. Could I amend your statement so 

that you would say a rational jury in all the 

circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard, 

would have? 

MR. YANG: Yes. It's -- in the position of 

this jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury, 

correct.

MR. BRINDLEY: I first want to address 

Neder, which Government counsel continually referenced. 

Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also 

limits itself to situations where the evidence is 

uncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in 

those situations the difference between the reasonable 

jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent 

because it would be impossible for the error to have an 

impact. 

Secondly, I think it's important to note 

from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't 

consider the error, then even that extreme case, that 

would have to be ignored. And so, I think the 

Government's formulation and the formulation used by the 

appellate court below would justify -- would lead to 

that bad conclusion. 

I also think that when you do that 

formulation, where you're talking about the reasonable 

jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come 

out different is because those courts think they don't 

have to address the error, which is I think what 

happened in the majority below, why they didn't address 

it despite the dissent.

 The other thing I think it's important to 

note is the reason you have to look at the error and its

possible impact and not just whether you could be 

convicted on the other evidence is because you say, 

well, he could be convicted on the other evidence. If 

that's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on 

the evidence which could independently in this case be a 

reason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt 

determination that this Court says is not supposed to 

happen. And I think the majority's opinion below is 

consistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it 

to suggest that's not exactly what they did. 

I also think that in the end -- there was a 

mention of the limiting instruction; a limiting 

instruction would have cured this problem. We assume 

juries would follow it. That means they wouldn't have 

concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then 

put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't 

telling the truth. 

What this error allows, what -- if taken for 

its truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his 

lawyer. They could disregard everything that was said 

on his behalf. They could say we know that he's guilty; 

his lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on 

that basis. That's an error that can infect the 

entirety of the proceedings. 

And if you look at this jury and what they

heard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez 

is credible or not, there is nothing in this record the 

Government can point to that would allow a reviewing 

court to make that determination. A reviewing court 

that didn't see --

JUSTICE ALITO: Did the panel majority in --

did the panel majority in this case say anything that 

differs from what this Court has said about harmless 

error? If we were to reverse, what would we point to in 

the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think you would point to 

that first statement of the test where they say whether 

the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error, 

because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out. 

This Court has never overruled Kotteakos. 

The other thing --

JUSTICE ALITO: Hasn't this Court said 

exactly what Seventh Circuit said there? In other 

cases? 

MR. BRINDLEY: This Court has used, I think, 

dicta that has language of that sort. But in those 

cases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they 

look at what the error was; they put it in the context 

of the whole case, and they can say the government could 

prove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree

of assurance, because it was cumulative, because --

there's no -- there's nothing --

JUSTICE ALITO: You want us to say -- you 

want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit 

panel, because you said what we have said in prior 

cases, but we were wrong? 

MR. BRINDLEY: I think the reason to reverse 

them is because that formulation has proven to lead to 

the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this 

guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of 

Kotteakos. This Court has never overruled Kotteakos. 

And to focus on it allows a guilt 

determination by a reviewing court that would be 

violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was 

concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was 

concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even 

concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases 

where the evidence is uncontestable. 

Because if you took these statements as true 

and then you came down to a question, well, is Marina 

credible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the 

government can do on this record to prove that the jury 

would have found her credibility differently because 

this Court can't figure that out on a cold record. 

It said so, many times. It's not possible
