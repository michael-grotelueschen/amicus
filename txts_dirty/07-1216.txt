 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 07-1216, Philip Morris v. 

Williams.

 Mr. Shapiro.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 We are here today because the Oregon court 

failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and 

because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a 

forfeiture of due process rights.

 This -- this Court vacated after finding 

that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong 

constitutional standard, and it remanded with directions 

to apply the standard that the Court laid out. But the 

Oregon court didn't do that. It never even addressed 

the constitutional issue. The Oregon court, of course, 

refused to follow this Court's direction because it 

believed there were mistakes in another paragraph in our 

instruction request dealing with what the court referred 

to as "unrelated issues."

 But that isn't what this Court mandated.

And the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the 

first time after nine years of appellate litigation is 

completely inadequate to avoid this mandate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, we are 

dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line 

always reads "for further proceedings not inconsistent 

with this opinion." And it was my understanding that a 

State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law 

ground, if there is such a ground in the case.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Your Honor. We believe 

that this disposition is quite inconsistent with what 

the Court mandated. The Court heard arguments in this 

case about the "correct in all respects" rule, but it 

still mandated an application of the constitutional 

standard, including the prohibition on punishment for 

harm to non-parties, and that standard simply was never 

applied. We say that is inconsistent with this Court's 

opinion.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it seems to me the 

problem with the argument is that to say it is 

inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say 

that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law 

issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do 

so those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the 

court but by the party who raised it. And the

difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on 

the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the 

issue, "correct in all respect" issue, was properly 

raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we 

in effect are saying the other side is not going to have 

an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme 

Court. And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill 

for you to climb.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we don't say that the 

court can never adopt a State law standard after remand 

from this Court, but we say that this disposition is 

inconsistent --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I know you are saying that 

but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking 

for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect 

you cut off the claim by a party raised before the 

Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon 

Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because 

the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in 

the case in a certain sequence? What business do we 

have to do that?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, because the preservation 

issue was debated before this Court and it adopted a 

specific order here saying on remand now consider the 

constitutional standard, which is the prohibition on --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I know the language that 

you are referring to.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the referring to that 

language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to 

raise. Isn't there a problem that we should be 

concerned with if we accept your position in cutting off 

the claim made by one party to the case which was never 

heard by the Oregon Supreme Court?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, this is very 

similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this 

Court, where the issue of preservation was debated 

before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers, 

and the Court said: We sub silentio passed on the 

adequacy of the State ground when we CDRed the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- did the 

Court -- suppose the -- what is it called -- "correct in 

all respects" had been raised and decided by the Oregon 

Supreme Court in the first instance. Suppose it had 

said, well, we don't have to deal with whether 

Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular, 

because it was wrong in other respects. Suppose that 

had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme 

Court said. Would that have offended any Federal due 

process? Would that have been an appropriate

disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, that takes us to our 

second and principal argument, which is that that ground 

would not be adequate under this Court's criteria for 

adequacy. And we say that there are really three 

reasons why that would not be an adequate ground for 

forfeiting this constitutional right. It's an ambush. 

It was a surprise ruling that we couldn't anticipate. 

It is an exercise in futility because, even if we 

submitted a perfect instruction that complied with that 

rule, we would have been rejected anyway by the trial 

court that simply believed that this instruction wasn't 

required by the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the place to make 

that argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, no. The Oregon Supreme 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't it have been 

appropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are 

raising and for you to make the reply that you have just 

made?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, this Court has 

said repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question 

for this Court to decide.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize it's a Federal

law question and in approaching that question, I keep 

asking the question which I think I have now put to you 

three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits 

on: Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here 

that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised 

an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be 

heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there are two reasons. 

First under the adequacy decisions of this Court, 

including Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years 

after the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like 

this that counts heavily against the adequacy of the 

State ground. This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very 

recently.

 And then secondly, this is a point that was 

argued to this Court four separate times now and when 

the Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the 

constitutional standard that's something that had to be 

done on remand. The Court did not invite the lower 

court to get into the question of whether this request 

was made. The Court found that the request was made.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- maybe this Court 

insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue 

which is now before us. And I still want to know, is 

there a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us

to cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue 

that they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in 

a timely fashion?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, there is a good reason, 

because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal 

question for this Court to decide. The issue was 

debated here four separate times at great length. The 

Court remanded for a specific decision by the lower 

court. That wasn't done. And if we turn to the 

adequacy doctrine --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what 

issue was debated here four times?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Whether or not there was an 

adequate State ground because of the "correct in all 

respects" rule. That was debated in the merits brief, 

in the cert oppositions twice. It was debated again in 

the cert opposition this time around. But the Court has 

never accepted it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the State court hadn't 

ruled on it at that time.

 MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So how do we rule on it as 

a matter of first impression?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, because, Your Honor, the 

Court considered, just as it did in Sullivan, it

considered these issues in the cert papers and then 

remanded the case for a different issue to be decided by 

the lower court.

 But we don't hesitate from debating the 

adequacy issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did our opinion decide that 

-- that question? Did our opinion say that that 

question was decided against your opponent?

 MR. SHAPIRO: No. What the Court said in 

Sullivan was that it was a sub silentio determination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could we have 

determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself 

hadn't made any determination?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Because the parties debated 

this extensively in their briefs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't decide 

questions, particularly questions of State law, that may 

have a Federal check. But we don't decide them in the 

first instance.

 And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I 

think affects this concern of fairness to the parties 

who raised this "correct in all respects" from the 

beginning. This Court had not clarified, had it, until 

the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others. 

In State Farm we were talking about harm to

nonresidents. So if I recall correctly, Williams was 

the first time we ever clarified that harm to others 

included people within the same State; is that correct?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's true.

 This -- this, as the Court expressed it, was 

a slight extension of the previous decisions.  But Your 

Honor, if the Court feel that this adequacy issue hasn't 

been dealt with previously by this Court, it's presented 

squarely here. It is a Federal question, which this 

Court says has to be decided by this Court. And we 

don't hesitate from --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose one reason 

-- one reason to think it may not have been decided is 

that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it 

would not have been a bar to our consideration of this 

case the last time because, just as you raise the 

question in your second question presented that whether 

the award complies with due process, we may have thought 

there might have been an adequate and independent State 

ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go 

ahead. We granted cert on the substantive question on 

whether the damages award was unconstitutional.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, if -- if 

we're not right about the decision resolving the 

adequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now

and address it as we do in our briefs. This is not an 

adequate State ground under this Court's decisions. The 

first reason for that is that this is a futile gesture 

that the State court requires of us.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to ask you about 

that. That's the thrust of your argument: It would 

have been futile to comply with the specific, drafting a 

perfect -- perfect instruction "correct in all 

respects." But I have to think the trial -- the record 

is subject to the reading that the trial judge thought 

the issue had already been adequately taken care of, 

rather than it would be an incorrect instruction.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the trial judge asked, 

is there any authority that requires me to give this 

instruction on harm to non-parties? And we said, in our 

view it's the BMW case. And she said, well, if there is 

not an authority right on point I'm not going to give 

this instruction. She said that very clearly. So if we 

submitted a separate piece of paper, it would have made 

no difference; and if we had taken out the two mistakes 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Where in the record is the 

portion of the colloquy about the instructions most 

clearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Let's see. It's the

instruction conference. This begins on page 17a, where 

Mr. Beaty starts discussing the second prong of this 

paragraph. He says -- he quotes the language, and the 

judge -- the judge says: "Well, I think that that's 

covered by giving an instruction that punitive damages 

are not compensatory." And he says: No, no, that is 

not -- "That is not the point of this instruction." 

This is pages 17 and 18a.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's exactly the 

point I make. I think the trial judge was saying, I 

think it's already covered, which is different from 

saying, no matter how you phrase it, I won't give it.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, she said she just 

disagreed with the idea that there should be protection 

against punishment for harm to non-parties. And she 

said unless there's a case requiring that, I'm not going 

to give that instruction. And she said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't she also say that 

she was going to give, and ultimately did give an 

instruction, to the effect that punitive damages are 

punitive, they are not for the compensation of this 

person or any other person, and to -- she then turned to 

Philip Morris's counsel and said: What about that? And 

Philip Morris's counsel said okay.

 MR. SHAPIRO: What he was saying when he

said okay was: I understand your ruling and I'm not 

going to continue to argue a point that I've already 

lost. But he pressed that point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't sound like much 

of an objection.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the -- the State courts 

both held -- both of the appellate courts held our 

instruction was rejected. And this Court said it was 

rejected, too, in its opinion. And that's exactly 

right. You can't antagonize the trial judge by arguing 

and arguing after your position has been rejected.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the -- the 

problem that I am having at the moment is that they did 

-- from your point of view, is that they -- the other 

side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon 

courts have followed this rule that the instruction has 

to be good as a whole.

 Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and 

they do -- they do say that. They do say it, or they 

imply it, or they apply it. They are not completely on 

point, but they are not completely out of point, either. 

And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge 

there just looked at this instruction on 32(a). It 

looks like sort of it's all together. It really does 

look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2). And

he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are 

two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the 

end of it. You can't raise your objection. Maybe you 

should have had four instructions instead of one, but 

you did just have one.

 And under Oregon law, unless every part of 

it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even 

if he never mentions the other part. And that 28 -- it 

does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say. So 

what do we say about that?

 MR. SHAPIRO: The -- the reason we say that 

those 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we 

had to submit a separate piece of paper or change 

another paragraph in the instruction request is that 

none of them dealt with a situation where you have 

separately numbered requests --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean -- please, I 

-- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am. And --

and that's because I have looked up in some of those 

cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't 

-- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's 

a little hard to say. But then I looked on page 32(a) 

of this appendix and looked at what your instructions 

looked like.

 And -- and if I were sitting there as a

judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a 

single thing there. They have it indented, and they 

have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one 

ball of wax. So can I really fault this Oregon court 

for just doing what I said?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think so, because 

the pattern instruction here told both parties to 

include all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive 

damages in one numbered instruction, 34.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they had some other 

handbook that says beware of that.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you are going to 

run into this rule that says if there is any part of a 

single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the 

trial judge never mentioned it.

 MR. SHAPIRO: But that handbook came out in 

2006. And after all, that was a practice tip. It was 

not a State court ruling saying you had to organize your 

instruction this way.

 We had separate paragraphs, separately 

numbered. They dealt with different issues. One was 

the Constitution and the other was the State statute. 

And there's no Oregon case that said that in that 

situation you have to break it out into a separate piece

of paper.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the notion was 

one issue, one charge. And it wasn't in just one 

practice manual. There were a few cited in the brief 

that the charge should be limited to one issue, one 

point of law.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the pattern instructions 

told us to put every point pertaining to punitive 

damages in Instruction No. 34. Both sides did that. 

And the Court was working with plaintiff's instruction, 

taking their --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it would be pretty 

odd. Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases 

or some share thereof? And if you were going to do that 

-- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you 

just, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model 

instruction? Then you won't make errors in the other 

parts.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, you see, the -- the 

pattern -- the pattern instruction didn't include the 

due process point.

 JUSTICE BREYER: True, but you could add 

that to the pattern.

 MR. SHAPIRO: That's what we tried to do,

other side's instruction to go through this one by one. 

She -- she was asking us: Now, what's your next 

addition?

 And we -- we got to the due process point, 

and she said: What is your authority? And we told her, 

and she said: I don't think that instruction is 

necessary.

 It was separately argued. It was separately 

decided by the State courts in the prior decisions, 

decided by this Court as -- as a separate matter, and 

that is exactly how the trial court approached this. 

Her request was to go through this item by item.

 She wasn't taking an all-or-nothing approach 

to this instruction. She started with plaintiff's 

document and asked what from our menu of additions 

was necessary.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not speaking of this 

from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that

I'm not sure that I think that now. That is, the reason 

is because I put myself in the position of not the trial 

judge. The person to put yourself in the position of is 

the Oregon Supreme Court justice. And what he is doing 

is he's reading that instruction. And -- and what can 

you say in response to what -- what he might have

thought?

 He knows this rule. The rule is if the 

instruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's 

wrong, you are out.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: He knows that rule, because 

there have been a lot of cases on it. And then he reads 

your instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't 

know this the first time when it was here, but he said 

because it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean it's wrong 

in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go 

to the rest of it.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now we send it back, so he 

says: Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.

 MR. SHAPIRO: You know, Justice Breyer, this 

is very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case 

which reached this Court. The Alabama Supreme Court had 

said if you intermix different appeal points in your 

brief, we are not going to consider any of them if there 

are any errors to be found in any of the paragraphs in 

their brief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the whole 

thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were 

discussing?

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that this was 

something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung 

at the last minute, that it was not like this rule. 

There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court 

applying the rule. It seemed to be quite a novel rule.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, what -- what the State 

argued there was that for 60 years the "correct in all 

respects" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited 

dozens of cases applying it. But this Court unanimously 

held that that approach was pointless severity. Even 

though the State supreme court there said, we can't 

disentangle these arguments, it's too complicated, it's 

too much of a burden on the State supreme court, this 

Court unanimously found that was pointless severity. 

And at that point --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There was a basis for 

questioning the good faith of the court in that case, I 

think.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And I don't think that's 

true here.

 MR. SHAPIRO: I -- I -- we don't question 

the good faith of the court, but we say that this is 

pointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied

more recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue 

of bad faith. The Court thought that it was pointlessly 

severe and unnecessarily severe to insist on a perfect 

proposal in that case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The best you have come up 

with -- and I think you have researched this pretty 

thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find 

a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George 

case, right? "George," I think, is the name of it.

 And there, there is an alternative ground 

which is that the judge had to -- had to give the 

instruction himself, and it's a criminal case. And we 

Shepardized it and it has only been cited twice. And --

and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth. And 

-- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to 

decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter 

of Federal law or not?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is an earlier case 

that is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several 

years before, and it's cited in our brief. In that case 

an imperfect instructional request was made, and the 

Court still found that there was a duty to give the 

instruction based on due process. And the reason was 

that the parties during the charge conference had 

debated the issue. It was a fair-enough exposition for

the trial court to understand the need for the charge.

 And here this really is much like the 

Osborne case. You know, in the Osborne case the 

defendant didn't make any instructional proposal, and 

this Court still reversed and required a new trial with 

the correct instruction. It said due process required 

that. And the Court said that we -- that the party had 

sufficiently brought this to the attention of the trial 

judge for Federal adequacy purposes even though no 

instruction was -- was proposed.

 The lawyer there merely moved to dismiss the 

proceeding, never proposed an instruction, but this 

Court required a retrial with a correct set of 

instructions to the jury. That's an a fortiori case, I 

think; and also the Flowers case, I believe, is a 

fortiori. There really was a strong and compelling 

State interest there in having the lawyers break their 

arguments up into separate headings and subheadings so 

the appellate court could follow the argument.

 But here there wasn't any burden placed on 

the trial judge at all by our request. She was going 

through these one by one, and she asked us: What's your 

next point that you want added? We proposed it. It was 

on a silver platter. She didn't have to retype it. She 

could have simply read it to the jury in that form. It

didn't have to be edited or amended. There literally 

was no burden on the trial judge at all. And so we --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: She didn't get to the --

the other grounds, because I think it was all about that 

paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under 

our then precedent. And I don't think that -- that the 

-- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now --

are now before us were -- were even reached then.

 MR. SHAPIRO: She did look at the illicit 

profits point. And she said: I'm not going to give 

that; that's unnecessary. She did -- she didn't address 

the "may versus shall" issue because she was working 

with plaintiffs' proposal. So all -- really she just 

had before her our request for this due process 

instruction. She analyzed it separately, it was debated 

before her.

 And this is much more specific than what the 

lawyers did in the Osborne case. They didn't even 

propose an instruction. We served it up on a silver 

platter. She could have used it, and indeed there was 

no work for the trial judge at all because she was 

simply telling the lawyers, make this change, make that 

change that we've discussed, so there is zero burden on 

the court.

 And you have to ask in this situation, what

is the legitimate State interest that would support this 

massive forfeiture of a very important due process 

right? The plaintiff says the State interest here is 

that it promotes affirmance of jury verdicts whether or 

not there has been a due process violation. But think 

about that. That's hardly a State interest.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The State interest in the 

rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers, 

if they are going to object to the instructions that the 

judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that 

is a correct instruction of the law. That's -- that's 

why, I guess, they have this rule.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and you'd better get 

it right, because if you don't get it right, you're 

going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was 

wrong in refusing to give any part of it.

 Now, if that's the reason they have that 

rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as 

in any other case. Why wouldn't it?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, please recall that in 

both Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general 

State purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but 

the Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily 

severe application of the rule. And that's what we

contend here, that this is exorbitant, it serves no 

legitimate purpose. It is truly a game of gotcha that 

just nullifies the defendant's due process rights.

 And that precedent I think would be of great 

concern in various fields of law. This is a rule of law 

that will apply in civil rights cases in the future, 

criminal cases, all sorts of cases.

 So I -- I think if this Court does apply its 

own criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise 

in futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter. We 

didn't have any reason to think we had to submit this 

again on a separate piece of paper.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you just tell me, 

well, why was it an exercise in futility? That's what I 

don't quite understand.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, because the judge had 

ruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't 

going to give this instruction. It wouldn't matter if 

we separated it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But she said she thought 

it was already covered. That's what I -- on that very 

page you pointed me to.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, she -- she said that was 

all she was going to say about the point. And we said, 

well, that doesn't cover our point, because we want

protection against punishment for harm to non-parties. 

And she said: I'm not going to give that instruction; I 

deny the rest of your request, No. 34.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And where is this 

colloquy? I mean, we went through the parts, she said I 

think it's covered and it was okay. You seem to be 

saying more than ws included in that colloquy.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think if -- if 

you look at the whole colloquy, that's the gist of it. 

I -- I have paraphrased it, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You've made it much 

clearer than it was.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Perhaps --

(Laughter.)

 MR. SHAPIRO: -- perhaps I did. But I -- I 

would just point out that in Osborne the lawyer didn't 

make it clear at all. The lawyer didn't even propose an 

instruction.

 We proposed a good instruction that this 

Court has quoted from emphasizing our language, 

saying -- saying it correctly captures the due process 

principle. So that is enough to satisfy Federal 

criteria of -- of adequacy, and that is sufficient to 

preserve the point. There is no dispute that this is 

preserved for appellate purposes in Oregon.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This Court's constitutional mandate in this 

case is conditioned in several significant respects, and 

it invites the discretion and judgment of a State court 

that's applying it. First of all, it says that States 

have flexibility in coming up with a procedure to 

address this procedural due process issue.

 It also says that it has to be an 

appropriate case; there has to be a significant risk of 

juror confusion, and a request. There's no indication 

in the opinion that this Court intended to federalize 

the State procedure over how that request occurs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't dispute 

that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is 

adequate and independent?

 MR. PECK: I do not, but I also submit that 

it is more than adequate. Exist -- what the Oregon

Supreme Court decided was that the existing procedure 

permitting a limiting instruction to be requested -- in 

Oregon it's Rule 105, same language as in the Federal 

rule -- and such a request has to be timely, it has to 

be specific, it has to be on the record. And Oregon 

precedent says that when we mean specific, the proponent 

has to give us the exact language -- this is part of the 

party presentation principle -- the exact language that 

they are asking us to use.

 And that means that we also apply our 

traditional 92-year-old rule that requests for 

instruction must be clear and correct in all respects.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The problem --

JUSTICE BREYER: I would say the 28 cases 

are not quite as clear as I suggested. That is, I 

couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable 

situation.

 MR. PECK: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: In each instance it seemed 

as if one of two things was the case: Either, A, where 

the instruction was in error, it really was the matter 

brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he 

gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway.

 Now, which of those cases do you think -- I 

am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you

think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they 

are not perfect.

 MR. PECK: I would look first at 

Reyes-Camarena, which is a 2000 -- a 2000 decision 

involving the death penalty. And there, there were two 

parts of this request, in a single request. The request 

asked for a mitigating factors instruction, which the 

court found was correct on the law and -- and would have 

been given had it been asked for separately.

 But it also asked the jury to consider 

sympathy for the defendant, which they found to be 

contrary to Oregon law, and therefore, it was not error 

for the trial court to have refused this.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what you can't tell 

from that is what was the part of the sympathy 

instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the 

part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel 

of the part that the -- that the appellant was 

complaining about.

 MR. PECK: Well, the court, though, did cite 

a prior decision that talked about a sympathy 

instruction and claimed that this one was no different 

than that. It was contained in a single instruction. 

It makes clear, the opinion does, on that.

 Owings v. Rose is that another case which

both parties have cited. And in Owings, it's very 

clear. There you have two different parts of an 

instruction that are offered at the same time, and --

and one part is right. And this -- this one deals with 

third party liability.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I remember that, 

because they said on that one -- some floor covering 

thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad 

floors or designing the floors wrong --

MR. PECK: If --

JUSTICE BREYER: If that's the case, what 

they said was: Don't worry about it because basically 

he did give you the instruction that you wanted, though 

in a different way --

MR. PECK: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and besides that, they 

added --

MR. PECK: And besides that --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're right.

 MR. PECK: -- this was an alternate ground.

 Then in Hotelling v. Walther, a 1944 case, 

the proposed instruction consist -- consisted of three 

separate sentences, and the Court does reprint that 

instruction. And each of those sentences has a 

different legal proposition in it. And it was only the

last sentence, the third proposition, that the Court 

found to be in error, and therefore, found that there 

was no error in failing to give this instruction because 

it was not clear and correct in all respects.

 I -- I think that that --

JUSTICE BREYER: In the last one, what I 

have here is that the court said the so-called requested 

instruction was never requested at all --

MR. PECK: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- at all.

 MR. PECK: But I do not believe that that 

was the --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what is the 

-- I will go look at that again. But what is the 

standard? I mean, remember, I think what your brother 

said at the end is correct. Imagine that yours is a 

death case and we have said as a matter of Federal law 

that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we 

send it back. And the court then says: Oh, we forgot; 

there are a couple of matters of State law here that bar 

the Federal consideration of the death question. And 

here they are. And then they come up with just this.

 Is this -- is this a situation where you 

would be equally -- that's my problem. And so, put 

yourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would

do if this is the death case and not the case that you 

have?

 MR. PECK: Well, you know, it's -- it's hard 

to get my arms around your hypothetical, because I don't 

know the grounds on which --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just imagining that 

what has happened is that the instruction that they have 

given for the defendant in the death case violates 

Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens 

is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal 

law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked 

from considering it because there are these two other 

State grounds that mean that the lawyer --

MR. PECK: I understand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. PECK: But -- but the question would be 

then, why would that be a situation like this, where the 

trial judge -- contrary to your assumption, 

Justice Ginsburg -- the trial judge did find that there 

were other parts of the instructions offered by Philip 

Morris that were incorrect on the law, and the illicit 

profits was one of them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't the trial judge 

just stop there? I mean, if this is the ruling in the 

State --

MR. PECK: Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- once the trial judge 

found that one of the other instructions was bad, he 

could have just said, I throw the whole thing out. Why 

did he go to all the trouble of going into this, the 

governing one?

 MR. PECK: This is -- this is a process. 

Counsel in the case in a trial in Oregon can offer 

instructions every -- a proffered instruction up to the 

point when the jury is instructed under their law. So 

Philip Morris had the opportunity to correct it. The 

practical nature of a charge conference is that the 

parties come in with their proposed instructions. The 

plaintiffs followed the pattern instruction, which by 

the way does not require enumeration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you are 

acknowledging that the trial court did not apply the 

rule --

MR. PECK: The -- it's not a rule of trial 

procedure. It's a rule of appellate review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- yes, 

that's exactly right. And I think the purpose for the 

rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision 

for the trial court. If you have got two errors, and 

she says the instruction's no good, on appellate review

you don't know which basis was at issue. There is no 

doubt here the basis on which the trial court was 

ruling, is there?

 MR. PECK: I believe there is -- there --

first of all the trial judge rejected this instruction 

on multiple grounds, and made it clear that the illicit 

profits request was contrary to the Oregon statute that 

sets up the criteria. She found other parts confusing 

and contradictory. But -- and -- but there are two 

things that I think are significant here.

 You have to look at what was discussed 

here. The trial judge, if you turn to 21a of the joint 

appendix: "We are not here to punish for other 

plaintiffs' harms. We are here to punish, if we are 

here to punish at all, for the conduct that caused harm 

to Jesse Williams on or after September 1, 1988." This 

sounds very much like an acceptance of the rule that 

Philip Morris was advocating.

 On 19a she says: "These punitive damages 

are not designed to compensate for other plaintiffs who 

are not here. " On 20a there is a colloquy; she 

expresses her belief that the risk is adequately guarded 

against, suggests language to express that, and asks: 

"Does that get you where you need to be?"

 That's when Philip Morris's counsel says

"Okay." She had every reason to believe that she had 

satisfied it. She then follows up.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we give any weight in 

the case to the fact that the instruction that the 

Petitioners now request and the rule had not really been 

announced clearly as of the time of this trial? It's 

not exactly a new rule, but let's -- for our sake we 

will call it a new rule. Does that have any weight?

 MR. PECK: I don't think it does.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it does in our cause 

and prejudice jurisprudence. In habeas, which is also a 

civil action --

MR. PECK: I understand.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- we say there is an 

overarching Federal principle that allows; because of 

cause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue. 

We do that all the time. Those cases weren't raised by 

the Petitioner, but it seems to me they're quite 

relevant here, especially when you consider the 

importance of the constitutional issue, which was not 

really -- let's face it -- clear to counsel on either 

side of the aisle or to the trial judge.

 MR. PECK: Well, here's the reason why I 

think in the context of this record, and -- and this 

litigant, it is not significant. And that is, if you

look at 21a, the appendix in our -- our merit brief, 

there we have Philip Morris in another smoker trial in 

Oregon offering up a requested instruction on this 

issue. This is in 2002, so it's well before this 

Court's decision in this case.

 It's even before State Farm v. Campbell, and 

the requested instruction says, one sentence: "You are 

not to impose punishment for harms suffered by persons 

other than the plaintiff before you."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the trial judge didn't 

have the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has 

subsequently made on that point. The trial judge in 

fact here said: Now, if you can give me a case, then I 

will give you an instruction; you can't give me a case. 

And she was right.

 MR. PECK: But she -- but that's actually 

not the same issue that she asked that on. Counsel 

cited page 17a of the joint appendix for that question. 

And if you look at the bottom of 16a, her question: 

"Let me stop first and go back to the proportionality 

point you are making. " This is the ratio point, the 

second guidepost of BMW v. Gore. She says: "Is there 

case law that says the trial court shall, in order to 

have a constitutional instruction, tell the jury about 

proportionality?" And this is where he says: It's

addressed post-verdict. She asks: Is there any case 

law; and she says: No, I'm not going to go there. I'm 

not going to go where no judge has gone before, because 

she did not want to be reversed.

 So she is trying to be careful, and I think 

you have to credit the Oregon --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- it sounds 

to me like that you are confirming my concerns.

 MR. PECK: No. I -- I think that what she 

said is as to the proportionality issue. On the other 

issue, she even returns to it later when Philip Morris 

bring up a different issue with respect to punitive 

damages.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh. Oh, you're -- you are 

saying that if our law had been clear at the time, that 

she still wouldn't have given the instruction?

 MR. PECK: No. I'm saying that she thought 

she was complying with that. She stated on the record 

that: We are not here to punish for other plaintiffs' 

harms. Later on that other issue, if you look at 28a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your -- your contention 

is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case 

had all the guidance necessary to give the correct 

instruction --

MR. PECK: She --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- before -- before we 

even announced the rule?

 MR. PECK: She seemed to accept -- she 

accepted the point before you announced the rule, and 

the Oregon Court of Appeals ruling in the Estate of 

Schwarz case where they offered that one-sentence 

instruction, reversed the verdict, in part because that 

instruction they said should have been given. So they 

anticipated this Court's rule. I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To move -- to move 

from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are 

correct that there is this routine, clear rule of State 

procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its 

head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide 

this complicated, difficult rule of Federal 

constitutional law instead?

 MR. PECK: Well, in fact, the -- the court 

thought it was relying on it. In each of the previous 

iterations in the Oregon Court of Appeals and in the 

Oregon Supreme Court, they cited this rule, "clear and 

correct in all respects," in order to reject the "harm 

to others" instruction because they said it was 

inconsistent with State law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we just 

made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal

procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by 

this adequate and independent State ground that the 

Oregon courts had relied upon?

 MR. PECK: No. What I'm saying is that they 

went further then, and this is what gave this Court the 

authority to rule on that substantive issue. They said 

that that request was inconsistent with the Oregon 

statute. And they did so -- on page 48a of the 

petition, where they say: "In Williams 1, the Court of 

Appeals concluded that the instruction was incorrect 

under State law. We agree."

 And then again on page 52a, they note that: 

"That is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon 

law respecting the conduct of juri trials and 

instructions" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then I think 

your --

MR. PECK: But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think your 

answer -- go ahead with your but.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PECK: But then they went on to say: 

"And nothing in due process requires us to look at this 

differently." That's where they made their error. That 

was the constitutional mistake that the Oregon court

made. They thought they were wrong on a State ground. 

They thought there was no Federal issue addressing that, 

and so they decided that they didn't have to reach any 

other State law issues. And they ignored the well 

preserved objections that Mrs. Williams made to the 

other parts of this unified instruction on punitive 

damages.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. I 

still don't see that answer. You are saying they said 

yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can 

still reach -- there might still be a Federal due 

process issue, so we just can't rely on that. And if 

that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession 

that this is not an adequate and independent State 

ground that would bar consideration of a Federal 

constitutional issue.

 MR. PECK: What was not an adequate on 

independent State grounds was their decision that the 

Oregon statute which permits you to punish a misconduct 

in order to deter others from doing that allowed 

punishment for harm to non-parties.

 That part was their interpretation of the 

statute, and if there were no due process equation here, 

that would have been an independent State ground. It 

was wrong as a matter of due process.

But there are other grounds, other mistakes, 

substantive mistakes, avoiding law in this instruction. 

And any trial court that gave instruction number 34, 

which was objected to as a whole, would have committed 

reversible error because they failed to follow the 

Oregon statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I think it's 

the more routine practice for a court, if you have a --

again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars 

addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely 

on that. Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and 

of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say, 

well, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway.

 But it seems to me, under your presentation, 

it's the other way around. It's a clear and easy 

procedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined 

constitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm 

going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.

 MR. PECK: I think it was natural for the 

court to do that. That was the issue presented to them 

by Philip Morris. And courts do not reach out to do 

other issues. They reach -- they were being solicitous 

of Philip Morris, and they were addressing the arguments 

that Philip Morris made. And when they decided that 

that inured to Mrs. Williams benefit, not to Philip

Morris's benefit, then they said we don't need to 

address your other questions. And I think have you to 

look at the Oregon Supreme Court noting in their own 

decision that there was no futility here. In fact, the 

last time we were here Philip Morris said the reason 

they needed this instruction was because of what was 

said at closing argument.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What are the elements? 

Imagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to 

put pen to paper on this. Suppose they win in this. 

Then we will be back at the State law issue that I 

thought was going to be there, which was the issue of --

you are talking about the colloquy. Did they give the 

essence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't 

they? And then look how cooperative the judge was, et 

cetera. But that isn't before us now.

 What is before us now is something that 

blocks our consideration of that or anybody's 

consideration of that. And imagine this is not your 

case; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case, 

that's why I used a death example, and we go through 

exactly the same thing. And then the court does exactly 

the same thing, the State court, that happened here. 

And now what are the words that distinguish whether the 

court is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody

the runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an 

absolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law? 

Which really they should have gone into first and saved 

everybody a lot of trouble.

 MR. PECK: I think the easiest way to look 

at this --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. PECK: -- is imagine that the statute of 

limitations, which now bars any such suit in Oregon, 

were brought today, after this Court's decision in 

Williams, and imagine that Philip Morris is the 

defendant, and at the end of the trial they offer their 

number 34 as it was before saying, "This Court said that 

they had made the right choice in asking for this 

instruction."

 A trial court clearly would engage in 

reversible error if they gave that instruction because 

it materially departs from Oregon law. At the same 

time, they could deny that instruction. They could deny 

that instruction, and the Oregon Supreme Court would not 

violate the mandate of this Court's decision by saying 

that that is a correct decision on the part of the trial 

law court because it was not clear and correct in all 

respects.

 And that is part of what distinguishes this.

This is still a rule that has to apply to its 

instruction --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they say is --

look at the two errors they found. One is in saying 

"may" instead of "shall," and the other is in saying 

"illicit profit" instead of "profit." And they are 

pretty picky. So, this is very picky, they say. And 

not only are they being picky, but they are being picky 

after the event. And they could have raised it first, 

and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of 

these cases is right on point because the subject matter 

is, you know, closer bound up. And so they put all this 

together and say it's an unreasonable application of a 

rule that was there. And you say --

MR. PECK: I would urge you, Justice Breyer, 

to look at the original case in 1916, the Sorenson case. 

There the court was face with a question: If there is 

the kernel of a correct instruction in there, is that 

adequate to ask the court to give that instruction or 

should we insist on what they thought at the time was 

the majority rule in the United States, that we should 

insist on an instruction that is clear and correct in 

all respects, and that the -- that the counsel has the 

responsibility to provide that? And they decided to go 

with the clear and correct rule. That was the debate

that they had, and that debate informs this one.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorenson was the agent and 

the principal, the broker who was selling some land.

 MR. PECK: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I think in that case 

they also said, "By the way, you've got basically the 

instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked" -- no, 

that was the case where they said, "You overlooked in 

your instruction an important allegation of fact," which 

allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a 

broker.

 MR. PECK: And there's a similar distinction 

that makes Osborne irrelevant, which counsel suggested 

was a -- an exemplary here.

 In Osborne, an element of the crime had not 

been instructed upon. That's why there didn't have to 

be the offer of an instruction. But the party 

presentation principle puts the onus on counsel to do 

so, and Philip Morris showed, in 2002, well before this 

Court's decisions that they know how to do it when they 

want to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Peck, are you -- are 

you asserting that our remand order was in error? After 

all, it did say, "We remand this case so that the Oregon 

Supreme Court can apply this standard we have set

that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: We didn't say it was in 

error. I mean, there is nothing wrong with that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PECK: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you say it's in error, 

my next question is going to be --

MR. PECK: I think the Oregon Supreme Court 

read that decision --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- can -- is it up to a 

State court to sit in judgment about whether our remand 

orders are in error or not?

 MR. PECK: Well, I'm prepared to say that 

the Oregon Supreme Court took that remand order to mean 

that they had to have in place -- this was a procedural 

due process decision -- that they had to have a 

procedure that was fair, outcome neutral, applied --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's what they took it 

to mean, they were just wrong. I mean, that's not what 

it says.

 MR. PECK: Well, if you look --

Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional

it goes to the constitutional issue we are talking 

about.

 MR. PECK: When considering --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "We remand so that the 

Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set 

forth," which has nothing to do with the issue we have 

been discussing this morning.

 MR. PECK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it was wrong?

 MR. PECK: No, it was not wrong. I don't 

think it was wrong, and here's the reason I don't think 

it was wrong: You corrected the Oregon Supreme Court 

when that thought that due process does not inform the 

analysis on harm to non-parties. You corrected that 

substantive error, and that part is what they got wrong.

 Much of this opinion said that they got lots 

of other things right. And so Oregon looked at it and 

said, "Okay, we got that issue wrong, but there are 

other problems with this instruction that are adequate 

and independent grounds for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's very nice, but 

that's not what we remanded for.

when this Court decides a constitutional issue of one 

part, it doesn't necessarily tell the court anything 

different. What -- the essence of this Court's opinion 

is that where there's a significant risk of jury 

confusion, the State has to provide a procedure and has 

flexibility in providing that procedure. There is no 

indication that the procedure for limiting instructions 

does not satisfy that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I think we 

all have is how do we guard, in effect, guard against 

making constitutional decisions which are simply going 

to be nullified by some clever device raising a 

procedural issue or an issue of State law when the case 

goes back? Is there any way for us to ensure against, 

in effect, a bad faith response to our decision except 

by purporting to require the State courts to follow a 

certain order of battle in the decision of issues before 

them so that when the case gets to us, we can be assured 

that there is no lurking issue that has not yet been 

decided as a matter of State law that in effect could 

then be resurrected to nullify our decision? Is there 

any way to guard against that except by telling the 

State courts what the sequence is in which they have to 

make decisions?

believe that it would be error to suggest to the State 

supreme court that they must, even though prudent, 

follow a specific sequence, simply because that would 

mean that they would have to necessarily decide every 

State law issue in the case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I see the problem. I 

mean, that's why I raised the question, how can we 

ensure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we do that all the 

time in cause and prejudice cases. We do it all the 

time --

MR. PECK: Yes.

importance of the constitutional right.

 MR. PECK: I understand that, but I think 

the adequate and independent State law ground provides 

all the protection. You assume, and I think properly 

so, that State supreme courts will operate in good 

faith. Even in Flowers, after the fourth trip to the 

U.S. Supreme Court, were -- Alabama Supreme Court was 

still trusted to apply the decision.

 MR. PECK: Well, by -- by accepting that if 

the rule that has been imposed was invoked properly by 

the party that invoked it at the right time --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. PECK: -- that it IS firmly established 

and regularly followed, then it should satisfy the 

Court --

nothing the plaintiff's counsel has done below, nothing

they call the "correct in all respects" rule.

respects" rule and submitted that rule -- if she had 

said, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper, 

everything would have been the same.

another one, that it would be different. And the fact

Supreme Court from my list of -- of participants who 

would have done something differently.

 MR. PECK: But -- but -- but the fact of the 

matter is, if after closing arguments which was the 

trigger that Philip Morris urged upon this Court for 

needing this substantive rule, if after -- if after that 

Philip Morris's counsel had returned to the judge -- you 

know, they said a few things that we think would tell 

the jury to punish for harm to others. We don't think 

the instruction is adequate. We will give you the same 

instruction, that one-sentence instruction like we gave 

in Fink v. Schwarz. I believe the court would have 

given that instruction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is, of course, 

another way to protect our constitutional authority in 

this case. We are talking about procedures for 

addressing the substantive due-process challenge to 

a punitive damages award. That is the second question 

presented here.

 If we went and granted that question and 

considered that issue, we would have protected our 

authority to reach that question despite the procedural 

objections alone. Why don't we just do that?

 MR. PECK: Well, Your Honor, of course, the

some argument on that. And I -- I believe that we are 

prepared to stand on that briefing and argument.

 We do not believe the Due Process Clause is 

an exercise in elementary school mathematics. It does 

not tell you something about this. Here you have to 

look at the enormity of the misconduct. And that did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not asking you 

to argue here today the second question presented.

 MR. PECK: I understand.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we have some 

concern, if there is something malodorous about the fact 

that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last 

minute to come up with this rule that was before it all 

the time, which was a State court rule that you would 

expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of 

course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to 

address what we do in a situation, having to 

characterize the nature of that -- that consideration, 

simply by saying: Look, we are going to go ahead with 

the questions presented. We can decide it in this case; 

and to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and 

do it.

 MR. PECK: Well, it's -- it's certainly 

within this Court's power to do that. Philip Morris had 

made a very harsh accusation in this case of bad faith

on the part of the Oregon Supreme Court. There was no 

sandbagging here. The Oregon court did not act in that 

way.

 Mrs. Williams raised the State-law issues at 

every opportunity, which is something that Philip Morris 

denied in their petition but then conceded in their 

merit brief. And the fact is it was before the Oregon 

Court of Appeals. It was before the Oregon Supreme 

Court, and we even raised it before this court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- in answer to the 

Chief Justice, you are not suggesting that we should go 

ahead and decide the second question when there has been 

no briefing on it?

 MR. PECK: I am not suggesting that you 

decide the question, but I recognize the Court has the 

power to do so. Mapp v. Ohio came to this Court as a 

First Amendment case and came out as a Fourth Amendment 

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I thought --

Mr. Peck, I thought you just told me that there has been 

full and adequate briefing on that question.

 MR. PECK: I believe we had full and

to fully argue the case, and it's up for you to decide 

whether or not you -- you have enough on that.

I thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Shapiro, you have three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Justice Breyer asked about these various cases from 

Oregon, whether they provided guidance and a warning 

here. And counsel referred to three cases, Reeve, 

Owings and then Sorenson. If you look at those cases, 

you will see there were simple instructions proposed on 

a single topic that were infected with an error 

throughout.

 And the court said if there is any valid 

proportion of this instruction, it was covered by 

something that was said to the jury already. So there 

was no harm in not giving that instruction.

 That is certainly not our case. We have a 

separately numbered paragraph dealing with the 

Constitution, which is quite apart from the statutory 

factors.

 Now, counsel referred to the charge actually 

given by the court as if it provided some protection 

against punishment for harm to nonparties. If you read 

that instruction, far from providing the protection that

the -- this Court said was obligatory, it invited global 

punishment. It told the jury they could return any 

punitive-damage award up to one hundred million dollars. 

Lo and behold, they come up with eighty million dollars, 

right within the suggested range of this charge. And 

there was no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which portion of the 

charge specifically are you referring to?

 MR. SHAPIRO: This is page 37a of our joint 

appendix. The -- the court concludes the amount of 

punitive damages you assess may not exceed the sum of 

one hundred million dollars. And that, of course, was 

the zone of reasonableness that the jury inferred from 

this, suggesting a global punishment to the jury with no 

protection.

 Now this Court said that that protection has 

to be provided. The Court said the State must insist, 

that the State must give assurance, and it's an 

important constitutional right, as Justice Kennedy said. 

I don't think the State court --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is your response to 

the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should 

reach the issue of due process on the amount?

 MR. SHAPIRO: We wouldn't oppose that 

because this is clearly excessive under what the Court

said in State Farm: Where there is substantial 

compensatory damages, one to one is something of a norm.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wasn't asking to 

you argue it, either but I mean I suppose the procedure 

the parties would prefer, if we were interested in that, 

would be for us to grant the second question and then 

have the normal briefing in consideration.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, that -- that -- yes, 

certainly, that -- that -- that is true. I -- I would 

comment, too, on Justice Breyer's question about what is 

the ultimate test here.

 The Court has stated various criteria and 

opinions over the last century, but the -- the key ideas 

are? Was it an ambush, something that couldn't be 

anticipated?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean I will tell you my 

subjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they 

are not quite in point, but they really take away the 

idea of the bad faith, particularly because the first 

time what the judge said, which I didn't understand its 

significance then, but the judge said: Well, since the 

first part of that paragraph was in -- was in error 

anyway, I don't have to reach the question of whether 

there were other mistakes under State law in the rest of 

the instruction. They did say that the first time, I

think.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, but this is the first 

time the Court has ever taken this "correct in all 

respects" rule and extended it to a completely different 

topic, U.S. constitutional law in a separately numbered 

paragraph. And we had no notice that this had to be 

broken out on a separate piece of paper. If we did, we 

would have broken it out on a separate piece of paper. 

It's just like Lee against Kemna where the Court said --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about this point 

that was made that in 2002 that is exactly what Philip 

Morris did, give one simple, precise instruction?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, no, that instruction was 

not harm to nonparties. That was harm for out-of-State 

injuries. It was a different issue. And it's true the 

lawyers there did break up their instructions 

differently, but the pattern instruction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it true that 

they gave one simple sentence stating their position on 

-- on what harm to others, how that --

MR. SHAPIRO: No. That's not true. That 

case did not accept our instruction. It did not. It 

accepted the State Farm instruction, which said that 

there can't be punishment for out-of-State harm.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but was the

instruction stated in a -- in a single paragraph, but 

all the other requests to charge were broken out?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. This -- this State Farm 

instruction was broken out. That's an option for 

lawyers. But under the pattern instruction, it's quite 

proper to put them all in one instructional basket. 

That's what the form instructions said, and that's what 

both parties here did.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 MR. SHAPIRO: We thank the Court.
