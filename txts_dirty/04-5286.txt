 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 

next in No. 04-5286, Michael Dodd v. United States. 

Ms. Bergmann.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BERGMANN: Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Court today is presented with two strikingly 

different interpretations of when the 1-year period of 

limitation found in paragraph 6(3) of 28 U.S.C., section 

2255 begins to run. 

If paragraph 6(3) is read in a manner that is 

consistent with both Congress' use of verb tense and this 

Court's decision in Tyler v. Cain, then the Government's 

interpretation of when the 1-year period begins to run is 

absurd because it reduces paragraph 6(3) to a near 

nullity. This is so because, as even the Government 

admits, retroactivity decisions almost always come more 

than a year after a decision of this Court initially 

recognizing a right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When you say it's a 

nullity, what you really mean is it allows for very --

very little relief.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. Very 

few cases would -- would have a retroactivity decision 

within a year of initial recognition. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And why is that an 

argument in your favor? 

MS. BERGMANN: The -- it would -- the argument 

is in my favor, Your Honor, because this Court should not 

read acts of Congress in a manner that would render them 

absurd.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, to say that it 

doesn't grant as much relief as it might have doesn't 

render the statute absurd.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, in -- in this case, Your 

Honor, it does in two ways. It does because the relief 

that it would allow has only occurred, in my estimation, 

once in the post-Teague world since 1989 when Teague v. 

Lane was decided, and the only other instance would be 

when this Court would find a right is both -- initially 

recognize a right and find that right retroactive in the 

same case, which in my understanding --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, we've had very few 

instances in recent years I think where this Court has 

found some right to be retroactive.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it just doesn't happen

very often to begin with.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it would be further 

limited if the Government's position is adopted here.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. It 

would basically be --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it doesn't happen 

anyway --

MS. BERGMANN: It -- it does not --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- very often. 

MS. BERGMANN: It does not happen very often, 

Your Honor, but there have been several instances. The 

situation in Bousley where the Court found that the rights 

in Bailey applied retroactively. I think most people 

would consider the Court's recent decision in Atkins v. 

Virginia would apply retroactively in light of this 

Court's earlier decision in Penry v. Lynaugh. So it does, 

indeed, happen and because it happens and because the 

rights involved in those types cases are so important --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How -- how do we read this 

statute concerning what court may find the retroactivity? 

It's not limited, I assume, under either your view or the 

Government's to a finding by this Court, a determination 

that it's retroactive.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's -- that's correct, Your

Honor. The parties agree that a lower court can make the 

retroactivity decision as well, and that's because of --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it could be a court in 

another circuit presumably if you're in the Federal 

system. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, I would argue 

that it would have to be a court in the -- in the circuit 

in which the prisoner would be filing the 2255 motion 

because that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why?

 MS. BERGMANN: Because that court would have 

jurisdiction over the proceedings in his case and it would 

be an adequate way of providing notice to that litigant. 

It -- a decision of another --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess a litigant can 

read decisions from other courts, as a lawyer can.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor, but 

they would have no precedential effect in his case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why shouldn't the 

litigant be put on notice by a district court decision? 

Let's assume it's in his own circuit.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, a district 

court decision would have no precedential value with 

respect to -- would not bind other district courts in that

district and therefore not bind other litigants. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there's -- there's just 

nothing in the statute that says what level court it has 

to be.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, actually, Your Honor, the 

statute does say that the ruling would have to be made 

retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. 

It does not say a case. And a decision of a district 

court would make that retroactivity applicable only to one 

case not to cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but that may be 

just a generic use of the term cases. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, it could be, Your Honor, 

but I -- Congress included the language. I think this 

Court could give meaning to it by interpreting the statute 

to mean that you would be looking at a decision of the 

court of appeals rather than a decision from a district 

court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if -- if you said a 

district court, one district judge could -- could trigger 

the thing for the whole country. That --

MS. BERGMANN: It would be very complicated, 

Your Honor, given the fact that district courts often 

issue rulings in unpublished decisions as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So look at the trouble we get 

into when we take your interpretation. Suppose we take 

the Government's interpretation and think only of first 

habeas. Leave second habeas out of it for a moment. But 

if it were only first habeas and those were all the 

habeases in the world, wouldn't theirs be better? Every 

prisoner would know that when you get the right, you file. 

Okay, no problem. And you're going to win if, and only 

if, you get a court to say it was retroactive. So that's 

fine. We all know. All the prisoners know we've got to 

file within a year. It would cause no problem if there 

were only first habeases.

 MS. BERGMANN: If there were only first habeas, 

Your Honor, and if the lower courts always made the 

correct retroactivity --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. They sometimes don't, but 

then if they don't, you appeal, just like anything else. 

And you might lose and you might not get your case taken 

in the Supreme Court. That's always true for every 

litigant.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so that's a problem.

 Is there any other problem? 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, there is also a

problem which the Government actually concedes --

JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MS. BERGMANN: -- which is if you read the 

statutory language of the second clause as being stated in 

the past tense, and the initial -- and the statute of 

limitations begins to run with initial recognition, it --

it doesn't respect Congress' intent to provide a 1-year 

limitation period. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's -- that's 

linguistic. I'm -- I'm looking for practical problems for 

prisoners, which was your initial argument. And in 

respect to a practical problem for a prisoner, I couldn't 

think of one, and that's why I'm asking. In respect to 

first habeases.

 MS. BERGMANN: With respect to first habeases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 Then if your only problem is second habeas, 

there I'd agree with you. There's a big problem. But it 

says here the date on which the right asserted was 

initially recognized. Now, I guess a person who's filed a 

habeas doesn't have a right until the Supreme Court has 

made the -- the rule retroactive. And therefore, until 

the Supreme Court makes it retroactive, there was no right 

recognized for a second habeas person. And therefore, for 

that case it does begin to run when the Supreme Court says

it's retroactive because prior to that he had no right --

MS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- given -- given paragraph 8.

 MS. BERGMANN: The -- the same would be true 

though, Your Honor, then for initial motions that there 

would be no right available unless a court at some point 

had held the right applied retroactively to collateral 

cases because under Teague v. Lane, there is no right to 

collateral relief simply based on the decision of this 

Court unless that decision has also been held 

retroactively applicable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's all -- the word 

right in (3) quite plainly doesn't cover the last six 

words of the -- of the sentence. Well, whether the word 

right -- I'm trying to fix it up. I'm trying to figure 

out --

MS. BERGMANN: Yes, I understand that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- how do we get to that 

conclusion. 

Now, it seems to me what you've done is say 

either use my ad hoc mechanism, or let there be chaos, or 

we take your approach which produces the kind of chaos 

we've just been discussing. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, I agree with --

that -- that this is not the best drafted statute that

Congress has ever come up with, but I think that 

respecting Congress' use of verb tense and this Court's 

decision in Tyler v. Cain, to read paragraph 8(2) and 

paragraph 6(3) together, that -- that it's important that 

all three of the prerequisites in the statute have been 

met before the limitation period begins to run. 

Otherwise --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why is that important, 

given what this petitioner did himself? He didn't wait 

for there to be a retroactivity decision to file the 2255 

motion. He filed the 2255 motion before the Ross case was 

decided. Isn't that right?

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So perfectly -- the -- the 

prisoner is perfectly able to file the 2255 motion after 

the first clause is satisfied, the date on which the right 

asserted was initially recognized. This movant was too 

late, if you measured the year from that right but he 

wasn't -- he wasn't waiting for any retroactivity 

decision. He filed before the retroactivity case.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. He 

was early under our interpretation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So on your view of it, his 

complaint, when it was filed, should have been dismissed 

as not ripe because he didn't have the final element --

 MS. BERGMANN: That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that is, the 

retroactivity?

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. At 

the time he filed, there had not been a retroactivity 

decision on which he could rely. During the course of 

litigation in the district court, the Eleventh Circuit 

decided the Ross case, and at that point, his right to 

relief became ripe and the -- and he then had a window 

open under paragraph 6(3), such as he could file timely. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Of course, if we're -- if -- if 

admittedly, as Justice Breyer said, we're trying to figure 

out some way to make this work in circumstances in which 

it's -- it's never going to work smoothly, I suppose one 

answer would be to take the Government's position and say 

you've -- your -- your year runs from the moment the right 

is recognized, but to the -- to the extent that there is a 

retroactivity question, a -- a court should simply stay 

the proceeding, hold it in abeyance to see whether, 

particularly in -- in second habeas where you have the --

the second petition where you have the problem, to see 

whether some court will, in fact, recognize retroactivity 

or whether the -- your circuit will recognize 

retroactivity. Then if it does, then you can go forward. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, the problem with that, Your

Honor, is that it -- it encourages, as the Government's 

rule in general does -- encourages numerous frivolous 

filings. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there's no question there's 

a Rube Goldberg character of the whole thing, I -- I 

realize. But -- but that would be a way of -- of solving 

the second habeas problem and still accepting the 

Government's position on the -- on the date at which the 

-- the 1 year for filing starts.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, a procedure that the 

Seventh Circuit has adopted -- and the Seventh Circuit 

agrees with -- with Mr. Dodd's interpretation of the 

statute that it begins to run with the retroactivity 

decision. Their solution for these premature filings is 

to review the case on the merits, and if they feel that 

the motion would lose on the merits, they dismiss it with 

prejudice, and if they feel there's some viable claim 

being stated, then they dismiss it without prejudice to 

refiling at a later time. That's --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would -- it would 

potentially violate the 1-year limit. That won't 

necessarily work. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Crazy. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, it's a very odd

statute.

 MS. BERGMANN: Yes, it is, Your Honor. It's 

very odd. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't know who's 

responsible for writing this, do you? 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BERGMANN: Actually my understanding is that 

much of it was written by the Attorney General in 

California at the time. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- do you understand the 

-- the difference between what is a right initially 

recognized and then what is a right newly recognized? The 

statute is supposed to have three requirements: initially 

recognized, newly recognized, and made retroactive.

 MS. BERGMANN: Yes, Your Honor. My 

understanding of when a right is newly recognized is -- is 

when it is new in the sense that this Court has adopted 

under Teague v. Lane, that it's not dictated by prior 

precedent. A right can be initially recognized by this 

Court but not new in the Teague sense. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Actually Justice Souter's 

approach might work here because you -- you -- all the 

second habeases file immediately. Now, the Seventh 

Circuit, you say, well, gets to those second habeases 

right away, and it says dismissed. Very well. When they

say dismissed, then they ask for cert. And when they ask 

for cert, we take or we don't. If we don't, then they're 

out of luck. And if we take it, people would hold all the 

other cases waiting to see what we decide. So they 

wouldn't lose out in any case where we really were going 

to make it collaterally -- applicable on collateral 

review. 

MS. BERGMANN: But then, Your Honor, you run up 

against your decision in Tyler v. Cain, and that was the 

circumstance of the litigant in Tyler v. Cain. No -- this 

Court had not previously determined that the right at 

issue in Tyler v. Cain was retroactively applicable, and 

under the second or successive statute that -- in the way 

the Court read this, the Court said that this Court could 

not determine the retroactivity of, I believe it was, Cage 

v. Louisiana in that very case because it was contrary to

the language in the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm sure my dissent was 

correct in that case, but the --

(Laughter.) 

MS. BERGMANN: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- still -- it still 

would work because the first case has come down. Okay? 

The first case has come down. Now all the prisoners read 

about these cases, and even if they've already filed a

habeas, they go file another. And the Seventh Circuit, 

you say, then looks at that first one that they get to, 

and they say, dismissed. 

Oh, you're saying that then he comes he here and 

we say the reason you lose is not because you're wrong. 

The reason you lose is because you're not yet ripe.

 MS. BERGMANN: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor. 

What Congress appears to have intended in this -- in this 

statute, as -- as much as anyone can tell, is that 

retroactivity decisions be -- be litigated in cases that 

are brought under paragraph 6(1) which is those cases that 

are within a -- a year of when the judgment of conviction 

became final. That's exactly what happened here.

 And the Ross case that litigated the question of 

the retroactivity of Richardson, that was a case brought 

under paragraph 6(1). Mr. Ross was within a year of when 

his judgment of conviction became final, and -- and the 

issue of retroactivity was -- was litigated straight and 

up in that case.

 And what it appears that Congress intended was 

that very circumstance to happen in all cases, that the 

retroactivity of decisions of this Court be litigated in 

cases brought within a year of finality, and then once 

those decisions were made, then litigants under paragraph 

6(3) would have the opportunity to file when a court of

appeals issued a retroactivity ruling. And then litigants 

under paragraph 8(2) would have a -- the ability to 

file --

JUSTICE BREYER: But we -- we still might be 

able to deal with it. That person files his petition for 

cert. He puts in the petition there are 4,000 prisoners 

who are trying to file second habeases, and if you decide 

retroactivity, collateral, all of them but me will be able 

to proceed. But you have to have enough sense, Supreme 

Court, to take my case to decide if you're going to decide 

retroactivity, that it is and give me the benefit of the 

decision. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, then, Your Honor, I guess 

the Court would have to -- to totally reconsider its 

decision in Tyler v. Cain to reach that conclusion. And I 

don't know what to say. I mean, since Tyler v. Cain was 

enacted for -- I'm sorry -- decided 4 years ago, Congress 

has made no effort to overturn that decision, and it 

appears Congress believed that the Court had -- had read 

the statute correctly in that case. And so if you 

interpret the made retroactivity -- made retroactively 

applicable language in paragraph 6(3) in the way that this 

Court read the language in paragraph 8(2), such that the 

retroactivity decision has to be made before a motion can 

be filed, it becomes very complicated to do that if the

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The problem with your 

argument, Ms. Bergmann, seems to be addressed to the idea 

that Congress intended to sweep quite broadly here. But I 

don't think that's the necessary inference at all. We're 

dealing with a situation, as Justice O'Connor points out, 

where we have very rarely held that a decision is 

retroactive. So it's already a very small class of cases, 

and the Government's view makes it an even smaller class 

of cases. But that doesn't mean the statute doesn't work. 

It just means it doesn't work for a lot of people who are 

excluded from it.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, Your Honor, I -- I agree 

that this involves a very small class of cases. The 

problem with the Government's reading is that they say 

that they are narrowly constricting the statute, but the 

procedural mechanism that they set up allows for a vast 

number of cases that would never fall within the statute 

of limitations to be filed and requires the court to deal 

with each and every one of those cases in the first 

instance. 

Whereas, my reading of statute has the benefit 

of allowing a -- a test case to proceed. Given the fact 

that there are very few number of these rights that are 

made retroactively applicable, it -- it makes more sense

in terms of judicial resources to allow there to be this 

situation where is -- there is a test case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But on your theory, there 

wouldn't be much in the way of resources because you say 

there's no ripe claim until the retroactivity decision 

comes down. Why wouldn't a district judge, faced with 

this dilemma, simply say, well, I'll just hold this 

complaint until the -- the court of appeals or the Supreme 

Court rules on retroactivity?

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, certainly the district 

courts would do that. The more appropriate course of 

action would probably be to find the motion at that point 

untimely because it does not fall within any of the -- it 

-- if it is outside the initial year from finality but 

doesn't fall within any of the other exceptions stated in 

paragraph 6, then it -- it would be untimely and the court 

could dismiss it as such.

 I mean, by doing so, if the court dismisses it, 

it could well count as a first motion so that any motion 

filed thereafter would be a second or successive motion. 

And this would be -- preclude litigants from filing 

prematurely and burdening the courts with premature 

filings until it is clear they have a cause of action. 

I mean, what's strange about the Government's 

reading of the statute is that they believe Congress

intended for a limitations period to begin to run before 

the litigant had any right to relief. No one has a right 

to relief in the collateral proceeding until the right at 

issue has been made retroactively applicable to collateral 

cases. And so that this kind of disjoinder of the statute 

of limitations and the cause of action creates this 

problem where people will be -- feel compelled to file 

protective motions. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? The 

words, made retroactively applicable to cases on 

collateral review, don't have a modifier such as telling 

us by whom it's made retroactive. Has any court 

considered what seems to me a fairly normal reading that 

the -- the words, by the Supreme Court, should apply to 

that phrase as well as the preceding language? 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, actually, Your Honor, every 

lower court to consider the language has found that the 

retroactivity decision need not be made by this Court, and 

the reason for that is the difference between the language 

in paragraph 6(3) and in the second or successive 

provision in paragraph 8(2). In paragraph 8(2), it 

explicitly states that it has to be made retroactive to 

cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that cuts in 

the other direction, that when Congress thought about the

entity that makes it retroactive, they thought about us. 

And that's why -- and that's the only language that seems 

to fit. I mean, the by the Supreme Court seems to fit 

that concept.

 MS. BERGMANN: If -- if you apply --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I guess nobody has come up 

with this suggestion other than this question. 

MS. BERGMANN: Well, various lower courts have 

considered that possibility and have latched onto the 

different -- differences in language where paragraph 8(2) 

explicitly states it has to be made by the Supreme Court, 

but paragraph 6(3) says it does not. And -- and the court 

below said the same thing, and the parties agree that the 

retroactivity decision need not be made by this Court.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we disagree and 

think it should be, I guess that would open a door down 

the road for people after this Court made such a 

determination. 

MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. It 

would make paragraph 6(3) much more consistent with 

paragraph 8(2), if -- if the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. 

MS. BERGMANN: But again, it would work only if 

the 1-year period began to run from this Court's 

retroactivity decision. If it begins to run from initial

recognition, then that would turn paragraph 6(3) into an 

absolute nullity because I know of no case where this 

Court has made a retroactivity decision within a year of 

when it initially recognizes a right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that fits the language, 

the date on which the right was initially recognized by 

the Supreme Court if and only if it's been made 

retroactively by the Supreme Court. It seems to me a very 

normal reading of the language. But nobody else agrees 

with it.

 MS. BERGMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that no one else 

has -- has agreed with thus far.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but there -- it's -- I'm 

now taken with this. I'm jumping from one thing to 

another here. But that does get rid of the problems that 

were initially plaguing your position because it's precise 

and definite. And it also gets rid of whatever problems 

were produced by Tyler because a person could easily get 

to the Supreme Court in that rare case without his 

petition, if it's a first petition, being improperly filed 

because he's not bound by paragraph 8.

 MS. BERGMANN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So it's a first position. So 

all that he does is he files a petition. He can file it 

before any court -- nothing says he can't file it before a

court has decided it's retroactive. He files the 

petition. He seeks cert here. He gets us to say it's 

retroactive in that rare instance, and everyone else has a 

year from that moment. 

And as far as the -- the second people are 

concerned, they don't -- the second petition people don't 

have to file it until a year from that moment, and they 

have a good claim under paragraph 8. There's quite a lot 

-- now -- now, I'm jumping to that because it sounds like 

it might be good. 

MS. BERGMANN: I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. I 

think you may have lost me. You would have the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, don't worry about it.

 (Laughter.) 

MS. BERGMANN: Okay. If the Court has no other 

questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It was very --

MR. FELDMAN: Our basic position is --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, to -- to interpret as 

meaning only this Court could make the retroactivity 

determination and the 1 year wouldn't run until and unless 

there was a new rule and subsequently in whatever case 

this Court said it was retroactive.

 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I have two comments about 

that. That was a position which actually a footnote in 

our brief in Tyler against Cain I think suggested, 

although that wasn't the issue before the Court in that 

case. But since that time, this has been litigated in a 

number of courts of appeals and district courts, and as 

far as I'm aware, no court has accepted that. And the 

reason they haven't --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's true, but I 

assume it is, nonetheless, open for us to do so --

MR. FELDMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- if we thought it was 

correct. What is your view? 

MR. FELDMAN: It would be, but I think we came 

to the conclusion that it probably wasn't because the 

words, by the Supreme Court, are not only present in two 

different places right in this paragraph 6(3), also in 

8(2), also in 2244 and in 22 -- I think -- 64. And it

does seem to be a pattern that where the Congress expected 

a decision by this Court in the whole series of statutes, 

they said, by the Supreme Court. And it's notably missing 

from the phrase that says, made retroactive to cases on 

collateral review. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is noticeably missing 

because it -- it has a blank there and the words, by the 

Supreme Court, are the only time limitation in that whole 

provision after the word if.

 MR. FELDMAN: It -- that -- it -- what it says 

-- it says newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made 

retroactive. It doesn't say by the Supreme Court. That's 

the rationale the courts have used.

 But if I could move to the --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if you don't -- aren't -- I 

mean, the language is open, and it's sort of like the 

virtue of this -- suddenly it's like tinkers to Everest 

chance. I mean, it seems to put everything together. 

What was worrying you most about their position was it 

produced uncertainty, a kind of a mess. You don't know 

which court you're talking about. People would be filing 

things all over the place. They'll be waiting. That --

it's a mess. 

This stops that. What's worrying them is that 

the second habeas person, given Tyler, could never file,

not even in that -- you know, not even in that -- in that 

really unusual situation where we're going to make it a 

collateral review. And now, what this does is it produces 

the certainty, the definiteness of when your time clock 

begins to tick, and it eliminates all the uncertainty, et 

cetera, and confusion, difficulty from their position.

 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I think the other -- the 

other problem that I actually am -- that I think the Court 

should be worried about is that this statute sets one --

it doesn't say anything about the date on which something 

is made retroactive. It says it runs from the later of 

four dates and it then sets forth what those dates are. 

And it says, the date on which the right asserted was 

initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if certain 

conditions are satisfied. 

Now, that if clause may well raise some -- it 

does raise, I think, some interpretative issues. But 

however you interpret the if clause, that just tells you 

whether the petitioner can use that date on which the 

right was initially recognized or not. If he can't use 

it, if the if clause is not satisfied, then he's -- he 

only has to show he's timely under one of the other three 

provisions. The normal one is 1 year from the date that 

the conviction became final. 

And I think our primary submission in the case

is however you construe the if clause, it can't possibly 

be read to -- whatever interpretative problems there are 

there, it can't be possibly be read to alter the totally 

plain language that Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, it could because you 

could say what the Congress intended to say. If the right 

had X, Y, and Z, it shall in that event run from that 

date. 

MR. FELDMAN: Right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's implicit in it.

 MR. FELDMAN: And it's not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just like the words, by the 

Supreme Court --

MR. FELDMAN: It's not -- it's not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would be implicit.

 MR. FELDMAN: -- it doesn't. But even then, 

it's not -- it doesn't run from that date, and the -- he's 

-- and the -- the petitioner has the -- the applicant has 

no date on -- if he's past his 1 year from the date the 

conviction became final, he has no date on which he can 

rely to make his application timely. 

And our primary submission --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, on Justice Stevens' 

analysis, he does not have a date until the retroactivity 

decision is made, and he has to sit there and wait. But

when the retroactivity decision is made, he's got his 

date.

 MR. FELDMAN: But this statute doesn't -- it's 

not worded the way the -- the -- paragraph 6 as a whole 

says you have the later of four dates. It names four 

different things. But subparagraph (3) doesn't say, well, 

the later of any of these things. It -- it tells you if 

the condition is satisfied then you -- the question is --

okay, the if condition is satisfied. I can use paragraph 

(3). What's my time limit? And it says the date on which 

-- 1 year from the date on which the right was initially 

recognized by the Supreme Court, and that's the date he 

has. If the -- if -- if it turns out that he can't use it 

because the appropriate thing doesn't happen till later, 

then he just can't use that date. He has three other 

possible dates to use under paragraph (6) --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I follow your linguistic 

-- Justice Stevens follows the linguistic analysis. I 

think the question that he's raising, the question I'm 

raising is, do we have a good reason here to doubt that 

the linguistic analysis is getting us to -- to what 

Congress would have intended? 

The proposed good reason or the best reason I 

think is that if we read it your way, then as Justice 

Breyer said in Tyler, as a practical matter, second habeas

is -- is -- a second habeas petitioner is -- is almost 

never going to -- or probably, in fact, never will get the 

benefit of the new rule. Well, maybe one answer to that 

is, so what. 

The reason that cannot be dismissed, I think, 

that way is this. As has been pointed out here, we do not 

under our rules often make a new rule retroactive, but 

when we do under the conditions which we impose for that, 

it's -- it's one humdinger of a rule. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And it is -- it is unlikely --

or at least there's a good argument that it's unlikely --

that Congress would have wanted to exclude all the 

potential second habeas people from it, particularly 

because they're second habeas people because they got in 

in time on first habeas. They played by the rules, and on 

your theory basically they're out of the game on a very 

important rule. So that's the argument for saying that 

your linguistic analysis may not be pointing to what 

Congress intended. 

MR. FELDMAN: Well, I -- I disagree with that. 

First, on second habeas, the -- this Court, I think all 

three opinions, in Tyler against Cain recognized that 

there can be cases where this Court recognizes a new right 

and it is retroactive at the same time where it's the

combination of some earlier decision that said all rules 

of a certain type are retroactive and then in the 

second --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that is --

MR. FELDMAN: -- the Court said we are 

recognizing a rule of that type. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That is a highly exceptional 

case, and the problem with that is -- I mean, if -- if 

we're going to -- if you're going to be linguistic about 

it, you'd have to say, well, that really is not very sound 

reasoning because that is not a holding because the -- you 

-- you've got not merely to have recognized it under the 

statute, but you've got to have held it. And that's --

that's pretty unlikely. 

MR. FELDMAN: It -- it says actually made 

retroactive, and I -- all of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I guess we've said you've 

got to do it with --

MR. FELDMAN: -- all three of the opinions in 

Tyler recognized that that sort of thing can happen, and I 

think that that actually is by far the most common kind of 

case because that's likely to be a case where the Court 

has said, for example, where Teague doesn't apply at all 

where the Court has narrowed the scope substantially of a 

Federal criminal statute such as in the Bailey case where

-- where the question was whether it has to be active use 

or mere possession of a firearm. And those kinds of cases 

are very possibly, at least if the Court has made it clear 

that they're narrowing the -- the Court is narrowing the 

conduct that was thought to be criminal in construing a 

criminal statute, those are the kinds of cases that are 

likely to arise most often. In those kinds of cases, that 

is likely to be the kind of the thing the Court was 

talking about in Tyler against Cain. 

With respect to the other class of cases, which 

would -- the only other class of retroactive cases would 

be those that come within the second -- what used to be 

called the second Teague exception for bedrock principles 

that have the primacy or centrality of Gideon against 

Wainwright. Now, the Court has suggested -- it has said 

that it may be doubted that any such rules remain to -- to 

be discovered. But if there were, I think a court of -- a 

case of that level of centrality and primacy and 

importance, I think that this Court and other courts could 

take steps to decide whatever pending section 2255 motions 

they have or whatever ones could be filed by someone who 

still has their 1 year to go from date of finality of 

conviction to decide those quite quickly because that 

would be --

Government ever on its own motion have a defendant retried

 MR. FELDMAN: I -- you know, I -- for instance, 

I don't know what the history was. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think it has. If --

let me ask you this. If -- if a decision says that what 

was a crime, as defined to the jury, is no longer a crime 

-- the conduct was no longer a crime -- I take it Teague 

doesn't necessarily apply to that, but this is still a 

substantive rule that's retroactive. Is that the way it 

works?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think the -- what the Court has 

said and clarified most recently in the Summerlin case 

last year is that those -- Teague doesn't apply. It's not 

an exception to Teague, but Teague doesn't apply because 

those cases are retroactive without going through a 

particular analysis under Teague. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what interest does 

the Government have in holding somebody when the conduct 

for which he was convicted is no longer a crime?

 MR. FELDMAN: The Government doesn't have any 

interest in doing that. And I -- I think if the 

Government --

Government do that if we found a case. What actually 

happens, of course, in real life is there's argument about 

what were -- what -- how was the jury actually instructed. 

Did the jury find the necessary fact? Was it just 

harmless error because this case was tried on a theory 

that made it totally clear that he did commit the crime 

even as narrowed by this Court and those kinds of 

questions arising. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say he's being --

MR. FELDMAN: I can't say how they would work 

themselves out. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say he's being held 

because the Government insists that it's not retroactive 

and the Government is then proven wrong. Would that let 

him qualify under (2) because then the -- the impediment 

to making the motion was the fact that he thought it was 

not retroactive, but then -- and that was Government 

action because that's what you insisted on. But then 

that's removed. So does -- so would -- does entitlement 

under (2) apply?

 MR. FELDMAN: I don't -- I don't think -- I 

don't think so because I would only think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't think this is 

going to work. 

MR. FELDMAN: Yes. I don't think the Government

holding somebody pursuant to a hitherto valid judgment 

would be seen as an impediment to making an -- a motion. 

I think that would be the Government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, but it is 

because he -- it hasn't been found retroactive yet and he 

can't file --

MR. FELDMAN: Well, but the -- the defendant --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- under your view.

 MR. FELDMAN: The fact that the Government is 

holding him doesn't prevent him from file. If the 

Government did actually prevent him from filing something, 

said you -- we're not going to take your mail that you're 

trying to send to the court, I think that's the kind of 

thing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you prevented him from 

filing effectively. I mean --

MR. FELDMAN: I don't think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the petition has to be 

dismissed. 

MR. FELDMAN: I don't think the Government has. 

I think the Government has said, go ahead and file 

whatever you want to file, and if you can obtain relief, 

then you should get it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. FELDMAN: And if the Government itself

concludes that someone should be released, there are 

mechanisms to do that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's probably right. 

MR. FELDMAN: -- the Government could. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The language -- the language is 

on your side, I think there's no doubt. But it's not 

unambiguous. Imagine a prison rule that says that the --

after the prison board, the -- the prisoner has 2 weeks to 

appeal to the warden from the time of the decision of the 

board if the prisoner has been notified. The prisoner 

isn't notified for 3 weeks. I think we'd read that to say 

he has 2 weeks from the time of notification. You -- you 

can use can if in that way. It's not impossible. And 

once I begin to think it could be open, I think, well, 

let's look for the most practical approach. 

MR. FELDMAN: I think under that -- those 

circumstances, there may be circumstances under which 

equitable tolling would be appropriate in a particular 

case. That's the kind of thing that also --

JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you'd say, well the 

language is clear -- clear, but let's go -- let's go on 

equitable tolling. 

MR. FELDMAN: But I don't -- I wouldn't go here 

on equitable tolling. In other words, I think maybe -- I 

don't -- I can't imagine all the possible cases under

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What you're saying is 

the language. 

MR. FELDMAN: But where the event that you're 

relying on for tolling would be an event that is 

anticipated in the statute and would be across the board 

and would really have nothing to do with the particular 

conduct of the petitioner's case, but whether someone else 

has gone and gotten a retroactivity ruling, I think it 

would be unprecedented in those circumstances to just 

rewrite the statute to come to a different date than what 

Congress had set. Congress set the date on which the 

right initially was recognized by this Court. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Dreeben, could I bring you 

back to the -- the issue? I'm sorry. Yes. Can I bring 

you back to the issue of whether the Court that recognizes 

the right has to be the Supreme Court or not? You say 

there are three other instances in which it is specified 

that it be the Supreme Court, and it's not specified here. 

But does any of those other three instances involve 

language like this which -- which has the Supreme Court 

mentioned immediately previously? 

I mean, when I read that the first time, has 

been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made 

retroactively applicable to cases, I mean, I think what it

envisions is the -- the very decision of the Supreme Court 

that newly recognized it made it retroactively applicable. 

Is -- is any of the other ones phrased this way so that 

the word, the Supreme Court, is immediately preceding the 

and made retroactively applicable?

 MR. FELDMAN: You know, I'd -- I'd have to look 

at the -- I can tell you where the statutes are. One is 

8(2), of course, which is right in 2255. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. FELDMAN: The other is in 2244 which I think 

is worded exactly the same as this is. The third is I 

think 2264, which I -- I just would have to look at the 

specific wording of each of those. 

But I think the -- you know, and this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The proximity of the reference 

to the Supreme Court there really --

MR. FELDMAN: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when you read it the first 

time, you think they're talking about the Supreme Court. 

MR. FELDMAN: You could also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Has been newly recognized by 

the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable. 

MR. FELDMAN: You could also -- you -- you 

could, but you -- and we did take that position in Tyler. 

You could also read it, though, the -- the presence of the

word Supreme Court right before and the absence of the 

words, the Supreme Court, here and the presence of the 

Supreme Court in the first one -- you could certainly draw 

the inference that this was not something -- this part of 

it didn't have to be made by the Supreme Court. And 

perhaps Congress was recognizing that it -- it does take 

this Court a longer time to reach a retroactivity decision 

than it would take the lower courts hearing cases. 

Once --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there anything in any of 

these statutes or legislative history or any -- anyplace 

else where Congress ever thought of the possibility that 

some other court might make a new rule retroactive?

 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think there's any 

statement one way or another, but I do think there are 

holdings. There are holdings as -- as the petitioner 

relies on by the Eleventh --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I think the other reading is 

-- the assumption was -- and I think it's incorrect --

that we would simultaneously identify the new right and 

decide it is or is not retroactive. That was the 

assumption I think. 

MR. FELDMAN: I -- I just -- I think that would 

be unlikely because this Court's practice has certainly 

not since Teague and even going decades before Teague --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I realize it's wrong, but 

I think that's probably the assumption Congress made. 

That's what I'm suggesting. 

MR. FELDMAN: I -- I guess I -- I would just 

think it's unlikely because although this statute has some 

drafting -- it certainly raises some drafting issues, I 

think they likely -- that basic element of this Court's 

retroactivity jurisprudence, which has been true for 

decades, I think likely --

JUSTICE STEVENS: See, the only thing about your 

reading of the statute that troubles me is you're --

you're reading the word only. If it's a 1-year statute, 

but only if Congress -- the Supreme Court has already done 

the next two things. 1 year is the maximum.

 MR. FELDMAN: Just -- I'm reading it has an if. 

If is a condition. If --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There's an only --

MR. FELDMAN: What if does is states a 

condition. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not an if, but if that 

happens, then it shall be --

MR. FELDMAN: Right, because Congress didn't say 

it. If Congress had phrased this the way it phrased the 

-- the 6(3) as a whole and said it shall it run from the 

later of three dates, the date that the Supreme Court

holds it -- recognizes the right or the date it holds it 

retroactive, that would have -- that would have been --

JUSTICE STEVENS: See, it really --

MR. FELDMAN: -- that would have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would accomplish your 

objective if you just struck the whole clause after the 

word if. You don't really need that. 

MR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think so. I think 

what the clause does is it makes it clear that in 6(3), 

which is a -- you know, intended to be a narrow exception 

from the -- the rule of finality -- that in 6(3) what 

Congress was doing was saying this is the only class of 

cases that we want this to apply to. And if they had just 

said the date on which the right was initially recognized 

by the Supreme Court, I think there might have been some 

inference that they were not -- they were trying to extend 

that beyond cases that are retroactive under Teague, or 

perhaps someone might have read that and said, you know, 

Teague is no longer applicable. Now Congress has a new 

standard that it's enacted here. 

And I think Congress wanted make clear -- the 

people who drafted this -- that that was not what they 

were trying to do. And by saying made retroactive -- if 

it has been newly recognized and made retroactive to cases 

on collateral review, what they were plainly referring to

was this Court's jurisprudence under Teague so that no one 

would think this deadline is supposed to somehow open the 

door to cases that would otherwise be barred by Teague. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what courts in -- in 

your view have to make the retroactivity finding? The 

district court? The circuit where he's -- which has 

jurisdiction over his case? Any circuit?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think every court that has 

addressed that question has come to the conclusion that it 

can be -- it has to be the circuit with territorial 

jurisdiction over the applicant's case. That's generally 

the jurisdiction of courts of appeals and the area in 

which their rulings are effective. 

It also could be, in our view, the district 

court that's hearing the particular defendant's case 

because that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's not that -- if it 

isn't the district court in that case, then you -- the 

district court has to take this complaint and just freeze 

it until some other -- a higher court rules on it.

 MR. FELDMAN: Yes. I don't see any -- I don't 

think that that would be the appropriate thing to do. I 

think if -- if the view was that this had to -- it 

couldn't be filed until a court with jurisdiction over the 

case had actually held that the right was retroactive,

then I think the correct course for the district court 

would be to dismiss it because it's -- it's not -- it's 

not a timely petition. At the time when it's filed, 

there's -- it's -- we're assuming 1 year past the date 

that the conviction became final, and there's no other 

provision at that point that can render it timely. And at 

that point, the correct course for the district court 

would be just to dismiss it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that if 10 other circuits 

have ruled on this but not his own, there's nothing he can 

do until somebody within the 1-year window files.

 MR. FELDMAN: Our view -- well, that -- that --

if -- if the -- the made retroactive has to occur before 

he files, that would be the consequence. But our view is 

it can be made retroactive in his own case, and therefore, 

anyone can file. They have a 1-year window from the time 

when a new right is recognized, and if in their own case 

it's held to be retroactive, then they were timely and 

they may well get relief depending --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So far as first habe goes.

 MR. FELDMAN: So far as first habeas goes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Second habe, he's out cold.

 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that it's -- I don't 

-- second habeas is definitely a narrower window, and I 

think Congress intended it to be a narrower window. But

for the reasons I said, there are decisions where the 

Court holds -- where this Court recognizes, in effect, the 

retroactivity of a new rule at the same time as it 

announces it, as the Court said in Tyler. And there are 

-- this Court and lower courts can act quickly on these 

kinds of things. If the kind of bedrock principle with 

the primacy and centrality of Gideon against Wainwright 

came up, I think the lower courts would see we have to act 

very quickly on this. 

I -- one point of note is that Richardson 

itself, which the Government doesn't believe is 

retroactive, but that's not before the Court here -- the 

first decision holding Richardson retroactive came down 7 

months after this Court decided Richardson. The second --

and that was where no one was thinking they had to 

particularly rush on that. 

But if this Court were to recognize a new right 

under -- a -- a new right that satisfied the second Teague 

exception, I think it can be expected because it would 

necessarily be -- have a certain primacy and centrality 

and sweep that there would probably be cases pending in 

the courts of appeals, in the district courts raising that 

issue, and I think the courts involved, if they -- this 

Court said, look, this is -- this is the way the thing has 

to be understood in accordance with --

 JUSTICE BREYER: What it would do -- let's take 

a case which I guess we -- Apprendi. I mean, you know, 

Apprendi, a big sort of an issue in the courts. And --

and this would put tremendous pressure on us to decide it 

immediately, wouldn't it? We'd have to say immediately 

whether it was going to be retroactive or not retroactive 

because it's only likely to come along in some major, 

major matter like that, other than the kind Justice 

Kennedy said, which is another kind of problem. 

I mean, I don't see a way, if we take your 

approach, of getting out of this tremendous pressure. 

Maybe it would be a good thing. But I don't think there's 

a way of getting out of it. 

MR. FELDMAN: I think this Court has -- has to 

take cases and plan its docket in accordance with a wide 

variety of considerations and that may be something that 

the Court would want to take into consideration. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you think about 

the -- it seems to me we've tried three approaches, each 

of which try to get us out of this problem of the 

pressure, call it. And we have Justice Stevens' and then 

-- but there were certain problems with Justice Souter's, 

which still I'm not certain might -- then I had started 

with one that I guess the objection to it would be it's 

laughable. But -- but is there -- is there any -- I mean,

you see, it's -- it's reading -- it's reading the word 

right in 6 to encompass all of the paragraph in 8. Is 

there anything -- I mean, it's a pretty good objection 

that really that just goes too far.

 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I --

JUSTICE BREYER: But is there any other 

objection? 

MR. FELDMAN: I think essentially the same one, 

that -- that they use the term right in 6 and they didn't 

intend that term to mean something different, whether it 

was a first habeas or a second habeas. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --

MR. FELDMAN: They were talking about the right 

that was asserted. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question? 

Isn't it true that under some of the other references they 

refer to a constitutional right?

 MR. FELDMAN: That's right. That's another --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Whereas this just refers to a 

right and it includes statutory rights. And, of course, 

the odd thing about that is that normally when we construe 

a statute, we say it always meant that. It's not -- it's 

not a new right in the sense as a right as of the date of 

enactment. 

MR. FELDMAN: But --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the difference between the 

Constitution and statutes sometimes is rather significant.

 MR. FELDMAN: Yes. In paragraph 8(2) only --

only -- it does require a constitutional right. But in --

in 6(3) it refers just to right. But, as I said, that 

would, I think, encompass the class of cases such as 

Bailey where this Court interprets a Federal statute and 

narrows it and makes conduct that was thought to violate 

the statute earlier -- it means that conduct no longer 

violates it. Those kinds of decisions may well under --

if the Court has made those points clear, if that clearly 

is what this Court decided, those cases may well be 

retroactive at the time they're announced under the 

rationale that all the opinions in Tyler against Cain 

accepted. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Feldman, is there any case 

in which the Supreme Court newly recognizes a right in 

which it does not initially recognize the right?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think there's sound -- those 

seem to me to be synonymous and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're -- I 

thought your position was newly recognized means that it 

-- it has to be the kind of a right that would -- would 

overcome our usual bar to -- to, you know, rights that 

existed before.

 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. But I think 

initially recognizing may well be another way of saying 

the same thing. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Every -- every newly recognized 

is an -- is an initially recognized, although every 

initially recognized is not necessarily a newly 

recognized. Is that it?

 MR. FELDMAN: I was actually thinking of it the 

other way around. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The other way around? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FELDMAN: Which -- but that -- that -- where 

this Court has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know who wrote this 

either, do you? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FELDMAN: No, I don't. No, I don't. No, I 

don't. 

But I think the point of the newly -- in fact, 

if you look at -- if you kind of flip it, the point of 

this provision can -- maybe becomes a little bit clearer. 

It's if -- if you start with the if, if the petition is 

based on a right that is newly recognized and made 

retroactive to cases on collateral review, that's the 

class. If that happened --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.

date on which it was initially recognized. In other 

words --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would have been the date 

on which it was newly recognized. 

MR. FELDMAN: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So why couldn't they say, the 

date on which the right asserted was newly recognized by 

the Supreme Court if it has been made retroactively 

applicable? Wouldn't that have been a more --

MR. FELDMAN: That -- that would have been 

better. I would definitely agree with that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about -- I think the 

principal argument that Ms. Bergmann made was your reading 

means people -- you're encouraging filings that inevitably 

will be thrown out because the right will be made 

retroactive?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think I just have a couple of 

answers to that. One is that when Congress enacts a 

statute of limitations, any statute of limitations has the 

effect of pushing people into court who might otherwise 

like to wait. And that was a predictable result that 

Congress would have surely known when it enacted this.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the other -- the other 

way avoids loading the district court with filings that 

are futile. 

MR. FELDMAN: But -- and which -- many of which 

may be quite easy to -- to dismiss.

 But I would say Ms. Bergmann's reading has a 

kind of -- the opposite problem with it, which is under 

her reading the -- no one -- when a court holds something 

retroactive can -- is an unpredictable matter. And under 

her reading, nobody -- even where there's a right that's 

rather important and that should be retroactive, no one 

could get relief until an appropriate court has held it 

retroactive, which could take years. It could be never. 

And if the Court -- and I think that that reading of that 

-- therefore, I think that that -- that reading has just 

the opposite problem. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You see, you're -- you're 

saying --

MR. FELDMAN: What Congress wanted --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the district court 

should take these filings, should not hold them. It 

should itself make the retroactivity determination.

 MR. FELDMAN: It can do that subject to appeal 

and ultimately certiorari in this Court.

 I think, though, that ultimately what Congress

wanted was a 1-year period after this Court initially 

recognizes a new right. When the -- for that -- that 

period of time the finality that is so important to the 

criminal law is -- does -- is suspended to a certain 

degree. People can litigate the issue. After that, the 

criminal law can go back to its retributive, deterrent 

purposes which can only be achieved if finality is 

recognized. 

I think, in particular, when you're talking 

about section 2255 motions, frequently the relief, if 

there is any, is going to be a new trial. And there's a 

particular cost, as the Court has recognized, of trying to 

retry somebody many, many years after an initial 

conviction. Sometimes it means, in effect, it's just an 

acquittal because you can't find the witnesses or you can 

no longer prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. And I 

think, therefore, Congress said, all right, well if 

there's a new right, that's a sufficiently exceptional 

circumstance, that we can suspend that finality for a 

brief period, but 1 year and that's all. These things 

shouldn't come out 10 years later or 15 years later or 

20 years later.

 And that was the purpose, I think a perfectly 

reasonable purpose that Congress intended to serve here. 

And I think that actually the language of it, which says 1

year from the date on which the right asserted was 

initially recognized by this Court, accomplishes that 

purpose. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- your position is 

strengthened by the other three provisions of the statute 

that mentioned this, but it's not controlled by that, I 

take it. You think it's unambiguous just as it read -- as 

it's read on its own.

 MR. FELDMAN: I think that the date -- there's 

only one possible date that can be found in this language. 

Unless the Court felt that it had to completely rewrite 

it, there's only one date, the date on which the right 

asserted was initially recognized by this Court. And even 

if -- whatever problems the if clause have -- has, that 

may mean that this -- not very many people -- the worst it 

would mean is that not many people can take advantage of 

that date. 

But unless it's -- that date is -- there's 

something unconstitutional, which no one has suggested, 

about Congress picking that date and that limitations 

period for people who have had the chance to litigate 

things on direct review -- in any event, it had 1 year 

from the date their conviction became final. Unless 

there's something wrong with that, I think that the Court 

should follow the terms of the statute, and the time

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 

Feldman.

 Ms. Bergmann, you have 6 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BERGMANN: Just several quick points.

 I'd like to start with the last point that Mr. 

Feldman made saying that there is only possible date under 

which the limitation period can run and -- and cautioning 

the Court about rewriting that date. What the Government 

neglects to mention is that it's asking this Court to 

rewrite the if clause by changing Congress' use of verb 

tense from a past tense to -- to something that could 

happen in the future. They want this Court to read that 

language contrary to Tyler, contrary to the use of verb 

tense and allow a district court to make a retroactivity 

decision at some time in the future in every case in which 

a motion is filed under paragraph 6(3).

 The second point I'd like to make is that the --

in situations such as this that involve these kinds of 

important rights, interests in finality are at an ebb. 

These are the types of rights where someone may well be 

innocent of the crime for which they are incarcerated,

that involve important rights that go to the accuracy of 

the underlying adjudication. It seems to me in these 

circumstances, there is -- it is a situation where 

Congress' need or -- or the need of the courts to enforce 

finality to keep people in jail are at their lowest point. 

These are very special rights and Congress went to the 

trouble of drafting and enacting paragraph 6(3) and 

paragraph 8(2) to protect these rights. And -- and I 

think the Court should read them as broadly as possible in 

order to protect those rights.

 Justice Scalia asked a question about the 

difference between newly recognized and initially 

recognized. I wanted to go back to that for a minute. 

There are circumstances where a -- let me see if 

I can get this right -- where a -- a right may be newly 

recognized but not yet initially recognized. And I would 

-- I would point the Court's attention -- the decision in 

Penry. In Penry v. Lynaugh, this Court stated that if 

there was an Eighth Amendment bar to the execution of 

mentally retarded individuals, that would be a new right 

that would be retroactively applicable to collateral 

cases. But then the Court declined to initially recognize 

the Eighth Amendment right. It wasn't until Atkins was 

decided that the Eighth Amendment right was initially 

recognized. And so --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it didn't newly -- it 

didn't newly recognize it either, did it?

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, it -- it -- I would say 

that it -- it recognized that it was new and that seems to 

be the way the courts have interpreted --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was -- it recognized that 

when it would be initially recognized, it would be newly 

initially recognized. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BERGMANN: That's correct, Your Honor, but I 

would say that there would be no additional decision of 

this Court that would be necessary for -- for someone to 

conclude that all three provisions of paragraph 6(3) had 

been met. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see your point. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it could be, if you 

want to play games, there is an imaginary right to which 

Blackstone has referred 48 times. Yet, for some odd 

reason, that right has never come to the Supreme Court of 

the United States. But one day it does. It is a right of 

constitutional dimensions embedded in the law of stoppage 

in transitu. And although it's well recognized, we've 

never had a case. Finally, we get one, and it is 

initially recognized here, but it is not newly recognized 

for every treatise on stoppage in transitu has long

assumed that it was part of the law of the United States. 

I don't know. That's what I thought it was.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, yes, Your Honor. There --

there are -- every time this Court issues a decision, 

someone could argue that it initially recognizes a right, 

and whether that right is new in the Teague sense or 

old --

JUSTICE BREYER: I take it that what I've just 

said is of total irrelevance to everything. Is -- is that 

right? 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BERGMANN: No. I disagree, Your Honor. I 

mean, there are circumstances where this Court initially 

recognizes rights, but then later on determines that they 

are not new, that they are indeed old. That happened in 

Simmons v. South Carolina. The Court recognizes --

recognized a right to present certain types of mitigation 

evidence in the penalty phase of a capital case, but then 

the Court later determined that that was not a new right. 

It was an old right in the Teague sense, and so it, 

therefore, applied retroactively because it was an old 

right but it did not newly recognize it at the time that 

it initially recognized it. And I'm sorry for the 

linguistic -- but it -- it is complicated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not your fault.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm laughing at the statute, 

not at you. 

MS. BERGMANN: Thank you, Your Honor. 

I just wanted to say in closing that -- that it 

is a difficult statute, but I think that Mr. Dodd's 

interpretation of the statute best respects Congress' use 

of tense and is consistent with the reading of paragraph 

8(2) that this Court gave in Tyler. 

It also respects Congress' intention to create a 

specific exception for new rights that apply retroactively 

and by allowing for the realistic possibility of -- of 

success in either an initial or a second or successive 

motion premised on such rights.

 It also, as we've discussed, promotes judicial 

efficiency by eliminating from it frivolous motions 

because litigants would not file until it was clear that 

they actually had a right to collateral relief. 

In sum, this Court should conclude that the 

triggering date is when all three of the prerequisites 

have been met. In this case, that would be when the 

Eleventh Circuit decided Ross v. Richardson.

 I guess my -- my final concern is for my client. 

If the Court constructs a rule where the Supreme Court 

would have to be the court that makes the retroactivity 

decision, I hope the Court will consider the effect of

such a rule on someone like my client who filed 

prematurely on -- in -- in hopes that at some point his 

arguably meritorious Richardson claim would be heard. 

Whether the Court decides that those premature filings 

should be dismissed without prejudice or if there's some 

kind of analysis the lower courts should take in resolving 

those claims --

JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how is -- how does that 

work? I mean, can you explain that a little? 

MS. BERGMANN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose he did -- he hasn't 

violated the statute of limitations. He -- he filed it 

before a year ran from the time that we finally recognized 

it because we haven't even recognized it yet.

 MS. BERGMANN: Well, that would be my argument, 

Your Honor, that he was premature. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But what is premature? What 

prevents a person from being premature? They just might 

lose on the merits of their claim is all, and he might 

anyway. 

MS. BERGMANN: That's -- that's if the Court 

would allow the retroactivity decision to be made in the 

-- on an initial motion by the district court in that 

particular case. Am I correct? Maybe I'm 

misunderstanding you, Your Honor.
