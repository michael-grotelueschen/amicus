 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Court will now hear 

argument in Gonzales v. Oregon.

 General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Before Oregon became the first State to 

authorize assisted suicide, the prescription of federally 

controlled substances to facilitate suicide generally 

violated State law and also violated Federal law. 

Respondents contend that Oregon's decision to remove the 

State-law consequences from that conduct also operated to 

remove the Federal-law consequences.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, what Federal law 

does it violate?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It violated the Controlled 

Substances Act. And the D.A. had taken the position, 

before Oregon acted, for example, that the fact that a 

doctor prescribed controlled substances for purposes of a 

suicide was a basis for revoking his license.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, would that be true 

also for any doctor who provided the substances to furnish

an execution of a convicted death penalty convict?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice O'Connor, the 

death penalty situation, lethal injection, is different, 

for a number of reasons. Of course, the D.A. has long 

taken a position of non-enforcement in that context, which 

would be protected by this Court's decision in Heckler 

against Cheney.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But, otherwise, it would be 

the same reasoning --

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think it would, 

Justice O'Connor, at least not since 1994, because in 1994 

Congress passed a statute that I think is best read as 

ratifying the practice of lethal injection. This is 18 

U.S.C. 3596. And that statute authorizes the Federal 

Government to use the method of execution in the State of 

the sentencing court. And at the time that was passed, in 

1994, the overwhelming majority -- something like 25 of 

the 38 States -- had already used lethal injection. So, I 

would read that as --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But would it be open --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- a ratification --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to the Attorney General to 

pass a regulation like this one, and all of a sudden apply 

it -- some new Attorney General, who had a very different 

view of the death penalty?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think so, Justice 

O'Connor, and I think the reason is, at a minimum, 18 

U.S.C. 3596, because I think that would now stand as an

obstacle to that type of regulatory impression --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, not if it just refers 

back to the States, would it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, but this is a provision 

that dictates how the Federal Government shall do its 

executions. And I think, at that time, in 1994, it 

effectively ratified the practice of using lethal 

injection. I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does the statute -- does the 

Federal statute specifically authorize doctors to do this? 

Or does it simply say that convicts may be executed by 

lethal injection?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the statute itself says 

that the Federal Government shall use the method in the 

State in which the sentencing court sits, the Federal 

sentencing court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the method may simply 

be lethal injection. And, going back to Justice 

O'Connor's question, it might still be the case that, on 

the theory the Government is advancing this morning, it 

would be unlawful for a doctor to engage in that, because

that was, in fact, not within the limits of the practice 

of medicine, the doctor was using a controlled substance 

for something outside the practice of medicine, and hence, 

it would be illegal.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And again, Justice Souter, I 

think the best reading is, that is now foreclosed -- that 

interpretation would be foreclosed by Congress's action in 

1994. There are also some technical differences --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it Congress did not 

refer specifically to -- or did not include a specific 

authorization of doctors, so that we'd have to do a little 

construction to get to your point.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think we would have to do a 

little construction, in fairness, but I do think -- I 

mean, and there also are some differences, because, for 

example, as I understand the practice in most States, 

doctors actually aren't exactly involved in the specific 

process of administering the lethal injection. There's 

also a technical difference, which is, with respect to 

lethal injection, it's not the federally controlled 

substance which is the lethal agent. It's just that 

there's a federally controlled substance that's used to 

administer -- to relieve pain in conjunction with a 

different injection that's not -- that does not involve a 

federally controlled substance. And that's actually the

lethal agent. Here, of course, it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: In your view, were it not for 

the statute, the Federal statute, your view of the 

Attorney General's authority is -- leaving that statute 

aside, if it weren't there -- the Attorney General, should 

we have an Attorney General who is opposed to the death 

penalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop Federal -- State 

death penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying 

that no physician can be registered insofar as he engages 

in that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I haven't 

thoroughly considered the issue, precisely because I do 

think the '94 statute stands as an obstacle. It may be 

that some of the differences in the way that the death 

penalty is administered, the fact that doctors aren't 

directly involved --

JUSTICE SCALIA: At most, it --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- would allow for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- at most, it would allow him 

to prosecute, or to move for the dis-certification of 

doctors who engage in that practice. And if the State 

chooses to do it without doctors, it would be okay.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right. As I 

say, I think some of the technical ways in which the 

penalty is administered could make a difference.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what we're getting -- at 

least what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably 

have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which 

is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and -- has 

nothing to do with the death penalty. And I would think 

that the argument on the other side is that the statute 

has nothing to do with assisted suicide. Congress didn't 

think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about 

assisted suicide. It's rather like the tobacco case, 

except a fortiori. Now, what's your response to that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, several points, Justice 

Breyer. I think that, first of all, I would say that 

Congress did focus on suicide, if not physician-assisted 

suicide, and I think that's an important distinction that 

I'd like to come back to. But I actually think the 

comparison to the tobacco case is quite instructive, 

because there what you had is a statute in which something 

seemed like it might come within the plain terms of the 

FDCA, and yet if you took that literally, it would run 

smack into another statutory scheme.

 And here, there is no other statutory scheme. 

To the contrary, the most natural reading of the 

Controlled Substances Act, I would say -- and I'll address 

it in a minute -- is that this falls within the authority 

of the Attorney General. And if you look to any

alternative congressional indication of intent on this 

topic, the only thing you would find is the Assisted 

Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which continues a 

Federal policy against assisted suicide. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I comment --

GENERAL CLEMENT: So, in that sense, I think 

it's very different than the Brown and Williamson case. 

Now, taking, though --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- as to what Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may I ask you about the 

position this Court took in Glucksberg? That is, everyone 

on the Court in that case seemed to assume that physician-

assisted suicide was a matter for the State, and the 

Government, at that time, said, "State legislatures 

undoubtedly have the authority to create the kind of 

exception to assisted suicide fashioned by the court of 

appeals. There is every reason to believe that State 

legislatures will address the urgent issues involved in 

this case in a fair and impartial way." And then the 

Government added that, "There is no indication that the 

political processes are malfunctioning in this area." 

That was a position presented to this Court in the 

Glucksberg case by the Government.

 Now, you are rejecting that position.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, I don't think so. I -- we stand by the brief in 

Glucksberg. Now, obviously in the Glucksberg case, the 

Federal law that everybody was focused on -- and, in 

fairness, the United States was focused on -- was the 

Federal Constitution. And so, that's one important 

difference.

 Another important difference -- and I think this 

is an important point -- is that the Federal regulation 

here, the interpretation of the Attorney General, does not 

purport to foreclose the issue of assisted suicide --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they say --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- which is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that, in practical terms, 

that is exactly what it does, because the only way they 

can administer their law sensibly is by using these kinds 

of drugs, scheduled drugs.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, we don't 

have a factual record on that question. I think it's not 

clear that that's the case, because, I mean, proponents of 

physician-assisted suicide have identified alternative 

methods. Perhaps the most notorious proponent of 

physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Kevorkian, operated 

without a federal controlled-substance license for the 

last six years before his conviction --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, did he use --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- at the time --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- did he use a controlled 

substance?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: He did not. He did not, which 

is why he could do that. So, it just goes to prove that 

physician-assisted suicide and the use of federally 

controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide are 

not coextensive.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that the --

those methods are less gentle to the patient, the methods 

that the State of Oregon has authorized its physicians to 

prescribe. We are told, at least in some of the briefs, 

that, from the patient's point of view, it's much less 

upsetting.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, we operate 

without a factual record on that point. In doing some 

outside reading, it seems that some of the other methods 

are actually disapproved, not because they're less -- more 

painful, but because it's more obvious that it's a 

suicide, in certain cases, and the administration of 

scheduled drugs sort of blurs that line.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But I guess my point would be, 

even if we take it as true that controlled substances are

the most efficient way to do this, I take it as a given 

that if Oregon doctors decided that a schedule 1 substance 

was the most effective way to administer a lethal overdose 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- after this Court's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Congress spoke --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- decision in Raich --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Congress spoke about 

section -- schedule 1 drugs, and that's what's lacking 

here. Congress says schedule 1 drugs, those are: no, 

never; schedule 2: okay on a doctor's prescription.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree there is that 

difference between schedule 1 and schedule 2 substances. 

Now, I think that brings us to the Attorney General's 

regulation, which is a longstanding regulation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, before you go 

there, I want to question you about your distinction 

between Dr. Kevorkian and a doctor who uses controlled 

substances. Why could not the Attorney General treat Dr. 

Kevorkian's conduct as conduct that may threaten the 

public health and safety, and seek his -- cancellation of 

his license?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I don't think 

he could. First of all, I think it's clear that that

isn't the authority that's invoked here. And the Attorney 

General in the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- OLC opinion are patently --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- he can rely --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- clear on that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- on things like prior 

convictions, other things unrelated to a specific 

transaction. And if he thinks that assisted suicide is 

contrary conduct that threatens the public interest, 

health and safety, I don't know why that wouldn't apply to 

Dr. Kevorkian, as well as somebody using controlled 

substances.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, the 

reason I would say that it wouldn't is, I think you have 

to read this regulation against a backdrop that for 90 

years the Federal Government has been involved in the 

regulation of controlled substance. Now, there have been 

a lot of statements and a lot of court opinions during 

that 90 years --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the Attorney General's 

directive, if I remember it, does not identify any 

particular controlled substance. It just identified a 

particular kind of conduct by the doctor.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: The -- I'm not sure if you're

referring to the statute or the regulation. I would say 

it this way, which is to say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Neither one. Neither one is 

identifying which schedule 2 or schedule 3 substance may 

not be used.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's fair, Justice 

Stevens. I don't take issue with that. And I think 

you're right to say that the statutory grant of authority 

to the Attorney General is quite broad. He's supposed to 

make judgments in the public interest about public health 

and safety.

 The point I was trying to make is, I would read 

all of that against the backdrop that for 90 years the 

Federal Government has been involved in the regulation of 

controlled substance. And we all know that that is going 

to have an incidental effect on State regulation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, for me --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- of medicine.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for me, the case turns on 

the statute. And it's a hard case. And it seems to me 

that your answer to Justice Stevens would be to say that 

the Justice Department has found this practice to be an 

abuse of the drug. But then, my question -- and if -- if 

you had, in fact, given that answer, my question --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- my question would then be, 

Isn't that an odd statutory scheme, where the Attorney 

General can find it to be an abuse of the use of the drug 

if the State of Oregon has specifically told its doctors, 

under special procedures in defined circumstances, that 

they can administer it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think that would 

be an odd regime. I think if, for example, Oregon made a 

radically different judgment and said that in Oregon it 

was going to be permissible to have treatment or 

detoxification programs that involve the administration of 

radically larger quantities of controlled substances than 

had been recognized in any other State, I think, under the 

authority of cases like Moore, the Attorney General can 

make a judgment -- now, that's not a legitimate medical 

purpose, that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- an abuse.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's -- that's a -- the 

slipper-slope argument that I wanted to explore a bit. If 

we do rule against you, and for the State of Oregon, on 

the statute, you do think that there will be some other 

serious consequence which will hinder the Department of 

Justice in an orderly implementation of this statute, 

particularly under the abuse formulation?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there could be, 

Justice Kennedy. I don't want to overstate it, in the 

sense that -- one of the reasons you don't see that much 

of a conflict between Federal and State law in the 

regulation of controlled substances is because, in the 

main, the States have adopted uniform controlled-

substances acts that mirror the Federal Act, and, in most 

of the instances there, works in the way of cooperative 

federalism in dealing with this problem. This Court tends 

to see the cases -- Raich, in this case -- where there's a 

conflict between the State regime and the Federal regime.

 And I guess my point is the -- in a such a 

comprehensive Federal regime, if this Court makes clear 

that State law can overtake the Federal regime, I think it 

at least creates the potential for there to be a lot of 

holes in the regime and the possibility, if States take 

the -- take you up on that invitation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But part --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to really undermine the 

regime.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- part of the regime referred 

to under the statute -- and it's 801(a) implementing the 

convention on psychotropic drugs -- and there, the 

implementation incorporates the treaty -- but it says 

that, "This shall not displace the judgment of the medical

community, as determined by the Secretary." And it seems 

to me that that cuts against you in this case.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, it is 

perfectly true that there are places in the statute where 

medical or scientific decisions are expressly given to the 

Secretary of Health and Human Services and not the 

Attorney General, but it is equally true that there are 

places in the Controlled Substances Act where medical 

determinations or public-health determinations are given 

expressly to the Attorney General and not the Secretary of 

Health and Human Services. And one of the places, of 

course, that's true is Sections 823 and 824 of Title 1 --

Title 21 -- which, of course, are the provisions about the 

registration and revocation of registrants. And Congress 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, certainly the practice 

of medicine by physicians is an area traditionally 

regulated by the States, is it not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It absolutely is, Justice 

O'Connor, but --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And there is nothing express 

in the statute suggesting that it's designed to put in the 

hands of the Federal Government or the Attorney General 

the regulation of the practice of medicine, is there?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, there's

nothing that says we want to take over the regulation of 

medicine, but it's crystal clear --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, and there were two 

attempts, were there not, to get legislation passed to do 

this expressly in Congress, and they failed?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, yes, but I think this 

Court is always hesitant to draw inferences from --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- failed legislative efforts. 

And if --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- the Attorney General had 

not adopted this interpretation, it may be that this 

Congress would have passed those initiatives --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And a prior Attorney General 

had a different interpretation.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And the prior administer of 

the DEA before that had our position. So, this is an area 

where I think, you know, there are different approaches to 

this. 

What I wanted to make clear, though, is, you're 

absolutely right that the regulation of medicine is --

this Court has observed -- is traditionally left to the 

States. But that has to be reconciled with the fact that 

for 90 years the Federal Government has had a prominent

role in the regulation of controlled substances. And it's 

been clear --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah, but --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- since the very --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- are these -- are these 

drugs classified as illegal, for all purposes?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Not for all --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- purposes, but they are 

highly classified, highly controlled substances. They are 

the -- the substances that are at issue here are the most 

highly controlled lawful substances. And I think if you 

go back to the history of the Harrison Act, it's been 

clear since the very first prosecutions under the Harrison 

Narcotics Act of 1914 that the Federal Government's 

ability to regulate medicine was going to have an 

incidental effect on the State's ability to regulate 

medicine. I mean, States had much more of a laissez 

attitude towards -- laissez-faire attitude towards the 

opium trade, but that was really displaced by the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah, but it's a --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- Harrison Act.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- it's a different thing to 

regulate by saying, "No one can prescribe this substance. 

It's so lethal, we won't let anyone prescribe it at all."

And it's quite different to say, "This -- if a -- if a 

physician follows the Oregon law, it's a -- it's not a 

legitimate practice of medicine." That's a very different 

approach.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, I can't tell 

you there isn't a difference between the treatment of 

schedule 1 substances --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- that are just verboten for 

all purposes and schedule 2 substances, but the regulation 

of Federal controlled substances in the Harrison Act has 

always focused on drugs that have some lawful medical uses 

but are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- also susceptible to abuse.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- what is the closest 

analog you have, outside of the present case, where the 

Attorney General's enforcement activity has impinged upon 

what the State has recognized as medical practice?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think I would -- I 

mean, I -- I guess I would do two answers to that, Mr. 

Chief Justice. One, I would point to the fact that, at 

the genesis of the Harrison Act, it really was displacing 

State medical judgments about the opium trade. I would 

point to two other examples, one under this statute and

one other the -- under the FDCA.

 The idea under the FDCA -- the example that 

comes to mind is the FDA's treatment of Laetrile, that 

this Court addressed in the Rutherford decision. In that 

case, 17 States had made a judgment that Laetrile was --

could be available, for prescription use, to treat cancer. 

And the FDA, by refusing to approve Laetrile --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the FDA. 

I'm talking about the Attorney General, under this 

statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, then I think I would --

I mean, I -- I'm not sure I can point to a decision by the 

Attorney General, but I think it's -- in the structure of 

this Act -- obviously the schedule 1 treatment of 

marijuana that this Court had before it in the Raich case, 

involved a situation where the Act clearly displaced the 

medical judgments of California and nine other States --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- who recognized --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was a clear act of 

Congress. I mean, Congress had made that decision, and it 

was unmistakable. It seems to me that the problem that 

you have, with your reference back to the Harrison Act and 

the 90 years of regulation, is that the 90 years of 

regulation was regulation for the purpose of stopping drug

pushing and drug abuse, in the conventional sense. And to 

say that a statute -- or a statutory history taken into 

consideration in determining the scope of this statute, 

with that kind of a history, can support a view that 

suddenly the Attorney General of the United States is 

given, in effect, the sole authority to determine whether 

any State may or may not authorize assisted suicide, and 

may do so in a way that any other Attorney General can 

flip back and forth -- as has happened in this case, if 

Attorney General Reno was wrong -- seems to me a kind of 

argument from history that simply cuts against you, 

because it leads to a sort of a bizarre result. I mean, 

what is your response to that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I think 

you have to look at the regulation of drug abuse and ask, 

To what end was Congress regulating these substances?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, and I -- as I said, it 

seems to me that your 91 years of history say that the end 

that Congress had in mind was to stop drug pushing and 

stop conventional drug abuse. It didn't have any more --

there's no indication that I know of that Congress had 

assisted suicide in mind, any more than it had the 

administration of the death penalty in mind.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, what I 

would say is, what Congress had in mind in enacting these

substances is, they were concerned about drug abuse, not 

for its own sake, but for the debilitating effect it has 

on people's lives, for its tendency to destroy lives. And 

I will grant you that Congress, in 1970, did not have 

before it in its contemplation a State that would make 

physician-assisted suicide lawful. But that's because it 

would have been unthinkable at that time. And what 

Congress did have clearly in its contemplation is the fact 

that a clear manifestation of a drug's potential for abuse 

was the fact that it could lead to suicide and overdoses. 

And that's page 35 of the House report, for those that 

look at legislative history. And I actually think that's 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Suicide is a result of the kind 

of dementia that comes from drug abuse. That is not 

suicide under the circumstances that we're talking about 

within the limits of the Oregon law.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Congress didn't specify, 

one way or another. And what I would -- I would point you 

to the House report, because I think it actually is 

indicative, because when Congress is framing the issue, 

they first look at the extent of the problem. And one of 

the ways they identify the problem as serious is, they 

point to overdoses that are taking place among teenagers. 

And then, in the next section of the report, they look at

the question of the consequences of drug abuse. And what 

do they point to as --

JUSTICE STEVENS: General, then may I just ask 

this question? We're focusing on whether congress really 

authorized this action by the Attorney General. And in 

the Raich case, which, of course, was a close case --

there were three dissents in the case -- the -- there was 

great attention on the fact Congress had considered the 

interstate market for the product involved, an impact on 

the market if it was allowed to be sold in -- or grown and 

so forth in California. But is there any evidence at all 

that Congress thought that any of these -- schedule 2 or 3 

substances that are used in assisted-suicide situations --

that Congress focused on the impact of that use on the 

interstate market for those drugs?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I mean, 

I -- first of all, I would say, as it compared to Raich, I 

would almost think this is an a fortiori case, as it 

affects commerce, because, unlike Raich, which, of course, 

were untraditional noncommercial transactions, the 

transactions at issue here are standard commercial 

transactions that are --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But are they --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- well within --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- are they transactions that

have any impact on any market, any commercial market, that 

Congress ever mentioned?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think they do. And I sure 

hope they do, because this is a situation where Congress 

and the Federal Government pervasively regulates the drug 

transactions at issue here in a way that even respondents 

don't object to. The details of the form that you fill 

out for the prescription, the fact that it has to be in 

writing, the regulations specify whether it has to be in 

pen or pencil -- I mean, there's such a pervasive 

involvement of the Federal Government in the regulation of 

these controlled substances that I don't think there's any 

additional commerce clause extension by regulating the 

purpose for which the prescription is being made. That's 

what the DEA did in the context of Marinol, when it was 

first moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, that -- we 

discuss that in detail on page 30 of our brief. And I 

think that kind of regulation, although it's not a common 

feature of the DEA in its administration of the Controlled 

Substances Act, is an important one, is a legitimate one.

 And I guess what I would say, with respect to 

Congress's intent, is, it seems to me odd to think that a 

Congress that was concerned about overdoses, concerned 

about suicides, would be indifferent or agnostic on the 

question of using federally controlled substances for the

express purpose of inducing a lethal overdose.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why were -- you were going to 

say, at one point -- why was Congress concerned about 

overdoses of narcotics and so forth? Why?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think they were concerned 

with it part and parcel of -- because, I mean, I think of 

the things that Congress does when it regulates is, it 

regulates to protect life, to protect health and safety --

JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, there was a 

reason, wasn't there, that they're worried about people 

taking narcotics?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, sure --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- there are. Sure they are.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. What was the main --

GENERAL CLEMENT: And they're worried about the 

impact --

JUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought it was 

narcotics addiction.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think it is, but, 

again, I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, if it is 

narcotics addiction --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But not solely.

because you know I'm going to say, What has this got to do 

with that? So, why not solely?

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: Not solely. You go ahead. 

What else?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Not solely. And, again, I 

mean, I think, you know, addiction qua addiction was not 

the concern so much as addiction because of its tendency 

to debilitate lives --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to destroy lives --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, but it's true 

addiction. And this seems to --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no, I don't think that's 

right, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there are a number of 

instances where the abuse that is being -- that Congress 

is concerned with is not solely the addictive abuse. I 

mean, to take one example, Congress has recently, as part 

of the controlled substances regime, regulated GHB, one of 

these so-called "date-rape drugs." And the concern for

abuse there is not its addictive quality, but the fact 

that it can be used in a way that's not medical, that can 

be very pernicious, and the like. And so, I think that's 

just another example of this concept of abuse being much 

broader than a narrow focus on diversion or a narrow focus 

on addiction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but even in your example, 

the concern of Congress is with the use of the drug to 

hurt people who do not understand that they're going to be 

hurt, and don't want to be hurt, and perhaps, in your 

example, the use of the drug to facilitate the violation 

of the law, that seems to me worlds away from what we're 

talking about here.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I would 

simply say that the Controlled Substances Act, if you look 

at it, is a very paternalistic piece of legislation. It's 

not designed to let people make their own judgments about 

the health risk. 

And if I could reserve the remainder of my time?

Clement.

 Thank you.

 MR. ATKINSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 What the Court said in Gibbons versus Ogden was 

that health laws of every description were for the States 

to regulate. In Glucksberg, this Court --

between the States and the Federal Government has changed 

a little since Gibbons versus Ogden.

 MR. ATKINSON: That's certainly true, Your

in Glucksberg and in the opinion -- excuse me -- and in 

the text of the Controlled Substances Act, you will find 

that this Court has recognized that this specific subject, 

physician-assisted dying, is one that is for the States to 

regulate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that begs the 

question -- if you had said "this specific subject," the 

regulation of controlled substances, your answer would 

have come out the other way, which is kind of what the 

case is about.

 MR. ATKINSON: I agree. And let me talk, then, 

about the -- why we believe the text of the statute 

demonstrates that Congress intended to leave the decision 

about what is, and is not, a legitimate medical practice 

to the States, as it has always been. And that's the key 

question in this case, because the U.S. Attorney General 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, because, I mean, wouldn't 

-- suppose that some State said that, "We think doctors 

can prescribe, for people who want to take it, morphine 

for recreational use."

 MR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, there are a number of 

limits clear in the Controlled Substances Act. But taking

the hypothetical you've offered, specifically, we think 

that the answer would have to be that Congress intended to 

leave the definition of what is a legitimate medical 

practice to the States.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No matter what? I mean, they 

have cases and so forth that say, "Of course a State could 

go too far. A State might decided it's" -- just what I 

said. And you're going to say your case turns or falls --

you win or lose, depending on whether I accept that a 

State could not stop a doctor from becoming, in effect, a 

conduit to a group of drug dealers by saying, "I think 

recreational use is part of my medical practice"? That 

would be up to the State? 

MR. ATKINSON: Certainly, the State could stop 

it, yes. The question --

JUSTICE BREYER: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it didn't "stop it" --

MR. ATKINSON: But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but could the State allow 

it?

 MR. ATKINSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if the State allowed it, 

the Federal Government would have to allow the drugs to be 

used for that purpose --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you're saying.

 MR. ATKINSON: -- there are a number of limits 

in the text of the Act itself. There are limits in other 

Federal statutes not contained in the CSA. There is also 

the political limits on irresponsible lawmaking at both 

the State and the Federal level that have served us well 

for almost 200 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that at 

the time this legislation was enacted, it would have been 

as unthinkable for a State to allow drugs to be used -- to 

be prescribed by a doctor to kill a patient as it would be 

for drugs to be subscribed by a doctor to make the patient 

feel better.

 MR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, many drugs --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I think that assisted 

suicide would have been as unthinkable at the time this 

was enacted as prescribing cocaine just for recreational 

use.

 MR. ATKINSON: We don't suggest that Congress 

had physician-assisted dying specifically in mind at the 

time that it enacted the Controlled Substances Act. What 

we do think that Congress had in mind was the 200-year 

history of State regulation of medicine, of the practice 

of medicine, and what were, and were not, legitimate 

medical purposes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you agree -- you -- in 

answer to Justice Breyer's question, he mentioned a drug 

that was a schedule 1 drug, morphine. Or maybe --

MR. ATKINSON: I'm sorry --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- perhaps it isn't --

MR. ATKINSON: -- I think it is a schedule 2 

drug, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's schedule 2 drug.

 MR. ATKINSON: Yes. We certainly don't suggest 

that a State could authorize the use of a schedule 1 drug 

for any purpose at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you saying that if 

the doctor is using it, saying, "In my medical judgment, 

this makes people happy; and, therefore, I'm going to 

prescribe it," that a State could permit that? Wouldn't 

the Moore case rule that out?

 MR. ATKINSON: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

There aren't -- there is no history of the U.S. Attorney 

General prosecuting any doctor at any time in the -- in 

the -- since before Moore --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the idea of 

Moore was, if you're using this, the doctor is prescribing 

the drug as a pusher.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but let's -- but 

the supposition is that the State legal judgment is that 

that's the wrong characterization, that it's legitimate 

medical practice to make patients feel better, and 

morphine does that; and so, the State can allow them to 

prescribe morphine to make people feel better. And I 

understand your position to be that that would be 

permissible?

 MR. ATKINSON: Yes.

not prohibited under the Controlled --

 MR. ATKINSON: -- that is not prohibited under 

the Controlled Substances Act if the doctor was acting 

consistent with the specific terms of the Act and the 

specific terms of the State statutes.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you say the Attorney 

General of the United States could not deem it to be drug 

abuse under the Act if a State allowed that for 

recreational use or to cure depression or -- How about 

steroids for bodybuilders? -- and decided that's perfectly 

okay. Now, can the Attorney General find that that's drug 

abuse?

 MR. ATKINSON: As the term "drug abuse" is used

in the statute, Justice O'Connor, it is used expressly in 

terms of the scheduling decisions that the U.S. Attorney 

General is authorized to make, and required to make. It 

is not otherwise generally used. What the Controlled 

Substance --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I don't know that I 

understand your answer. Could the Attorney General deem 

the authorization -- purported authorization by a 

physician to use morphine to help with depression, or 

steroids for bodybuilding -- can that Attorney General 

say, under the Act, that's drug abuse?

 MR. ATKINSON: Not if it is permitted by -- and 

regulated by State law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I disagreed with you 

about that, then would you lose the case?

 MR. ATKINSON: I would certainly lose ground, 

Your Honor.

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking, if I disagreed with 

you that I thought -- we take the facts of Moore, where 

he's a drug pusher, the doctor, and, for some unknown 

reason, the State says, "That's fine, it doesn't violate 

State law," but the Attorney General says, "Do what you 

want about State law. I think it violates the Federal 

law." Suppose I think the Attorney General does have the

right to do that for -- assuming it -- assuming it -- then 

what do you say about this case?

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, first of all, we don't 

think, Justice Breyer, that what the U.S. Attorney General 

is attempting to do here is reasonable within the scope of 

whatever authority he has. Moreover, he has not followed 

the processes and procedures that are specified in the 

Controlled Substances Act. But our first position in this 

case is, he simply lacks the authority to do that.

 The Controlled Substances Act reflects, first, 

in Section 903, the anti-preemption provision, which is 

found in the State's brief, at page 36, that Congress 

intended not to intrude on State laws that would otherwise 

be within the authority of the State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that do to the 

effectiveness of regulation under the Controlled 

Substances Act? If one State can say it's legal for 

doctors to prescribe morphine to make people feel better, 

or to prescribe steroids for bodybuilding, doesn't that 

undermine the uniformity of the Federal law and make 

enforcement impossible?

 MR. ATKINSON: I don't believe it does, Mr. 

Chief Justice. In the first instance, we think the U.S. 

Attorney General's claim of uniformity is overstated. We 

think it's clear from the text of the statute that

Congress intended to leave the definition of what is, or 

is not, a legitimate medical practice in the hands --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that may or --

MR. ATKINSON: -- of the States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- may not be true. But 

focus on the particular question. If you have one State 

that allows the use of a drug that the Federal Government 

has determined is illegal, and is illegal everywhere else 

because other States haven't done it, how is the Federal 

Government supposed to enforce that prohibition?

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, I don't think the Federal 

Government is supposed to enforce that prohibition if the 

prohibition -- if we're dealing with a schedule 2, 3, or 4 

or 5 substance. Congress has clearly spoken to schedule 1 

substances. Once we move into the other substances, 

traditionally and has -- as has -- as been the -- as is 

the case today in every State, physicians, under the 

regulation of State medical boards, prescribe those 

medications for purposes other than those for which 

they're normally prescribed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to get at the 

specific enforcement point. If you have one State that 

allows morphine to be used legally for --

MR. ATKINSON: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- recreational

purposes, how is the Federal Government supposed to 

enforce the prohibition on that elsewhere?

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, there is no -- well, the 

Congress can prescribe -- can enforce it in any State in 

which it is not authorized by State law. If the U.S. 

Attorney General wants to regulate it in a State where it 

is authorized by State law, he must go to Congress and get 

a clear statement of authority to do that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But are you saying, in response 

to the Chief Justice's question, that, in fact, Congress, 

itself, could not explicitly pass a statute that says, "No 

State, through its doctors or otherwise, may authorize the 

use of morphine" --

MR. ATKINSON: Not at all, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. So, you're not 

making a --

MR. ATKINSON: No, not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- constitutional --

MR. ATKINSON: -- at all.

to your statutory argument.

 MR. ATKINSON: We're sticking to the statutory 

argument.

that "accepted medical practice" means accepted medical 

practice State by State --

MR. ATKINSON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- rather than on some uniform 

basis. Do you have any other area, regarding the 

enforcement of this Act, where the drug is allowed, or not 

allowed, to be used on the basis of divergent views of 

medical practice by divergent States?

 MR. ATKINSON: There are any number of areas in 

which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Such as?

 MR. ATKINSON: -- States diverge. Such as --

palliative care, I think, is the most obvious example. 

These days, there is a great deal of divergence among the 

States as to how --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In palliative care? And you 

think in some States you can -- you can prescribe these 

drugs without violating the Act; whereas, in other States, 

the same prescription would violate the Act.

 MR. ATKINSON: In some States, a prescription 

would violate State law; and in other cases, in other 

States, that same prescription would not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it violate the Federal 

law in those other States?

 MR. ATKINSON: It would if the -- if the

prescription violated the State law, the U.S. Attorney 

General could take action against the physician.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. So you say that in -- with 

respect to many aspects of this legislation, what's lawful 

-- and what's lawful depends upon the accepted medical 

practice within the State.

 MR. ATKINSON: That's exactly correct, Justice 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does this have to be reflected 

in the State medical board determinations, or just in what 

the -- what the doctors in that region tend to think is a 

good idea?

 MR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, what we believe is 

that what Congress did in enacting the Controlled 

Substances Act was leave those decisions to the States to 

enforce according to their traditional methods. Now, in 

some cases, that may be by statute; in some cases, the 

States may discipline doctors for -- through a State 

medical board.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any cases that you can think of 

where the same prescription has been held okay in one 

State and not okay in another State?

 MR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, we're not aware of 

any cases in which the U.S. Attorney General has ever 

attempted to de-register or to prosecute a doctor who was

acting in accordance with State law. We have a history 

that we're -- to -- at least since the Controlled 

Substances Act, in 1970, where the U.S. Attorney General 

has never attempted to suggest, as he does here, that 

something that is permissible under State law is, in any 

sense, a violation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the --

MR. ATKINSON: -- of the Controlled Substances 

Act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- statute goes beyond the 

State law, the five factors, you know, on the -- justify 

the --

MR. ATKINSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- revocation. And some are 

in compliance with State law, but the fifth factor is, 

"such other conduct which may threaten the public health 

and safety." It seems to me that's a clear grant of 

authority to go beyond State law.

 MR. ATKINSON: Justice Stevens, we think that 

the best reading of the five factors is that they continue 

to respect State laws. Certainly, that's what the 

legislative history, for those of you who would be willing 

to look at it, of the 1984 amendments reflects. Congress 

was not concerned about how States were defining 

legitimate medical practices. Congress was concerned

about the failure to enforce existing State law. And 

that's clearly reflected in the legislative history, some 

of which is set out in the State's brief, on page 36, in 

note 16. But if you look at those five factors, what they 

are addressed to is individual applicants -- that is, 

individual doctors -- not to broad medical purposes.

 And what you're seeing here in the Attorney 

General's claim of authority, for the first time, is rules 

that are not addressed to controlled substances, per se, 

but to medical practices, and that is something that the 

Congress simply never contemplated giving you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do you do 

with regulation 1306, which -- the one that, of course, 

talks about "legitimate medical purpose"? That was 

promulgated in 1971. It wasn't directed to the Oregon 

statute. And yet it suggests that the Attorney General 

has the authority to interpret that phrase.

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, we think there's -- there 

are two answers to that, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice. The 

first is that, in Harris versus Christensen, this Court 

said that a Federal agent cannot promulgate a new 

regulation in the guise of interpreting an old one. Now, 

in 1971, when that regulation to which you refer was 

enacted, it was absolutely clear that the U.S. Attorney 

General could not have de-registered an Oregon doctor who

was acting in accordance with State law, because, as this 

Court pointed out in United States versus Moore, the 

registration was a matter -- was as a matter of right if 

the -- if the physician was in good standing with State 

medical authorities.

 So, what he's attempting to do today, in the 

guise of interpreting that rule, is to make it mean 

something entirely different than what it meant when he 

enacted it. And I think Christensen versus Harris County 

says that he simply cannot do that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You had a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- second answer?

 MR. ATKINSON: Excuse me?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You had a 

second answer?

 MR. ATKINSON: That's all right. I'm -- I --

I'm happy with the first one, at this point.

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Atkinson, you've spent most 

of your time talking about the statute and the 

regulations. Do you also make the argument that ,even if 

the Government wanted to do this thing, it would be 

unconstitutional?

 MR. ATKINSON: We do, Your Honor. One of the

questions presented in Raich was whether Congress "could" 

do what it had done. The question here is -- first of 

all, is whether Congress "did" what it had done. And our 

point is not necessarily that it would be 

unconstitutional, but that it would raise a significant 

constitutional question, which implicates the clear-

statement rule and the constitutional avoidance rule.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why would it raise a 

significant constitutional question? I take it that it's 

none of the Government's business whether people gamble or 

not. I take it, it's none of the -- the Federal 

Government -- I take it, it's none of the Federal 

Government's business whether people are allowed to drink 

at 21 or at 18, innumerable other things, which really are 

matters that belong to the police power of the States. 

But the Federal Government has chosen to regulate those 

things through the use of its commerce power. Is the 

drinking age any more a matter of -- or any less a matter 

of State privilege than suicide?

 MR. ATKINSON: No, I wouldn't say that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, are those -- are those 

entries of the Federal Government into the regulation of 

drinking age, are they unconstitutional --

MR. ATKINSON: No, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or do they raise serious

constitutional questions?

 MR. ATKINSON: No, they don't, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why does this one? I 

don't --

MR. ATKINSON: The difference here is simply 

that there -- the amounts, as was suggested earlier, are 

so minute that there cannot be any significant effect on 

interstate commerce. There is not even any evidence in 

this record that there is a market for the drugs that are 

used under the Death with Dignity Act, much less if there 

is an illicit trade. There's no question here of -- as 

the Court described it in Raich, where you had a $10 

billion market of --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The statute gives the Attorney 

General authority to promulgate regulations for the 

dispensing of drug -- 821 -- and that seems to me to 

describe precisely what the Attorney General has done 

here.

 MR. ATKINSON: I can't disagree with that, 

Justice Kennedy. The question is, Does he have authority 

to tell a doctor in a particular State, not by reference 

to a particular drug that he may not dispense this drug, 

but that he may not dispense a drug for a specific medical 

purpose? And, as I've suggested, this is the first time 

we've ever seen that happen. And we think that's because 

it's inconsistent with the congressional design, which was 

to leave the subject of what are, and are not, legitimate 

medical purposes to the States and to -- and to have the 

U.S. Attorney General promulgate rules that deal with

things like the -- like prescriptions, scheduling of those 

drugs so that they are on schedule 2 or schedule 3 or 

perhaps --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me --


MR. ATKINSON: -- schedule 1.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- very odd to have a


regulation on dispensing that takes no account of the 

purpose for which the drug is being used.

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, we think it's somewhat

odder, frankly, Justice Kennedy, to suggest that Congress 

intended to authorize a single unelected Federal official 

to decide, in his sole and apparently un-reviewable 

discretion, that this medical practice, of which he 

disapproves, may not be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I give --

MR. ATKINSON: -- followed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you a statutory reference, 

and then you tell me about something else.

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, no, I -- we agree that he 

gets to authorize regulations on dispensation -- to 

require, for example, that there be prescriptions before 

it be dispensed, that physicians shall follow certain 

rules and regulations before they dispense, and those are 

the kinds of things on which we agree he has the authority 

to engage in rulemaking and to -- and to promulgate 

uniform --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, on that, I didn't 

think that the reg was defining the word "dispense." I 

thought the statute defines the word "dispense." And it's 

-- persons registered by the AG to dispense controlled 

substances are exempt. And then you look at who is such a 

person. A person who does that is a practitioner. And 

who is a practitioner? A registered practitioner is one 

who prescribes, a physician registered by the United

States to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in 

the course of professional practice. And I thought this 

reg is defining "in the course of professional practice." 

Am I wrong about that? I thought it was a reg that says, 

"In the course of professional practice, the prescription, 

to be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by 

an individual practitioner." Now, I might be wrong. How 

does it work?

 MR. ATKINSON: No, I think that's absolutely 

right. But the question -- that is a very different 

question from the question of, Who gets to define, as a 

matter of policy, what is a "legitimate medical practice"?

 JUSTICE BREYER: On the matter of policy, I 

would -- since -- if you -- if you've said basically what 

you want to say in your argument, I would appreciate your 

devoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to 

agree with. But suppose I were to assume that a State is 

not free, through the device of defining what's good 

medical practice, to gut the Act -- that is, to really 

make marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal --

because they disagree with Congress's basic judgment that 

it should be illegal. That could happen.

 MR. ATKINSON: It could.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose I think that the 

AG does have the power to stop Congress from gutting the

Act. All right? Now, on that, do I have -- if I believe 

that, on that assumption, do I have to decide this case 

against you?

 MR. ATKINSON: No.


 JUSTICE BREYER: And if not, why not?


 MR. ATKINSON: There are at least two reasons


for that, Justice Breyer. The first is the commerce-

clause question, which we believe to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose, on the commerce-clause 

question, I -- on assumption, I don't agree with you, 

either -- then do I have to decide?

 [Laughter.] 

MR. ATKINSON: I'm starting to be backed into a 

corner.

 [Laughter.] 

MR. ATKINSON: I think -- I think the third 

answer then becomes the procedural answer, Justice Breyer, 

and that is that what the U.S. Attorney General is doing 

here violates the rule this Court stated in Christensen 

versus Harris County, and he is attempting to do, by an 

administrative rule, what he can only do by notice in 

comment rulemaking.

found it different, in life and law, when you pass a rule 

in a State that guts an Act, from when you pass the rule 

in a State that doesn't seem to have much to do with the 

purpose of the Act.

 MR. ATKINSON: Well, I certainly would not 

disagree with that in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you would. I think --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me -- it seems to 

me that you -- that you cannot accept the premise that it 

guts the Act, if you come in here with the proposition, 

which you do, that what the Act says is: whatever is 

accepted medical practice within the State is okay. 

That's your principal point.

 MR. ATKINSON: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the Act does not refer to 

any overall Federal accepted medical practice. It refers 

to accepted medical practice, State by State. And, 

therefore, it in no way guts the Act if a State wants to 

let these drugs be used for, you know, make-people-happy 

purposes. I don't see how you can accept the premise.

 MR. ATKINSON: I wasn't anxious to accept it, 

Justice Scalia, but I --

told to. Let me --

MR. ATKINSON: -- but let me -- let me offer, if 

I can -- we --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, in -- Mr. 

Atkinson, in response to the question you were just asked, 

you said there were procedural problems, no notice in 

comment. So, that's a "how" it's done.

 MR. ATKINSON: That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the "who"? Is this 

something -- how does it work under the Controlled 

Substance Act? What authority does the Department of HHS 

have? What is the division of authority between those two 

under the Act? The Attorney General, on the one hand, and 

the Department of Health and Human Services, and including 

the FDA, on the other.

 MR. ATKINSON: Justice Ginsburg, I can't answer 

that question in specific respect to this case, because 

there is no authority in the Controlled Substances Act for 

anyone to do what has been done here -- that is, to focus 

on the specific medical practice and say, "No controlled 

substance" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you made --

MR. ATKINSON: -- "can be used for" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you made a point earlier

that the Attorney General has never done this before, has 

never said, "You can't prescribe particular drugs for" --

has -- that has not been done. You've been giving 

examples of where the FDA ruled that you can't --

MR. ATKINSON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- use a drug. And that 

control is nationwide, no matter what the State medical 

board thinks, right?

 MR. ATKINSON: Yes. There is -- there are --

for example, in scheduling of drugs -- and the U.S. 

Attorney General suggests, for example, that he could 

simply schedule these drugs in a way to -- as a way of 

avoiding the Oregon Act -- or voiding the Oregon Act, as 

it were. And, to do that, he has to get his medical and 

scientific advice from the Secretary of Health and 

Services, and must accept that advice and be bound by it. 

And certainly, that wasn't done in this case. So, I hope 

that answers your question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who -- the consultation, you 

said, was not with HHS, and it wasn't with Oregon? Who 

did the Attorney General consult?

 MR. ATKINSON: To the best of our knowledge, it 

was solely done within the Department of Justice.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May ask this question 

concerning the -- Justice Scalia's suggestion that you're

insisting the States would have the authority to act 

independently of a congressional prohibition against the 

use of a substance to make people happy and so forth. 

Isn't your point in this case that Congress hasn't really 

spoken to the issue to which the Attorney General has 

spoken?

 MR. ATKINSON: That's exactly right, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is the opposite of the 

case that Justice Scalia point, where the Congress has 

spoken to the issue.

 MR. ATKINSON: And there are circumstances in 

which it has, and those in which it has not. And to try 

to respond to Justice Scalia's point, again I would invoke 

the 200 years of responsible regulation of the practice of 

medicine, which is the backdrop against which Congress 

legislated in this case. Congress does not lightly 

assume, nor should it, that States are going to -- are 

going to simply legalize drugs to make people happy. It 

hasn't happened. Congress doesn't assume it's going to 

happen. States act responsibly. Congress assumes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in 1971 

Congress didn't assume the States were going to pass 

legislation for use of drugs to assist with suicide, 

either.

 MR. ATKINSON: No, that's certainly true, Mr. 

Chief Justice. But Congress knew, as we all know, that 

the practice of medicine evolves, that things change, that 

today's -- acupuncture, the use of Botox, things that were 

unheard of 30 years ago, are all accepted medical 

practices today, and they are all regulated by the States, 

not by the U.S. Attorney General. And the question here 

is whether Congress intended to enact a uniform medical 

practices --

JUSTICE SCALIA: These are all different manners 

of assisting people to stay alive or assisting people to 

feel better. Assisting people to die is something of a 

totally different category.

 MR. ATKINSON: Justice Scalia, I have to 

disagree. There's a great deal of medical practice now, 

and attention, focused on end-of-life issues. This Court 

has seen them. For example, in Cruzan, the Court said it 

is a matter for the States to decide those things. The 

Court has seen cases that involve do-not-resuscitate 

orders. The Court is familiar with living wills. There 

are any number of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't deny that. I -- I'm 

not taking a position on whether, you know, a State wants 

to allow it, or not. I'm just taking a position on 

whether it was envisioned by Congress, in 1971, that

accepted medical practice would include prescribing drugs 

to help somebody end his life. And I don't think it -- I 

don't think it would have occurred to Congress.

 MR. ATKINSON: I don't think that it would have 

occurred to them either, Justice Scalia, but I do think 

what occurred to them was that that was a matter that, 

like any other matter dealing with the regulation of 

medical practice, the States could be trusted to act 

responsibly. That's what Oregon has done here. That's 

what this Court invited the States to do in Glucksberg.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it you would agree 

that, in effect, all you need to win on the statutory 

argument is for us to accept the premise that Congress may 

very well have intended to interfere with the practice of 

medicine and to authorize the Attorney General to do it, 

insofar as the practice of medicine would have gutted the 

statute -- e.g., doctors who prescribe recreational drugs, 

doctors who, in effect, cater to pushers -- but that 

Congress did not intend to go any further than that in 

authorizing interference with the practice of medicine. I 

take it you agree that if we accepted that premise, that 

would be sufficient for you in this case.

 MR. ATKINSON: That's absolutely true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. ATKINSON: That's absolutely true, Justice

Souter. But -- this case is obviously about statutory 

construction, but it's about statutory construction in a 

very special area, and that is the area of federalism, of 

the relationship between the sovereign States and the 

Federal Government. We think it's clear, from examining 

the statute, that Congress intended to retain and respect 

the historic powers of the States to define legitimate 

medical practices.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think Respondents have embraced the logical 

consequences of their position. And what it results in is 

turning the Controlled Substances Act, the federal 

Controlled Substances Act, into an odd patchwork. It also 

is profoundly a-historical, because, at the time of the 

Harrison Act of 1914 -- which the Controlled Substances 

Act was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this Court 

pointed out in Moore -- at that time, the States had a 

variety of different approaches to opium and heroin and 

other -- and cocaine and other substances -- opium and

cocaine now of which land on schedule 2. Some of them 

tightly regulated them, some of them allowed them in over-

the-counter tonics in large quantities. And the point of 

the Harrison Act was to clean that up and impose a uniform 

Federal regime. And they knew it would have an impact on 

State regulation of medicine. And even the Court, in the 

Linder days, recognize that that was not, per se, a 

constitutional problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what about gutting? Never 

mind Mr. Atkinson's argument. What about gutting?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it's an odd statutory --

I mean, I'm not familiar with the -- with the principle 

that the Federal authority only extends to prevent that 

which would gut the statute, and no further. That seems 

like an odd principle. And I think that, here, it is a 

perfectly legitimate interpretation of this statute to say 

that a Congress that was profoundly concerned with 

overdoses, with suicide, with drug abuse, precisely 

because of its debilitating effect on people's lives, 

would not have been agnostic at the prospect of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At the time --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- controlled substances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- at the time this 

statute was passed to deal with lax State treatment of 

opium, was opium regulated as part of medical practice in

any of the States?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It was, Mr. Chief Justice. 

They were all over the map, but there was clearly a 

recognition that doctors were part and parcel of the 

problem, that there were needs in States to more closely 

regulate both the doctors and the pharmacies. That was, 

kind of, the two problems that gave rise to this. And 

there's no question that the impact of the Federal program 

was profound on the State's practice of medicine. 

Nonetheless, that program was upheld, and that has been 

the tradition in this area.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the impact profound 

because they were in what's now schedule 1, that they were 

just prohibited? In other words, were doctors allowed to 

prescribe opium for some purposes?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: They were. And opium's now on 

schedule 2. The Harrison Act did not have the schedules 

we're familiar with from the Controlled Substance. But 

most of what was at issue -- I mean, opium, in its various 

forms, morphine, all of that of that is now on schedule 2, 

and that's really what prompted the Harrison Act in the 

first instance.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question? 

If the Attorney General determined that acupuncture was 

conduct that threatened the public health and safety,

could he de-license, or revoke, the license of doctors who 

engaged in acupuncture?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice 

Stevens. It's the same reason as my answer earlier, which 

is, I think you have to look at this regime, and read it 

in light of the 90 years of Federal involvement in the 

regulation of controlled substances and the lack of a 

traditional Federal role in regulating medicine qua 

medicine. And I think this is on the -- on the side of 

the line of regulating controlled substances.

 With respect to the commerce-clause issue, I 

would -- thought that one thing that came clear out of the 

Raich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is 

not the class of activities that a State decides to 

decriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that 

Congress decides to regulate.

 And with respect to schedule 2 substances, I 

would think this case is a fortiori. We're not talking 

about substances that are homegrown and are never part of 

a commercial transaction. And even those who were in the 

dissent in Raich, I think, would think that this was an 

appropriate commerce-clause application. This case is to 

Raich as the regulation of commercial farming would be to 

Wickard against Filburn. It is a much different 

situation. Congress's commerce-clause power is more

robust here.

 I wanted to remark and focus for a minute on 

what an odd statute Oregon has passed. The practitioner 

respondents point out it is a prescribing law only. And 

Oregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the 

prescription, but not the administration, of these 

substances.

 Even what Oregon does, does not purport to be 

medicine, as one traditionally understands it. I can 

think of no other medical substance where a doctor can 

prescribe it, but not administer it. And I think if you 

look at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is 

that Oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to 

basically take a Federal regulatory regime that allows 

doctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances.

 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General 

Clement.

 The case is submitted.
