3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear case 

4 next in Case 10-1001, Martinez v. Ryan.

 Mr. Bartels. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. BARTELS 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. BARTELS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 In Arizona, almost all State and Federal 

11 claims for relief from a criminal conviction are 

12 raisable in the Arizona Court of Appeals on direct 

13 appeal. 

14  However, a claim that trial counsel was 

ineffective must be presented first to a trial court in 

16 what Arizona labels a postconviction relief proceeding. 

17  Petitioner agrees entirely with Arizona's 

18 requirement that ineffective assistance of trial counsel 

19 claims go initially to a trial court, and he does not 

object to the label "postconviction relief" as such. 

21  The issue in the case has to do with 

22 Arizona's insistence that Petitioner had no right to 

23 counsel with respect to the postconviction first-tier 

24 review, portion of first-tier review, even though he did 

have a right to counsel in the appeal portion of direct

1 review. 

2  And our position is that that distinction 

3 between what are two portions of the first opportunity 

4 for review of a conviction, broken up sensibly but by 

the dictate of the State into two parts, that that 

6 distinction cannot stand, especially in a case in which 

7 the first postconviction proceeding started and ended 

8 before anything of substance --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you --

MR. BARTELS: -- happened in the direct 

11 appeal. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If your main position is 

13 right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings? 

14 I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the 

claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by 

16 a trial judge first, not an appellate judge. And yet in 

17 2255 proceedings, if you're urging ineffective 

18 assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right 

19 to counsel. In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be 

appointed only if the court determines that the 

21 interests of justice so require. So, the proposition 

22 you're urging would have ramifications in the Federal 

23 system as well, wouldn't it? 

24  MR. BARTELS: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, 2255 would no

1 longer be the interests of justice so require because if 

2 it's your first opportunity to raise the point, the 

3 court must appoint counsel for you. That's your view? 

4  MR. BARTELS: In a situation -- the Federal 

system is a little more complicated than Arizona, though 

6 not much, because of Massaro. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because of the what? 

8  MR. BARTELS: Our position would be, in the 

9 Federal system, if -- if a Federal defendant wished to 

file a 2255, that he would be entitled to appointed 

11 counsel but, as far as this case is concerned, only with 

12 respect to any claim of ineffective assistance of trial 

13 counsel. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you want us to hold that 

there is a right to counsel whenever a petitioner 

16 asserts a claim that could not have been asserted at an 

17 earlier point in the proceedings? 

18  MR. BARTELS: Yes, Your Honor, with the 

19 caveat: If the State allows that kind of proceeding. 

One of the things I have a hard time keeping track of in 

21 this context is, unlike the right to counsel at trial, 

22 the Sixth Amendment right, where I think they have to 

23 give him a trial, we're dealing in a context where this 

24 Court made clear well over 100 years ago that there 

doesn't have to be any review at all. The State --

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: That's a very far-reaching 

2 proposition that extends well beyond claims of 

3 ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it? 

4  MR. BARTELS: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If many years after someone 

6 is convicted an allegation is made that the prosecution 

7 failed to turn over exculpatory evidence and that the 

8 information supporting the claim has just recently come 

9 to light and could not have been previously discovered, 

there would be a right to counsel there. 

11  MR. BARTELS: If the State --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: That would be the case? 

13  MR. BARTELS: If the State provided that 

14 proceeding, that -- and the State would not have to. 

The State could have statutes of limitation or rules 

16 against successive petitions that could be extremely 

17 strict if they're concerned about that. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would it be 

19 successive if it could not have been raised earlier?

 MR. BARTELS: Your Honor, as I understand 

21 the situation, we've got newly discovered evidence of 

22 perhaps a Brady violation. In that situation, if the 

23 State provides a proceeding for review of that, and it 

24 is the first opportunity for review, I think the 

implication of Douglas and Halbert is there would be a 

6

1 right to counsel. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the State doesn't, 

3 but the Federal government does? I mean, what if you 

4 say, you know, there's no State habeas available; you go 

straight to Federal habeas? 

6  MR. BARTELS: I think that's correct, Your 

7 Honor. In the Federal system --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you haven't really given 

9 us a solution for the States. They can't -- they can't 

stop this thing. Right? 

11  MR. BARTELS: Well, but the Federal system 

12 itself has a statute of limitation, though I believe 

13 that the statute would probably begin to run, in Justice 

14 Alito's hypothetical, with the discovery of a Brady 

violation. And so, the Federal courts have set up the 

16 statute of limitation to accommodate that claim. And 

17 the States would be free to do that, too, if they 

18 wished. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if you are 

permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not 

21 have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel 

22 limited to that point, or can the counsel representing 

23 the client bring up other things? 

24  MR. BARTELS: No, Your Honor. The right to 

counsel would apply only to the first-tier review issue.

1 And so, for example, if counsel finds other issues and 

2 wants to pursue them, the State could say: We're not 

3 going to pay you for those. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But could it be that the 

counsel could also bring up a Brady claim, newly 

6 discovered evidence? So wouldn't be limited to 

7 ineffective assistance of counsel. 

8  MR. BARTELS: The holding in this case will 

9 be so limited, but I would agree that Douglas and 

Halbert would imply that Brady would -- at least many 

11 Brady claims would be such that the 2255 or the State 

12 postconviction would be the first opportunity --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: What if the --

14  MR. BARTELS: -- to present.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. What if the 

16 ineffective assistance of counsel claim is closely 

17 related to other claims that petitioner wants to raise 

18 in an initial postconviction relief proceeding? Counsel 

19 at trial was ineffective for failing to do A, B, C, and 

D, and all of those are bases for relief. And now I 

21 want to argue with new counsel in the first 

22 postconviction proceeding not only that counsel was 

23 ineffective at trial but also that all of these other 

24 claims are meritorious.

 Are you saying that the counsel that -- to

1 whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making 

2 only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and 

3 cannot go on and represent the petitioner on these other 

4 claims?

 MR. BARTELS: I'm saying, Your Honor, that 

6 the State does not have any duty to pay the lawyer in 

7 those circumstances. 

8  Now, the kind of situation you're talking 

9 about I think is most likely to come up where --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a question of 

11 pay. I think Justice Alito was asking, counsel says: 

12 I've got a duty to represent my client zealously. So, I 

13 want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of 

14 counsel but these other matters.

 MR. BARTELS: Your Honor, I think the 

16 appointment could be limited to the first-tier review 

17 issues. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I don't 

19 -- I don't understand how that works. The claim is, 

say, for example, you were ineffective because you 

21 didn't raise a Batson claim. Surely, he gets to pursue 

22 the Batson claim once he establishes ineffectiveness --

23  MR. BARTELS: Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact, 

24 in that example, pursuing the ineffective assistance 

claim requires pursuing the Batson claim.

2 lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel 

3 not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness 

4 argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to 

which he was ineffective. 

6  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, in the 

7 situation in which the ineffectiveness of counsel is 

8 based on the failure to make a Batson claim, the failure 

9 to make an objection at trial, I would agree with you, 

absolutely. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: But what --

12  MR. BARTELS: In my experience --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about other claims 

14 that -- that don't follow on? I mean, other -- other 

claimed errors in the trial. You say the State doesn't 

16 have to pay for that representation. Does counsel keep 

17 time sheets on --

18  MR. BARTELS: Yes, Your Honor. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the various issues, 

12-minute intervals? 

21  MR. BARTELS: Yes, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: And the State pays for some 

23 issues and not for other issues? 

24  MR. BARTELS: Absolutely, Your Honor. That 

happens routinely in the State system. The appointed

1 counsel have to submit detailed billing statements --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does this work now, 

3 counsel? How are you proposing this work? Right now, 

4 in the Federal system, a pro se litigant comes in and 

says, I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. 

6 Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an 

7 affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the 

8 claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a 

9 hearing. Under your theory, every State would be 

obligated to appoint counsel ab initio to check out 

11 whether there is the potential for an IAC claim? 

12  MR. BARTELS: Well, I think the States could 

13 run this in different ways. The way in which Arizona 

14 does it makes sense to me, which is that the -- there is 

a form, Form 24(b). It's a very simple form. It 

16 doesn't require stating any substantive grounds. It 

17 really just says, I would like to challenge my 

18 conviction through postconviction relief, in the very 

19 same way that notices of appeal.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what you are 

21 essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint 

22 an attorney on the first leg? 

23  MR. BARTELS: Every State is obligated to 

24 treat these, what are really parts of the appeal, the 

initial appeal, in the same way they do the rest of

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is a huge 

3 reliance interest that has developed since Finley and 

4 its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint 

postconviction counsel. 

6  MR. BARTELS: Your Honor --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What are we going to do 

8 about that reliance interest and the burdens on States? 

9  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess 

I would say two things about that. One, there are a 

11 fair number of States that do appoint counsel routinely 

12 upon request. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I know --

14  MR. BARTELS: Arizona is one.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know for a fact that 

16 most do in capital cases. But I don't know if that's 

17 the same figure for non-capital cases. 

18  MR. BARTELS: I don't know the percentage, 

19 Your Honor, but I know there are several States. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand. Could 

21 you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor 

22 asked? She said: What happens in Arizona? You said a 

23 prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone 

24 through his first round of appeal. He is given a form, 

which you said is a simple form: Do you want to proceed

1 in collateral review? And he answers yes. Then does 

2 Arizona appoint a lawyer or not? 

3  MR. BARTELS: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then what are 

we arguing about? He had his lawyer. 

6  MR. BARTELS: He didn't have an effective 

7 lawyer. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. So, now you're talking 

9 about the second round. You're talking about does he 

have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the 

11 first lawyer that they gave him on collateral review was 

12 ineffective? 

13  MR. BARTELS: No, Your Honor, that is not 

14 the issue in this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the issue? 

16  MR. BARTELS: The issue in this case is 

17 whether the ineffectiveness of the first postconviction 

18 counsel --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. BARTELS: -- constitutes cause to 

21 excuse --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, why --

23 that's what I thought, actually. And I don't understand 

24 what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing 

something, about whether they're all going to have to

Official 

1 appoint lawyers or not in these different States. It 

2 seems to me that has nothing to do with this case. 

3  This case comes out of a State that does 

4 appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your 

client, should have from your point of view at least one 

6 full, effective chance to say: Every lawyer I have been 

7 appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible. 

8 And -- or whether the State can block that from being 

9 heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and 

the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even 

11 raise. That's the issue; is that it? 

12  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, we're 

13 actually, once we take it past two, I -- I'm not on 

14 board with the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But I'm not --

16 I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim. I'm saying 

17 maybe that's right. Maybe he's not going to win the 

18 claim, probably. But the question is, if his claim is 

19 in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 

proceedings and every one of them was absolutely 

21 ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it 

22 and say, oh, I see, he's claiming he's never had one 

23 full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was 

24 ineffective because the other 19 were just as bad. I 

have to look at it if I'm a trial judge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

6  MR. BARTELS: That's not my argument. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Now let's start at ground 

8 zero. Sorry. Everyone else --

9  (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that where your 

11 argument leads, to the proposition that you can never 

12 procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective 

13 assistance of counsel claim? 

14  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, on a 

theoretical level, I don't think this Court's decisions 

16 in Douglas and Ross and Halbert give us a clear answer 

17 about whether there's a right to effective assistance of 

18 second postconviction counsel. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we want to know what 

rule you're advocating in this case. 

21  MR. BARTELS: I --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: We want to know why you're 

23 not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito 

24 indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous 

counsel were ineffective. You say, oh, no, you're not

1 arguing that. What is the rule that you are arguing 

2 for? What limiting principle do you have so that we do 

3 not have an endless right of counsel? 

4  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

theory that you get counsel for first-tier review limits 

6 it to that first tier, because when you go after the 

7 effectiveness of this -- of the first postconviction 

8 counsel, that is necessarily going to involve review of 

9 the effectiveness of trial counsel --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- I understand that. 

11 But what is it that prevents the Petitioner from saying 

12 that the first counsel in the collateral proceeding was 

13 ineffective and that so was the second? 

14  MR. BARTELS: Your Honor, I don't think 

there's a right to a counsel and therefore not a right 

16 to effective counsel in the second --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: But you can -- you can have 

18 a -- you don't have to give him a counsel. Look, the 

19 State did give him a counsel on first collateral review; 

that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise 

21 the claim my trial counsel was no good. 

22  Now we go to the next round. The State 

23 says: I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we're not 

24 giving you a lawyer anymore. Okay. That may count. He 

now has to know he has to make the argument himself.

1 And, therefore, he goes and makes the argument himself, 

2 and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all 

3 wrong. He's not blocked. 

4  MR. BARTELS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, what --

6 there isn't an issue in this case about giving people 

7 counsel, on that view. There is an issue about if you 

8 do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have 

9 an argument later that you did it ineffectively. That's 

a different matter; that's a question of whether you're 

11 blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim. 

12  All right, forget it. I will ask the 

13 other --

14  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, I think I'm 

on the same page with that example. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: But there can't be a 

18 claim --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But can I -- can I leave 

this argument with the -- with the judgment that you've 

21 offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings 

22 there must be --

23  MR. BARTELS: Well --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- before there's an end 

to the argument that previous counsel were inadequate?

principle. 

6  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if you want to say 

8 there shouldn't be, then that's fine. 

9  MR. BARTELS: No, Your Honor, there should 

be. And the merits -- the Petitioner's merits brief 

11 devoted quite a few pages to both the theoretical 

12 problems with the infinite continuum of litigation and 

13 the practical limitations. 

14  And let me -- let me turn to the practical 

ones. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Bartels, before you 

17 do that, I mean, I understood you to be saying that you 

18 would draw a line after the first postconviction 

19 proceeding.

 MR. BARTELS: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that correct? 

22  MR. BARTELS: That's correct.

3 McKane, to draw the line anywhere it pleases. It could 

4 just say you get one postconviction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What I understand you to be 

6 saying is exactly that. A line has to be drawn 

7 somewhere. Enough is enough; it can't go on forever. 

8  MR. BARTELS: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: And the sensible place to 

draw the line, in your view, is after the first-tier 

11 review. That's your argument, right? 

12  MR. BARTELS: Yes, Your Honor, because I --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: But the problem with that is 

14 that you can answer that by saying, yes, we have to draw 

a line someplace; and the Court has already done it, and 

16 it did it in Douglas, and it said it was after the first 

17 tier of review on direct appeal. It's exactly the same 

18 argument, except where the law stands now the line is 

19 drawn at a different place on the same principle.

 MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: It has to be drawn 

22 someplace. 

23  MR. BARTELS: That principle doesn't work 

24 very well in a system like Arizona's where you can't

6 raise it on collateral review; you have to raise it on 

7 direct appeal. 

8  MR. BARTELS: As long as --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is very 

unworkable, because if you're arguing ineffective 

11 assistance of counsel in a direct proceeding, presumably 

12 it's usually the same counsel; he's not likely to bring 

13 the claim. That would be worse for criminal 

14 defendants --

MR. BARTELS: Well --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- than the 

17 system that's there now. 

18  MR. BARTELS: No, Your Honor. I -- the --

19 if direct appeal is now going to encompass possible 

claims of ineffective assistance, you're not going to be 

21 able to have the same counsel on appeal. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

23 person --

4  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, that's not 

true in Arizona.
 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Arizona, the
 

7 usual case in criminal cases is that somebody else
 

8 handles the appeal on direct proceedings?
 

9  MR. BARTELS: It may be from the same
 

office. But -- but I agree that that would have to 

11 change if ineffective assistance of counsel were part of 

12 the direct appeal. 

13  And the other thing that would have to be 

14 done -- and this is done in some States -- is that you 

have to raise it in direct appeal, but most -- as this 

16 Court recognized in Massaro -- most ineffective 

17 assistance claims can't be dealt with on direct appeal 

18 because of a lack of evidence. They need more evidence. 

19 So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, ineffective 

21 assistance of appellate counsel certainly can't be dealt 

22 with on direct appeal, right? 

23  MR. BARTELS: No, that's correct.

different counsel to -- to take the appeal --

1  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you could always claim 

3 that that counsel was ineffective in habeas, right? 

4  MR. BARTELS: Your Honor, I -- two things 

about that: First of all, the State does not have to 

6 provide the review of the effectiveness of appellate 

7 counsel. If it does so, I would still say that that's 

8 going to end up having to be second-opportunity review 

9 of the claims that appellate counsel failed to raise. 

That's got to be the basis for --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: If there's a right to 

12 counsel whenever someone asserts a claim that couldn't 

13 have been raised earlier, why does the State not have 

14 the obligation to provide counsel to contest the 

constitutionality of the representation that was 

16 provided on appeal? 

17  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

18 reason is that -- in terms of this first-tier, 

19 second-tier analysis from Douglas and Halbert, you're 

not going to be able to look at the effectiveness of 

21 appellate counsel without looking at the issue of 

22 prejudice. And that's going to require what is 

23 second-opportunity review of the merits of the claim 

24 that the appellate lawyer didn't raise. But that's the 

second opportunity for that review, because the direct

1 appeal was the first opportunity. 

2  I think in the end, though, just a Mathews 

3 v. Eldridge procedural due process analysis works 

4 better. And the critical factor is what's the risk of 

an error in the absence of counsel? 

6  Well, the first time around, the risk of 

7 error involves what's the probability that the trial 

8 judge made a mistake that's prejudicial? By the time we 

9 get to the postconviction challenging appellate 

counsel's effectiveness, now it's the probability that 

11 the trial judge was wrong and that the appellate lawyer 

12 was wrong. And so, it's exponentially lower and at 

13 least provides a basis for --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the trial judge 

doesn't have to be wrong for there to be an ineffective 

16 assistance of counsel claim at trial? 

17  MR. BARTELS: No. No, I'm sticking with the 

18 example of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I --

MR. BARTELS: Trial counsel -- I'm sorry. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: I wonder what you would say 

22 -- some of these statistics suggest that these claims 

23 succeed very, very rarely. So, by the analysis that you 

24 just used, this kind of balancing analysis, why we 

should even go so far as you would have us go?

Official 

1  MR. BARTELS: Well, Your Honor, the -- it 

2 would be because Douglas and Halbert have done that 

3 balancing and said in this situation, the first-tier 

4 review, the probability of an incorrect result without 

counsel is sufficiently high that there should be 

6 counsel. And that's really the disagreement between 

7 Justice Douglas and Justice Harlan in Douglas. Justice 

8 Harlan didn't think the lawyers mattered that much. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the -- postconviction 

application would go to the trial judge, right? And on 

11 the --

12  MR. BARTELS: Yes, Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: All right. So, go to the 

14 trial judge with this Anders type brief that doesn't 

raise ineffective assistance of counsel, but it's such 

16 an obvious claim to make that when the -- when the judge 

17 reviews that Anders brief, if the trial judge thought 

18 that this defendant was abysmally represented, wouldn't 

19 the -- wouldn't the court say: Sorry, I'm not going to 

accept this Anders brief. It seems to me that you --

21 there was a flagrant ineffective assistance of counsel, 

22 and you should have raised that. That's a -- that's a 

23 viable issue. So, I'm not going to accept your brief.

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, if the judge reviews 

the Anders brief, really thought there was an
 

6 ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a valid one,
 

7 the judge would have spotted the issue, and it would
 

8 have been -- and it would have been argued on that
 

9 first --

MR. BARTELS: Are we talking about the 

11 Martinez case itself, Your Honor? 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. In the Martinez 

13 case, there was an Anders brief, right? 

14  MR. BARTELS: There was, Your Honor, but 

it's nothing but a summary of the trial transcript and 

16 provides no basis for the trial court -- the problem 

17 with ineffective trial --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't the trial 

19 court -- I mean, the excuse -- the excuse of counsel is 

not automatic; the trial judge has to look at it and 

21 say, yes, there's -- there's no issue for you to pursue; 

22 so, I'm going to excuse you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT E. CATTANI 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

7  MR. CATTANI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

8 please the Court: 

9  I would like to focus on three points. 

First, Petitioner is advocating a significant change to 

11 this Court's jurisprudence that does implicate the 

12 State's reliance interest on Finley and Giarratano. 

13  It's not a modest change --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cattani, could I ask 

about your interests here? Because your State is one 

16 that does appoint counsel; so, you already have the cost 

17 there. I'm just wondering -- in your brief, you talk a 

18 lot about the excessive costs that this would impose on 

19 you. And I'm just wondering where those costs come from 

if you appoint counsel already. And I know some other 

21 States are in a different situation, but as to you, 

22 where do the costs come from? 

23  MR. CATTANI: I think they come primarily 

24 from the logical extension of the rule that would 

require a second postconviction proceeding to litigate 

26

Official 

1 claims of ineffective assistance of first postconviction 

2 counsel. Right now, those claims are routinely rejected 

3 under Finley and Giarratano because there's no --

4 there's no constitutional right to counsel. Under --

under the theory and -- I don't think there's really 

6 been advanced a principled basis for limiting the rule 

7 that's been advanced. And, certainly, under --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if we just said there 

9 is -- you know, we can only draw a line in this context, 

and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where 

11 it sticks. What are the additional costs to you? 

12  MR. CATTANI: Well, the additional costs 

13 would -- would be implicated with a second 

14 postconviction proceeding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that -- it's only 

16 a cost if that second counsel, however it's secured, can 

17 actually make a credible or sustainable claim that 

18 appellate counsel, the first-tier counsel, was 

19 ineffective.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I think it's the nature 

21 of ineffective assistance claims. They are easy to 

22 raise and difficult to litigate. It's -- it's not 

23 difficult to raise -- to assert ineffective assistance. 

24 It's -- it's very obvious in the context of capital 

cases where -- where an assertion is my attorney was

6 routinely. 

7  MR. CATTANI: Pardon me. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Federal courts handle 

9 them routinely on papers, and most of them are denied. 

Is the State system different? Where first-level 

11 counsel, appellate counsel, postconviction counsel 

12 raises ineffective assistance of trial counsel. How 

13 many of those cases end up in hearings? 

14  MR. CATTANI: I don't -- I don't have the 

statistics. They do not generally result in -- in 

16 evidentiary hearings. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. Very few.

19 Certainly, in capital cases, I think the majority do.

21 clarify the record for a second?

2 to prosecute the direct appeal. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What gave him the 

4 authority to file the 32 motion? Obviously, he didn't 

seek his client's approval, because the client when he 

6 received the motion said: I don't understand what 

7 you're saying; I only speak Spanish. 

8  So, what gave Levitt the authority to do 

9 what he did?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, she -- she was 

11 representing Mr. Martinez, and the rules allow the 

12 filing of a postconviction petition. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By an attorney appointed 

14 just on the direct review?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I don't think there was 

16 anything that would prevent her from representing him in 

17 -- in a number of different ways. If she saw something 

18 that she thought needed to be raised in a post --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what would have 

been -- what was the tactical advantage of doing what 

21 she did? What conceivable reason was there for her to 

22 file the Rule 32 motion before direct review finished? 

23  MR. CATTANI: Well, I don't know that there 

24 was necessarily a tactical reason. The reason would be 

in some cases that if an attorney views the case as

have, strategic or otherwise, to file the Rule 32 

6 motion? 

7  MR. CATTANI: I don't know that she had one. 

8 There was some indication in the record that there was 

9 some evidence that she wanted to raise an issue that the 

victim's diary would have contained some exculpatory 

11 information. And that would have been something that 

12 would have had to have been developed in a 

13 postconviction --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But she files 

essentially an Anders brief that says, I don't see 

16 anything. 

17  What was the -- what was the strategic 

18 reason for doing that? What conceivable strategic 

19 reason?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, if she thought that 

21 there would be a claim but, after looking at it further, 

22 decided that the claims were not colorable, is, I think, 

23 what happened in this instance. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it routine, or 

does it happen often, for lawyers who perceive a trial

1 issue that can only be raised on collateral review to 

2 think that it makes sense to raise that right away so 

3 that the appeal -- and then the appeal is delayed until 

4 that's resolved?

 MR. CATTANI: It is what happened in Arizona 

6 frequently, prior to the Spreitz decision. And, 

7 historically, counsel was allowed -- counsel were 

8 allowed to raise claims of ineffective assistance and 

9 stay the appeal. And that was the practice previously. 

So, it's not necessarily unusual that an attorney 

11 reviewing the record might decide that there's some 

12 issue that could be raised in postconviction. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. This is -- I'll 

14 not -- we'll say this is my argument. I don't want to 

make this your friend's argument. 

16  In Arizona, there was a trial, and defendant 

17 thinks trial counsel was inadequate. Then there was a 

18 collateral review, and Arizona appoints a lawyer for 

19 that. And after that, the Arizona courts thought, no, 

he was adequate at trial. This particular defendant 

21 wants to say that that lawyer was inadequate, too. In 

22 fact, it was the same one. Hardly surprising. All 

23 right? That's his view. 

24  Now, when he makes that argument in Federal 

court, I guess he's going to be met with the claim,

2 collateral review, it doesn't matter what that lawyer 

3 does. Is that right? 

4  MR. CATTANI: Well, I -- I think it's better 

viewed through the lens of procedural due process. If 

6 -- we're looking at what are the procedures that are 

7 available to a defendant to raise a claim of ineffective 

8 assistance of trial counsel. One of the ways that you 

9 can do that, that certainly goes a long way to 

satisfying procedural due process, is to appoint 

11 counsel. It could be accomplished without appointing 

12 counsel --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

14  MR. CATTANI: -- certainly, having some --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but don't -- don't 

16 guess where I'm going here because maybe nobody wants to 

17 go there. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Just follow the questions. 

The question is, if he tries to make the claim he does, 

21 want to say that my first lawyer was no good at trial, 

22 and my second lawyer, who by coincidence was the same in 

23 the collateral proceeding, was no good either, then the 

24 State comes in and says: You can't make that -- you 

can't make that argument now because we had a proceeding

1 called the collateral review proceeding. We didn't have 

2 to give you a lawyer there. But even if that lawyer was 

3 inadequate, you lose because we didn't have to give you 

4 one.

 Am I right about that? 

6  MR. CATTANI: Well --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: That's all I want to know. 

8  MR. CATTANI: Well, I think you're -- you're 

9 not right from the standpoint that we do have to provide 

procedural due process. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

12  MR. CATTANI: And so, the question is 

13 whether that was enough. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: All right -- no, no. You 

say -- I'll answer it. It is enough to give him a 

16 lawyer. Okay? It is enough. But you have to give him 

17 an adequate lawyer if you give him one. If you give him 

18 one. You don't have to give him one. But if you give 

19 him one, it has to be adequate. Now, what about that?

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I think that goes well 

21 beyond this Court's previous jurisprudence. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but would that 

23 -- it does. That's what I think we're at. Now, why not 

24 say this, that every defendant has to have one fair shot 

at claiming -- they can make the claim that his trial 

33

1 lawyer was inadequate? And the State doesn't have to 

2 give him a lawyer at collateral review, but if it does, 

3 then that lawyer, he can say, couldn't make that claim 

4 because he was inadequate. So, you say, fine, they can 

make that argument in habeas. I bet they never win it. 

6 But somebody might. He can make it. 

7  So, what would happen would be that the 

8 habeas judge in Federal habeas would read the piece of 

9 paper. He'd say, what's the ground for thinking this? 

And then he'd make his normal kinds of judgments. 

11  Now, what is -- is there anything wrong with 

12 that view? Is it absolutely blocked by precedent? It 

13 seems to me it would relieve the concerns of the States 

14 about worrying about having to appoint a lot of lawyers, 

and it gives him a fair shot to make his argument. 

16  MR. CATTANI: Well, I think it is blocked by 

17 precedent, certainly by Finley and Giarratano. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 

19  MR. CATTANI: The problem with just shifting 

-- because this Court has said that there is no right to 

21 counsel and thus no right to the effective assistance of 

22 counsel in both --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- that's 

24 where you'd have to make the exception. You'd say, if 

you give him a counsel, he does have the right to an

1 effective assistance of counsel insofar as the 

2 ineffectiveness would prevent him from raising a claim 

3 that, to be fair, the trial itself has to be -- has to 

4 -- he has to have that about the trial itself. That 

exception. There would be that exception. Now, is 

6 there something in those cases that blocks that 

7 exception? 

8  MR. CATTANI: Well, I think it does create 

9 an infinite continuum.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in a sense it does, 

11 but he's never going to win the infinite continuum. 

12  MR. CATTANI: Well, but the other problem 

13 with it is --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: You never have to give him 

a lawyer at all. 

16  MR. CATTANI: That's correct, but if you 

17 don't, then the problem is you shift over to Federal 

18 court, and on Federal habeas you're then -- you're then 

19 in the position of litigating claims that are untethered 

to any State court decision. And when we talk about 

21 whether it's blocked by current precedent, certainly 

22 under Edwards v. Carpenter to allege ineffective 

23 assistance as cause to overcome a procedural default, 

24 there's a requirement that you litigate that claim in 

State court.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: The question is whether 

2 there's cause external to the petitioner to overcome the 

3 procedural default. So, if you went down that road, 

4 would the petitioner representing himself or herself, 

not have to show that, I would have raised a claim of 

6 ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and I would 

7 have won on that, were it not for the fact that the 

8 State appointed counsel for me and led me astray and 

9 prevented me from raising this meritorious argument --

isn't that where that would have to go? 

11  MR. CATTANI: Well, I think it would, but 

12 it's even more problematic here in that the procedure is 

13 that the attorney files a notice, gives notice to the 

14 defendant that she's been unable to find any colorable 

claims and gives the defendant an opportunity to file 

16 his own pleading. So, it's -- it's somewhat illogical 

17 to think that if we just grant a second postconviction 

18 proceeding that the defendant is going to be in any 

19 better position than he's in, in this type of situation 

where he's advised that the attorney says, as is 

21 routinely the case, I'm unable to find colorable claims, 

22 and then the defendant is given an opportunity to file 

23 his own petition.

so on your own. 

6  How much time would the defendant have? How 

7 much time remained? 

8  MR. CATTANI: I don't recall the specific 

9 time. I believe it is in the brief. I'm sorry. I 

don't recall the number of days that were remaining. 

11 But, certainly, a defendant can request additional time 

12 if the period of time is very short at that point. 

13 Extensions are routinely granted in those circumstances. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cattani, if you handled 

this through the regular appeals process, the person 

16 would receive the benefit of counsel. Is that correct? 

17 Rather than shuttle this over to the postconviction 

18 review process? 

19  MR. CATTANI: Well, the person -- here he 

receives the benefit of counsel because it's appointed 

21 in Arizona. He receives the benefit of counsel. If 

22 your question is, would he be entitled to the effective

distinction this Court has drawn between direct review 

6 and collateral attacks is one that should be maintained.

following, because I think the procedure that Arizona is

9 that there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue 

and putting it in a different kind of process. So, 

11 suppose the State does this, and some States do it: 

12 They say, on -- in the direct appeal process, we're 

13 going to remand this issue back to the trial court 

14 because the trial court is good with the facts and can 

make an evaluation. But it is part of the direct appeal 

16 process, this -- this remand. Would the person then be 

17 entitled to effective assistance of counsel? 

18  MR. CATTANI: That's -- it's a difficult 

19 question. I -- I don't think they would, because I 

think it's still a collateral proceeding to address the 

21 -- the effectiveness of trial counsel. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though now it's part of 

23 the regular appeals process? It's just the way the --

24 because of the issues that we recognized in Massaro, the 

State has decided to structure things in this way?

1  MR. CATTANI: Well, I think more important 

2 than the -- than the label that's been put on it is the 

3 nature of the -- of the argument that's being advanced, 

4 and it's a collateral attack, whether it -- whether a 

State chooses to call it part of the appeal. What 

6 happened -- what happened in Arizona previously was 

7 that it would be --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, now you're creating a 

9 different rule. You're saying anything which somebody 

determines is appropriately raised as a collateral 

11 attack, even if there's been no first review of that 

12 question, there's no entitlement to counsel? 

13  MR. CATTANI: Well, I think that's the 

14 logical extension of what this Court announced in Finley 

v. -- Finley and Giarratano, that we've drawn this 

16 distinction between --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't think, as 

18 Justice Kennedy said, that we ever really considered 

19 that question in Finley and Giarratano because we were 

assuming there that all the things had been through the 

21 appeals process. 

22  MR. CATTANI: But I guess I'm not certain 

23 that the timing would make a difference of when -- of 

24 whether you had a direct appeal first or whether the 

collateral proceeding occurs first. In either case, the

1 collateral proceeding is a non-record-based attack on 

2 the conviction, as opposed to the direct review, which 

3 is a record-based review of the conviction. So, the 

4 timing I don't think is as important as the nature of 

what's happening; it's a non-record based attack on the 

6 conviction. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Kagan's 

8 question indicates that there are States, as you know, 

9 where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary 

hearing on IAC. And as I understand your answer, is if 

11 that happens, the proceedings that precede the 

12 resolution of the issue on direct appeal, being probably 

13 conducted by the same counsel who is taking the direct 

14 appeal, can be conducted and he can be -- and the 

counsel, he or she, can be inadequate in the conduct of 

16 those further inquiries. That seems to me very strange. 

17  MR. CATTANI: Well, I don't think we're 

18 suggesting that would be the desired outcome. And it's 

19 simply that drawing the distinction between 

collateral --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're suggesting that 

22 there's no constitutional right to effective assistance 

23 of counsel on direct, when he conducts some 

24 supplementary proceedings. That's very strange.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, I guess the suggestion

1 is that it's a collateral -- that's a collateral 

2 proceeding. If they -- if you stay the proceeding and 

3 go back and address ineffective assistance, that that 

4 would essentially be a collateral proceeding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You mean -- it makes no 

6 sense to me. That happens quite frequently on direct 

7 appeal where a variety of issues are raised, and the 

8 court -- the circuit courts or the appellate courts send 

9 it back to trial counsel to develop the record further. 

Your position is every time there's a sending back, that 

11 stops the need for effective counsel? 

12  MR. CATTANI: If they've sent something back 

13 for a new hearing, I think that's something different. 

14 I think you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that involved in this 

16 case? 

17  MR. CATTANI: -- at that point. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have to decide this 

19 for this case?

 MR. CATTANI: I don't think we need to. I 

21 think it's clear that --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's another case. It's --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the reason I think 

24 it's relevant is that if you were to say that there 

needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then

1 I would have asked you, what is the difference between 

2 this case and that case? So, that's the reason it's 

3 relevant to this case, because the difference is really 

4 just one of just labels.

 MR. CATTANI: Well, and that's why I think 

6 it's more important to -- to assess the inquiry that's 

7 being done, whether it's a collateral inquiry, as 

8 opposed to whether we're labeling it part of the -- the 

9 direct appeal or not. And if it is a collateral 

inquiry, then it makes more sense, I think, to -- to 

11 couch it in terms of this is collateral review. But, 

12 certainly, I think --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: There seems to be a 

14 rational line between collateral attack and attack in 

the same proceeding. I don't see anything irrational 

16 about that. Right? 

17  MR. CATTANI: No --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes! 

19  MR. CATTANI: Yes, I agree. Yes.

 (Laughter.) 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain to me, 

22 why don't we consider this adverse to your proceeding, 

23 because this postconviction proceeding -- it began and 

24 it began at the same time as the direct appeal, but it 

ended before this case became final.

1  So, it was the first -- it was the first 

2 tier because it was decided before the direct appeal. 

3  MR. CATTANI: Well, it is a first-tier 

4 collateral attack. I would agree that it's a first 

tier. That's the first time that this issue is raised 

6 in a collateral attack. But I don't -- I don't think 

7 that's determinative of the issue here. 

8  This Court has never -- has never said that 

9 every claim that can only be raised for the first time 

entitles someone to -- to counsel. And that exception, 

11 that would -- that would swallow the rule. In Arizona, 

12 in most States where the types of claims that can be 

13 raised in postconviction proceedings are generally 

14 limited to claims that could not have been raised 

earlier. 

16  So, the rule that Petitioner is seeking 

17 really would swallow -- the exception would swallow the 

18 rule that was announced in -- in Finley -- and 

19 Giarratano.

24  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

44
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

2 please the Court: 

3  Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, I want to go 

4 to your questions about the costs, because there are 

some very real costs here. We live in a world that is 

6 settled and working. Although this Court has drawn the 

7 line at the first direct appeal, 47 States, D.C., and 

8 the Federal Government provide counsel in a first 

9 postconviction proceeding, either as of right or in the 

discretion of the trial court or the public defender. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Forty-seven do and the 

12 Federal Government does? 

13  MR. WALL: That's right. So, there are 18 

14 States that provide it as of right; 29 States and D.C. 

provide it in the discretion of the trial court or the 

16 public defender, and then the Federal Government, 

17 obviously, in the discretion of the district courts. 

18  And so, what Petitioner is doing, by 

19 constitutionalizing that area, is shifting resources to 

a subset of ineffectiveness claims. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's pretty --

22 it's small comfort to the lawyer -- the client who 

23 doesn't get one that everybody else does. 

24  MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I understand, 

but I think this is an area where States are permitted 

45

25

Official 

1 to draw different lines. And what Petitioner is saying 

2 -- take the Federal system, for example. Petitioner's 

3 rule would say a Federal prisoner can walk in under 

4 2255, and by making an allegation of ineffectiveness of 

either trial or appellate counsel, he's entitled to 

6 appointed counsel without even, I take it, a showing of 

7 colorableness. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, not if you adopt the 

9 -- the one-proceeding rule that I think counsel for the 

Petitioner was suggesting. He suggested Arizona is one 

11 of those few States where you could only raise this 

12 issue on collateral, and, therefore, you are entitled to 

13 effective assistance of counsel on that collateral. 

14 Then he would stop there, for statistical and for --

reasons, probability reasons, rather. 

16  MR. WALL: I think that's exactly where he 

17 would stop. I think it's very difficult to explain why 

18 his rule doesn't require him to go further, because by 

19 saying the first tier is not a stage of a case, as this 

Court has always meant it, but it applies claim by 

21 claim, and lawyers are going to represent you only on 

22 some claims, and you're -- pro se you'll file others, he 

23 ends up with two problems. 

24  One, he has to concede, as he does in his 

reply brief and as he did in response to Justice Alito, 

46

Official 

1 that he's going to say the same thing with regard to a 

2 lot of other claims that are typically raised in habeas; 

3 and, second, he can't find a limiting principle. 

4 Because when you come in on your second or your third or 

your fourth postconviction proceeding, and you say all 

6 my previous counsel has been ineffective, that's also 

7 the first time that you've been able to say it, and 

8 you'll be making the same claim: I'm entitled to have 

9 one constitutionally competent lawyer argue that my 

trial counsel was ineffective. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: What about not going that 

12 far? What about saying: In this case -- in this case, 

13 Arizona did give him a lawyer. In this case, it was the 

14 same lawyer. In this case, the proceeding was filed 

prior to the completion of the appeal and ended before 

16 the completion of the appeal. So, for this case, this 

17 counts as the one round of proceedings, and, therefore, 

18 his client can in fact assert that that single 

19 individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those 

proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the 

21 termination of the appeal, ended first. 

22  MR. WALL: Here's -- here's the primary 

23 problem with that, Justice Breyer: This Court said in 

24 Coleman, and before that in Murray v. Carrier and in 

Wainwright v. Torna, that if you don't have a Federal

1 constitutional right to counsel and the States or 

2 Congress go beyond what they're constitutionally 

3 required to do when they give you a lawyer, that 

4 lawyer's performance does not thereby give rise to a due 

process claim. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but it didn't face the 

7 issue of what about a claim that you have a 

8 constitutional right to bring up at least once? And 

9 this is the first time he was able to bring it up. So 

in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem. It's 

11 as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was 

12 sleeping until you got to collateral proceedings. A 

13 State could have such a rule. I don't know why they 

14 would, but they could. But if they did, it would be 

your first chance ever to attack that trial process, and 

16 so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation, 

17 actually rather beside the point? 

18  MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I think we just 

19 see the case in fundamentally different ways. His first 

opportunity to raise his trial ineffectiveness claim was 

21 in his first postconviction proceeding, and he had the 

22 opportunity to raise it, and his lawyer didn't. And 

23 what he's coming in and saying now is not I was deprived 

24 of an opportunity to raise it, as in your --

JUSTICE BREYER: No.

Official 

1  MR. WALL: -- hypothetical, but I had the 

2 opportunity and I didn't, and we should excuse that --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, we're saying it the 

4 same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the 

fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it 

6 because he was staring at the ceiling and had been 

7 drinking too much. Just as he could raise that point in 

8 habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he 

9 could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time 

that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of 

11 trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera. 

12  MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I think this case 

13 presents a much narrower question, which is, when he 

14 comes in, in his second postconviction proceeding, and 

says although I didn't raise it last time around, I have 

16 cause to excuse that default because my lawyer was 

17 ineffective, this Court's been clear in three different 

18 cases that that's only cause if he had a constitutional 

19 right to counsel in the proceeding that he's pointed to 

and that he complains about. So, the question --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you haven't told me 

22 is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel 

23 in the first postconviction proceeding? I mean, our 

24 entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the 

fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged 

49

1 with the ability to prosecute their claims through 

2 direct appeal. Discretionary appeal, we said the 

3 likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal 

4 because they would have a record from below; they would 

have competent counsel below who would make the best 

6 arguments possible. They could then pursue their 

7 discretionary appeals because they had something to work 

8 with. 

9  But if your first chance as to present 

ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a 

11 postconviction proceeding, you have no record to work 

12 with. 

13  MR. WALL: That's right. Justice Sotomayor, 

14 I think this is a very different case from Douglas and 

Halbert, which were grounded in a fairly fundamental 

16 equal protection concern, that indigent defendants would 

17 be denied a first look, maybe an only look, at their 

18 convictions and sentences. 

19  Here, we're facing something very different. 

States like Arizona are giving direct appeals; 

21 defendants are getting looks at their convictions and 

22 sentences, as Petitioner did. They're providing 

23 postconviction review. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but it is the first 

look --

Official 

1  MR. WALL: They're even providing lawyers in 

2 postconviction review. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- only look at the 

4 effective assistance claims. So, what would you say, 

Mr. Wall, if a State did the following: If it said 

6 we're going to take out all Fourth Amendment exclusion 

7 claims, and we're going to put that in a postconviction 

8 review system, and, you know what, there you're not 

9 entitled to an effective lawyer -- would that be all 

right? 

11  MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I think there are 

12 any number of claims that if a State tried to pull them 

13 out of direct appeal and locate them in collateral 

14 review, we might be able to say it's end-running its 

obligation under Douglas, because those are the types of 

16 claims based on a trial record that ought to be -- and 

17 always have belonged to direct appeal. The question is, 

18 does a State act arbitrarily when it takes an 

19 ineffectiveness claim, which is the only type of claim 

that a State has tried to relocate into collateral 

21 review --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm sure the State 

23 would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example. 

24 The State would say there's a good reason for it: 

Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored; they

1 have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind 

2 of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a 

3 different proceeding. 

4  So, I think that the State would have many 

good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there 

6 you don't get a lawyer. 

7  MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I just -- I think 

8 that the Court's case law would -- I mean, I think it 

9 would be a difficult question, the Court having said 

that under Stone, at least in the Federal system, the 

11 Fourth Amendment -- Fourth Amendment claims can't be 

12 raised on habeas. I think it would be difficult for a 

13 State to come in and say they have to be raised in 

14 habeas.

 Here, the Court said in Massaro these claims 

16 are best suited to resolution in habeas, and they're 

17 claims that are traditionally brought in habeas. And at 

18 least for that type of claim, which is the -- I mean, 

19 the State's not trying to hide the ball here. All the 

State has done is take a claim that this Court has said 

21 belongs at habeas and say we're putting it in habeas, 

22 not as in the Federal system where, although people can 

23 raise it as a practical matter, they're all decided on 

24 collateral review, or virtually all of them. It says 

we're just going to save people the trouble of briefing

1 and raising it, and we'll locate it to collateral 

2 review, not for an invidious or arbitrary reason, but 

3 for all the reasons that this Court gave in Massaro. 

4  So, at least for that type of claim, I think 

it's permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, leaving 

6 for another day whether it could do it with other types 

7 of claims that I do think probably belong to a direct 

8 appeal. And that would present very different 

9 constitutional problems if a State started trying to 

channel them to collateral review. But I -- all Arizona 

11 has done is pick up on Massaro and say, absolutely 

12 right, these claims belong in habeas, and that's where 

13 we're going to put them. 

14  And collateral review --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've now told me that 

16 the vast majority of States -- 47, I think, is the 

17 number you gave -- put this into postconviction -- give 

18 counsel at postconviction review. 

19  MR. WALL: At least discretionarily.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't it an empty 

21 promise if what you're giving is incompetent counsel? 

22  MR. WALL: Well --

1 States have found under their own constitutions or 

2 statutes a right to effective assistance of counsel. 

3 But it's a very different matter to say that when States 

4 go beyond what the Constitution requires in providing 

counsel, that counsel's performance thereby gives rise 

6 to a due process claim. And, again, the Court's 

7 rejected that in at least three cases, and I think 

8 saying that it's cause to excuse a procedural default 

9 here without saying that there's some underlying right 

to counsel would require overruling those cases.

represent Mr. Martinez on appeal. She then moved to 

21 have herself appointed for purposes of the

4  The other point that I wanted to get to was 

the questions about other States where this -- these 

6 claims are handled on direct appeal illustrate a couple 

7 of things about our argument: One is it would be --

8 seem very peculiar to say you have a right to appointed 

9 and effective counsel in Wisconsin or Utah on these 

issues, but not in Arizona, where the label -- the 

11 difference is purely label. 

12  All these claims, almost all of them, 

13 require additional evidence, and that fact makes counsel 

14 even more important. Respondents want to say you have a 

right to counsel on review for almost all claims, but 

16 not the one where you need it the most. 

17  Thank you.
