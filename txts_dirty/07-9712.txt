 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first today in Case 07-9712, Puckett v. United 

States.

 Mr. Isaacson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ISAACSON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 This case is framed by two major facts: 

Jimmy Puckett pled guilty and waived his fundamental 

right to trial in exchange for a promise by the 

government that they agreed he was qualified for a 

three-level reduction in his offense level; and the 

government of the United States breached this promise.

 The teachings of this Court in this 

situation are instructive. For a plea to be valid, it 

must be voluntary and intelligent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Isaacson, you said 

there were two facts. Aren't there three? Isn't it a 

fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in 

essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a 

crime while he was in jail?

 MR. ISAACSON: No, Your Honor. He did not

breach the plea agreement by doing that. He --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I used to teach 

contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a 

breach of contract. That would have been a breach on 

his part.

 Now, the government has conceded the breach 

of the plea agreement. I don't -- I can't understand 

why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it. 

Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of 

deciding what the -- what the remedy is? Ignore the 

reality that there was a breach? I mean, you know, 

if the government said, we will ask the court to 

sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse 

that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then 

demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know, 

suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the 

government really supposed to have to go before the 

judge and say, "Your Honor, this man is really 

remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower 

end"?

 It seems to me it's a basic principle of 

contract law that a party to a contract cannot take 

action which makes it impracticable for the other side 

to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what 

your client did. The government couldn't practicably go

in and make that argument when he had demonstrated 

himself to be an unremorseful criminal.

 MR. ISAACSON: The government in this case 

drafted a plea agreement, and most plea agreements --

I've practiced in the Northern District of Texas quite 

often, and virtually every plea agreement has a 

provision in it that says if the defendant does some 

type of criminal activity, thus it will render it void. 

This plea agreement did not have that in it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.

 MR. ISAACSON: So it's different than most 

plea agreements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you want to us make the 

inference that the impermissible or criminal activity 

was permitted by the absence of this specific clause. 

You say there is no implied condition, no implied 

covenant?

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, I'm not -- what we are 

saying is the government needs to obey the promise in 

the plea agreement. The promise in the plea agreement 

is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the questions so far 

indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise 

that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful 

behavior. So that just -- what you say just begs the

question.

 Now, I recognize the government has conceded 

a breach, and we will probably move on from that point. 

But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a 

very artificial posture, it seems to me.

 MR. ISAACSON: It is -- well, it is up to 

the judge to determine whether or not the defendant gets 

the acceptance points or not. The bargain here was not 

that Mr. Puckett would get the points, but that the 

government would agree that he was qualified to receive 

those points.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there is nothing 

theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you 

can feel remorse. I mean, you're not going to do it 

again. You going to feel remorse every time you do it, 

but that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the 

crime he was pleading to.

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes, 3E1.1. There is a 

number of different factors that go into whether or not 

someone gets the acceptance points. It is the judge's 

discretion to give those points and there are a number 

of different factors that go into it. Certainly the 

termination of criminal activity is one 1 of those 

factors the court looks at, but it's not the only one.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this judge said --

and he was open in his thinking. He said: "Unheard to 

me that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit 

to someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out 

there committing another crime."

 MR. ISAACSON: That is what Judge --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge did say that. 

He said it was unknown to him that judges give 

acceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in 

the interval between the plea and when he shows up in 

court for sentencing commits another crime.

 MR. ISAACSON: That is what Judge Sanders 

did say.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Your point is not that he 

should have gotten the reduction. Your point is that 

the government should have made the recommendation.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, the position --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it? Isn't that your 

point?

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The agreement called for 

them to make a recommendation and they didn't make it. 

In fact, they recommended the contrary. And that's your 

gripe, right?

 MR. ISAACSON: The plea agreement did not 

say the government had to get up there and make a

statement at sentencing that he was supposed to get his 

points. They just agreed he was entitled to his 

acceptance points.

 There was two parts of the plea agreement. 

The first part that they agreed to was, you know, that 

he was entitled to those points; and the second part was 

that they would recommend at sentencing that he get the 

lower in the guideline range. The first part was not --

did not say they had to get up there and say that. They 

chose on their own to get up there and breach the plea 

agreement by saying, he's not entitled to those points.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that in the 

record, do you know offhand? Where the plea agreement 

is?

 MR. ISAACSON: It's page 54a of the Joint 

Appendix volume 1, paragraphs 8 and 9.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose Justice 

Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of 

prejudice. If the judge gets up there and says, I don't 

care what the government says, I am not going to give 

anybody a departure when they have committed another 

crime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the 

government's breach.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well -- I believe he has been

prejudiced by the government's breach, because once the 

government violates the plea agreement on the first 

level, as we know under the prior precedents of this 

case, it makes the actual plea agreement void. And 

secondly, the Santobello case clearly talks about it is 

not important the effect on the sentencing judge 

what the -- in Santobello the government breached a plea 

agreement and the judge said: It doesn't matter the 

government breached the plea agreement; I would have 

done the same thing anyway; it makes no different. This 

Court said specifically that's not relevant.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the judge would have 

known about what happened anyway from -- from the 

presentence investigation, wouldn't he?

 MR. ISAACSON: Correct.

 I guess the point I am trying to make is the 

agreement here was not that Judge Sanders would give him 

acceptance points. The fact is the government made the 

position -- and I should point out that Mr. Puckett, he 

gave up all his rights just for this slim reed of hope.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have, if he 

felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the 

courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement 

because there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was 

taken, right?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the plea was 

taken --

MR. ISAACSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it was the same judge, 

wasn't it?

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes, Judge Sanders.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so they were all 

there and the defendant was asked all these questions, 

and the government-- and the judge knew about the 

government's side of the plea bargain.

 MR. ISAACSON: Right, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it was not a secret to 

anyone that the government said it would ask for the 

extra acceptance of responsibility credit. And yet the 

defendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say 

a word: Wait a minute, judge. They didn't object at --

there was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?

 MR. ISAACSON: Mr. Puckett had made a motion 

prior to the sentencing to withdraw his plea on his own. 

He basically pro se had done that. But not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

MR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry.

was no plea to withdraw the plea.

 MR. ISAACSON: During the sentencing, no, 

there was not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so that's why we are 

-- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have 

a different case.  But he didn't, so we are here on 

plain-error review.

 MR. ISAACSON: Our point is that we suggest 

plain error shouldn't be applied to this case. This 

court in Santobello said 35 years ago when the 

government breaches a plea agreement it can never stand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Santobello was a case 

where there was a timely objection.

 MR. ISAACSON: That is correct, but the 

principles of whether or not when the government 

breaches a plea agreement that renders the underlying 

conviction void raises it to a different level.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why should that be the case? 

I know plea agreements are not strictly governed by 

contract law, but there is an analogy and your whole 

argument seems to be that the government's breach 

rendered the plea agreement void. But why would that 

so? There was a plea agreement, voluntarily entered 

into, and then there was a breach. So, why shouldn't 

the issue be what is the remedy for the breach? And why

shouldn't it be governed by the plain-error rule like 

most errors that occur at trial?

 MR. ISAACSON: I would suggest it goes to 

the very heart of whether or not he actually pled. 

Justice Ginsburg's raised a great point about what Judge 

Sanders did in this case. He was long involved. The 

promises in the plea agreement were talked about. Mr. 

Puckett had every right to rely upon those promises when 

he foreclosed his right to jury trial, his right to 

present witnesses on his own behalf. This is a 

solemn --

JUSTICE ALITO: But you can say that in 

every case in which parties enter into a contract and 

later there is a breach. The fact that one of the 

parties later breaches doesn't mean that there never was 

a contract. There was an agreement that he voluntarily 

entered into at that time. And then there was a --

subsequently there was a breach, but that doesn't mean 

that he involuntarily -- he did not voluntarily enter 

into the agreement, does it?

 MR. ISAACSON: I would suggest this Court's 

precedent is that it has to be a knowing waiver of his 

rights, that promises that are unfulfilled or 

unfulfillable render the plea itself void. The 

constitutional due process overtones or overpinnings of

a plea agreement as opposed to a normal contract makes 

this different.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What relief are you 

seeking now? You didn't -- you didn't ask to withdraw 

the plea when you were before the sentencing judge.

 MR. ISAACSON: We request -- what relief do 

I want?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

 MR. ISAACSON: Mr. Puckett would like the 

plea agreement to be set aside and be allowed to take 

this case to trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which would expose him to 

a considerably greater penalty.

 MR. ISAACSON: Potentially, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it suffice to 

give your client everything that he was entitled to if 

the case were remanded to a different judge and the 

government were required to go before that judge and 

make the commitment that it undertook in the plea 

agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON: We believe --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that be a 

perfectly satisfactory remedy?

 MR. ISAACSON: We believe that the action of 

the government, again, rendered the plea agreement

itself void, without value, and he would -- Mr. 

Puckett --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to say that. 

But let's assume I don't agree with that. Let's assume 

I agree with Justice Alito that his entry into it was 

voluntary and all that's happened is that one of the 

commitments on the part of one of the parties has not 

been complied with. Why isn't it an adequate remedy for 

that problem to send it back to a new judge and have the 

government come before that judge and make the same 

commitment it was supposed to under the agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON: Certainly that is a remedy 

some circuits have used. Why that is not effective, we 

believe the defendant should have the right to be able 

to choose. When it reaches this level, the plea 

agreement is void.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask essentially two 

questions. You mentioned the fact that this is not --

this is an unusual agreement, and that some of the 

provisions were negotiated and the record shows they 

were -- they were deliberately undertaken. It seems to 

me that this was probably a scrivener's error. The 

normal -- most plea agreements would include a provision 

that if the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct, all 

bets are off. And my hunch was that somebody just

forgot to put the boilerplate language in the agreement. 

Is that fair to say? I can't imagine the government 

negotiating an agreement that doesn't include that 

clause.

 MR. ISAACSON: I certainly can't put myself 

on the sides back then. I think it's fair to say it's 

unusual. The government in its breach -- sorry -- in 

its brief indicated it could have included it in there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It did include it in the 

motion, didn't they?

 MR. ISAACSON: It was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there a motion --

MR. ISAACSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for credit for 

acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition 

that the defendant be law-abiding?

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes, that was included in the 

motion filed the next day for the additional point, that 

is correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So isn't it odd that the 

-- that these documents both meant to serve the same 

purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct 

in the future and the other doesn't?

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, one is a plea agreement 

that is entered in open court with the defendant present

with his attorney and the second is a motion filed by 

the United States attorney the day after. So they are 

different. Certainly they have different, I would 

suggest, importance.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But going back to my 

question, isn't it a likely explanation for the 

defendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just 

didn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal 

provision in it?

 MR. ISAACSON: I -- I can't. As to 

whether -- I would suggest that it is -- this is a --

normally, these are normally included in these 

agreements, I would suggest to you.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. ISAACSON: But I would suggest to you 

also that it was not included in this agreement, and 

since the government drafted it I don't think we can 

just assume it should be there.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that. 

But the other thing I wanted to ask you: You keep using 

the term "void." Do our cases say that any breach of a 

plea agreement renders it void rather than subject to 

some kind of other remedy?

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, if it is -- I think the 

language of -- of Brady -- certainly a plea must stand

unless it is induced by misrepresentation, unfulfilled 

or unfulfillable promises. Recently in the Bousley, 

case: Statements in there can't go; not good if it's 

induced by misrepresentation; Machibroda --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But those are cases that 

say that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty 

plea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement 

as having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, again, I am -- citing 

from Machibroda: A guilty plea, if induced by promises 

or threats which would deprive it of a private or 

voluntary act are void.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but those -- that 

goes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether 

or not the underlying contract became void, I think. 

Maybe I'm missing something.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, I -- I think what we 

are saying is once the government takes its action, it 

deprives the plea of its voluntary character.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't 

retroactively render the government's promise a 

misrepresentation. Every time a -- a party to a 

contract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been 

guilty of fraud. "Misrepresentation" would mean the 

government had no intention of complying with it when --

when it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert 

that was the case, do you?

 MR. ISAACSON: No, but I would suggest that 

Santobello again talks about the intent, whether or not 

-- in that case there were two prosecutors who didn't 

know what one -- the other one was doing, and this Court 

said that's not important; it is the integrity of the 

plea that's important and the government's breach 

thereof.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the law of contracts 

I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't 

rescind for a nonmaterial breach. A trivial breach 

doesn't always allow recision. And isn't it trivial if 

the district court said: You know, I don't care if the 

Attorney General of the United States and the Solicitor 

General himself both came into the court on their hands 

and knees begging me to do this. I wouldn't do this. I 

wouldn't give you an increase.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me an 

immaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and 

correct me if I am wrong. I take it as to level one --

or as to the third level, they need the recommendation 

before they have the authority to reduce. Am I right 

about that?

MR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry -- I am missing --

what are you talking about?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are some instances 

in which the -- the prosecution must make the 

recommendation before the district judge has the 

authority to depart downward, am I correct?

 MR. ISAACSON: I -- I -- I am sorry. For 

the downward departure and acceptance of responsibility, 

they are different. For the first two points, it can be 

done in the plea agreement. The third has to be done by 

the prosecution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right. So -- so 

this -- this district judge, I take it, did not have the 

authority to go down by -- by a third without the 

recommendation?

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, the government filed a 

motion. I don't know if they officially had withdrawn 

it or not. I know at sentencing they argued against it, 

so -- I am not sure if the judge had the power to or 

not. The motion was already on file. The government 

had already asked for that. Now, they changed their 

mind.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even as to the third 

level, the district judge said, you know, I will assume 

that they have made the argument. I will assume they

have made the argument. I wouldn't hear the -- I -- I 

wouldn't grant -- I wouldn't follow the recommendation. 

I am not going to depart downward even assuming the 

government -- it seems to me that there is -- the 

government's breach is immaterial.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, in terms of materiality 

of the breach, in Santobello there are those exact 

words: The government is in a very poor position to 

talk materiality after they've breached the agreement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My reading of Santobello 

is the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult 

for me to understand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was part of this 

agreement that was honored. In fact, the judge after 

having said that, I never heard of giving credit for 

responsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the 

interim, but he said: I understand there was an 

agreement to sentence at the low end, and that's what 

I'm going to do.

 MR. ISAACSON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you say what you 

want is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not 

just the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in 

this case that the judge ordered to be served 

concurrently rather than consecutively?

MR. ISAACSON: Yes, there were three 

underlying Federal charges that he was on supervisory 

release for that the judge ran concurrently with the 

sentence in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would counsel say about 

a case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach? 

There is a factual dispute as to whether there was a 

breach. Let's say the government agrees that it will 

reserve the right to call all relevant facts to the 

attention of the sentencing judge, but won't take a 

position on sentencing. And the prosecutor in 

sentencing makes certain remarks that might be 

interpreted as taking a position or might be interpreted 

as simply calling facts to the judge's attention.

 Would it be your position that when a 

defendant hears that, the defendant can sit back and 

wait and see whether he or she is satisfied with the 

sentence and then after this sentence is imposed raise 

the issue of breach on appeal and not be subject to 

plain error, rather than calling it to the attention of 

the sentencing judge at the time when the -- the 

potential breach could be adjudicated?

 MR. ISAACSON: I think there are two parts 

to your question, Your Honor, if I could address them. 

In regard to a de minimus breach of the plea agreement,

we recognize that technical defects in a plea agreement 

may not always require automatic reversal. However, the 

government must always fulfill completely the promises 

they have made in the agreement. And that goes to the 

difference between a -- a plea agreement is being 

different than a normal contract.

 In a normal contract, you think of a -- an 

Exxon merging with Mobil, things of that nature. This 

is a situation where the government's -- the obligations 

in the plea agreement for the vast majority are on the 

defendant, what he has to do. He gives up his rights. 

He must cooperate, things of that nature. As on page 

51a shows, the government's agreements are extremely 

small. There's only two paragraphs. And that's 

normally how it is. Our position is if the government 

breaches its promises, that's when it must be reversed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure that really 

answers my question.

 MR. ISAACSON: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying as to some 

errors there is a plain-error rule, in some breaches 

there is a plain-error rule, but not as to all breaches?

 MR. ISAACSON: No. I'm -- what I'm saying 

is the threshold of whether there is a breach or not --

the question has been posed of whether or not every

single breach is automatic reversal.

 We -- we recognize that there may be some 

that have absolutely no basis or do not really imply or 

go into what the government promised to do. Because the 

government's promises as a part of the plea agreement, 

again, are just two paragraphs of this case. Our 

suggestion is when the government breaches what they 

promised to do, that's when the automatic reversal --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are saying, if -- if 

I understand you correctly, that even if at the trial 

your client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had 

said, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend, 

you know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have 

to have said was, the plea agreement is invalid. And 

the trial judge could not say, oh, yes, the government 

has to make that recommendation.

 You are -- you are saying it is invalidated 

by the mere fact of the government's not having done it, 

right?

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So no objection need to be 

made or can be made, right?

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, certainly, we -- we'd 

never suggest --

seems harsh and perhaps it is harsh, but the government 

has to abide by the contracts they make.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I take it -- you 

never really answered Justice Alito's question. I take 

it that the defendant and his counsel can knowingly 

recognize that an error is being committed, say nothing, 

listen to the sentence, and then object later. That's 

your position, yes or no?

 MR. ISAACSON: For it to be reversible, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's inconsistent 

with the answer you gave me.

 MR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The answer you gave me is 

that automatically the guilty plea is washed out --

automatically.

 MR. ISAACSON: We -- if the government 

breaches the plea agreement, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is automatically washed 

out?

 MR. ISAACSON: Well, I would suggest --

have a new trial.

 MR. ISAACSON: I would suggest that the word 

"void" may also be "voidable."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Voidable -- then your 

answer to me would be different. It's -- it's not void. 

It's voidable, so that he can play dog in the manger and 

wait and see what happens, and then if it's in interest 

that -- in his interest to void it, he does. If it's in 

his interest not to void it, he doesn't.

 MR. ISAACSON: Your Honor, these are not 

easy issues. Certainly, defense attorneys should not 

ever sit on his hands and let these things go. To take 

a chance and to just say, oh, we are going to do nothing 

and just sandbag, like is suggested by the government, 

I'm suggesting that is never going to occur.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would not be 

cost-free for you, because if you just sit there and 

say, you know, the agreement is void, the government is 

going to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and 

we will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as 

much as you would have gotten anyway.

 You have some interest, since you entered 

the guilty plea, in going forward with the plea.

Let's say it is the same facts as we have here but 

instead of saying, I can't do this, the judge says, I'm 

going to do this. And, look, I think you are 

remorseful. I'm going to give you three points. And 

that's all you agreed with the government. The 

government says we'll recommend it, and the judge says, 

well, you're going to get it anyway. I think you should 

get it. The agreement has still been breached, right? 

The government didn't recommend.

 MR. ISAACSON: It has been breached.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in that 

situation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON: I would suggest that it would 

be at the defendant's option to do so. The point that 

I'm trying to make --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But why -- why should the 

defendant have the option to withdraw from an agreement 

when he got everything under the best possible 

circumstances that he could have expected?

 MR. ISAACSON: Because the government --

well, we don't know that, what the sentence would have 

been by the sentencing judge.

about the Chief Justice's hypothetical at this point. 

And they -- in his hypothetical, the sentencing judge 

says, I'm going to give you the three points; you are 

going to get everything that on the rosiest scenario you 

could have hoped for.

 Why should he be able to withdraw his plea 

at that point?

 MR. ISAACSON: Because the jurisprudence 

teaches that the result of the effect on the sentencing 

judge is simply irrelevant. If the government breach --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, your 

position is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic 

position, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong 

words here -- there is a metaphysical quality to the 

plea, and even though things turn out as well to him as 

he could possibly have expected had the agreement been 

kept punctiliously, if the government simply omits the 

words he can walk away from the plea? I mean, that's 

your position?

 MR. ISAACSON: I believe so, yes. But there 

is a reason for it. This Court has stated the 

government cannot breach the plea agreement. That's all 

we're saying. The power the government has in reducing 

the plea, the rights the defendants are giving up, it

should be at the option of the defendant to decide.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but usually -- I mean, 

the theory of relief in contract law depends upon relief 

from something. And if, in fact, there is -- there is 

no discernible damage that has been suffered, if on the 

other hand -- again, taking the Chief's hypothetical --

there is an affirmative demonstration that no damage 

occurred, normal principles of contract would say there 

is nothing to give him relief from. The law of contract 

is -- is not a metaphysical construct. Why should the 

law of plea agreements be?

 MR. ISAACSON: I -- I'm not suggesting it 

would be metaphysical. I'm simply suggesting --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I think you are. I 

mean, you are saying even though he has come out with, 

you know, a rose in his mouth, he can still, if he is 

crazy enough, throw away the whole plea agreement.

 MR. ISAACSON: I think that suggests that 

the result on the judge has to do with the breach, what 

the government does. The concept is, if the government 

breaches the plea agreement, the defendants should have 

the right to withdraw from the plea even if there is no 

effect on the sentence.

think what we are all trying to get at -- is in order to

have a rule, an absolute rule like yours, we usually 

look for a good reason to have that rule. And since we 

are talking about an agreement, the place to look for 

the good reason is in the consequences to the defendant. 

And when the consequences are terrific, when they are 

the best that he could possibly have hoped for, there 

doesn't seem to be a good reason to adopt your very 

theoretical construct of agreement.

 Is there some reason that we are just not 

seeing?

 MR. ISAACSON: Because it doesn't occur. I 

mean, the government could not cite a single case in 

which this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Never mind what the 

government can cite. I'm asking you if there is a good 

reason to adopt this absolute rule of yours.

 MR. ISAACSON: There is an absolute -- the 

good reason is the defendant should get the promises the 

government has elicited for his giving up of his 

fundamental constitutional rights. 99.9 percent of the 

time that's going to be adverse to the defendant, as it 

was in this case.

 A possibly hypothetical situation where the 

judge would forego or ignore what the United States 

attorney says and give him acceptance points is so rare,

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this kind of 

conceptual question? Is it your view that a breach of a 

plea agreement can never be concluded to be harmless 

error?

 MR. ISAACSON: Harmless error? Yes, I -- if 

it -- well, harmless error if you are talking about 

structural error, I mean it's a little different 

analysis.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to get rid of 

the labels like "plain error" and "structural." But if 

in fact it's totally harmless and everybody agrees it's 

harmless, would the government still have to -- or would 

there be an adverse consequence nevertheless?

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes, I believe so.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, there could never be 

harmless error, harmless breach of a plea agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't someone read 

what happened here as the defendant saying, well, I 

didn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still 

sentencing me at the low end, and he's still making the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 When the government breaches a plea 

agreement, an objection made in the district court 

serves important purposes that relate to the functioning 

of Federal courts. It permits the district court and 

the parties to determine whether a breach has occurred, 

and it also, in many cases, may permit an immediate cure 

of that breach to be administered, obviating the need 

for appellate review of the issue altogether.

A central purpose of the contemporaneous 

objection rule is to ensure that the district court 

proceedings are as free of error as possible. And that 

purpose is served in this context, the plea breach 

context, as it is in others.

 Rule 52(b) reinforces the contemporaneous 

objection rule by placing a heavier burden on the party 

who does not object in the district court to win relief 

on appeal.

 The government's submission to the court 

today is that the plain-error standard does apply to 

forfeited claims that a plea agreement has been 

breached, that the Olano framework should be followed, 

and that one component of the plain-error showing in 

this context should require a defendant who did not 

object to a breach in the district court to show a 

reasonable probability that the outcome of the 

proceeding was affected by the breach.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to explore the issue 

of breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same 

facts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired 

and objected to in the district court.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Your Honor.

the government says, well, Your Honor, well, he 

committed another crime. And then the judge says -- and 

we are not going to move for the recommendation. And 

the judge says: I will assume that you made the 

recommendation, and I will just tell you right now I 

wouldn't take the recommendation anyway. I'm not 

going -- I wouldn't give a lowered sentence even if you 

made the objection. What result?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, I think the result 

there is controlled by Santobello.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it? Because in 

Santobello there was no reason given for the prosecutor 

to violate the plea agreement. Here there's a good 

reason. Can you distinguish Santobello on that basis?

 MS. SCHERTLER: I would -- I would -- I 

would seek to distinguish Santobello. As we say in our 

brief, there seemed to have been multiple problems going 

on in Santobello. And in -- and it was unclear that the 

district court in Santobello even knew what the terms of 

the agreement were.

 This court -- a court in that situation 

would have been aware -- would have sorted through what 

the terms of the agreement were. Now -- and -- and, we 

don't believe that there is a reason not to apply 

harmless error review in this context as there is in any

other context.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, were you --

Justice Kennedy, were you through? I'm sorry, I thought 

you started a question again.

 The problem I have with the harmless error 

suggestion that you've made is this. If the government 

does engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to 

me the consequence is that an individual has given up a 

trial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty, 

without either the trial that he is entitled to or 

fulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty.

 And isn't there -- isn't there a very high 

value to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United 

States under the constitutional guarantees should be --

should be sitting behind bars without either a 

conviction following full trial, invocation of whatever 

rights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to 

be behind bars? And -- and when neither of those 

conditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as 

a matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as 

harmless.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, there -- certainly I 

agree, Justice Souter, that -- and although there is 

distinguishable facts in Santobello, that that theme is 

present in Santobello as well. And the Court there said

that it was not -- at the very least, the Court said 

when the government has not fulfilled its promise and an 

objection is raised and the defendant has suffered an 

adverse consequence that was somehow related to the 

government's broken promise, that the Court is not going 

to find harmlessness simply based on the district 

court's statement itself that it didn't rely on what the 

government had said.

 Now, we would submit, however, that there 

could be cases -- and the Chief Justice's hypothetical 

would have one of those -- where even in a setting where 

an objection is raised, if the defendant receives the 

benefit that was the aim of the promise he secured from 

the government -- for instance, if in Santobello the 

defendant there received the lowest possible sentence 

that he might have gotten -- that in that circumstance, 

Santobello should not preclude harmless error review, 

and the defendant cannot be said to have -- to be in 

jail having not received the benefit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I think I would agree 

with you there because, by whatever means, the defendant 

has gotten everything the defendant bargained for.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It may have come by a more 

circuitous route, but he got it all.

unlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't 

know that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his 

thoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the 

-- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars, 

neither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal 

that he made?

 MS. SCHERTLER: I agree that is -- that is 

the strong suggestion of Santobello when there has been 

an objection made. We would -- we would submit to the 

Court that the analysis must differ when no objection is 

made in the district court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't -- whether we 

accept that proposition or not that the analysis must 

differ, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value 

we place on the importance of the proposition that I 

started with? If somebody's behind bars, it's either as 

a result of a valid conviction after trial or a 

voluntary agreement that says, yeah, I will stay there. 

And if -- if we place a very high value on the liberty 

interest -- in -- in retaining liberty except under 

those two conditions, then isn't it fair to us -- isn't 

it sensible for us to say even in a plain-error 

situation, we are going to recognize this -- this kind

of prejudice, despite the fact that he didn't object? 

If we place a high value on the liberty interest, we 

wouldn't accept your position; isn't that fair?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The high value that the 

Court placed on the liberty interest in that situation 

would also have to be to the exclusion of other very 

important interests that are served by making sure that 

objections are raised in the district court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You are right, there is no 

question about it. If -- we are saying we will take 

a -- a less efficient process, a process less efficient 

perhaps even for getting at the truth, because we think 

the liberty interest is that important. You are 

entirely right.

 MS. SCHERTLER: I -- and -- but I also would 

add on to that that I don't think it is only efficiency, 

that that is the sole interest that would be sacrificed 

by an -- by an absolutist approach, really, that Your 

Honor has suggested. There also would be interests, 

fairness interests, that would be compromised by that 

rule, because just a rule that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Will you give me an 

example?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, yes. The rule that 

Petitioner proposes, for example, is that when a

government breach occurs, one need not object in the 

district court, one may raise it on direct appeal and 

one automatically gets to elect to withdraw the plea. 

That would create incentives on the part of defendants 

to -- to withhold objections.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question, but it 

seems to me that the answer to that is, it's an 

incentive that would never come into play if the 

government kept its word.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So why -- why should -- why 

is the government really in a position to object to 

that?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Because this Court has 

the -- what it permits is manipulation of the system by 

-- by counsel, really.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're talking about 

manipulation of the system. I just wonder if the 

government wasn't manipulating the system when they said 

we should grant cert in this case. You did -- you did 

agree that the cert should be granted.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Oh, we did acquiesce, yes. 

Yes, Justice Stevens.

objection would always be controlling?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: For example, in this 

particular case, it seems to me that if the -- if you 

had an objection and if the judge had agreed with the 

objection and said I will set aside the plea because of 

adopting the arguments of your opponent, I think the 

government would have appealed, and said that that 

decision is so wrong and it's because it's really 

harmless error. I think here the real question is 

whether there's harmless error available, rather than 

turning anything on whether or not an objection was made 

in the district court.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, but this -- this is 

the question on which the circuits had divided, and 

which is why we acquiesced in this case to sort through 

that question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in talking about the 

division of the circuits, do you think all breaches of 

-- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely 

the same standard? Or do you think there are varying 

facts in different cases?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, I think that the 

analysis of a breach in each case will differ and it 

first and it will in the -- first and foremost depend

upon what the standard of appellate review is and 

whether an objection has preserved, in which case it 

would be the government's burden to show that a breach 

is harmless, or in the plain-error sentencings the --

the burdens are reversed; and we think the -- the 

ordinary rules codified in rule 52(a) and (b) apply in 

this context equally.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's clear, isn't 

it, that the defendant in this case was in fact 

prejudiced? The judge -- Judge Sanders said it's very 

rare, he said, that you would depart -- or I 

forget whether it's depart or --

MS. SCHERTLER: So rare as to be unknown.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So rare -- I thought 

he said "rare to unknown," "to be unknown" -- you are 

right.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I suspect it's 

probably rarer still for the government to recommend 

that. So you can't really say that he wouldn't have 

done this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it. 

It's one thing to say I've never heard of that. It's 

another thing when one of your colleagues is there 

saying, this is what you should do.

that immediate point. Which is -- my response would be, 

yes, if the government were to recommend that he 

received acceptance of responsibility in this situation, 

that may be considered significant; but the district 

court judge would also know that it was in fulfillment 

of a promise that was made before renewed criminal 

activity occurred from jail. And so, given that 

circumstance --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but none of us 

can know what the judge would have done. I mean, we 

have had cases here where the government's 

recommendation of downward departures has been pretty 

surprising to me as well, and it's because they were 

informants or whatever and they have engaged in some 

pretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders 

would have done.

 MS. SCHERTLER: And here under the plain 

error standard it was the defendant's burden to show a 

reasonable probability that something different would 

have happened. The court of appeals made findings on 

this record that the record showed that nothing 

different would have happened, even had the government 

complied with its promise.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Looking at this, why can't 

we say the following? Some circuits have said that they

will never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of 

a plea agreement.  That's wrong. It could be plain 

error like any other kind of a case, every other kind of 

issue. Sure. But the error here isn't plain. On the 

one hand, all they did, the promise was the government 

agreed to request that his sentence be placed at the 

lowest end, and they followed it. In the other part 

they made no promise. They simply agreed that he had 

demonstrated acceptance of responsibility. And then 

what they did at the trial, they said, "we don't want 

him to get acceptance of responsibility at this point."

 Now, some people could argue that here is an 

implicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at 

the trial that is contrary to their recognition in 

paragraph 8. That's where it is. On the other hand, 

you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise 

not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has 

done in the meantime is commit another serious crime.

 So we have two arguments, one of which says 

they committed error, and one of which says they didn't 

commit error; and the argument turns on two implicit 

readings of paragraph 8. Therefore, it is not plain. 

End of case. What's wrong with that?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, the -- the government 

has conceded, and I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, the 

government would like a whole lot of questions answered. 

So what I don't see is how the government can come here 

because they want a lot of questions answered, and get 

us to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful 

idea; maybe it was. But then we take the case, and now 

they want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious 

response to it because we would like you to answer five 

other questions.

 So what I want to know is, what's wrong with 

what I said? Is that a possible outcome?

 MS. SCHERTLER: That is a possible outcome, 

Justice Breyer, and clarification for -- from this Court 

that the plain-error standard does apply to this type of 

error as it does to others would certainly help to 

resolve the conflict that does exist out there in the 

courts of appeal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I may have gotten 

lost in the dialogue. As you understand it, 

Justice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right? 

You get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and 

it comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the 

other.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. Yes, Chief Justice.

go along that.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. The -- it does not 

give the courts all of the guidance that would be 

helpful as to how to apply other components of the 

plain-error standard in this context.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a big 

difference, right? As you said earlier, harmless error, 

the government has the burden; plain error, the 

defendant has the burden. That's certainly going to 

change how you approach however many different factual 

contexts.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, yes, Mr. Chief 

Justice. I mean, what -- the reason that this case 

seemed to us a good vehicle to address these questions 

is that they was agreement throughout the appellate 

process that there was an error that was plain and, 

therefore, it provides an opportunity to address -- if 

the Court chooses, which it need not, but if the Court 

chooses -- to address how the substantial rights aspect 

of the plain-error standard and discretionary aspect --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the 

government has tried to pick a case in which it has the 

strongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to 

have us decide a rule that really isn't important in a 

lot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in

this case.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, Justice Stevens, what 

one finds when one looks through a lot of these -- when 

these cases are brought, there often is a dispute and a 

real -- and a genuine dispute as to whether a breach has 

occurred or not. And those cases, of course, do not 

allow exposition -- explanation about the other 

components.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you think it 

would have been open to the government to make the 

argument that Justice Breyer has made and said there 

really wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant 

breach that should be ignored?

 MS. SCHERTLER: As we acknowledge in our 

brief, there might be arguments out there that there 

were implicit terms to this plea agreement that were 

breached by the defendant. Those arguments were never 

made in the court of appeals in this case, and so we are 

accepting that record as a way --

JUSTICE BREYER: They can only get -- they 

can only get your breach if they find an implicit 

agreement. The implicit agreement is that you will not 

tell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no 

longer describes the situation. You didn't breach 

paragraph 8, as taken literally. You agree he had shown

that acceptance of responsibility. What you told the 

court was, now we don't think he should have this 

acceptance of responsibility, which previously he had 

shown, because he's committed another crime. Those are 

the exact words you said to the court.

 Now, he may have made an implicit not to do 

that. On the other hand, that implicit promise may be 

negative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of 

the fact that this applies only where we don't commit 

another crime.

 So I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying 

you are even right. I'm just saying, having those two 

arguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong. You 

aren't plainly wrong. So how do I get to the other 

questions if I believe that? Do I say, "Hypothetically 

if the error here were plain, which I think it isn't, 

then I'd like to tell you where the burden of proof 

lies."? By the way, if I happened to think that that's 

whatever it is, then I will go into a few other things. 

That's really what I feel you are asking me to do 

because I don't think it's plain. Maybe the other 

people think it's plain.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, I mean -- as I've --

as I've already indicated, having the Court state that 

the -- Rule 52(b) applies here is a -- is a -- I think,

a helpful --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's plain. What 

about paragraph 9? Are you ignoring paragraph 9?

 JUSTICE BREYER: You fulfilled paragraph 9, 

didn't you?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The -- paragraph 9 indicates 

that the government agrees to request that Puckett's 

sentence placed at the lowest end of the guideline 

levels deemed applicable by the court. And there has 

been no claim, at any point in this proceeding, that 

that provision has been breached. What happened at the 

sentencing was that the district court stated on the 

record: I know that there is an agreement in here that 

that the lowest end of the guideline is appropriate, and 

I intend to follow that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's very 

clear that there has been a breach here. And it's not 

fanciful to say he felt remorse and then he went and did 

it again. That happens all the time.

 You know, when I have a rich dessert I 

shouldn't have, I feel bad about it afterwards. It 

doesn't mean I will not do it again. I mean, why isn't 

that the case here?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, I -- I guess that it's 

a matter of some disagreement, but -- I mean, we have --

we have taken the position that this was a breach of the 

government's agreement that he qualified for a 

three-level reduction in his offense level. That was 

the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you can put that 

before the judge. You are supposed to go there and say, 

"Look, we agreed to recommend it and we do recommend 

it." You could say, "And by the way, you should know 

that he's gone out and done this again." But you most 

-- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you 

said you would do.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, we breached the 

agreement by not doing what we said we would do, and the 

question we would submit to the Court is whether, given 

the absence of an objection, Petitioner carried his 

burden of showing that we did prejudice him. And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but isn't it the 

fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would 

have done if the government had what it said it would 

do. And because -- why shouldn't you bear the burden of 

showing there is no prejudice when you can't tell 

because you're the one that breached the agreement?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Because in the plain-error 

setting, this Court has made clear that the burdens 

shift and that, under the third component of that

standard, it is the defendant's burden, if he did not 

object, to show an effect on the outcome of the 

proceeding, that his substantial rights were violated.

 And here -- and I would note that the court 

of appeals made findings that the result would have been 

the same, and Petitioner in this Court has never 

challenged those findings on this record.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you say just for me, 

because I am changing a little bit here in light of that 

question, but what is it precisely that the government 

said it would do that it did not do?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The -- paragraph 8 of the 

plea agreement indicates that the government --

JUSTICE BREYER: What does it say? What are 

the words that it says the government did not do?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, we indicated to the 

district court that Petitioner did not qualify for 

acceptance of responsibility. And paragraph 8 was a 

government agreement that he did qualify for acceptance 

of responsibility.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So he did agree. "We 

agreed that he does qualify." And then when you got to 

the court, you said, now we don't agree that he 

qualifies at this point.

 MS. SCHERTLER: That's correct. And there

was -- and there an intervening event, obviously, that 

affected the judgment, but because the explicit 

provision of this particular plea agreement, which I 

agree is atypical, as the government's motion for the 

third point made clear, did not have a qualification in 

there. And that -- that is the base -- I mean, I don't 

mean to be arguing strenuously that the government did 

something wrong here, because there were -- but the fact 

is, given the terms of this plea agreement, there --

that is the basis for our concession that there was a 

breach.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As a matter of practice 

among U.S. attorneys, we do have six and a half years at 

stake here, right? That's the difference between the 

two levels? Why wouldn't it be the appropriate thing 

for the U.S. attorney, the assistant U.S. attorney, to 

say, "Judge, I want to call your attention to paragraph 

8 of the plea agreement. At the time we entered into 

it, we made that undertaking." And so then everybody is 

sure that the judge's mind is focused on that. Wouldn't 

that be the better practice?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Absolutely, 

Justice Ginsburg, and if there had been an objection 

based on that provision of the plea agreement, that may 

have been very well what would have happened. The

breach could have been cured. And the fact is that, in 

the absence of that objection, the breach was not cured 

when it could have been, and that is one reason -- that 

is why it makes sense to apply the plain-error standard 

in this context.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could the breach have 

been cured? I mean, the point -- it seems to me, the 

point at which the defendant would have known that the 

government had breached the agreement was when the 

government stood there before the court and said, "In 

fact, he hasn't accepted responsibility. He went out 

and committed another crime while he was behind bars."

 It seems to me that that's the point -- and 

maybe this phrase occurred somewhere in the record --

that that's a bell that you can't unring. For the 

defendant to get up and object and said, "Wait a minute, 

were you supposed to represent to the court that you 

agreed that I did accept responsibility" -- to require 

the government to fulfill that undertaking at that point 

would have been ridiculous. I suppose the U.S. attorney 

could have said, "Oh, yes, he's right, Judge. We agreed 

that he accepted responsibility." But the U.S. attorney 

has already just said a moment before, "He hasn't. We 

really don't mean that at all."

 There's no way, it seems to me, that there

could have been a better outcome in a case like this, 

even if the objection had been contemporary.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, there would be more 

than one way to cure a breach such as this, if an 

objection had been raised in the district court. One 

way would have been by the correction on the record that 

we have just discussed, but another way --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Which would have been 

silly.

 MS. SCHERTLER: But if the defendant -- and 

if the defendant said that, that would be a silly way to 

correct it. It also could have been sent to another 

judge for resentencing, just as the Court in Santobello 

said, that a remedy could be accomplished.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was sent to another 

judge, that judge would still have the presentence 

report. After all, it wasn't the government that 

initiated reneging on the -- if it was the -- it was the 

presentence report. And before the government said a 

word, the judge had read and was discussing the 

presentence report, which said, judge, earlier, we said 

you should give credit for acceptance of 

responsibilities, now we must tell you, you should not.

 MS. SCHERTLER: The probation officer said 

that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. And I don't think 

Petitioner -- Petitioner even contends that he is 

entitled now -- or he contends he is entitled to get out 

of this plea. But taking the more typical remedies that 

this Court proposed as one possibility in Santobello, I 

don't think Petitioner would say that a judge should not 

know that he did -- that he engaged in subsequent 

criminal conduct. That is information that any judge 

sentencing him must know about in order to fairly assess 

what sentence he should receive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe Judge Sanders 

would look at this kind of the way that we have been 

discussing it, and he would look and say, boy, it's --

it's -- he committed subsequent conduct, how can you 

recommend that I depart? He says, but on the other 

hand, every plea agreement I have seen you always say if 

he commits subsequent conduct that is illegal, that all 

bets are the off. You didn't say that here, so I'm 

going to take the recommendation seriously.

 I don't think it's -- maybe I am repeating 

myself, but I don't think it is at all clear that the 

result wouldn't be different here.

Petitioner's burden to show a likelihood, a reasonable 

likelihood that it would have been different.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect, that is not 

what Olano says, is it? The -- the -- the basic Olano 

standard is a -- is a violation of substantial rights 

standard.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And one way that you could 

show a violation of substantial rights would be a -- a 

demonstration that the outcome would have been 

different. But another possibility of showing that 

violation is -- is whether -- and I know you don't 

accept it, but it's the one that I proposed earlier, 

there is a violation of substantial rights if somebody 

is sitting behind bars without having gotten there by 

the performance of an agreement that he made, or as a 

result of a trial. And that, too, could satisfy the 

Olano formulation, could it not?

 MS. SCHERTLER: It could, Justice Souter. 

And if the Court were to take that position, we would 

argue that there is still, under the plain-error 

standard, the fourth component, the discretionary 

component --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know you want to -- as I 

point out one other thing to you. I think it's a hard

question, burden of proof and these other things, that I 

just turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's 

the prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others 

can disagree, that this judge knew just what the 

government had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying 

that now things have changed.

 And then the judge turns to the probation 

officer, and the probation officer says, just to 

reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense, 

according to the guidelines of the guideline manual, 

prohibits any acceptance of responsibility. Now, if 

that turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't 

matter less whose burden of proof it is.

 MS. SCHERTLER: It was not correct, as a 

matter of fact, and the defense attorney made that 

correction, and the -- and the judge accepted that. And 

if I could go back --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He wasn't -- was he 

convicted of this new crime?

 MS. SCHERTLER: He -- not at the time of 

these proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was just an 

allegation, right?

 MS. SCHERTLER: That's right. Another --

another defendant had pled guilty to this crime, and the

factual statement supporting his plea had implicated 

Petitioner as having instigated the crime, suggested 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did we assume 

anything anyway? I assume he denies the allegations.

 MS. SCHERTLER: He admitted the allegations 

to the probation officer, and that is what was reflected 

in the presentence report.

 And if I could return to Justice Souter's 

question about if the Court were to take the position 

that a form of substantial rights is affected in every 

case of a government breach of plea agreement, we would 

respectfully submit that as this Court analyzed a 

similar type of difficult question in Johnson and 

Cotton, that the fourth discretionary component of the 

standard should preclude relief or should at least give 

the district court, the court of appeals discretion to 

not grant relief where, as in this case, there has been 

no showing that there was an effect on the outcome, and, 

as the Court of Appeals found, an affirmative record 

that the outcome would have been exactly the same.

 Thank you, Your Honors. We would ask that 

the judgment be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Isaacson, why don't you take two

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ISAACSON: Thank you, Your Honor.

 The problem that the Puckett panel had in 

the third prong of 52(b) they focused on whether or not 

there is prejudice at sentencing. That was the focus of 

the Puckett panel. That is why they said 52(b) plain 

error applied and was found in that case.

 The problem with that is that Santobello 

clearly points out that prejudice to the trial judge, 

that the trial judge -- what the trial judge would have 

done is simply not relevant. That is why 52(b) cannot 

be applied in this case.

 Secondly, when the government argues that 

there is no prejudice -- you have to show prejudice at 

sentencing, the judge would have done something 

different, that is virtually an impossible standard. 

Under 18 U.S.C. 355 -- there are a number of factors a 

sentencing judge has to take into. The idea -- and 

there is many different factors they must look at, all 

of these different things.

 The idea that a defendant can somehow show a 

judge would have come to a different result but for the 

government breach is an impossibility.

The final point I would make is, the 

argument the government is making now about prejudice, 

it would make no difference at all if the defendant had 

objected at the time. If there is no effect on 

sentencing, it would not pass muster under plain-error 

or the harmless error standards. So the next case that 

is going to come before this Court is when you have an 

objection, and then they're going to say the exact same 

argument here.

 We would ask you to reverse the decision of 

the Fifth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:15 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
