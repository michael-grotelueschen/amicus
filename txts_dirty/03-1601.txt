 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in the 

City of Rancho Palos Verdes against Abrams.

 Mr. Lamken.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it 

please the Court:

 This case concerns whether Congress, in enacting 

section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act, intended to 

expose local governments and State and local officials to 

expansive section 1983 liability with the tens of 

thousands of wireless antenna zoning decisions they must 

make each year.

 Entitled preservation of local zoning authority, 

section 332 provides for State and local agencies in the 

first instance to implement specific Federal substantive 

and procedural requirements, together with preserved State 

zoning laws, in passing on applications to build or modify 

wireless towers. It then provides a highly distinctive, 

independent cause of action for accelerated judicial 

review of the decisions, including a short limitations 

period and mandatory expedition. That tailored process is 

sufficiently comprehensive to evidence Congress' intent

for enforcement to occur --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as 

comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on 

that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of 

action, is it? I mean, it's -- it's more spare.

 MR. LAMKEN: It -- it is unusual in its unique 

focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for 

the focus on private enforcement. In other provisions of 

the Communications Act, the Congress chose -- for example, 

section 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at --

at the FCC level because it was concerned that State and 

local governments often wouldn't have enough -- excuse me 

-- local governments in particular --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what -- what --

MR. LAMKEN: -- wouldn't be able to -- I'm 

sorry. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What would you think of a 

case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning 

was the -- was caused by racial discrimination against the 

applicant? Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you 

suppose?

 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. That would still be available 

because the -- the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides 

for a cause of action for violations of the Communications 

Act. Violations of the Constitution continue to be

enforceable directly under section 1983.

 Section -- section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is 

comprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every 

violation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely 

aggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial 

enforcement. In addition --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about -- it -- it 

-- section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate 

relief. What does that include? Could it include 

punitive damages? Could it include attorney's fees, do 

you think? 

MR. LAMKEN: In that respect, it is 

indistinguishable -- for example, the statute that was at 

issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the 

precise forms of relief available. In our view in this 

case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the 

type of relief that is traditionally given on review of 

zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of 

agency action. That's supported by a number of 

considerations. 

I should point out, in the first instance, that 

in this case respondent never did seek damages, or 

punitive damages for that matter, under section 

332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself. 

But that's supported by a number of

considerations. 


First is the structure of the act, which


presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action. 

The act is structured much as you have -- much as you 

would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal 

requirements and are subject to judicial review. The only 

difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State 

and local agencies with the initial implementers in place 

of the Federal Government. In that respect, it shares 

some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the 

Communications Act which are also implemented by local --

by -- excuse me -- by State governments as opposed to the 

FCC. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the 

argument has been made that 4 years before the 

telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, 

Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. 

And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to 

declaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence. 

Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit 

relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in 

the -- in the measure?

 MR. LAMKEN: Justice Ginsburg, that -- that's an 

example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that 

could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose

to restrict the forms of relief available. And it is an 

example, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has 

made its intent explicit in the text of the statute.

 Congress can also by implication limit the forms 

of -- excuse me -- limit the mechanism for relief that's 

available, and that's our position here, that Congress by 

providing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the -- what's the source 

of the implication?

 MR. LAMKEN: Pardon? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You say by implication.

 MR. LAMKEN: The implication -- Congress has 

provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here, 

section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly 

adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics 

such as a very short limitations period. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the -- the 

implication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically 

provides for damages, it implicitly does not.

 MR. LAMKEN: I'm sorry. In terms of Congress 

making damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view 

of the damage -- mind you damages are only one of the 

differences we think that exists here, but our view is 

supported by a number of considerations, in addition to 

the structure of the statute. For example, appropriate

relief is often -- is the traditional form of relief 

available. In this context traditional relief was always 

specific relief. Congress also included a specific 

savings clause that extends not merely to Federal 

statutes, but prohibits the impairment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Where -- where are 

you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?

 MR. LAMKEN: This -- that comes from this 

Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't 

specifically identify the specific forms of relief 

available --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But that's --

that's not in the -- that's not in the text of this 

statute, is it?

 MR. LAMKEN: No, it isn't. It is an inference 

the Court draws from silence. When the Court -- when 

Congress provides an express cause of action and does not 

identify the specific forms of relief available, the Court 

will infer that Congress intended to provide all 

appropriate relief. But the term, appropriate relief, is 

that relief which Congress would have intended, and when 

the Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the 

traditional forms of relief are and it will look at things 

such as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says 

that the statute should not be read, unless it expressly

provides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State 

and local law, as well as Federal law. And in order to 

put damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide 

damages expressly, one would have to impair myriad 

municipal immunity laws that otherwise protect 

municipalities and State and local officers implementing 

zoning requirements from liability.

 Finally, the FCC has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and 1983 is not subject 

to that limitation. 

MR. LAMKEN: Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive 

under this Court's decisions, and it is -- it would 

preempt the State laws by its own force. But we believe 

that that also supports Congress' decision not to provide 

-- or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend 

to provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of 

making the Communications Act enforceable under section 

1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which 

-- that -- those immunities are unavailable, and it would 

thereby impair those immunities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But are they only immune from 

damages action or are they immune from suit?

 MR. LAMKEN: No. They're generally immunities 

-- immune from damages actions, not from suits. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, I mean, that proves too

much because they -- the statute obviously intends to 

eliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is -- is 

clearly --

MR. LAMKEN: Oh, I think -- I think you may have 

misunderstood. The immunity is not from suit. It's an 

immunity from damages and the impairment would be the 

immunity from damages. Section 332 is not designed to 

impair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not 

immunities from suit. They are generally from damage 

liability. The officers are subject to suit because these 

are subject --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it allows suit against 

either municipalities or States, State or local 

governments. Right?

 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the States have immunity 

not just from damages but from suit.

 MR. LAMKEN: As a constitutional matter, they 

have an immunity from suit, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless they have chosen to 

waive it, which --

MR. LAMKEN: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- one must assume in this area 

they haven't. 

MR. LAMKEN: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to regard this 

provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of 

State law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, first of all, I don't think 

it would be read to -- to override the State's 

constitutional immunity to suit. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's --

MR. LAMKEN: But it would be read to -- it would 

be read to override immunities to suit that exist under 

State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: In for a penny, in for a pound.

 MR. LAMKEN: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If they've -- if they've 

waived --

MR. LAMKEN: But I'm not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you acknowledge that 

it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why --

why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect 

their immunity from damages?

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, because it would be -- it 

would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it 

didn't override immunities to suit. 

But I'm not sure there are provisions that are 

providing for -- I mean, that there are myriad damages 

immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute

immunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under 

California and other State law, for municipalities to be 

subject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that 

they make. And that is the typical fashion that this --

this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of 

providing judicial review of agency action.

 Another consideration that supports the view 

that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act 

provides an entire process for the implementation of the 

Federal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive 

requirements that identifies the agencies to implement 

them. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-

like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial 

evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like 

the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of 

time. 

It then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted 

mechanism for judicial review. In that sense, it is very 

much like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson. 

That elaborate process is particularly 

significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as 

a whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches 

specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the 

common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with 

corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as

an action for suit -- I mean, an action for damages in 

court or an enforcement action in the commission in 

sections 206 and 207. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does this action have to be 

brought in Federal court? It says any court of competent 

jurisdiction. Could --

MR. LAMKEN: Yes. The action can be brought in 

State court and often is. There are about 50 reported 

decisions that we have found where the suit has been 

brought in State court. I haven't seen a particular 

pattern between the choice, but Congress gave the option.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would a State court be free to 

award damages or would that be preempted under the view 

you take of the statute?

 MR. LAMKEN: The State -- because there's an 

express preservation of State law in this context, I think 

that State -- States would be free to award damages under 

their own laws. They wouldn't -- whatever relief is 

available under the Federal statute would be available 

under the available under the Federal statute, and State 

courts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment 

as to what relief should be provided under Federal 

statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the State court allowed 

damages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law

allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action 

under this section, be allowed to award damages under that 

-- under the State statute?

 MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, I think since the --

the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute 

should not be construed to impair State law -- and there 

are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only 

have one construction of the statute -- I believe that the 

construction would be an across-the-boards construction, 

that this act does not provide damages and you would not 

vary from State to State.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the State law 

authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? Would they be 

recoverable?

 MR. LAMKEN: Pardon? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the State law 

authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? 

MR. LAMKEN: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What would you do then?

 MR. LAMKEN: If the State law provides for 

recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then 

that would control for State violations. For violations 

of Federal law, the -- the remedies that Congress chose to 

provide would control and the States would not be 

permitted to second-guess the -- the remedies --

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure why that would be 

if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an 

APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the 

substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which 

helps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form 

are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no 

reason to interfere with the States. Let them do what 

they want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't 

do. That works perfectly for you. 

MR. LAMKEN: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's strongly supported in the 

history. It may lose your client the money. I don't 

know. 

MR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, California provides 

a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my 

client --

JUSTICE BREYER: So then you're only --

MR. LAMKEN: -- would be fine with your 

position. But that is a potential inference. My -- the 

normal view would be that where Congress provides a -- a 

statute, one would normally presume that Congress intended 

a particular set of remedies to accompany it. You could 

say that the silence is meant to -- meant to reflect the 

fact that Congress knew that these would be enforced in 

State courts, as well as Federal, and it would allow State

courts --

JUSTICE BREYER: Congress didn't care.

 MR. LAMKEN: -- to use whatever --

JUSTICE BREYER: Congress wanted to substitute a 

Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it 

said so. And the reason you know that is because that is 

what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other 

things are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere 

with the State unless you have to.

 MR. LAMKEN: That is one of our principal 

contentions, Justice Breyer, which is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what, Mr. Lamken, would 

be the normal procedure in the State? You make an 

application for a permit to a zoning board. What is the 

standard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we 

don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.

 MR. LAMKEN: The normal procedure is either 

under a uniform State law or California law. If you have 

a -- an entity which is -- excuse me. If you have either 

a planning commission or sometimes there's another entity 

that does the initial review and makes a determination 

whether to grant the permit. It is then appealable either 

to a zoning board of adjustment -- that's the -- the model 

act -- or in California, States -- localities have the 

option of having the appeal go to the local legislature.

That appeal is then reviewed -- is then determined. And 

finally, once you've gone through that process, under 

California law it's generally reviewable by a writ of 

mandate, although other -- other States provide review by 

writ of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other 

procedures, almost always subject to a short limitations 

period, almost always short -- requiring finality, a final 

decision, exhaustion through the State process. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the remedies being 

injunctive and declaratory. 

MR. LAMKEN: A -- a form of specific relief. 

Generally they have the authority to effectively go in and 

revise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do 

not include monetary or compensatory relief I should say. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that it's 

parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would 

be?

 MR. LAMKEN: It's very much like that. The 

remand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA 

context is not so strictly observed in the context of --

of review of -- judicial review of zoning decisions, but 

it is very much like APA review. That is what prevails. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it seems to me that the 

30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of 

damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why.

MR. LAMKEN: Well, actually this Court's


decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and 

that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-

the-record review of decisions below, are often 

insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new 

record such as their proof of damages, to make important 

decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury 

trial, or to prepare for discovery. And that's why 30-

day provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of 

judicial review of agency action, but they're wholly 

unprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the 

area of tort-like remedies like section 1983.

 If I -- if there are no further questions, I 

would like to reserve the remainder of my time for 

rebuttal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may.

 Mr. Feldman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FELDMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 Where Congress creates a special cause of action 

for -- for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily

carries with it its own features and incidents, Congress' 

decisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing 

with that violation of Federal law should not be 

frustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in 

addition. 

In this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which 

creates a cause of action for violation of the specific 

standards in (i) through (iv) is an independent, 

standalone cause of action. If 1983 didn't exist, 

332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide 

plaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain 

redress for the legal wrongs that they claim. 

Where Congress has taken that step and has 

thought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a 

violation of a particular Federal statute and has created 

a judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it -- the statute, 

though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's 

fees, isn't it?

 MR. FELDMAN: It is. It doesn't say anything 

expressly about either of those things, but I think it has 

long been --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can we infer all appropriate 

relief? Do we?

 MR. FELDMAN: As a matter of damages, I think

all appropriate relief would be the standard. But as a 

matter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of 

why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law 

is 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in 

Alyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't 

provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting 

authorized. That's what they intended. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Attorney's fees are never 

appropriate, in other words. 

MR. FELDMAN: Are never appropriate unless 

Congress specifically provides for them. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it has provided for them 

for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes 

care of it. 

MR. FELDMAN: That's right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And this is kind of circular.

 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think it's circular 

because I think when Congress created the specific cause 

of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's 

fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be 

provided. If respondent's view in this case were 

accepted, the -- the presumption would be exactly flipped, 

and Congress would have had --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Congress said

specifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would 

that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?

 MR. FELDMAN: Yes, I -- yes, I think it -- I 

think it would. 

The question here, though, is where Congress has 

thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation 

of a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of 

action for every wrong that's -- that -- that can exist 

under that statute, then the incidents and features of 

that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and 

features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case 

are different. And attorney's fees is just the best 

example of that. 

If -- under respondent's view -- when Congress 

was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of 

this Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that 

attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly 

provided for. And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications 

Act --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take -- you -- you 

take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's 

not just attorney's fees. It's damages.

 MR. FELDMAN: That's right. But it's just an 

illustration. There's other differences between the 

provision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is

that where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a 

particular violation -- type of violation of Federal law 

and has provided for a judicial cause of action, with 

whatever features and incidents it -- it wants, 1983 

shouldn't be allowed in. It should be assumed that 

Congress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by 

also allowing a 1983 action. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about damages? 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you -- do you think that 

any other provisions of the Communications Act are 

enforceable under 1983? I mean, we're talking about 332, 

but it's a big, complicated act. Are any of the other 

provisions enforceable?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think -- I think the same rule 

would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has 

specifically provided for a cause of action for the same 

reason, otherwise Congress when -- here, for example, just 

to return to attorney's fees for a second. When Congress 

was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't 

giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be 

construed not to give attorney's fees, but not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is really a more 

general proposition you're urging upon us then, that 

whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is --

what -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the

background action of section 1983 is not available. 

MR. FELDMAN: That -- I -- I think that's 

correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. How could that be? 

Wouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the 

particular statute, the particular set of remedies that 

Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely 

independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in 

favor or leaning against. It would depend on the 

particular statute. Why in general?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think in -- I think the rule 

would be in general because, first of all, it's not just 

remedies. There's other incidents of a cause of action 

such as statute of limitations, the provision here for 

expedition, and other things. And really when Congress 

has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation 

here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the 

Communications Act of other Federal standards, it 

shouldn't be assumed that they all -- that -- to allow a 

1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in 

fashioning that particular remedy. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how would you ever have 

a statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a 

violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional. 

One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad

reading means that you were doing away with statute as a 

basis for 1983.

 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that that's 

completely wrong. When Congress has created -- has 

recognized a right, as this Court has found is essential 

for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about 

providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause 

of action in court in particular, then that's the function 

of 1983, is to serve -- it provides a cause of action for 

people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory 

violation. 

But where Congress has given thought to what 

kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of 

action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's 

fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever 

the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate 

Congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983 

action to undo all of the things that Congress provided 

for. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there -- there are two 

situations. I mean, one can supplement without 

frustrating. I mean, you -- you could say that in, you 

know -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the 

action that was provided, but one can conceive of a 

provided action that -- that grants relief which 1983

would not grant.

 MR. FELDMAN: That's right. And -- and I --

whatever -- I guess the general point would be whatever 

remedial decisions Congress made, those should be 

respected, but I would add in this case it's not just --

it's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have 

had to -- Congress would have had to do something very 

unusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no 

-- there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you 

can always go to 1983 and get it. In fact, even if they 

had done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still 

argue, well, we still have our 1983 action. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about damages? Do 

-- do you take any position on whether the Communications 

Act provision enables damages to be collected?

 MR. FELDMAN: We don't have a position on 

whether it does. I think there's arguments both ways. I 

would point out --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it's unnecessary to 

decide this case.

 MR. FELDMAN: I think it is unnecessary, and in 

fact, I think it shows a problem with -- a reason why our 

view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that 

should be respected -- why that should be respected.

 Under other views, you have to look at the 1983

action and figure out all of its incidents. You have to 

look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents 

in the abstract as here, not where -- in connection with a 

particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're 

consistent with each other. 

I think the much better rule would be to say 

where Congress has created a specific cause of action, 

that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that, 

you get. Whatever you don't get under that, you don't 

get. But 1983 shouldn't be used to -- to frustrate 

Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of 

action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of 

limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to 

give you -- eliminate the provision for mandatory 

expedition, to have any differences in damages. 

Another way to put it would be under the Court's 

decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any 

appropriate relief. All that 1983 could do here -- it 

maybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that 

goes, it doesn't matter. But all it could do otherwise 

would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that 

Congress didn't want. 

And instead of construing the two statutes in 

that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in 

accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth

the line of cases where you have a right to get into court 

in Wilder -- I'm sorry -- in -- in Sea Clammers and Smith 

against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress' 

remedy, however simple or complex it is. It gives you a 

complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it 

gives you. And that should govern. 

And then the other line of cases, which is 

Wilder where -- and -- where it says -- and the Wright 

against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to 

get to court -- get into court. In those cases, that's 

the function of 1983.

 The same thing would be true in -- in a number 

of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have 

a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't 

think at all about the remedy because that's the function 

that 1983 was supposed to serve.

 If there's no further questions.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 In -- by its clear text, section 1983 promises 

redress for the depravation of any Federal right in any,

quote, proper proceeding. And that expansive language, 

this Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption 

that its remedies apply to all violations of Federal 

rights, a presumption which this Court has said is 

rebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the 

statute that creates the right is accompanied by an 

enforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or 

inconsistent with 1983's remedies. That's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Waxman. 

MR. WAXMAN: -- the background principle. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that 

the -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility 

is the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one 

that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his 

argument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30-

day provision in there, which in effect says Congress 

wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast. 

And that is incompatible with a damage action because if 

you get into a damage action, you are going to get into 

the panoply of -- of damages litigation, including 

depositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is 

that it is not going to be over expeditiously. 

What is your argument? What is your response to 

that incompatibility argument? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that the way this

Court has interpreted incompatibility before -- in the two 

instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was 

decided, the only instances in which this Court has found 

incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an 

end run around limitations in the statute. That is, in 

the -- in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had 

statutes that forestalled an individual's access to court 

via an administrative regime and then expressly limited 

the judicial remedies that would be available once they 

got there by requiring, for example, only injunctive 

relief. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the other word is 

inconsistent, and is it -- sorry. Were you -- is it 

inconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's 

insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at 

the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it 

sounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the 

maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty 

statute.

 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see an administrative law 

statute. It sounds like that's the system they're 

imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent 

with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to 

fail.

 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Now I have two points. I --

I don't want to forget these. I have to deal with the --

the question of whether a 30-day requirement is 

inconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent 

with what -- with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like 

administrative review model.

 A 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of 

Congress' -- Congress confirming expressly that somebody 

who -- who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him 

under 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether 

it's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly. 

It's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and 

Felder, guarantees and requires. It does not require --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it also requires 

expeditiousness on the part of the court. 

MR. WAXMAN: It requires that the court proceed 

expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where 

damages are sought or are not sought.

 One of the interesting things about damages --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you -- do you agree with 

this much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be 

allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to 

be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious 

if damages are not allowed.

 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think that's true. In

fact, I think this case is a pretty good example. The 

court separated it -- I mean, acting under a requirement 

of expedition at the request of the city. This -- the 

court didn't even begin to address this case until 18 

months after it had been filed. But what it said was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And -- and that --

MR. WAXMAN: -- the first issue --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was a violation of the 

statute, wasn't it?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it first issued an order 

saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've 

determined that the statute is violated. Now we will have 

a separate proceeding. Then the city will conduct itself 

accordingly. Now we'll have a separate proceeding in 

order to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are 

available. And that is available in any of these cases. 

What --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So they turned the damage issue 

basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end 

of the case.

 MR. WAXMAN: It could or could not be, and there 

may -- may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate 

but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was just to 

decide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance --

that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific 

case damages or attorney's fees were due. But the 

district court was deciding a question of law, that is, 

whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could 

have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.

 MR. WAXMAN: What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was 

we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available 

and to what extent in a separate proceeding. As it turns 

out, he concluded in an --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was not making a rule for 

this case only. He was making a ruling of law.

 MR. WAXMAN: For sure. He said that I don't 

think you're entitled to this because I think that the 

statute doesn't allow it. And therefore, he didn't get to 

this question. 

But the point about damages -- I think there are 

two points that are very important that not be obscured.

 First of all, the Government -- the fact that 

the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether 

the statute itself provides damages relief under the 

principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County 

certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on 

this subject. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they don't necessarily 

disagree. The Government just says the -- the issue

doesn't have to be reached in this case.

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think -- I think that --

what the Government says in its papers is they may well be 

available and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote 

him, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I 

think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh 

Circuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific 

remedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you 

apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v. 

Hood and applied to an implied right of action in 

Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is 

available. And damages are the paradigm. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman. 

MR. WAXMAN: And the irony here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how 

do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is 

applicable to the cause of action under the Communications 

Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983? 

I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983. 

There's no 30-day limit there.

 MR. WAXMAN: I have -- I have two different ways 

to get to that.

 First of all, section 1983, by its terms, 

provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It 

also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of

action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't 

exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that 

are brought under 1983. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. 

MR. WAXMAN: But more broadly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't require you to --

to establish a cause of action under some other statute 

either.

 MR. WAXMAN: That's right. It provides a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It does not at all. It's --

it's self-contained. And do you know any case where we 

have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to 

read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from 

the statute that was violated and which forms the basis 

for the 1983 action?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't, but I do know that 

this Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted 

section 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default 

statute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983 

doesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction 

that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law. 

And there's certainly nothing in that language that says 

when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is 

otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very 

statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is

enforcing. 

And even before that, when your -- your decision 

in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to 

figure out what statute of limitations applies to a 

freestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a 

tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires 

you to engage in. And the first part is to see whether 

there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of 

limitations. 

Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that 

was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social 

Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v. 

Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much 

less any express statute of limitations. And so this 

Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's 

the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires.

 But the anomaly of the argument here is we have 

a background principle that 1983 is available and there is 

a heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is 

explicitly incompatible or inconsistent with --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's --

MR. WAXMAN: -- and --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that's why I'm approaching 

it differently, and I -- I want to get your view on it. 

I'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a

guide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do 

that, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in 

what I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run 

the whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We 

want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a 

few minimal procedural requirements.

 If that's right, that means all these damages 

questions are open. All kinds of things are open, but --

and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe 

deferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983 

doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not the APA 

model. This is not a model of administrative review for a 

number of reasons. 

Number one, it is a background -- there -- there 

-- it is established, for purposes of this case, that this 

statute creates individual Federal rights and those rights 

were violated. And the background rule is uniformly --

and this Court has -- has -- in Owens v. City of 

Indianapolis and many other cases has reinforced the 

principle that damages are available and 1983 is available 

where Federal rights are violated by municipalities, 

whether it's under the Takings Clause or the Due Process 

Clause or the Equal Protection Clause or in statutory 

cases. What is more --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, one 

of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC, 

the one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought 

review from the local decision to the FCC, you petition 

for FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you 

attorney's fees?

 MR. WAXMAN: The FCC has said that it does not 

if you do that. In -- in 2000, when the FCC last 

reported, one person had chosen to go that route rather 

than go to Federal court. It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't that an 

incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice? 

Complainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or 

you can go to court.

 MR. WAXMAN: You can't go to the -- excuse me. 

I didn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- if you have that 

choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to 

go the -- why would any litigant ever do that? Why would 

any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC 

and you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be 

that it would work the same way whether you go to the 

agency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that 

you're in the same situation as respect to fees?

 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the FCC alternative for a

declaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five 

rights that are provided here, and even if it applied to 

all of them, I don't think you could possibly infer 

that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take the one, 

that -- that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there 

because you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you 

shouldn't get them in court?

 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. If -- if there 

were an instance in which a local zoning official said, 

you know, I know I'm not supposed to take radio 

frequencies emissions into account, but I'm going to, it's 

denied, I would have the right either to go to the FCC and 

say, tell them no, or to file an action under 332 and/or 

1983 and say that violates my rights. And actually your 

example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't --

MR. WAXMAN: If I just may finish. 

Your example, I think -- the example of this 

particular provision points out that what -- the balance 

of what I was going to explain to Justice Breyer, which is 

that another reason why this isn't the APA model is that 

this statute includes in little (i) and little (ii) 

substantive provisions, not just procedural provisions. 

You can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first

example, among providers. The -- that was a complaint in 

this case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those 

claims. It's not administrative APA review in any 

respect. And in fact, the district judge in this very 

case, Judge Wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were 

discriminated against, but I don't need to reach that 

because it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they didn't provide for 

the normal administrative review because they were quite 

aware that under the State zoning systems, there would 

always be State administrative review before the issue 

even comes up.

 MR. WAXMAN: And this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And so what this provides is 

what kind of judicial review there will be after the 

anticipated administrative review before the zoning board 

and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists. 

MR. WAXMAN: I -- I have to respectfully 

disagree. This Court, in -- in Williamson County and 

Darby and many other cases, has distinguished carefully 

between final -- final action and exhaustion of 

administrative review or judicial review. And all this 

statute requires is that if you are aggrieved by an action 

or inaction of a State or local government or an 

instrumentality thereof --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Final. Final action or failure

MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Final action or failure to.

 MR. WAXMAN: And final action, this Court has 

explained, does not import into it exhaustion of either a 

State administrative or judicial remedies. What it means 

is that once you have been injured, it's a -- it's a 

ripeness requirement that's familiar under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't been injured until 

you've exhausted your --

MR. WAXMAN: That is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you really think that 

when there is a State provision available for review of 

the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 

without even going through the administrative appeals?

 MR. WAXMAN: I am entirely certain of that, and 

in fact, the -- the local ordinance -- I mean, the 

question of what is final agency action is surely a 

Federal question, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is really respecting the 

States, which is what the -- the purpose of this -- of 

this whole provision was.

addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points

out in the very first page of its brief and as the 

legislative history reflects, it was confronting a 

situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning 

authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the 

creation of a national wireless network. And it was so 

concerned about this that the House actually passed a 

provision that removed this paradigmatic local authority 

to the FCC. The FCC was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which would be more 

burdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities 

nationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and 

burdensome on federalism --

MR. WAXMAN: I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and the abilities of local 

governments to function?

 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, I think the former, for sure. 

I mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions 

would be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably 

intrusive. 

And what happened in the conference committee 

was a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective 

was going to be achieved by creating -- by leaving it, in 

the first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure 

because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality

can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of

 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I --

MR. WAXMAN: -- let me just say this, with 

respect to the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Plus other -- plus other 

damages.

 MR. WAXMAN: I think this case, Justice Kennedy 

-- I have three things to say about this. 

Just this case is every bit as -- as paradigmatic 

as the parade of horribles that they suggest. And here's 

my proof. It has been since 1997 that courts have been 

ruling that 1983 and damages are available under this 

statute. There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the 

other side or any of their amici that there has either 

been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large 

awards. 

And if that happened, Congress would do -- would 

be attentive to it in the way that Justice Ginsburg 

pointed out when the local cable authorities came to --

came to the very same committees 4 years before and said, 

we're being hit -- there's an express right of action in 

555 of the -- the Communications Act. We're being hit 

with very large 1983 awards. Please do something about

it. And the very same committees 4 years before enacted a 

provision that said you may get only injunctive and 

declaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility 

with 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, cable -- cable media 

companies may -- may have Congress' ear more readily than 

-- than -- you know, than the municipality of whatever 

this is or any --

MR. WAXMAN: State and -- than State and local 

governments? I hope not. But here's -- here's the 

additional --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I wouldn't put a lot 

of money on it. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WAXMAN: The point is that Congress --

Justice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being 

inattentive to State and local budgets. What it wanted to 

do what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in 

-- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis, 

which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately 

enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages 

remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that 

had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program 

and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate.

 Now, this Court has made clear, with respect to

damages, in -- in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that 

there may be very many cases in which there's a violation 

of a procedural right but only nominal damages are 

available. And in Buckhannon --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But with respect to --

MR. WAXMAN: If I may just finish this sentence. 

And in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has --

has recognized that in order to get attorney's fees, you 

have to have substantially prevailed and a court, under 

1988(b), may award attorney's fees in its -- may award --

in its discretion insofar as they are reasonable. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman. 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is in this legislative 

record a concern expressed by a Senator from California 

when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the 

Federal review forum. And that was rejected, if I 

understand correctly, because there was a concern that 

municipalities would have to travel all the way to 

Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And 

Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the 

cost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well, 

that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that 

would be awarded. 

MR. WAXMAN: First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I

-- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two 

Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's 

brief suggests, this provision. They were talking about 

another provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was 

section 253, but I may be wrong. 

But even if that's the case, the fact of the 

matter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I 

agree. It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left 

all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking, 

and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on 

local municipalities to have to come to Washington to 

justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which 

would have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it 

would sort of like be the -- the television commercial, 

you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you 

know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact 

is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial 

decisions with local authorities. 

But Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly 

frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which 

they had let local authorities do it under their normal 

routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting 

the job done. That was the imperative of this statute. 

And in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11 

years later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later.

In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or 

inappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy 

presumption that this Court has recognized over and over 

and over again, that 1983 is there. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the only --

MR. WAXMAN: 1983 is the background principle 

against which Congress legislates. And this statute 

either -- neither provides nor excludes any remedies, and 

all it does is confirm that when you go -- when you are 

injured, you can go to court. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: The other -- the other harm is 

there any evidence of because it's -- it would also be 

harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite 

difficult decisions, because the -- the antenna -- they 

bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're 

environmentally harmful. They -- there are a lot of bad 

things, as well as good things about them. And of course, 

it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning 

boards were erring too much on the side of granting 

everybody's application, as well as too much on the side 

of not granting them. 

MR. WAXMAN: To be sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And so I -- I don't know how --

what the -- there won't be evidence. How can we get 

evidence on such a thing?

 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the -- you -- the evidence 

will be either in the decided cases or by local municipal 

governments coming to Congress and saying, this is too 

heavy a thumb on the scale. But what we know is that if 

you afford only prospective relief, which is the -- the 

ancien regime that Congress was -- that Congress felt 

wasn't doing the job, it provides no deterrent, no 

incentive to accomplish what Congress said was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I don't think we --

MR. WAXMAN: -- a compelling national objective.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think we usually think 

of -- of judicial review of agency decisions in the 

ordinary course as being a deterrent.

 MR. WAXMAN: We --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an opportunity to 

elaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a 

deterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent. 

And as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that 

there's -- there's another voice in that -- in that 

administrative hearing room. They're terrified of 

damages.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's going to skew the 

decisions. 

MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy, it -- under their

-- under the regulations of this municipality, which is --

is perfectly representative, it is final agency action 

when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you 

choose to appeal it to the city council.

 And there is -- not only is there nothing 

peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the 

violation by a State and local government of an express 

Federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the 

right was violated but also that you were really damaged. 

It's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had 

damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct. 

You have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned 

Stacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a 

deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal 

local officials. 

But what Congress had -- Congress had to come up 

with some way to confront this problem in which there were 

sort of local parochial --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr. 

Waxman? I don't know if it's really a legal question 

exactly, but I have the impression that most of the 

plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed, 

large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff. 

And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive 

to be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct

impression or is it incorrect?

 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't know whether it's a 

correct impression or not. Our brief points the Court to 

an authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have 

-- have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or 

fewer facilities. 

And one thing we know for sure is that when 

Congress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically 

wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies. 

It had specific provisions in the law to give special 

treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster

JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't imagine -- I can't 

imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose 

damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without 

even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their 

mistakes, which is what you're saying. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the 

municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people 

to take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at 

the lowest level and you get damages and you get 

attorney's fees. That -- that is extraordinary. 

MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983 

-- and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it

does any other principle -- stands for the proposition 

that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the 

statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated 

incompatibility. And that's the background rule. 

There are many instances in the Telecom Act and 

elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get 

injunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean, 

go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title 

II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly --

expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation 

of 1983.

 And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my 

client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was 

subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged 

and entrenched intransigence by this particular 

municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example 

in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v. 

the Village of Mequon.

 But this Court has recognized, as have the lower 

courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you 

really have been damaged. And in an instance where 

there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct 

it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus, 

where the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given 

the opportunity.

 In this case, the city never said, give us the 

opportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson, 

a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing 

to go back and correct because the only thing -- the only 

reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna 

and tower in the first place. It -- we concede that it 

makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being 

broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago 

and have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a 

substantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may 

have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all 

out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not 

in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back. 

There's a line of cases this Court has decided 

under the Social Security Act where there have been 

remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and 

in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get 

damages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you 

probably don't get attorney's fees either.

 If there ever is the sort of parade of horribles 

that they protest about, even a small parade of horribles, 

Congress will be as attentive as it was in 1992 when the 

cable --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. LAMKEN: I'd like to make only two brief 

points.

 First, that the imposition of the -- of damages 

and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court 

for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the 

antenna siting rules, which are often complex and 

uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and 

aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees 

on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce 

their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly 

attempted to preserve in the statute itself. 

It is -- in this case alone, for example, 

respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees 

-- and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add 

-- is -- is $15 million, essentially the city's entire 

budget for a year. And respondent claims to be a 

relatively small operator. That sort of -- with that sort 

of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few 

municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights 

to enforce local zoning even when they're relatively 

certain that they are right.

 Section 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its 

purposes as the preservation of local authority. It 

should not be construed to provide for that authority's 

evisceration. 

The second point I wanted to hit is that when 

Congress established the mechanism for review in 332, it 

provided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of 

characteristics: a very short limitations period and 

mandatory expedition. This Court's decisions in Novotny 

makes it clear that neither of those requirements can be 

simply transferred over to section 1983. Novotny had very 

similar language, a 90-day limitations period. The Court 

did not transfer that over to section 1983. Instead it 

understood that the general rule, the general Federal 

principle of law, that in the absence of an express 

limitations period, that State law would control. Wilson 

then confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section 

1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State 

law controls unless there's an express Federal cause of --

statute that addresses that particular cause of action.

 If there are no further questions, we ask only 

that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. Thank 

you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.

 The case is submitted.
