 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation 

versus Reliant Energy Services.

 Mr. Frederick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court.

 In 1988, the Government of British Columbia 

created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions 

including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated 

by development of the Province's natural resources 

pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States.

 The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex 

its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State 

entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal 

court.

 Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction 

issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors 

by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ 

status. First, the court articulated the wrong test for 

determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign 

State. The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive

are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court 

overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public 

functions that are the best indication of its sovereign 

status. The British Columbia Government receives and 

distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations, 

supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to 

provincial laws not applicable to private companies and 

grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from 

taxation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Frederick, are you 

going to get to the 1447(d) problem?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Let me address that 

now. The court's -- the district court's remand order 

was appealable because it was not issued under 1447(c).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court 

thought it was and one we did, the district court said I 

have no authority in -- under -- over any of these 

people. So back it goes.

 MR. FREDERICK: The district court made two 

mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper 

and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Because 

of that inconsistency, the court of appeals --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Removal. Removal was-

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- talking that -- where 

are these statements?

JUSTICE SCALIA: You said remand was proper. 

That's the --

MR. FREDERICK: Sorry. That removal was 

proper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d) 

and 1442(a). It also then said it lacked subject matter 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the point it was 

acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was 

not that it thought the removal had been proper; the 

basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked 

jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.

 MR. FREDERICK: But immunity was the basis 

of the district court's thinking that it had to remand.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It may have been, leaving 

aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it 

may have been wrong. But what it thought it was doing 

it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a 

jurisdictional reason.

 MR. FREDERICK: And what this Court's cases 

say, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a 

ground cognizable under 1447(c).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those cases are all 

-- all based on Thermtron. You don't have any doubt 

that Thermtron would come out the other way today, do 

you?

MR. FREDERICK: I certainly do --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in light of, in 

light of the statutory language as it exists now?

 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four 

times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory 

amendments. It has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on 

the basis of statute is the strongest form of stare 

decisis. So I do --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But stare decisis on 

the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the 

statute's been changed.

 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the 

Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead --

from the time it was decided even through statutory 

amendments. Our submission is that if Congress intended 

to change that rule, it could have done so clearly. And 

we note that the Respondents here don't ask for 

Thermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the 

amicus on their side, that the only way you could rule 

in favor of the Respondents in this case would be to 

overrule Thermtron.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Thermtron was such a 

far cry from this case. In Thermtron the district judge

said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so 

I'm going to toss this case back to the State court.

 MR. FREDERICK: But here, Justice Ginsburg, 

the court did have jurisdiction because removal was 

properly effectuated once the entities that we moved 

were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign 

sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal 

sovereigns in the case of BPA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we go into that 

question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity. I mean, if 

in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether 

indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to 

be able to appeal every case.

 MR. FREDERICK: No, you're not, 

Justice Scalia, and here's why. Immunity is not a 

ground for remand because it is not a precondition for a 

removal by a sovereign. It is a separate freestanding 

issue. It is a status determination that determines 

whether removal is proper by those sovereigns.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be fine if 

1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the 

basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it 

says.

 MR. FREDERICK: But if in Thermtron the 

court, the district court had said my docket is too

busy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and 

remand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt 

that the courts would look beyond the label given.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think the court 

said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject 

matter jurisdiction.

 MR. FREDERICK: I'm speaking hypothetically, 

Justice Ginsburg. My point is that the label the 

district court attached here was the wrong label, and 

that's why the court of appeals to satisfy --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Why was it wrong 

when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district 

court said I have -- these people are totally immune 

from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.

 MR. FREDERICK: Because it is inconsistent 

with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive 

effect to remand a case on the ground that the 

sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate 

their immune status in State court. That is precisely 

why Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you are really 

arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is 

that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with 

foreign sovereign immunities.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's our backup

submission, Justice Souter. You do not need to reach 

that if you agree with our principal submission and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the trouble with the 

principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have 

said that even if the district court has come to an 

erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it 

understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling, 

that is not appealable.

 MR. FREDERICK: But Justice Souter, it did 

so. The case -- the cases in which the Court has said 

so have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds 

cognizable under 1447(c). Immunity from suit is not 

such a ground, because the purpose of having the removal 

provision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal 

courts to decide the immunity status. If the court 

sends the case back to State court on immunity grounds, 

it does not have preclusive effect in the State courts. 

The State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign 

immunity status and there will be no recourse except 

through appeal through the State court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're into your 

backup argument now.

 MR. FREDERICK: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The backup argument that 

you're now making, that not your principal argument.

MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, that's 

not our backup argument. Our point is that in this 

case, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of 

the successful removals, which everybody conceded were 

correct, that the label that it attached, immunity is 

subject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground 

recognized in 1447(c). So it was appropriate for the 

court of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to 

determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory 

remand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type 

this Court has recognized in the Cohill case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you request -- when 

the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was 

before the district court, did you request that the 

district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court 

remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the 

case -- the question up on appeal?

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't believe that we did, 

Justice Ginsburg. This case was remanded. A motion --

motions for clarification were subsequently brought. 

But a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because that would have 

taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay 

the remand to allow this question of law to be 

determined by the court of appeals.

MR. FREDERICK: It is certainly the case 

that in searching through the docket entries, you'll 

discover that there was a holding by the district court 

of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure.

 But the point that is important here is that 

even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction 

pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose 

subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity 

claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign 

sovereigns. And it is their theory that the district 

court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that 

has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes 

behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the 

opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in 

Federal court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't care whether it 

had subject matter jurisdiction or not. It's not an 

essential part of their case. Their case is even if it 

did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end 

of case.

 MR. FREDERICK: Their submission in this 

Court, however, is that there was no subject matter 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's their backup 

argument, I think.

MR. FREDERICK: Well, their backup argument 

should be rejected by the Court as wrong.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If in fact it goes back to 

the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you 

raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two 

things the statute guaranteed you? One was a 

determination in the Federal court that you're an organ 

of a Federal State, and second, a bench trial?

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, there's no 

provision --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but could you?

 MR. FREDERICK: By the time the appeals in 

the State court would have been exhausted, the very 

benefits --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm just asking could 

you, yes or no. I --

MR. FREDERICK: We would certainly make the 

argument.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. Now if you lost 

in the State court, could you then use that as a basis 

for asking this Court to accept jurisdiction? And if 

they -- if we did, we took it and we heard the case, 

reverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under 

the statute?

want to foreclose any arguments that we might try to 

make; but let me point out to you that in the years that 

it would take to march through the State court system, 

Powerex, as a sovereign, would be denied its right to 

have a bench trial --

JUSTICE BREYER: See, what I'm getting at is 

whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical 

problems that you raise are present. And they're awful. 

I don't deny them.  I mean, they're right there in the 

statute, it foresees them. So I wonder, is there any 

difference in this case from every case where the remand 

is erroneous?

 MR. FREDERICK: I do think foreign 

sovereigns are different, and Congress intended to treat 

JUSTICE BREYER: In terms of the legal right 

to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your 

view of the law, there is no difference.

 MR. FREDERICK: The foreign sovereign is 

entitled to a bench trial. It is entitled to other 

procedural protections with respect to treatment of 

garnishment, other --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you would get those 

eventually, it would just have to happen.

would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's purely --

pure question begging. I mean, the whole issue on the 

merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not. And 

you can't assume that you're correct when the remand 

provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been 

remanded doesn't care whether you're correct. The idea 

is, you can get a correct determination in State court 

through up to review by this Court eventually, as you 

can in Federal court. There's no reason to assume that 

the Federal court is the only place you would get a 

correct determination.

 MR. FREDERICK: But Mr. Chief Justice, the 

point of having Congress enact these removal provisions 

and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for 

sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to 

vindicate those rights and interests. If Powerex were 

sued for not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's the same with 

diversity jurisdiction. You can make the same argument. 

There's nothing distinctive here. This statute says 

that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a 

right to be tried in Federal court. Fine. But the 

statute also says that if you're a defendant in a 

diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal

court.

 And I don't know why this is any more 

demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary 

diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're 

entitled to trial in federal court.

 MR. FREDERICK: Diversity is different, 

Justice Scalia, and here's why.

 When a case is removed on diversity grounds, 

the court of appeals -- the district court is obliged to 

examine the bases of diversity. That is what the 

court's removal duty is. When a foreign sovereign 

removes a case, the district court's duty is to 

determine is this a foreign State within the meaning of 

the FSIA. If it is, I have jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, may I just 

follow up on Justice Breyer's question? It seems to me 

that your answer suggests that you have two bites at the 

apple because you -- all the way along, you might win. 

And if you won, then it wouldn't matter. If you lose, 

you always have the argument that you've made here, 

let's go back and start over again.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Stevens, I don't 

think we would win at all in that circumstance because 

we would be forced as a foreign State to litigate in 

State court contrary to Congress's will.

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if you lose, you 

always have a point on appeal and may start all over 

again later on.

 MR. FREDERICK: It is unclear to me, and I'm 

not sure that I've seen any of this Court's cases that 

would suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural 

right would be grounds for reversing a State court 

judgment. And our position is that Congress intended to 

protect the bench trial right, the immunity defenses of 

a foreign sovereign, because the organ status 

questioned --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anybody in this 

case -- did any of the Defendants in this case request a 

trial by jury?

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't recall whether the 

Defendants do, but it is clear that the Plaintiffs would 

be entitled to a jury trial --

it? Has any party asked for a jury trial? If not, that 

part of the case seems academic.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the case has settled, 

Justice Ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of 

trial procedures, and so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The case is settled?

 MR. FREDERICK: As explained in the cert 

petition papers, the case is on appeal in the State 

court system on objections to the settlement, and it 

will not be mooted during the course of this Court's 

action on the case.

 But the invocation of jury that would be 

done normally just before trial has not been an issue 

that's been presented.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's different 

than it is in the Federal courts. You have to -- can't 

wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, what the Plaintiffs 

here assert is that they would be denied their right to 

jury trial, and I presume that that means they intend to 

ask for one and to perpetuate that request. Our 

position, as we explain in a footnote in our reply 

brief, is that they have a jury trial right as against 

Duke and Reliant; they do not as against the foreign 

sovereigns that they have sued.

So at root, the case is about the kind of 

comity and dignity that the courts of the United States 

will accord to foreign sovereigns. If Powerex were sued 

on the basis of non-commercial acts, it would not be 

entitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the 

district court is held to have no jurisdiction, 

notwithstanding the proper removal under 1441(d).

 I'd like to save the reminder of my time for 

rebuttal, please.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This Court has recognized repeatedly that 

the bar on appellate review in 1447(d) applies only to 

remands under 1447(c). This Court has held that the 

courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a 

remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 

1447(c). In fact, just this term in Osborn, the 

district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) 

for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Osborn made it very clear 

that was an extraordinary case where Congress had 

explicitly ordered two conflicting things. One, it said 

no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no 

review of remands. So the Court was as clear as it 

could be that only when you have those conflicting 

signals does that court -- does that case have any 

application.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor is 

absolutely correct. Osborn concerned a particular kind 

of categorical exception from 1447(c). Our argument is 

that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in 

this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). That 

although the District Court termed the sovereign 

immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not 

jurisdictional in the relevant sense. And this Court 

held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case. 

There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the 

district court on the basis of its immunity and the 

district court certified that holding as a 

jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this 

Court.

 Yet this Court looked beyond that label 

attached by the district court and held that sovereign 

immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense

because it does not limit the authority of the Federal 

courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule 

that would preclude suit in State court as well. 

Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that 

the defendant is immune.

 When Congress authorized sovereign 

defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate 

their immunity, it did not intend that when the district 

court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to 

State court which would be free to disregard the Federal 

court's decision.

 JUSTICE BREYER: One technical question. 

The same one. I would to be -- imagine it is a 

diversity case. Imagine that a Federal court 

erroneously remands it. A trial gets up to this Court. 

And we say it was diverse. It shouldn't have been 

remanded. Now what's -- is that like -- can that 

happen? I guess. And is the remedy then wipe out the 

State proceedings, go back to Federal court? What 

happens? Has that have ever been a case like that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What happened?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Missouri 

Pacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on 

review of a State court judgment following remand cannot

review the remand order itself. It can review issues of 

Federal law that were decided by the State courts on 

remand but --

JUSTICE BREYER: And it is called, the case, 

Missouri --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Missouri Pacific 

Railway case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what --

what do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after 

removal joinder might defeat subject matter 

jurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit 

joinder and remand the action. In other words, you have 

got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute 

contemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose 

subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there. 

And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari 

materia with (c) so that the remands would not be 

subject to review. It seems to me the same situation 

here. You have got allegedly subject matter 

jurisdiction. It is later defeated, and it is remanded. 

Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: What, what's 

notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same 

time that it amended 1447(c). It provided in 1447(e) 

for an authority to remand in a particular instance

where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction 

post-removal. It had of course been the rule since this 

Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that 

post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's 

jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit 

that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was 

removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.

 And when Congress amended the language in 

1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in 

removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, 

it at the same time -- and added the language, or 

changed the language in the second sentence that raises 

problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 

1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to 

remand based on post-removal events that would have been 

unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was 

intended to confer general authority to remand on the 

basis of post-removal events.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't have 

any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered 

by 1447(d), do you?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. And the courts 

of appeals that have considered that question likewise 

hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari 

materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on

whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable 

decision appealable under Waco or not. But -- but that 

issue is not presented.

 But what is significant is that had Congress 

intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for 

the first time remand on the basis of post-removal 

events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, 

the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that 

Congress believed that in the absence of that provision, 

the Court would have been limited to two alternatives. 

Authorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss 

the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How is that relevant here? 

Where is the post-removal event?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The post-removal 

event here is the recognition of the defendant's 

sovereign immunity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not an event. 

That's -- that's an epiphany, it's not an event.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, according --

well, apparently the district court viewed it as a 

post-removal event that deprived it, or defeated, 

divested --

event.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean the sovereign 

immunity didn't exist from the outset. Nothing changed.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But -- but the 

district court's order is clear. And it is absolutely 

correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed 

at the outset. So the court does not lack removal 

jurisdiction. The reference in 1447(c), second sentence 

to "lacks subject matter jurisdiction," refers to lacks 

removal jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court used that 

shorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe 

1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction. This Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When did it say that? I 

really find it very hard to accept that argument, when 

its says -- you know -- it doesn't use lacks removal 

jurisdiction, that's what it means. It is such an easy 

thing to say.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the Court has 

to go back to the history of the statute, how it's 

evolved. Clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only 

if it was removed without jurisdiction. And so the 

question is when Congress changed the language to lacks 

subject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal

jurisdiction? Which it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the -- under the 

district court's view, would there have been original 

jurisdiction against Powerex?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, it would not 

have. Bit that's because of the peculiarities of the 

difference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA, 

section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the 

FSIA. Whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a 

conclusion that the defendant is not immune, Congress 

conferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign 

sovereign is defended.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then can you --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Likewise in 

1442(a), which was about the Federal --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can, can you tell me, if 

the Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back 

to the State court. Can the immunity argument be raised 

in the State court?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The immunity 

argument could be raised in State court. That's what 

this Court held in Kircher. But the defendant would be 

forever denied its right to a bench trial under Federal 

law. That right is limited to suits in the Federal 

courts by its term; 1441(d) --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because then you'd have 

constant -- eternal shuttling back and forth, that's 

why.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The State court 

could reconsider Powerex's status as a foreign 

sovereign, but it wouldn't have many, if any, 

implications in the State court because Powerex isn't 

claiming immunity in this case. It's only invoking the 

procedural benefits of the FSIA which include that the 

case be litigated in the Federal court before a judge 

rather than a jury. And it would be forever denied the 

benefits, those important procedural benefits of the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. SIMON,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. SIMON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 There are two reasons, independent and 

sufficient reasons why there is in appellate 

jurisdiction in this case. The first most narrow and 

simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of 

jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which 

accept the district court's remand order for what it is 

and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject 

matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under 

1447(d). That is a simple direct route to that result.

 There is a second approach suggested by a 

lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors 

have heard this morning. And I want to lay it out 

briefly for the Court.

 And it is that, as the law professor amici

have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the 

lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of 

1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to 

1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of 

appeal.

 And the Court could clear out some of this 

underbrush, mooting many of the issues that 

Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have 

raised. Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the 

question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring 

opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron 

does not say what many of the lower courts think it 

does. Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it 

does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by 

Carnegie Mellon. The notion that the only proper remand 

is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie 

Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand 

covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also 

ancient history.

 Congress has given us a simple and strong 

message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when 

the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith 

disputing forum, State court versus Federal court, 

Congress has said take one shot at it, let an Article 

III judge determine whether the forum is State court or

Federal court, and move on to the merits.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what, what reason 

would Congress have for wanting a system that says --

and there are many, many, many people in the United 

States who would like to sue Pakistan. They would like 

to sue China. They would like to sue Russia. There are 

all kinds of places they would like to sue. And why 

would Congress want to have a system that says to those 

countries, you can come into Federal court and get your 

claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a; 

but by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake, 

there you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one 

of 50 different states? In front of juries, the very 

thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have 

to do.

 Now what would their theory be?

 MR. SIMON: It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I, -- I'm not sure it 

is even that he made a mistake. It is even worse than 

that. If he gets it right and finds that you are a 

sovereign --

MR. SIMON: Let me try to answer it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you can go back to State 

court. I mean, that's even worse. He gets it right.

questions. The problem is whether he gets it right or 

wrong, we spend two years in a court of appeals. But 

Your Honor, you're assuming there's an immunity issue in 

this case. With due respect, my adversaries are arguing 

someone else's case. There is no immunity claim in this 

case by Powerex. There is one petition, one petitioner.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They were saying they were 

an organ of --

MR. SIMON: They were saying they were an 

organ.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, and therefore they 

are immune unless -- unless they fall within an 

exception. And it may be they do.

 Is that not right?

 MR. SIMON: No. They conceded that they 

fell within the exception.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying, that's 

how the statute works.

 MR. SIMON: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I take it if you win 

this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person 

who has total immunity.

 MR. SIMON: No.

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.

 MR. SIMON: Would have removed the case the 

same way --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah.

 MR. SIMON: And it would have presented two 

arguments to the district court. It would have argued 

number one, we are a foreign sovereign; maybe it wins, 

maybe it loses. And number two. We are immune.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. SIMON: There is a solid line of cases 

that suggests the decision on immunity -- first of all 

let me say, I think it is somewhat far-fetched that a 

party that would actually be immune, say the King of 

Saudi Arabia, would end up being in this third lowest 

category of foreign -- purported foreign sovereigns and 

end up in the position Powerex is in.

 But if it did, in other words we have three 

categories. We have immunes, we have non-immunes who 

got Federal court, and then we have would-be foreign 

sovereigns like Powerex, who end up in State court. And 

I'm suggesting for a party to fall from the first 

category to the third in front of an Article III

lower courts suggest that that is a collateral order. 

The immunity issue, not the remand issue. We actually 

now have a Waco type case.

you're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on

but not the remand is reviewable on appeal --

want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.

MR. SIMON: The difference is that the 

immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a 

line of court of appeal cases -- a majority, not a 

unanimous majority, never blessed by this Court -- which 

suggests that immunity is so important, don't need a 

lawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you 

don't spend a dollar, you walk away -- so important that 

you are entitled to an immediate --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, and you agree with 

that?

 MR. SIMON: And I agree with that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then why is it in 

your opinion that the immunity thing is so important 

that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ 

thing is not so important since all, what turns on that 

is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.

 MR. SIMON: Well, I want to come back 

non-jury trial and answer Justice Ginsburg's question 

because I don't think she got the right answer. But the 

reason it's more important is this is, as Justice Scalia 

said, like a diversity decision, this is a litigation 

who sells power in the Pacific Northwest and admits that 

it competes with Enron, Duke, and Reliance, and it is 

disputing whether it belongs in a State court in San 

Diego or the Federal court across the street in San

Diego, leaving aside the jury issue. And that is 

precisely the kind of dispute that Congress suggested in 

1447(d) and its predecessors, which have been on the 

books for more than 100 years, ought to be done once. 

What do they say, one and done? Is that what they say 

in the district court?

 JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying this all turns 

on our assessment of the strength of the interest in 

remaining in Federal court? Is that what it boils down 

to?

 MR. SIMON: No, it turns on the strength of 

getting an immediate decision on the immunity question. 

The immunity question I think is a question of an 

entirely different nature than the question of forum. 

In the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The immunity question, 

the immunity question is the same as State or Federal 

court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign 

sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State 

court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court 

jurisdiction because Congress said so.

 But with respect to the commercial 

enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a 

Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial. 

That doesn't apply to State courts.

MR. SIMON: That's correct. But Congress 

said, we're going to give you a Federal forum and a 

bench tribal if you convince us that you are an agency 

or instrumentality of a foreign State. This, this 

corporation Powerex failed to make that convincing 

showing. Having failed to make that convincing slowing, 

again, they are debating in the appellate courts and 

tying litigants up for two, five years over whether this 

case should be litigated in State court or in Federal 

court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a sovereign 

party who said: I'm out of this; I have suit immunity. 

And that was the B.C. --

MR. SIMON: B.C. Hydro.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to B.C. 

Hydro? Because as I understand the district court sent 

that party back, too.

 MR. SIMON: The district court found that 

they were immune, properly followed the law, but 

determined because it believed it had no subject matter 

jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point, 

that it should just walk away from the case and remand 

it, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the 

parallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power 

Administration. The Ninth Circuit when it erroneously

took the appeal on the remand also clarified or

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but it couldn't --

if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should 

have touched this case. So what happens to the three 

parties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are 

entitled to suit immunity?

 MR. SIMON: Well, what's happened so far is 

nothing, which might tell us that in the practical world 

when a Federal district judge says that B.C. Hydro is 

immune and then remands a multi-plaintiff, 

multi-defendant, multi-cross defendant-cross defendant 

case to San Diego Superior Court, it is exceedingly that 

the San Diego Superior Court will reconsider the 

immunity. But if it did --

JUSTICE ALITO: But could it?

 MR. SIMON: I suppose it could, but if it 

did that matter is subject to appeal and subject to 

ultimate certiorari review in this Court. So I think 

we're talking about a frolic.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought the argument you 

were making a few minutes ago, if I understood it 

correctly, was that B.C. Hydro would not have been 

barred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the 

remand; is that correct or not.

MR. SIMON: I think B.C. Hydro could have 

taken a collateral order, a collateral order appeal.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Whether it's a collateral 

order or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291. 

It doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447.

 MR. SIMON: B.C. Hydro could have attempted 

to appeal the immunity decision under a series of 

decisions which suggest that immunity is so important 

that it ought to be decided right then.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The difference between that 

immunity and Powerex's status is what? It's simply the 

fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing 

immediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of 

the determination of the remand of a party that claims 

to be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an 

organ?

 MR. SIMON: Among several other things. 

There is a stronger interest in that, and we are not 

debating about the forum. Again, we have the Kircher 

case from last term saying State courts are perfectly 

capable of resolving this issue. That is a quotation 

actually from the Missouri Pacific case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we think that Powerex, 

that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain 

in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer 

to get around 1447(d)?

 MR. SIMON: I think Justice Scalia was 

correct to say there is just as strong an interest in a 

diversity case in having a New York corporation trying 

to escape --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm having, I'm having 

the same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer. 

Can you say in just a few sentences the difference 

between the case where there is sovereign immunity, 

China, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's 

organ immunity?

 MR. SIMON: Yes, if I could --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're telling us that one 

is more important than the other, but there's no textual 

basis in the statute for us to make that distinction.

 MR. SIMON: I think there are two 

differences, so if I could. One is textual and one is 

important. Let me start with the textual difference. 

The textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to 

remands, and so to the extent the district court 

remanded the matter to State court the remand is 

untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d). 

And if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body, 

lobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department

doesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get 

that fixed quite easily.

 There are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d) 

for class actions, for Native Americans, for civil 

rights cases, and they can get their own exceptions. So 

to the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is 

untouchable. That is my textual answer. It's a remand, 

i.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is 

untouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or 

indispensable party is reviewable. So what I would say 

is, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of 

immunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral 

order; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito.

 I meant that line of cases about going 

straight up even though the case was continuing. While 

the case continues in State court, where it belongs 

under 1447(d), it would appear under this line of 

collateral order cases that the denial of immunity 

per se could go up on its own --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking why is denial 

of immunity for sovereign status different from denial 

of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial, 

etcetera?

 MR. SIMON: Possibly, possibly this could 

would decide that question the other way. But --

JUSTICE BREYER: We have this very old judge 

like me. China is there. And he says: This isn't 

China; Formosa is China. So he says remand. So there 

we are, China is now in the Western District State Court 

for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money. 

Now, you said, I thought, before that where that 

happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they 

could, China, appeal in the Federal system. I thought 

you said that.

 MR. SIMON: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. SIMON: But not the remand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. SIMON: But not the remand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All they want is a 

definitive appeal that this is really China, all right. 

Now, can they do that, yes or no? You said yes.

 So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was, 

if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly 

the same way on the question of whether they're an 

organ. What's the difference?

 MR. SIMON: The first difference is what I 

said in response to Your Honor's question was I think 

they could do that under some cases from the courts of 

appeal. I know they can't appeal the remand because we

have an act of Congress which --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't care. I don't call 

this an appeal of a remand. What this is, it is an 

Appeal of the determination precedent to remand that 

Powerex is not an organ.

 MR. SIMON: Well, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: That would make them just 

as happy, I believe.

 MR. SIMON: Justice Breyer, think about a 

multi-party case and maybe my answer will be clearer to 

you. In a multi-party case my position is the remand 

stands, the case goes back to Missouri or Mississippi or 

wherever your hypothetical was, but at the same time, I 

do believe that the potentially immune party, which is 

not here in this courtroom today, the potentially immune 

party, could seek to review of what is a dispositive 

ruling.

 Remember, that's a dispositive ruling. They 

win the case. That's very different than a venue 

ruling.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of how they 

would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the 

immunity question, our series of questions is why do we 

draw or why should we draw a distinction between 

immunity and federal bench trial? And your answer is, I

take it, immunity is dispositive; Federal bench tribal 

is not?

 MR. SIMON: Immunity is dispositive and 

Federal bench trial is not -- and is no different from 

the day to day decisions district courts make all the 

time about the choice between a State court and a 

Federal court in the area of remands and removals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Immunity, suit immunity, 

is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not 

in Federal court; you can't be sued, period. But now it 

is admitted that you can be sued. That's not in dispute 

in this case, right?

 MR. SIMON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the only question is 

where.

 MR. SIMON: And that is my core --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is if --

MR. SIMON: Excuse me. That is my core 

point, that Congress told us when the only question is 

where, we stop after one level and we move on to the 

merits.

JUSTICE STEVENS: I just want to be sure 

your position. Assume that there is a remand that was 

improper and cannot be appealed under your theory and 

the Powerex argues all along, I was entitled to a 

Federal forum and a non-jury trial. And the State court 

says no all the way up. Can they file a petition for 

certiorari saying, we had a Federal right that was 

denied us, not the remand but our entitlement to a bench 

trial? Can they petition for certiorari at the end of 

the State proceeding in your view.

 MR. SIMON: Other than the jury question, I 

think the answer would be no because of 1447(d), because 

I think 1447(e) would suggest that that's an appeal of a 

remand. But again, you're asking questions that I 

believe have not been addressed by this Court or even 

lower courts.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering what 

your position is.

 MR. SIMON: A clever enough lawyer I suppose 

could argue that at that point that we're no longer 

challenging the remand, the remand has happened and been 

completed and the trial has taken place; we're now 

simply challenging the results. And maybe that clever 

lawyer would win the day.

-- I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is, 

State court, cannot try me at all. The feds can do what 

they want about remand and it gets back here. But 

because I'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me 

at all. Isn't that the argument?

 MR. SIMON: Oh, I think in State court a 

clever litigant could argue all these points over again, 

because 1447(e) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But his clever opponent 

would say --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that what 1447(d) means 

is that you can be tried in State courts. That's 

precisely what it says.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And ultimately when the two 

clever parties got to the State supreme court, they 

would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if 

we granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it.

 MR. SIMON: This Court would ultimately 

decide it and they would ultimately decide questions 

such as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the 

bench trial issue has been preserved.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not say, depending on 

the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, 

why not just say Congress intended that you do get an

underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at 

stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but 

rather significant and important rights attach in the 

Federal court that do not attach in the State court. 

And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when 

they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by 

doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and 

the necessity to hire clever lawyers.

 MR. SIMON: Well, Congress has said --

Congress has said the contrary. And there are often 

important differences between State and Federal courts. 

Justice Breyer, I think you have some experience in 

California. We have 9 to 3 jury verdicts. You will 

have a litigant here next year saying that the 

difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous 

jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really 

important.

 Now, I would just briefly like to go back to 

Justice Ginsburg's question about a jury because I don't 

think she got the full answer. Let me give it to you, 

Justice Ginsburg. The jury issue is virtually -- I 

would say not virtually. The jury issue is out of this 

case based on my adversary's reply brief. I will tell 

why you. We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we 

were upset about the whole notion of this case being

removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in -- we 

never sued Powerex -- losing our right to a jury trial 

on this important case.

 Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote 

4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that 

our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that 

under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct 

they do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our 

right to jury trial would survive even though he would 

have a right to a bench trial under his theory.

 Well, there is no right to a jury trial on 

the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client. The 

cross claim in the California court, which got this 

whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for 

equitable indemnification and declaratory relief, 

equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury 

trial. So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury 

trial. We are arguing someone else's case. Some day a 

litigant will appear in this Court and present the issue 

of jury trial --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they raise that there 

is still the question of Federal forum over State forum.

 MR. SIMON: There is, and that's the issue 

that I think Congress has clearly and definitively said, 

the State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good

juries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to 

this Court. In Kircher, the Court's opinion says, "the 

State courts are perfectly competent to resolve these 

issues."

 The cost of this case being frozen for 3 or 

4 years while we debated these issues -- and these 

issues are very difficult. I would say, we don't only 

have a backup position, we have a backup backup 

position. Because we think, number one, the court 

should be taken at its word. We think, number two, the 

court had no subject matter jurisdiction. Removing 

jurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction. If you 

look at the book, Chapter 89, Section 1441, et cetera, 

it's titled Removal of Cases From State Courts. You 

won't find the word "subject matter jurisdiction" in 

there anywhere.

 A removal petition removes a case from the 

State court to the Federal court, where if it's a 

foreign sovereign immunities case, the Federal court 

decides if it has subject matter jurisdiction. That's 

what 1330 says in haec verba. It's what this Court's 

decision in Verlinden versus Central Bank of Nigeria 

says in haec verba. Verlinden says every court that 

gets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine 

at the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction

by determining if the foreign sovereign is immune.

 Which means that Judge Whaley was correct 

when he decided that by concluding he had an immune 

party in front of him, he had no jurisdiction. And it 

was equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined 

that United States versus Myers says the same thing, so 

that he had no subject matter jurisdiction. And in 

addition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine.

 This notion of "removal jurisdiction" quote 

unquote, it's a term we all use. The Court used it in 

Kircher. I use it. Other people use it. But if you 

start getting serious about your words, it's meaningless 

in this context. We have subject matter jurisdiction 

and it is conferred in the area of 1330, 1331, 1332. It 

is not conferred in 1441, 1442, or 1443. It's simply 

not there.

 So my backup argument is, he was right on 

every point. And my backup argument beyond that is 

again, please, reread Carnegie Mellon. Put it next to 

Thermtron and look at what the lower courts have done. 

They have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in 

cases that have no business being in the courts of 

appeals. They don't have immunity issues. They don't 

have foreign sovereign issues. They don't have 

anything.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the reason why they 

may have done that is because they've seen case after 

case where absolute power corrupts absolutely. And 

because district judges know that remand orders are not 

reviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for 

reasons that are clearly improper. That may be the 

reason.

 Now on your first argument, you say that 

what the district judge says is dispositive. You mean 

if the district judge says I lack subject matter 

jurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not --

MR. SIMON: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's not --

MR. SIMON: No, Your Honor. I overstated. 

Let me say it more clearly. Kircher, decided last term, 

makes clear the line between what can and can't be done. 

It discusses precisely this point and it refers to the 

Ryan versus Contra case and it refers to the Principi 

case. And it says that when the court is patently wrong 

about whether the issue it is discussing is subject 

matter jurisdiction, then this Court may enter into --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it's a good 

thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you 

fall back very quickly. I would have thought your 

answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if

it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or 

otherwise. And if it's remanded for a silly reason, 

that will be corrected on review of the State supreme 

court by this Court.

 MR. SIMON: That would be my first answer, 

and the Chief Justice said it much better than mine, 

than I have. But I think, Your Honor, looking at 

Kircher, to be fair, looking at Kircher, I believe that 

is the position Justice Scalia took, it is concurring 

opinion. And I didn't want to suggest that 

Justice Scalia's concurring opinion was the opinion of 

the Court. The opinion of the Court wrestles with what 

I thought was Justice Alito's question. What do you do 

if the trial judge says he has no subject matter 

jurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety 

jurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue 

is? It's really failure to state a claim. It's really 

something else. And we of course have the Steele case 

which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often 

get confused about them. And the Court answered the 

question by saying, only when the trial court is 

patently wrong, patently wrong not about the 

jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a 

jurisdictional question, only when the court is patently 

wrong do we second guess the court.

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That certainly 

changes the argument. So the notice of appeal that's 

filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court 

wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals 

has to consider that before determining whether it has 

jurisdiction to review the remand order.

 MR. SIMON: If the court wants to adopt 

Justice Scalia's view in the prior case, in the Kircher 

case, my clients would be pleased with the results --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I recommend that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SIMON: But I think, Justice Roberts --

I think, Mr. Chief Justice -- I apologize. Because my 

time is running short, I would say the key point in this 

case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in 

the Ninth Circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing 

and argument, and it was denied. That was the point at 

which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase "this is 

patently wrong," would likely in most circuits before 

most panels have lost. And this matter would have gone 

back to the State court 2-1/2 years before it got 

affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and five years before 

today.

 Unless the Court has any further questions,

 Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, a 

non-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity. This 

Court's cases have recognized that. In footnote 6 of 

the Government's brief, the Government cites the Lehman 

case which makes this point clear and argues that the 

point should be applicable to sovereigns in the context 

in which we are faced here.

 The question of whether a foreign entity, 

and it's more complicated often in the real world, 

Justice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply 

with questions but with the kinds of entities that 

foreign governments create to advance public purposes. 

The intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of 

entities tested in State court to determine whether or 

not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural 

protections of the FSIA. And it is not simply a 

question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose 

to recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of

instrumentalities that were created by those governments 

to advance public purposes, to serve as separate 

political entities, and who would be performing the 

kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Congress said, those 

entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: 

They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial. 

That's all that's at stake.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's not all that's at 

stake, Justice Ginsburg. There are also rights with 

respect to foreign states to be free of punitive 

damages. There are rights to have certain property of 

the sovereign that would be subject to different 

attachment rules.

 The FSIA has a whole string of procedural 

protections that are afforded to foreign states and 

their instrumentalities. And this case ultimately is 

about the fact that Powerex is being subjected to 

multiple suits in State court, but as a result of the 

Ninth Circuit's holding in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are those -- have they 

been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or 

have they always been brought in by defendants?

 MR. FREDERICK: They have been directly sued

Official - Subject to Final Review 

by the People of the State of California whom my brother 

here represents. They have been sued by the California 

Attorney General. They have been sued by the California 

Department of Water Resources. And under the Ninth 

Circuit's precedent in this case which I urge you to 

overturn, Powerex has been remanded to State court, has 

not been permitted to appeal the remand order, and is 

stuck in State court in these cases without any 

opportunity to test what is a clearly erroneous, and 

what my brother doesn't make any attempt to defend, the 

merits of the decision, that Powerex has performed 

public functions, it's serving at the direction of the 

Government of British Columbia, and is performing these 

functions to advance clearly public purposes.

 And yet, we are now in this Kafkaesque work 

world between State and Federal court where if we try to 

litigate all the way up through State court, it is not 

entirely clear whether we will ever have our organ --

our status as a foreign organ ever vindicated. Thank 

you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
