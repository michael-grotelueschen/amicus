(10:14 a.m.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 12-236, Sebelius v. Cloer. 
Mr. Horwich. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 
please the Court: 

The Vaccine Act does not provide for an 
award of attorneys' fees on a petition that is denied as 
untimely. That's the best reading of the Act's text, it 
fits best with the structure and purposes of the Act, 
and it's the result that's consistent with the canons of 
construction that would apply to an award of attorneys' 
fees out of the Federal Treasury. 

Now, the -- the textual question here in 
some sense begins with the statute of limitations, which 
is in Section 16 of the Act, and which provides that no 
petition may be filed outside the applicable time 
period. 

Now, that provision, like most limitations 
provisions, doesn't itself actually say what the 
consequences of the failure to comply with the provision 
are. And in some sense, just as in the -- the civil

context, it's not as if the Special Master, upon finding 
the limitations provision hasn't been complied with, can 
go back in time and prevent the petition from being 
filed, just as a civil court can't prevent an action 
from being commenced, or a suit from being brought, or 
whatever the limitations provision proscribes. 

So the question really is going forward, 
what -- what consequences should there be once the 
adjudicator decides -- once he or the Special Master 
decides -- that the limitations period has not been 
complied with. And textually speaking, it's the 
correspondence between the limitations provision, which 
says that no petition may be filed, and the attorneys' 
fee provision, which depends on the existence of a 
petition filed, that signals that Congress intended the 
consequences of untimeliness to be visited through the 
application of the attorneys' fees provision --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Horwich --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are other -- there 

are other provisions that refer to a petition filed. 
For example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing 
a notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to 
any petition filed. And so in those sections at least, 
petition filed would include petition filed after the 
running of the statute of limitations.

 MR. HORWICH: Well, those provisions 

would -- those provisions by their terms apply at points 
in the proceedings where we would entirely 
conventionally accept the -- the claimant's 
representation that the petition has been filed in 
accordance with the time limitation. That's generally 
true, certainly in the civil context, that we accept the 
plaintiff's allegation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But don't you -- don't 
you put in the Federal Register and report to Congress 
petitions that had been filed out of time? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, with respect to -- with 
respect to reporting to -- to Congress, that's actually 
an obligation from the Court of Federal Claims, so I 
can't necessarily speak on their behalf of what they --
what they've produced. From what I've seen, it's a 
statistical report. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, think about the 
Federal Register. 

MR. HORWICH: The Federal -- with respect to 
the Federal Register provision, I should first say that 
it has very recently come to my office's attention that 
the Department of Health and Human Services has not been 
complying with that provision for the last few years, 
and they are taking steps to bring themselves in --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they don't file 

anything in the Federal Register? 
MR. HORWICH: Well, it -- they -- they have 

historically, and let me -- up till about 2009 -- and 
again, to be clear, they're taking steps to rectify that 
situation. But with respect to the period up to 2009, 
what they would do -- and this is understandable given 
the -- the provision that says it's supposed to be 
published within -- and I believe it's 30 days, that 
they -- the petitions that are received or that were 
received at the Department get logged into a computer 
database, and then a report gets printed out, and they 
would cross-check them for accuracy against the petition 
title and forward them to the Office of the Federal 
Register. 

It's not -- it doesn't -- it wouldn't make 
sense in a provision that's supposed to be applied 
essentially upon the filing of the petition, to go into 
an examination of the timeliness of that -- of that 
petition. 

And so we think that provision, just as you 
would -- just as you would describe in a civil context, 
you would certainly say that an action that ultimately 
proves to be held untimely was nonetheless commenced 
if -- for example, if you imagine a statute of

limitations that says no action may be commenced, you 
wouldn't say the action hadn't been commenced at the 
time it was pending. And -- and that's not the argument 
we're relying on here. 

What -- rather, what we're relying on is the 
fact that when you get to the end of the case, which is 
where the attorneys' fee provision is evidently supposed 
to apply because --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, could you say a 
little bit more about the reporting to Congress 
provision because that presumably does not happen at the 
very beginning, but happens more at the end or in the 
middle. So do -- does the Department subtract the 
number of untimely petitions from the number that it 
reports? 

MR. HORWICH: I believe the -- the reporting 
provision is a -- there's a report that the Special 
Master is to make to the Court of Federal Claims, and 
there's a report that the Court of Federal Claims is to 
deliver and -- and those, from what I have seen --
again, the Executive Branch doesn't prepare those 
because it's the Special Masters and the court that do, 
but the reports that I have seen, my understanding is 
that the report of the Special Master is delivered 
orally to the judges, and so I don't actually know what

the contents of that are. And the report that -- and 
the report that the Court of Federal Claims sends to 
Congress is a statistical report of all -- actually, of 
all actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims, that it 
sends a kind of an omnibus report in satisfaction of --

JUSTICE KAGAN: All actions filed, using 
"filed" in the normal sense. 

MR. HORWICH: No, no. I actually mean all 
actions filed meaning Vaccine Act actions and otherwise. 
So it -- it actually doesn't even differentiate the 
Vaccine Act --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But is -- is the upshot of 
your argument then that filing means different things 
under different provisions of the Act? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think it means --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that's so, it tends 

to weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in 
the statute -- on the word "filing" in the statute of 
limitations section. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think it 
means -- I don't think it means different things in the 
Act so much as it means it -- it is to be applied with 
the understand -- it is to be applied as the -- as a 
fair stand at the time the provision is applied. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I meant -- I meant

that just to supplement Justice Kagan's question. I 
didn't mean to cut it off. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, let me -- let me focus 
for a moment then on the attorneys' fee provision, 
though, in terms of why -- why that is particularly good 
reason to think that petitions -- a petition filed is to 
be considered, in terms of what ought to have been done. 
And that's because the -- the attorneys' fee provision 
speaks as of -- it speaks of awards of fees at the time 
of judgment. And so that time, we know that any 
limitations issue should have been resolved by that 
point in the case. 

And therefore, it is -- it is an entirely 
natural -- it's entirely natural to expect that the 
limitations provision might therefore have some 
consequences at that stage. 

In some ways, you can think of it as an 
application of the old maxim that equity regards as done 
what ought to have been done. 

So we're saying to the Special Master, well, 
if you've gotten to the point at the end of the case 
where there's a judgment, and you've determined that 
this petition was forbidden from being filed, in the 
sense that the limitations provision forbids it, then 
you should visit the consequences there.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That sounds like a 

jurisdictional argument to me. But I understand the 
government to be conceding that this statute of 
limitations is not jurisdictional. It's just a claim 
processing move. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, if it sounds like a 
jurisdictional argument, then I suppose the answer would 
be for this Court to say that it's jurisdictional, and 
of course, if that's true, then our position -- our 
position would prevail. 

We think on balance, given this Court's 
precedence most recently in the -- the Auburn Regional 
Medical Center case, that these -- that this Court did 
not interpret Congress's time limit provisions to be 
endowed with jurisdictional significance. It doesn't 
mean that it doesn't have any significance. It has the 
significance of an ordinary affirmative defense, just as 
it has the significance of the -- the timeliness 
provision here just has the significance of an ordinary 
affirmative defense, just as --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just want to make 
sure I heard you right. You said if it sounds 
jurisdictional, we should say it is, and you win. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, what I was saying --
what I was saying in response to Justice Sotomayor's

question is that if -- if it seems that that argument 
compels you to believe that it's jurisdictional, then 
the Court should reach the conclusion that it's 
jurisdictional rather than --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your conclusion 
is that it is not jurisdictional. 

MR. HORWICH: We think -- we think that it 
is not -- we think that it is not, even if the text of 
it makes it sound like it could have jurisdictional 
significance, we think on balance, this Court's 
precedents teach that time -- that time limits are 
typically claim processing rules, and we don't think 
that the text overcomes that view. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume I accept --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So using Federal rules as 

your model, and Federal rules list statute of 
limitations as an affirmative defense. Ordinarily, 
that's what it is. But is it an affirmative -- well, 
certainly it's an affirmative defense to any award of 
compensation under the Vaccine Act. 

But what makes it an affirmative defense to 
the award of fees? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, it seems to -- there is 
not anything in the compensation provision that says 
that it's an affirmative defense any more than -- in any

way that's more explicit than what we're relying on to 
say that it's an affirmative defense to attorneys' fees. 
It's not as if Congress said there -- in another section 
there shall be no award of future medical expenses when 
the statute of limitations is not complied with, and it 
left that out of the attorneys' fees. 

That's not how the statute is structured. 
So we're in a situation where I think we ordinarily are 
with statutes of limitation, in trying to decide what 
the consequences of noncompliance are --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, one of -- one of 
your -- your argument you were making is that there --
since the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of 
the case, it should not be construed to apply to the --
the failure to meet the filing deadline. 

Is -- is that true? I mean, the statute 
says if the judgment does not award compensation, on a 
petition filed under Section 300aa-11 -- if the judgment 
does -- is there no judgment when a -- when a case is 
dismissed for failure to meet the statute requirement? 

MR. HORWICH: It -- it seems to us that the 
appropriate disposition of a case that is held to be 
untimely is that there is a judgment denying 
compensation. And the reasons for that have to do with 
something that's not really briefed, but the operation

of the appellate provisions of the Act --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, so --
MR. HORWICH: -- become confusing if you 

treat a dismissal as something different. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Other than the judgment. 

Okay. So then -- then your argument that -- that this 
fee provision looks to the end of the case simply 
doesn't fly. It looks to the beginning as well, if 
indeed dismissal for failure to comply with the time 
limit is a judgment. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, we think -- we agree 
that it's a judgment, but it -- but it has to be a 
judgment, I'm looking here at page 26A of the appendix 
to the government's brief, refers to the judgment of the 
Court of Federal Claims on such a petition. And then 
such a petition refers back to a petition filed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --
MR. HORWICH: -- and so that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That's just 

repeating your -- your first argument. 
MR. HORWICH: Well -- I -- but I do think 

that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That petition means --

means a petition properly filed, but I don't see that 
the -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's

at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys' 
fees looks to the end of the case and not to the 
beginning. It looks to the judgment. And if it's a 
judgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply 
with the statute, it's still a judgment. 

MR. HORWICH: It's still a judgment, but it 
is -- it is not a judgment in connection with a petition 
that should be regarded as having been filed timely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your first argument. 
I understand. 

MR. HORWICH: -- that is our first argument. 
But let me say, it is also -- the -- the situation here 
is not one in which we think that it's incumbent on the 
government to -- to demonstrate clearly how Congress 
wanted to withhold attorneys' fees. The canons of 
construction here all caution the Court to be -- to be 
extremely reluctant to extend or -- or find that 
Congress is willing to pays attorneys' fees in -- in 
this context. And that's for -- and that's for several 
reasons. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Congress has 
waived sovereign immunity. It's absolutely clear that 
there's a waiver of sovereign immunity here. 

MR. HORWICH: It's clear that there's a 
waiver, but it's --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And once we find that, I 

don't think we nitpick the following language to 
unrealistically narrow it as much as possible. I mean, 
the initial question of whether Congress has agreed to 
be sued is, yes, we -- we assume it hasn't and -- and --
but -- but once it's clear that it has agreed to be 
sued, I think we just interpret the language reasonable. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I 
think this Court's decision certainly most recently in 
the Cooper case, from a term or two ago, says that --
that this Court considers not only the existence but the 
extent of the waiver of sovereign immunity to be 
controlled by -- by canons that -- that counsel against 
extending that -- extending that waiver. 

But that's not the only issue here. Because 
the consequences of -- of Respondent's rule are ones 
that -- that are entirely out of place both with fee 
proceedings in general and with this compensation 
program in particular. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, before you go 
to the consequences argument, just to keep on with the 
text a little bit, is this understanding that you have 
of what it means to be filed, does it have any 
consequences other than with respect to attorneys' fees, 
or is that the only thing that -- that depends on

viewing the word "filed" in this way? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think viewing the word 
"filed" in this way also explains mechanically why the 
limitations issue becomes an affirmative defense on the 
merits as well because Section 13 says compensation has 
to be awarded on a record, and the record is defined as 
the record on a petition filed. So similarly, if you 
get to the end of the case or you get to the point of 
limitations determination, the court says, well, there 
shouldn't -- there shouldn't be -- there should not have 
been a petition here, and so regarding -- regarding is 
done what should have been done, we'll say there is 
no -- there is no record available on that petition, so 
we should deny compensation. 

So I agree it's a little -- which I concede 
is -- is not how we ordinarily think about statutes of 
limitation, but it -- but it certainly is that -- it is 
exactly the same textual logic in the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I totally lost that 
answer. 

MR. HORWICH: Sure. I'm happy to step 
through it in the statute itself. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you 
go back and talk to me again about what you mean about 
not having a record?

 MR. HORWICH: Sure. So Section 13 of the 

Act, which starts on page 19A of the government's brief 
says that compensation is awarded "if the Special Master 
report finds on the record" various matters. 

But then it goes on, and this is on page 21A 
in Section 13(c), to define the record as the -- as the 
record established on a petition filed. And so in the 
same sense that if the Special Master determines that 
the limitations provision says, well, there shouldn't 
have been a petition filed, the consequence is there is 
not a basis for attorneys' fees. They're similarly in 
this definitional provision not a basis for the record 
on which compensation is to be awarded on the merits. 
And that produces the result that we would expect, which 
is that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm totally confused. 
Are you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in 
that case or that the record supports the conclusion 
that it was untimely? Or neither? 

MR. HORWICH: What I'm -- what I'm 
suggesting is -- what I'm suggesting is that when the 
limitation -- when it's determined that the limitations 
provision applies and should have prevented the filing 
of the petition, and the Special Master has to decide, 
well, what are the consequences of that. Because,

again, the Special Master can't go back and actually 
prevent the whole thing from having happened, but the 
Special Master can say, well, if this direct -- if this 
directed that there shouldn't have been a petition 
filed, then one of the consequences is there's no --
there's no record on which we should be able to decide 
compensation. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, as to the 
consequences, let me give you these two cases. The 
first is the case in which the petition is timely filed 
and -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail 
because the claimant is unable to prove that the injury 
was caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable 
basis for the argument and the argument was made in good 
faith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys' 
fees. 

The second is a case in which there is a 
question about when the statute of limitations begins to 
run. And one of the points at which it can begin to run 
is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of 
an injury, which seems like a question about which there 
could be a factual dispute. And in that situation as 
well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of 
limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis 
for thinking that the petition was submitted within the

period after the -- the onset of this significant 

aggravation. 

Why would Congress want to draw a line 

between -- a distinction between those two situations 

for the purpose of attorneys' fees? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, there's several reasons. 

The first -- the first one is that in your -- in your 

first example where there's been a determination on the 

merits, the Special Master is in a perfect situation to 

decide whether there was a reasonable basis on the 

merits. And this is how -- this is how the program has 

worked since its existence because to be clear, until 

the decision below, there was no practice of awarding 

attorneys' fees on untimely petitions in the -- in the 

program. 

And so what you would get would be 

situations like your first example, Justice Alito, where 

the Special Master would issue a -- a written decision 

on entitlement and these are -- these are 10, 15, 20, 

25 pages long in my experience, dealing in considerable 

detail with the medical evidence, the scientific 

evidence, the expert testimony, the review of 

literature, the different theories of causation, and 

getting to the end, and obviously, if the decision is that 

compensation is to be awarded, then attorneys' fees

follow as a matter of right, but if compensation is 
denied, the Special Master can and typically does add, 
literally as an afterthought, that -- but having been 
through all of this and having discussed all of this, I 
think there was a reasonable basis for what was being 
argued here. 

Now, in your second example where the 
Special Master has only determined this essentially 
diagnostic question of when was the first symptom of 
this particular claimant's particular injury, the 
Special Master hasn't looked at any materials about 
whether the vaccine can cause that injury. So let me 
give as a -- as a paradigm example maybe the -- what we 
give in our brief as the -- the Smith case, which had to 
do with the claim of whether certain childhood vaccines 
caused the claimant's Type 1 diabetes. 

And the Special Master's decision focuses on 
the question of whether the first symptom of the 
diabetes was a blood glucose reading that sent the 
claimant to the hospital, and then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Could you --
could you -- there seems to be a confusion in this 
consequence conversation. You seem to be assuming that 
the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do 
with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this

injury? I would have assumed that the award of 
attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was 
brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable 
basis to believe that the petition was timely? And on 
that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the 
timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts 
that made the Petitioner believe it was timely. 

And so I'm a little bit confused as to what 
additional factfinding the Court has to do. It has to 
be told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable 
basis has to be in fact and law. The law says first 
symptom. She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought 
the latter was the starting point of the statute, not 
the former. What more does the Special Master need to 
know to adjudicate whether that's in good faith, that 
belief is in good faith? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, the question under the 
attorneys' fee provision, and this is on 26(a) of the 
government's brief, is a determination that the petition 
was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable 
basis for the claim for which the petition was brought. 
The question isn't was there a reasonable basis to 
believe it was timely, the question is -- and -- and I 
think my friend agrees with me on this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I understand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But now, look, still, the 

worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a 
textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your 
position with the -- with the first words in 3300aa-11, 
which is talking about a petition starts this whole 
proceeding and you want to interpret that word 
"petition" meaning a timely petition. You mean an 
untimely petition doesn't start the proceeding? I mean, 
that's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to 
your -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you 
is this proceeding, okay? That's what's worrying you, I 
think, the shadow trial. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes, it is. 
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, on that, just what 

Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem 
when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with 
a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise 
forget it. Okay? 

So you look at the complaint. You see a 
complaint there. He had a good reason for thinking it's 
timely. It looks, on the face of the complaint, as if 
his client has a good claim, a plausible one. Now, if 
the government wants to say, we want to present some 
evidence, let them do it. And if they don't, the worst 
that happens is this person who thought she had a good

claim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get 
some attorneys' fees paid. 

Why is that -- why is that so terrible? Why 
is that putting such a burden on the government that 
they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get 
these words in the statute, too? 

MR. HORWICH: What -- what we're worried 
about here is -- is not the fact that some fees may be 
paid. What -- what we're worried about here, as you 
said, are the shadow trials, and -- and to an extent 
also the question of whether additional cases would be 
attractive to the program. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's in your control, 
the shadow trials. 

MR. HORWICH: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to have a 

shadow trial if you don't want one. 
MR. HORWICH: Well, but -- but -- but, Your 

Honor, I think where we're coming -- where we're coming 
at this from is -- is saying what did Congress envision 
here. And as this Court said in Hensley and in Pierce, 
Congress doesn't want attorneys' fees to be a second 
major litigation. So it seems exceedingly odd to think 
it would have set up a scheme in which the case would 
end on the merits and yet, the question on which

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The shadow trial brings up 

the answer that you were giving to the second part of 
Justice Alito's question, which you never got to finish. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you were saying -- you 

were giving the example, suppose this were a question of 
timeliness. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when did the fact of 

the vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become 
manifest, and you were -- and you said that this should 
not be tried because -- and this is finishing off 
Justice --

MR. HORWICH: Right. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Justice Alito's 

dichotomy. 
MR. HORWICH: Yes. Maybe if I finish giving 

the example I was giving in response to the -- the 
second part of Justice Alito's dichotomy in that Smith 
case. So the timeliness question the Special Master 
resolved was, okay, was it the blood glucose reading

that was within the limitations period that was the 
first symptom or was it the excessive thirst and 
frequent urination that fell outside the limitations 
period. 

Now, the Special Master, having resolved 
that, which is something that I think perhaps even some 
of us in the room could recognize that one of those was 
the symptom -- was likely the first symptom or not, the 
Special Master then has to decide, was there a 
reasonable basis for the claim that childhood vaccines 
cause Type 1 diabetes? And that's simply not something 
that that timeliness determination is going to be any 
good for the Special Master in deciding. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a lot of 
information just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what 
has to be put in the petition. And there's --
couldn't -- couldn't a Special Master make the 
determination based on that? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think part of the 
problem is that we would be asking the Special Master to 
spend the Special Master's time reviewing that material, 
assuming that it's even in the petition, which is not 
always the case. We'd be asking the Special Master to 
spend -- spend her time evaluating that material in a 
proceeding that can't result in compensation to any

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FISHMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
MR. FISHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
My friend started with Section 16. I'd like 

to start very briefly with our reading of the fee 
provision itself. Section 15(e)(1), which says, "Any 
petition filed under Section 11 is eligible for award of 
attorneys' fees, even if it's denied, provided that two 
conditions are satisfied. It has to be filed in good 
faith and with a reasonable basis." 

15(e) itself and by its terms says nothing 
about compliance with the statute of limitations. The 
filing provisions of Section 11, which are Section 
11(a)(1) similarly say nothing about compliance with the 
statute of limitations. Our position, therefore, is the 
most direct and sensible reading of 15(e)(1), is you can

get an award of fees on a petition that has been denied 
regardless of the reason why, and there is no textual 
basis for saying that that provision carves out an 
exception for one class of denied cases, those denied on 
limitations grounds. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if -- if you're 
preparing one of these filings, and you're all set to 
go, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh, 
it doesn't look like we're going to be on time. You 
should still go ahead and file because you might be able 
to apply for attorneys' fees. While if you file it the 
day that it's due and you find out the day after, oh, my 
gosh, we weren't on time, then there's no question that 
you could apply for attorneys' fees. 

MR. FISHMAN: Right. And if I understand 
that comment correctly, I think that's right, and -- and 
you see actually many Special Master decisions that 
ultimately deny a petition for failure typically to 
prove causation; and when they turn to the reasonable 
basis standard, they will say literally, your contact --
your client contacted you two days before the statute of 
limitations was going to run. 

You ran to the courthouse and filed. You 
had a basis, we believe, for filing your claim. Further 
investigation, examination of the medical -- medical

records made you question that judgment, and you 
abandoned the case. And -- and there can be fee awards 
in -- in that scenario. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My hypothetical was 
not that you had two days and you made it in time, but 
that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or 
you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on 
further research, oh, this isn't going to look like 
we're going to comply. We thought we had the time, but 
we don't. You should still go ahead and file, right, so 
that you might be able to get the fees? 

MR. FISHMAN: I think that would depend --
if -- if you're late, you're late. I think the -- the 
judgment your hypothetical would call on the attorney to 
make is, why did we miss it, and maybe does that provide 
grounds for equitable tolling or do we have a reasonable 
and good faith argument as to timeliness? 

If the lawyer says, I blew it, whether by a 
day or a month or a year, I think that attorney's going 
to have a very difficult time showing a good faith 
reasonable basis for filing a claim that I think in your 
hypothetical would be by the attorney's own account, 
clearly time barred without justification. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So are you saying that 
the good faith and the reasonableness go to two things:

One, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness. 

MR. FISHMAN: That is what we're saying. 
That's also what the Federal circuit said. I think the 
word "claim," as it's used in the statute, encompasses 
the entire case. Causation, evidence that you actually 
received a vaccine, the timeliness of your petition, 
damages, the -- everything you would need to 
establish --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you answer the 
argument about a shadow trial? 

MR. FISHMAN: There's a number of arguments 
about -- about that subject. And I think the starting 
point because it may have been lost a little bit in the 
briefs, is the government does not cite a single case 
where there has ever even been a hearing held on a fee 
petition, ever. And collectively are --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How were the records 
accumulated and when? 

MR. FISHMAN: I'm sorry? 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How were the records 

accumulated and when? 
MR. FISHMAN: They are accumulated -- the 

system that's established is one of front-loading. 
You -- 11(c) requires an enormous amount of medical 
documentation that is to be filed with the petition when

it's filed. If they are incomplete, you're required to 
submit an affidavit explaining what's missing and why. 

The very first thing substantively that 
happens with these things, Vaccine Act Rule 4(a) says 
within 30 days of filing a petition, the secretary must 
review the medical records, and if she thinks they are 
deficient, she has to immediately notify the Petitioner, 
and that is the very first thing that is hashed out in 
these cases, complete medical records. 

Section -- Vaccine Act Rule 2(c)(2) says if 
you're not going to rely solely on medical records in 
support of your petition -- medical records will often 
contain evidence of causation. If the records 
themselves don't and you're going to go outside the 
records, Vaccine Act Rule 2(c) -- 2(b)(2) is the actual 
rule, says you're going to rely on observations or 
testimony of every witness -- any witness, you have to 
submit a detailed affidavit of the proposed testimony 
that supports every allegation in the petition. 

So the answer is, a lot of it's there right 
at the front end, which is not to say that as these 
cases get litigated and the areas of contention get 
refined. Additional information can also be submitted, 
but it is front loaded. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is your bottom line

that the record is already there for the shadow 
determination? 

MR. FISHMAN: Sure. And that's the reason 
why we point out in our brief, routinely these cases are 
decided -- fee determinations are made based on the 
written materials without a hearing, without any 
additional evidence. And again there are no cases -- we 
are not aware of a single instance going to the 
inception of this program where there has ever been an 
evidentiary hearing. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And if there is a hearing, 
would the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get 
attorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing 
about attorneys' fees? 

MR. FISHMAN: Yes, the law is pretty clear 
that fees are available for time incurred on seeking 
fees. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think it would be 
within the discretion of the court or Special Master to 
look at a case and say, for whatever strange reason, 
this is a case where it's going to require some lengthy 
mini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad 
use of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant 
attorneys' fees here? In other words -- you know, this 
is a "may" provision; would it be a sufficient reason

that this is just going to take too long, it's too 
involved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this 
case? 

MR. FISHMAN: I think that might well be 
within a Special Master's discretion, if it really is 
going -- if a fee determination really will require the 
sort of parade of horribles that the government sees. 
It's not our case, but I think it could be possible and 
-- and within their discretion in a subsequent case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say the Special 
Master "may" award -- so it "may" award is 
discretionary. 

MR. FISHMAN: Correct. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a tough 

position, isn't it? I mean, if you have got a difficult 
and tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees; 
but if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees. 

MR. FISHMAN: I don't know -- the -- no 
court and the parties have not briefed or addressed in 
this case the -- the extent to which the "may" 
discretion can be exercised in a procedural way that 
Justice Kagan's hypothetical proposes. I'm just saying, 
I can't stand here and give you a hard and fast rule 
that says that will never be appropriate. 

Maybe if that case comes before a court and

a Special Master has done that, the argument will be 
it's an abuse of discretion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you 
were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when 
you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and 
good faith. 

MR. FISHMAN: Those are the requirements to 
be eligible for an award of fees, the statutory 
requirements for eligibility. But just because you meet 
good faith and reasonable basis does not necessarily 
mean you get fees for the -- for the reasons just 
discussed. It is discretionary. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is one reason 
that should affect the exercise of discretion is that 
you didn't comply with the statute of limitations? 

MR. FISHMAN: I think it might be. There --
the law is not -- this is not the issue in our case, so 
it's -- it's -- it's difficult to know the precise 
contours of the exercise of discretion in a case where 
nobody's contended that the discretion couldn't properly 
be exercised. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take -- let's 
take this case. What would you put in to show that you 
have been reasonable, in good faith and reasonable, one, 
as to the claim; and two, as to the attorneys' fees?

What -- what would the Special Master have to look at to 
make those determinations in this case? 

MR. FISHMAN: I will take the second part 
first, reasonableness of statute of limitations. The 
Federal Circuit has already ruled that we were 
reasonable to bring this case in terms of timeliness 
because of the case law as it existed at the time the 
petition was filed, the fact that we actually prevailed 
on the timeliness question before the three-judge panel. 
So the Federal -- I think on that question the Federal 
Circuit has resolved it. 

But if you want to go beyond that, I think 
you would look at our briefs and the laws that existed 
and the analysis of the various courts that have looked 
at this and said -- and say, that was a close call, you 
actually prevailed for a couple years on this question. 
That's reasonable, and that's good faith. 

As to the merits, it is all the material 
that accompanied our petition, which is principally 
medical records, also some medical studies linking the 
Hepatitis B vaccine to MS, and then a number of 
affidavits that were filed subsequently. And I think 
that is all you would need to look at, and -- that is 
the only thing in the record. Because the government 
has introduced no evidence in this case at any stage

contesting the merits of our underlying claim. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are arguing that 
they don't need to, and why should be -- why should they 
be put to the burden of doing that? 

MR. FISHMAN: The reason is you have to 
remember this is not ordinary civil litigation; it's a 
streamlined front-loaded process. So the way the 
Vaccine Act works is you file a petition with medical 
records, as I mentioned before. You have 30 days for 
the government to object to the completeness of the 
record. The very next thing that happens under the 
rules, and it's Rule 4(c), is the Secretary has 90 days 
to set out all of her objections to the case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the very fact that 
it's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very 
careful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to 
deter the filing of stale claims. And your -- your rule 
certainly undermines that. 

MR. FISHMAN: I think that you have to back 
up and -- and acknowledge, as a starting point, that 
there's no question that Congress intended this program 
to award fees on petitions that have been denied. And 
as we point out in our brief, petitions are routinely 
denied on procedural grounds where there has been no 
examination of the underlying merits, just as the

government contends is the case with statute of 
limitations. 

We disagree with that. We think actually to 
resolve a statute of limitations question, a Special 
Master is going to have a more complete understanding of 
the underlying merits of a case than in many other 
procedural settings. So we know that Congress has 
already said, sure, it's a streamlined process, but 
we're not going to pursue that objective at the expense 
of compensating attorneys who bring good faith claims, 
but lose. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the -- what's the 
relationship between your position and equitable 
tolling? I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that 
there was a fair amount of confusion about when the 
statute of limitations might run or that's your 
position. I would think a lot of the cases where the 
attorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will 
involve things like -- you know, I was delayed by 
Hurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we tried to file, 
and it got lost in the mail. 

Are those things that -- I mean, should that 
be considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or 
under -- under your idea that you don't have to file on 
time anyway?

 MR. FISHMAN: The -- the -- I think that the 

best answer to that question is to look at the Federal 
Circuit -- Circuit's en banc ruling in Cloer I. We 
actually argued -- we didn't argue snowstorm. What our 
argument was is there was an extraordinary circumstance 
that prevented us from filing within 36 months of the 
first symptom. And that circumstance was there was no 
scientific evidence of a link between the vaccine --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that, 
but I would assume the more typical case is when you 
miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether 
for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline. 
And I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not 
sufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is, 
therefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys' 
fees? 

MR. FISHMAN: I think that would be a 
case-by-case determination as to whether the particular 
facts relied upon supported good faith and a reasonable 
basis. I think in Your Honor's hypothetical, you would 
be -- a lawyer would be skating on thin ice there, too, 
because the Federal Circuit made clear in Cloer I that 
fraud and duress are the grounds for equitable tolling. 
So I think if you are going to bring a claim that you 
know is late and your only excuse is a snowstorm, you

have to look at Cloer I and think, I don't have a very 
strong or maybe any equitable tolling argument. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem to me, I did 
not have the opportunity to ask the government this 
question, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts 
the government's position that no petition may be filed, 
as being an absolute. Because we all know, I take it 
the government concedes, that there is equitable 
tolling. 

MR. FISHMAN: They -- well, they fought the 
issue. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or there can be equitable 
tolling in some cases. 

MR. FISHMAN: Sure. That's the law. They 
fought the issue below and lost, and in fairness, in 
their briefs to this Court, they say, we don't agree 
with the ruling just because we didn't seek this Court's 
review for reasons that are not identified. 

That is the law. That's correct. And it 
is, frankly, one in a long list of inconsistencies with 
their conception of what it means to file under the Act. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fishman, this may be a 
hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of 
why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they 
usually have to do with things like -- you know,

snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have 
to do with questions about the manifestation of 
symptoms? 

Or something else, if something else is --
just the range of cases out there, what are we talking 
about? Why are these cases untimely filed? 

MR. FISHMAN: My understanding from reading 
the case law is it's the latter. It's not snowstorms. 
It is here is a disease. I have a child that has been 
sick her whole life. When is the first symptom of this 
disease? She coughed 40 months ago. She had a -- some 
other symptom 42, and the experts often battle that out, 
and -- and oftentimes the Special Master say, sorry, it 
was the cough at 40 months that is the first symptom of 
the disease, not the symptom you've pointed to. 

JUSTICE ALITO: This may be a question that 
the government is in a better position to answer, but 
do -- do you have any sense of how often claims are 
rejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing 
with? 

I mean, you mentioned in a footnote that the 
fund out of which the -- the claims and the attorneys' 
fees are paid has a positive balance of $3.5 billion. 
Maybe the only government fund that has a positive 
balance, but --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is this going to bankrupt 

the -- the system? 
MR. FISHMAN: I -- I can't imagine how it 

would even really put much of a dent in that government 
obligation. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know how many cases 
we might be dealing with? 

MR. FISHMAN: I -- I don't. I know that 
there are not a huge number of published cases by 
Special -- unpublished decisions by Special Masters on 
the statute of limitations question. I tend to think 
that those numbers will actually go down moving forward, 
even under the rule we're proposing because of the law 
on when the statute of limitations runs is so much 
clearer now than it was in 2005 when we brought this 
case. 

The other point, of course, is you're always 
going to have to show good faith and a reasonable basis. 
So the government seems to suggest that the rule we're 
advocating and the one that the Federal Circuit adopted 
is going to result in a flood of frivolous litigation. 
I think that's just not supported because of the 
requirements you'd have to establish. 

I think there's also no reason to think that

that will be the case empirically, and I say that for 
this reason: The -- the program for 25 years has 
authorized the payment of fees to losers. It has paid 
out $2.4 billion in compensation to individuals injured 
by vaccines in that 25 years and just about $160 million 
in fees for winners and losers. It is just over 
6 percent.  And one would think that if this unusual 
system of paying losers really encouraged the filing of 
frivolous lawsuits so lawyers could be paid, you'd think 
the number would be substantially higher than 6 percent. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Who pays for the Special 
Masters? Is that paid out of the fund? 

MR. FISHMAN: It is. 
I do want to answer a couple of the 

questions that were presented during my friend's 
presentation. The -- I was not aware of the fact that 
the Secretary no longer discharges her obligation to 
publish in the Federal Register, but as we noted in our 
brief, our petition was published. And her obligation 
to publish it was triggered by the statute's requirement 
that a petition has, quote, "been filed under Section 
11." Ours -- ours, in fact, was published. 

The question that -- that you raised, 
Justice Kagan, is there any other situation where this 
reading results in a petition that has been filed. The

answer is yes, the government argues that a petition 
filed under Section 11, even if it's untimely, is 
sufficient to commence proceedings and confer 
jurisdiction, which if that's true, it goes to your 
question, Justice Sotomayor. How do you get here if the 
statute -- if the statute of limitations is not 
jurisdictional? How do you get from one place to the 
next? I -- I think there's not a good answer for that. 

Another question that has arisen, I think, 
Justice Scalia, your comments are correct, that -- that 
a filing, a judgment can occur at any time in a case. I 
think it's also important to remember that the Secretary 
is not bound to defend a case on the merits and then 
contest a fee award for the same reason. So there are 
cases pending before the Special Masters right now that 
for reasons I suspect are that the Secretary wanted to 
establish a precedent, that there is no causation 
between vaccine A and injury X, we want to litigate that 
on the merits, and they have won. But it wasn't a slam 
dunk. There was a lot of evidence and a lot of science 
to contradict that, which was rejected. 

Those lawyers now come before the Special 
Master and seek fees in those cases, and the Secretary 
is arguing no fees because these are time-barred. And 
in that case, you are going to have a judgment, by the

government's account, entered on the merits and then 
they're going to come back and defend a fee award 
saying, there is no judgment because there's never been 
a case filed, and you can't get fees.  And it is just a 
fundamental and glaring inconsistency with their 
position. 

I want to address a couple additional points 
on the shadow trial argument because these were raised 
in the government's reply brief. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- I have been 
thinking about your last point. Couldn't that last 
point easily be remedied by -- by simply our holding 
that -- you know, you -- you can't ride both horses; 
that if, in fact, you've litigated it through to a -- to 
a merits judgment in your favor, which presumably has 
stare decisis effect, you then cannot come back and say 
the suit never occurred because the filing was too late. 
I mean, we -- I think we're able to hold that, don't you 
think? 

MR. FISHMAN: I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I agree with you 

it's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for 
the government to do, to win the case and get -- get 
stare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get 
lawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right?

 MR. FISHMAN: Right. I mean, I think 

that -- yes, and I think that, in terms of authority, 
power, I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We could make that up, 
couldn't we? 

MR. FISHMAN: I think that you probably 
could. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. 
MR. FISHMAN: I think you probably could, 

but I think that the problem is you would then be, in 
essence, adopting a procedural rule though that endorses 
the inconsistency in the position. A petition is filed 
for some purposes but not for others, even though 
Congress only referred to petitions filed in -- in the 
generic sense. It didn't distinguish between the time 
at which it's entered or the basis on which it's 
entered. And it could have easily done these things. 

The -- the government is proposing this 
legal fiction. Well, they say, sure, I mean, it can be 
tendered and accepted and you can litigate it for years 
and there can be all sorts of rulings, but as soon as 
the Special Master enters a ruling on timeliness, the 
phrase is they're bound to, quote, "refuse to recognize" 
that it has ever been filed.

 They could have established that -- Congress 

could have established that legal fiction. It could 
have said no petition shall be deemed to be filed if it 
is brought after the statute of limitations has run. 

Or Congress could have achieved this same 
consequence that the government is attributing to 
Section 16 by enacting a rule like this Court's Rule 
13-2; the court will not -- will not file a cert 
petition that is untimely. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You were going to address 
the shadow trial? 

MR. FISHMAN: Yeah, a couple -- a couple 
quick points. We cited 11 cases in the discussion of 
our -- in our discussion of shadow trials for the point 
that these petition -- petitions are denied on 
procedural grounds all the time, and Special Masters 
resolve subsequent fee requests routinely and without a 
hearing. 

The government --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Procedural grounds because 

the affidavits aren't sufficient or --
MR. FISHMAN: Inadequate records is one 

reason. Sometimes, a petitioner dies, and their family 
or estate does not want to pursue this, so it's 
abandoned. There's cases where there's just a failure

to prosecute, it's not clear why; the lawyers lost touch 
with a client or I don't know the reason why, it's just 
a failure to prosecute. 

There are also cases where somebody is 
arguing for causation, but as their case is going 
through the system, other cases are being decided that 
reject their view, particularly paradigm cases. And the 
petitioners fold, they give up, but the lawyers, having 
fought the cases for years, come in and argue. So those 
are all, incidentally, examples of procedural denials 
that are reflected in the 11 cases we cited. 

The point I wanted to make is the government 
doesn't say which of those cases it's referring to when 
it makes the claim that our cases reflect circumstances 
where the Secretary has determined the program's 
resources would be best conserved by, I think the phrase 
is "acquiescing" to a modest request for fees. 

They don't identify what cases they're 
talking about, but in 10 of the 11 cases we cited, on 
their face, fee awards were contested. And they're 
litigated. And you read the opinions, and the Special 
Masters are resolving the challenges that the Secretary 
made, and they are doing it without a hearing. 

There also is this argument about -- I think 
we've already gone over the fact that a statute of

limitations determination is not identical to a 
causation determination. The additional argument that 
the Secretary made in their brief is that, unlike many 
other matters that must be supported at the outset --
the key question in most of these cases, causation, you 
don't have to furnish evidence or make allegations of 
causation -- is not correct. 

Under Section 11(c), if you're bringing a 
non-table case, you have to allege cause and fact. 
And if the medical records don't support causation, you 
need an affidavit from an expert. So that is 
front-loaded as well. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there regulations or 
rules establishing hourly rates? 

MR. FISHMAN: There are not. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea 

from the cases what the ranges are? 
MR. FISHMAN: For rates? 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For rates. 
MR. FISHMAN: It varies region by region. I 

think the Special Masters look to see what the rates in 
Denver are as opposed to the rates in New York or Los 
Angeles --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know that civil rights 
rates, for example, are far below market rates for most

rates generally? 

MR. FISHMAN: Right. I think it's less. 
And it's not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Market rates for general 
litigation. 

MR. FISHMAN: Right. And it's not CJA 
rates --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. 
MR. FISHMAN: -- but very often, it's not 

the rates that attorneys are actually paid. It ends up 
being a problem -- as an aside -- with expert witnesses 
sometimes because the Special Masters don't pay what 
experts in these cases want. 

If there are no further questions, I will 
relinquish the remainder of my time.

because it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases 
dismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those 
dismissed on -- other procedural grounds. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, no, we don't. And 
actually, that's the point I wanted to start with 
is that -- is that the Federal Circuit's decision below 
puts the program into this unchartered territory, where 
we don't really know what this is going to look like. 

The cases that -- that my friend cites in 
his brief are ones that either the petition is so 
facially defective that, of course, fees can't be 
awarded on it, but there's no reason to think that's 
going to be the typical case. 

And then there's other cases where the 
application of the reasonable basis standard is so lax 
as to essentially just turn on -- on the claimant's 
personal say-so, that, oh, I think the vaccine caused my 
injury. That's like -- that's the Hamrick case, for 
example; it's cited in there. 

And that -- that can't be the standard for 
reasonable basis. 

And -- and so I think the Court needs to 
keep in mind that, for example, when my friend says 
there's -- the government doesn't cite a case where 
there's been any shadow trial, the reason is because

there haven't been fees available on untimely petitions, 
which is exactly the set-up that would cause you to have 
a shadow trial. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there have been 
dismissals on other procedural grounds. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, there aren't -- there 
are not really other procedural grounds. There may be 
situations where a petition is voluntarily withdrawn, 
and I think there is a problem there about there not 
actually being a judgment when somebody voluntarily 
withdraws. 

But even in those, the Special Masters 
should have, in our view, examined whether there was a 
reasonable basis. I don't think it's right to say that 
an attorney can come in, file the petition and then the 
claimant decides, well, I would like to withdraw, and 
then the attorney essentially gets paid as of right. 

So our -- it's unsurprising that there's no 
examples of these hearings. It's also unsurprising that 
my friend says, well, there -- for the petitions, when 
it comes time to determine fees, the record is complete. 
Of course the record is complete because the case has 
been decided on the merits. And that's the paradigm 
situation under which the program has been operated. 

What we are talking about here is entering

this unchartered territory, where -- where the program 
has not been before, and where you wouldn't think 
Congress would want to send it. And this is our central 
concern with this case. The government's concern 
here -- and the reason we've petitioned for certiorari 
is not because of the dollar amount involved in paying 
these claims. The concern is about where the program's 
resources are being directed. 

The question is -- the question is about 
where the finite number of Special Masters, the finite 
number of government attorneys, can put their time in 
responding to these petitions for -- to deliver the 
compensation to the very few, but very deserving people 
who Congress wanted to award compensation to. 

And our concern here is --
JUSTICE BREYER: So your view here it's the 

same. No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they 
decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed 
early on for a procedural ground, when the record is 
inadequate, et cetera. 

You think that in none of those cases 
Congress would have wanted attorneys' fees. 

Or is it --
MR. HORWICH: Well, in the case of --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- do you think in some but

not others? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, no. In the case where 
the claimant dies, the statute has provisions for that, 
and you can obtain compensation in that situation. So 
there's no reason an attorney can't go on there --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, no, the family 
gives up. 

MR. HORWICH: -- if they want to -- if they 
want to withdraw the petition, I guess it depends on 
exactly the circumstances under which --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but my question is what 
is your view? It's the same problem. He's listed, you 
heard, he listed six or seven different instances --
four or five anyway; he's found 11 cases, apparently. 
And so what is your view? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, my view -- my view is 
the view that I think we would take under any other fee 
shifting provision, which is that if a claimant wants to 
withdraw his or her case, I don't think that he can then 
claim the benefit of the attorneys' fee provision, 
absent some circumstances that -- that would warrant the 
finding of reasonable basis. I think that is an 
unexceptional result.
