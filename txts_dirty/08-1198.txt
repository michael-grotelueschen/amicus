CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument first today in Case 08-1198, Stolt-Nielsen S.A. 

v. AnimalFeeds International. 

Mr. Waxman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Unlike courts, arbitrators derive their 

authority solely from the consent of the parties to a 

particular agreement. 

That agreement determines not only what the 

parties have agreed to arbitrate, but just as 

fundamentally, with whom they have agreed to do so. And 

when the agreement reveals no intent, no meeting of the 

minds to add participants, but the arbitrators 

nonetheless extend their reach to hundreds of parties of 

other contracts, they violate the basic principle 

reflected in the FAA that their authority is created and 

circumscribed by an agreement. 

The decision to impose class proceedings is 

not the kind of incidental procedural matter that 

arbitrators have to resolve in order to discharge their

responsibilities under the foundational agreement. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, there’s a 

preliminary question in this case, and that is: There 

was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, 

and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the 

question whether the arbitration clause permitted class 

treatment. 

The arbitrators answered that question, 

which they were given authority to do so by both sides, 

and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators 

answered within the ballpark. 

If we agree with that, then there's nothing 

else to consider in this case. 

MR. WAXMAN: I respectfully disagree, 

Justice Ginsburg. The arbitrators -- the agreement 

reflected in paragraph 7 of the supplemental agreement 

-- that is, to proceed to arbitration under the auspices 

of Rules 3 through 7 of the AAA rules, and Rule 3 itself 

contemplated precisely submitting precisely the 

contract issue that the Bazzle plurality said should go 

to the arbitrators. That is, looking at the arbitration 

clause itself, does it objectively reveal an agreement 

among the two parties to permit or prohibit class or 

consolidated treatment, or is it truly silent? 

That is a question of contract

interpretation. That is the question that was submitted 

to the arbitrators. 

There is a separate statutory question that 

arises if the answer to the contract question is number 

3. There is no meeting of the minds. It is truly 

silent --

JUSTICE BREYER: But there is no such answer. 

MR. WAXMAN: Excuse me. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought, in contracts, 

there is no such answer. When you interpret a contract 

and it doesn't say, you try to figure out -- I used to 

be taught that; probably I am way out-of-date -- you try 

to figure out what a reasonable party would have 

intended. 

MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I thought that's what 

Bazzle said, that --

MR. WAXMAN: I very -- I very much doubt 

that you are way out-of-date. If you are, I shudder to 

think where I am. But let me be clear --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not as out-of-date. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WAXMAN: I hope I am as up-to-date as I 

need to be to provide a coherent, correct answer. 

My proposition is twofold, and only the

second part gets to your question. 

The first is that the arbitrators in this 

case decided the contractual question, the -- did the 

parties have a meeting of the minds, yes or no? And if 

so, was it? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. WAXMAN: And the arbitrators then went 

on to say: Even though there is no meeting of the minds 

objectively revealed, nonetheless we are going to apply 

a background rule that puts the burden on the party 

opposing arbitration to prove that there is an intent to 

preclude. 

So, we're establishing that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see that now, but then --

but there are two separate questions. 

MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. 

JUSTICE BREYER: My question was, first, the 

same as Justice Ginsburg. 

MR. WAXMAN: And I have an answer --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I have a question for 

you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought 

your description of who is to decide this matter of 

whether there is to be a class action was just what you 

said: The question of who should decide it is a matter 

for the parties.

MR. WAXMAN: The question --

JUSTICE BREYER: So when I looked at -- I 

just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there 

seemed --

MR. WAXMAN: Well, you are nowhere near up 

to me, then. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But what it 

seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from 

a contract and background circumstances. In Bazzle, 

the contract was: Any -- all disputes relating to this 

contract. 

Here, it doesn't say that. It says: "Any 

dispute arising from the performance, termination, or 

making of the contract." 

Now, a class-action determination does 

relate to. Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay? That's 

an argument. 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes. No, no, no --

JUSTICE BREYER: So why are all these briefs 

saying that what Bazzle said was: Whenever this is 

silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is 

answered at arbitration. 

I can't find it saying that. 

MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. What -- and I -- I'm 

interpreting the plurality opinion that you wrote -- or

you and three of your colleagues. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know. I know. But 

what I actually thought doesn't matter. What matters is 

what is said. 

MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Well, our 

understanding -- what Bazzle said is, at the very 

beginning of the opinion -- look, here's the case: The 

South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration 

clause is truly silent, and it then applied a rule of 

State law that says, if it's silent, class treatment 

will be permitted. We granted certiorari in this case 

to decide whether that rule of South Carolina law 

applied to this case is precluded by the FAA, which 

requires actual consent, not coercion. 

Now, what the plurality in Bazzle, with 

respect, said is: We can't reach the legal question, 

the statutory FAA question on which we granted review, 

because we can't be certain that the contract really is 

silent. To be sure, there’s no express provision, but 

Bazzle -- the Bazzle plaintiffs say that it is silent, 

and Green Tree says, no, if you look at other words in 

it, including the right to choose each arbitrator for 

each arbitration, it's not -- the South Carolina courts 

answered the question, but they are not the ones, 

because when you are talking about a question of the

interpretation of a contract that has committed to 

arbitration, that is for the arbitrators to decide. The 

arbitrators have to decide whether there was actually a 

meeting of the minds. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're -- so the 

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who 

question, who shall decide whether or not in your case 

class actions are permissible? 

MR. WAXMAN: And the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The who question in Bazzle, 

because of the contract and background, was the 

arbitrator. 

MR. WAXMAN: If -- yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The who question here, 

irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the 

reason that Justice Ginsburg said. There's a separate 

saying: You are the who; you, arbitrators, are the who. 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So now we look to the what. 

They then decided it. 

MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. So in Bazzle --

JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what did they decide? 

And you are saying that's wrong. And there you run into 

all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other 

places, saying when the arbitrator says something,

unless it's in Marrs, follow it. That's what you are 

addressing. 

MR. WAXMAN: Right. Exactly. And -- and this 

case presents exactly the same answer to that question 

that Bazzle presented when it was granted review; that 

is, there is -- there was an interpretation of the 

contract in Bazzle, and an application of a legal 

principle to that interpretation. The who for what --

what the parties actually intended is the arbitrator. 

That's what the Bazzle plurality, together with Justice 

Stevens, both decided. 

The question that arises, the legal question 

that arises, only if the arbitrators say there was no 

meeting of the minds: So what rule does the FAA allow 

us to apply as a matter of Federal law? That is for 

courts, and you didn't reach it because the preliminary 

question of whether the contract was really silent, the 

predicate question, wasn't answered. And you remanded 

for that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, can I ask this 

preliminary question? Assume the contract expressly 

authorized class arbitration. Would you agree that was 

permissible? 

MR. WAXMAN: If it expressly authorized it? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

MR. WAXMAN: If it expressly authorized 

class participation, obviously, we would have no 

argument that the parties had not agreed to it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, but would 

you agree that would be consistent with the law, to 

enforce such a provision? 

MR. WAXMAN: My -- I have a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That is, does the Federal 

statute prohibit that kind of provision? 

MR. WAXMAN: No, certainly not. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh. 

MR. WAXMAN: I mean, the only reason -- the 

only reason I’m hedging -- and I don't mean to hedge, but 

trying to be thoughtful -- is that this Court explained 

in Mitsubishi, in the context of the arbitration of a 

Sherman Act agreement, and subsequently in Gilmer and 

other statutory cases, that in determining whether class 

participation or some other form of remedy is or isn't 

available, there is a two-part inquiry. 

The first part is: What was the scope of 

the arbitration agreement? What is it that the parties 

have agreed --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you would agree that 

if they phrased their order a little differently and 

said we think that the best reading of this agreement

is that the parties intended to authorize class 

arbitration, then you would have no case? 

MR. WAXMAN: Then we would have review only 

under the -- I don't know that I would characterize it 

this way, but what Justice Breyer characterized, the 

Marrs standard of review; that is, you would have to 

show --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That there was manifest 

disregard –-

MR. WAXMAN: -- manifest disregard, and a 

manifest --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you would not contend 

-- you are not arguing that that would be manifest --

MR. WAXMAN: No, our -- and the petition in 

this case presented the question as given, presented the 

issue of contract construction as given, that the 

contract itself was silent, not only in the sense that 

it didn't include an express provision or prohibition, 

but also that it reflected no meeting of the minds. It 

objectively revealed no meeting of the minds, looking 

not only at the actual text of the contract, but also 

looking at the other indicia -- objective indicia of 

intent that courts use to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What, in your view --

by the submission by the parties? 

MR. WAXMAN: The arbitrators were asked to 

decide whether the arbitration agreement objectively 

reveals consent to prohibit, permit -- whether it 

reveals a meeting of the minds to prohibit class 

treatment, permit class treatment, or whether it was 

truly silent. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't you just --

MR. WAXMAN: And if you look at --

JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't you just say that the 

parties agreed that there was no meeting of the minds on 

this issue? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, no, no, no. The 

parties that -- I mean -- we actually -- let me step 

back and give -- and give the history of it. 

This case arose immediately in the wake of 

Bazzle. Okay? They sued in court; we obtained an order 

affirmed by the Second Circuit sending them to 

arbitration. Bazzle is decided, and we’re all looking 

at Bazzle, and we decide -- like the AAA, which has 

filed an amicus brief in this case, and said it drafted 

these rules in order to provide a procedure to answer 

the Bazzle contract interpretation question; the AAA 

says, we don't have any view about the statutory 

question that arises from silence -- so we drafted a

supplemental agreement that, in paragraph 7, 

incorporates the AAA Rules 3 through 7. 

And the AAA Rule 3, which is included on 

page 56 of the joint appendix, is headed "Construction 

of the Arbitration Clause." And it requires the 

arbitrators in this arbitration to determine, quote, "on 

construction of the arbitration clause, whether the 

applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to 

proceed on behalf of or against a class." The, quote, 

"clause construction award." 

Now, the legal -- the arbitrators in this 

case concluded that it neither permitted nor prohibited, 

either by its express terms or by reference to other 

objective indicia of intent --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I’m a little bit puzzled. I 

don't understand how something -- if you ask 

whether something permits it, and if it doesn't prohibit 

it, doesn't it a fortiori permit it? 

MR. WAXMAN: It -- in the context of the 

Federal Arbitration Act, which this Court has made clear 

more times than I can remember that the central purpose 

is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are 

enforced according to their terms, the question is: 

Have the parties agreed to it if there is a meeting of 

the minds?

If no meeting of the minds is objectively 

revealed, under the FAA, the arbitrator exceeds his 

authority in requiring class arbitration. It's -- there 

is no consent. And if there is no consent, the legal

is a private consensual matter. This is not a court 

exercising public coercive authority. I mean, the --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is your understanding 

of what Mr. Persky says at 77a of the joint appendix? 

He was -- I take it he was counsel for AnimalFeeds? Is 

that right? 

MR. WAXMAN: Correct. He --

JUSTICE ALITO: And he says all the parties 

agree that when a contract is silent on an issue, there 

has been no agreement that has been reached on that 

issue; therefore, there has been no agreement to bar 

class arbitrations. 

MR. WAXMAN: Right. I --

JUSTICE ALITO: So then I don't understand 

what issue there was for the arbitrator to --

arbitrators to decide --

MR. WAXMAN: They --

But that would not be within their power, unless they

could presumably find that rule in Federal maritime law

MR. WAXMAN: Correct. I mean --

JUSTICE ALITO: So what was the issue for 

them to decide? 

MR. WAXMAN: So here's was -- here’s what the 

issue was. They said the contract is completely silent 

and, as you quoted on page 77, the part -- there's no 

meeting of the minds on this issue at all. That was 

their position about the construction of the contract. 

Our position about the construction of the 

contract was that, in fact, although there is no express 

provision one way or the other, this is a maritime 

contract, and the -- and maritime law is ascertained by 

custom and practice. And we introduced evidence in the 

form of affidavits that were unrefuted that since the 

days of Marco Polo, these types of spot voyages have 

been --

JUSTICE BREYER: That -- isn't that -- you 

and I have a contract. I'll ship you 17 pounds of durum 

wheat, and you will pay me $43. In the meantime, a 

green worm eats up all the durum wheat, and therefore 

they can't send durum wheat; they send some duhu wheat. 

All right? Question: Is the contract 

valid or not?

JUSTICE BREYER: Answer: We have courts for

MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Arbitrators will look to 

see what it says. If it says nothing, they will try to 

determine what the parties thought. If they can't 

determine what they thought, they will look to custom, 

analogy, et cetera. Now --

MR. WAXMAN: No.

over a dispute and exercises coercive power, it has to 

get to an answer. 

When you are talking about private 

arbitration, where the model is a private agreement to 

resolve things between two parties, this -- under the 

FAA, the arbitrators get their authority only as to 

matters as to which there is consent. 

And there is -- going to Justice Alito's 

question, there was consent. It was submitted for 

purpose of determining whether -- if you look at the 

contract and look at background rules and look at parol 

evidence and look at custom and practice, can you

discern whether, as -- as you put it in -- in the 

opinion in Howsam, Justice Breyer, whether the contract, 

quote, "objectively reveals an agreement" by the two 

parties. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the same before 

courts. That's no different. I mean, yes, a court has 

to come to a decision, but so does an arbitrator. And I 

really -- I really don't understand what it means to say 

that the contract does not cover it. I mean, the -- the 

contract either requires it or does not require it. 

And if the contract is silent, either the 

court or the arbitrator has to decide what is the 

consequence of that silence, in light of the background, 

in light of -- of implied understandings. Is the 

consequence of the -- of the silence that a class 

arbitration is permitted, or is the consequence of the 

silence that it is not? 

But those are the only answers. The 

contract requires it or the contract doesn't require it. 

I don't know anything in between -- the contract is 

silent. If the contract is silent, it's up to the court 

or the arbitrator to decide what that silence means. 

MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. And -- and maybe the 

ambiguity here is the fluidity of the term "silence." 

"Silence" can mean there’s no express

work your way through to conclude that there was in fact 

an intent.

that I am using it in, and I think the sense that the 

arbitrators have authority to do, is to say, well, 

let's look and see, for example, if there is custom and 

practice that would inform the backdrop against which 

the parties negotiate. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and why is it that 

you say an arbitrator cannot do that, but a judge can? 

MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no, I think an 

arbitrator can. The arbitrator has plenary authority, 

subject to manifest disregard review, to decide whether 

or not there was a meeting of the minds of the parties. 

And it can use the text of the statute; it can use an 

applicable background principle of governing law; it can 

use principles like contra proferentem, as this Court 

did in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are they situated and 

do they have the same authority as a court would in 

determining that issue, given the fact that it was 

remitted to them to decide? 

MR. WAXMAN: They have plenary authority to

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you would -- would you 

describe -- would you describe the authority of a court 

any differently than you've just described the authority 

of an arbitrator? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that courts can 

-- for example, a court can say -- and the other side 

relies heavily on a Seventh Circuit opinion by Judge 

Posner, where he basically says: There is no intent 

here, but courts apply contract constructions that seem 

most sensible as a matter of public policy, and that's 

what we are going to do. 

That's what a court can do and an arbitrator 

can't. The arbitrator can use any tools possible, 

including, largely, the text and custom and practice, in 

order to define whether or not there was a meeting of 

the minds. But if there wasn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do I have to agree with 

Judge Posner on that? I mean I -- I don't --

MR. WAXMAN: I think it's a radical 

proposition --

do, but it certainly doesn't express what an arbitrator 

can do. And he was -- he was performing the kind of 

function, ostensibly, that you said that should be done 

by an arbitrator in Bazzle. He was doing it as a court. 

But arbitrators have to construe the 

agreement itself between the two parties to see if there 

is a meeting of the minds. And there are lots of tools 

they can use. 

And just to get back to your question, 

Justice Alito --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

MR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry -- in this case, we 

said the contract was not truly silent, that --

essentially, we argued what Judge Rakoff concluded. 

They said: No, no, no; it is truly silent, but you 

should rule for us on other grounds. And may I please 

ask the Court, if you have it, to turn to page 22 of our 

blue brief, because on page 22 of our blue brief we have 

reprinted exactly what AnimalFeeds told the arbitrators 

were the reasons why they should win, in light of Mr. 

Persky's statement that there was no meeting of the 

minds. And it is the indented paragraph. 

This is all that they said: "The parties' 

arbitration clause should be construed to allow class 

arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the

issue of class treatment, and without express 

prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under 

Bazzle." The arbitrator said: No, that's not what 

Bazzle means. Bazzle doesn't mean that unless there’s 

an express prohibition, it's -- it's permitted. So that 

was their reason number one. 

Let's go to their reason number 3. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the arbitrators 

say that? 

MR. WAXMAN: They said it in -- pardon me 

while I get the page. 

Page 49a: "Claimants argue that Bazzle 

requires clear language that forbids class arbitration 

in order to bar a class action. The panel, however, 

agrees with Respondents that the test is a more general 

one. Arbitrators must look to the language of the 

parties' agreement to ascertain the parties' intention, 

whether they intended to permit or to preclude class 

arbitration." 

Now, let's go back to what they told the 

arbitrators, and it's reprinted on page 22. I am going 

to skip --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But let me just, right 

there, interrupt with one question. The alternatives 

before the arbitrator were whether it is permitted or

precluded? 

MR. WAXMAN: Or was silent. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, that's not what they 

said there, is it? That -- that the parties agree they’re 

silent -- that whether they -- if they are silent, 

whether they permit or preclude class action. Those are 

the two alternatives that they were confronted with. 

They decided that it did not preclude; ergo, it 

permitted. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's what the answer to 

that on page 49a is. 

MR. WAXMAN: No, with -- with respect -- and 

I’ll -- let me answer this question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You --

MR. WAXMAN: -- before getting back to the 

-- what that -- what -- look, you -- you may find, 

contrary to the cert grant in this case, that the 

predicate of our petition is wrong. 

Our petition is predicated on the 

understanding that the arbitrators found that the 

contract was truly silent; that is, it expressed no 

meeting of the minds. And, therefore, this case 

presents the question --

asked was whether that silence should be interpreted as 

a preclusion or a permission. 

MR. WAXMAN: And we know from the 

arbitrators' decision --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You said there was a 

permission. 

MR. WAXMAN: As -- as a background rule, 

that's what they said. What they said was, they --

first of all -- and we are looking at page 52 -- they 

acknowledge the force of the argument, quote, "that the 

bulk of international shippers would never intend to 

have their disputes decided in a class arbitration." 

But they said, well, we can deal with that later in 

deciding whether they can opt in or out. 

I mean, the point is that if you have to opt 

in because it's clear that you never agreed, there is no 

meeting of the minds. 

Secondly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, may I 

ask you -- because your time is running and we are 

spending all of your time on this preliminary question. 

There is one fundamental flaw, it seems to 

me, in your argument, and I’d like you to answer it. 

And you can call it “the vanishing class action.” 

AnimalFeeds wanted to be in court, not in arbitration.

MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- and they 

wanted to bring a class action. You persuaded the 

Second Circuit they belong in arbitration. So now they 

are in arbitration. You say: The only thing we 

consented to is a one-on-one claim. Fine. 

AnimalFeeds can then say: Fine, well, we 

didn't consent to anything more than the one-on-one. We 

had a class action. We had -- we were in court. We 

could have proceeded in an individual action or a class 

action. Now we are in arbitration, and under the 

agreement, as you read it, we can't have the class 

action in arbitration. 

That doesn't mean it vanishes, because if it 

does, then the arbitration clause is not merely saying 

what the arbitrator can decide, but it is shrinking 

drastically the dimensions of AnimalFeeds' claim. 

MR. WAXMAN: That is incorrect, with 

respect. AnimalFeeds doesn't have a class claim. 

AnimalFeeds has a claim. Its claim is that it paid too 

much for the contracts that it entered into -- the charter 

parties -- to ship some sort of oil from Panama to ports 

around the world. 

It is -- it was asking a court, and is now 

asking an arbitrator, to join in the separate claims

said this goes to arbitration. What is the "this"? 

If it's only a one-on-one claim, how do they lose the

-- in the JLM case, which is the case in which the 

Second Circuit, the district court in the Second Circuit 

said, no, you have to arbitrate this -- their briefs 

actually made this point. Their briefs said you can't 

send us to arbitration, because we won't get class 

treatment in arbitration. 

And the Second -- the district court in the 

Second Circuit said you have got to arbitrate 

according to the terms of your agreement. In footnote 9 

of the Second Circuit's opinion –-

a forum selection clause, it says where you go, but it

your claim is. 

MR. WAXMAN: Their claim was we paid too 

much. And with respect, Justice Ginsburg, your point 

that they aren't allowed to proceed in class arbitration 

is no different than the fact that by agreeing to 

arbitrate this bilateral dispute, the parties agreed to 

dispense with an appeal and with meaningful judicial 

review of the things the arbitrators decided.

arbitrators correctly said no. 

I want to skip (b), because my submission is 

that (b) is what they did. 

(C) says the clause would be unconscionable 

and unenforceable if it forbade class arbitration. The 

panel said: We aren't reaching that; we are not 

deciding that question. 

So what's left? The only other argument 

that AnimalFeeds made was (b): The clause should be 

construed to permit class arbitration as a matter of 

public policy. And that is exactly what the arbitrators 

did. 

What they said was -- and this is on page 51 

of the petition appendix -- they said that if they 

followed a strict contractual theory, quote, "There 

would appear to be no basis for a class action, absent 

express agreement among all parties and putative class 

members." 

And they then, lower down on the page, then 

said that we were required to prove that the parties, 

quote, "intended to preclude arbitration." That is, 

they applied a background rule that they thought was 

desirable from a public policy sense. 

And our sole submission here, the only 

question presented in this case, is that that decision

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T.L. PILLARD 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. PILLARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

What the arbitrators did here was interpret 

the contract as the parties asked them to. They did not 

impose their own policy judgment. And any judicial 

review is under very deferential FAA standards under 

section 10, which is confined to correcting what amount 

to gross defects in the process. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where -- where do 

they say that they were interpreting the intent of the 

parties, that it was the intent of the parties to permit 

class arbitration?

rests on a misinterpretation of what the arbitrators 

did. And if you look at page 59 of the petition 

appendix, Mr. Waxman already read to you the language 

that the arbitrators understood they must look to the 

language of the parties' agreement to ascertain the 

parties' intention. 

And then the next key part is on page 50a, 

which is a little terse, but let's say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, what part -- 50? 

MS. PILLARD: 50a, the next page of the 

petition appendix. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said 59a to 

start. 

MS. PILLARD: No. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You said 49a. 

MS. PILLARD: 49a was where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MS. PILLARD: -- the arbitrators described 

their methodology, which is standard contract 

methodology: To look to the parties' agreement, to 

ascertain the parties' intention, whether they intended 

to permit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or to preclude.

set up --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that a 

critical difference, though? I mean, I understood the 

fundamental question in -- before getting arbitration 

is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this 

dispute with this party. 

And it's one thing to say that the contract 

permitted this sort of arbitration; it's another thing 

to say it didn't preclude it. 

MS. PILLARD: That's right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if it didn't 

preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree --

I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with 

A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but 

nothing in the agreement compels me to do that. 

So which did the arbitrators do? Did they 

say, under this contract, you agreed to a class action 

treatment, in the sense that -- whether it's the 

language or the intent or whatever -- or did they say we 

don't find anything here that precludes class action 

treatment? 

MS. PILLARD: Mr. Chief Justice, they did 

the former. And let me point you to -- on page 50, what 

they relied on was the broad language of the agreement,

the language "any disputes." And in particular, they 

drew on the breadth of that language and on the fact 

that many other arbitrators had read similar language to 

permit class arbitration. And so those other --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you show 

me this -- I see they have quoted from --

MS. PILLARD: Yes.

Where is that in the agreement itself? 

MS. PILLARD: The "any disputes" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you know offhand. 

MS. PILLARD: Is -- the agreement is 

reproduced in Appendix F of the petition appendix, which 

starts on page 67a, and the arbitration clause is on 

page 69a. 

Now, it's clear that the arbitrators 

rejected the notion that they should permit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this is -- I'm 

sorry. This is what I was wondering. It is, of course, 

any dispute arising from -- blah, blah -- performance, 

termination of this charter party shall be settled in 

New York.

Now, there's -- the class is not a party to 

this charter party. So disputes arising from this 

charter party doesn't involve the class. So they did 

not agree to arbitrate with the class. 

Now, as I understand what the arbitrators 

did, they said, well, they didn't preclude it, and so 

we get to decide how far our authority goes. 

MS. PILLARD: I’d like to address that 

directly, Mr. Chief Justice. The arbitrators 

specifically rejected the notion that they should adopt 

as -- as a default rule. And that's on page 49a. Where 

we had actually argued that they should, they rejected 

our argument. 

Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear 

language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar 

it; the panel, however, agrees with Respondent. 

So they are saying: We are not going to do 

this based on a default rule; we are going to do this 

based on the language and intent. Right? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now -- now --

I'm sorry. I'm just reading along here. They rejected 

your argument about "forbids," but the -- they go on to 

say: The issue -- we look at this, we look at that to 

see whether they intended to permit or to preclude class 

action.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's enough for 

them if the parties did not intend to preclude class 

action. 

MS. PILLARD: I -- I respectfully disagree. 

They go on and they read any disputes to authorize --

now, it's not to require class action. I think it's 

important that that be clear. 

It's to put the class action mechanism --

or, to read the contract, that the class action 

mechanism is in the arbitrators' toolbox. It's 

something that's available. It's not necessarily going 

to happen, but it's something that's available. So it's 

part of a delegation to the arbitrators of authority 

to choose procedures. Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In -- in any -- in 

any case -- when you say "arbitrators' toolbox," I'm 

trying to figure out if that is something different than 

what the parties agreed to. 

MS. PILLARD: No, by agreeing to arbitrate 

any disputes, the arbitrators found that they were given 

the authority to use class arbitration, among other 

procedures, if they were appropriate in the particular 

case.

that the arbitrators are putting the choice in a false 

manner. It isn't whether, on the one hand, they agreed 

to permit it or, on the other hand, they agreed to 

prohibit it. Just forget about the latter. They must 

have agreed to permit it. 

Where did the arbitrators say they agreed --

they agreed to permit it? Not simply, they did not 

agree to prohibit it. You don't have to agree to 

prohibit everything in a contract. You have to agree to 

permit it. That's what contracting is about. 

MS. PILLARD: That's right. I’d like to 

point to two aspects of the opinion that I think clarify 

this. 

The one is their reference to the language 

on page 50a, the panel is -- and they are talking about 

the language in the context of the other arbitration 

precedent, or the other arbitration opinions that had 

developed at that point under the AAA arbitration 

scheme. And they are saying the -- they find that the 

broad wording "any dispute" to be significant, and the 

fact that other arbitrators looking at that language 

also found "any dispute" to encompass the choice of this 

procedure. 

Now, I think it was Justice Alito --

good for you. "The panel is struck by the fact that 

Respondents have been unable to cite any post-Bazzle 

panels or arbitrators that construed their clauses as 

prohibiting a class action." 

That's not what -- what they have to find. 

They must find positively that it permits a class 

action. 

MS. PILLARD: And it's our contention -- and I 

think it's clear -- that they found that it was 

permitted. And when you see that following --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just give me some language 

that says that. I -- there is nothing in that paragraph 

that says it. 

MS. PILLARD: The -- the broad wording, the 

"any dispute" -- now, they reject the notion -- they 

expressly have rejected the notion that they are 

supposed to do it as a matter of default. 

And then I just want to address this 

language, which I think could be confusing, at the 

bottom of 51a, where they say they don't establish that 

the parties -- this is the last paragraph on 51a: The 

Respondents' evidence "does not establish that the 

parties intended to preclude class arbitration."

was affirmative general authorization on the part of the 

arbitrators to choose any procedures, to have this in 

their toolbox, then in order to overcome that, you would 

need to -- and the Petitioners were trying with their 

maritime experts -- to show an intent to preclude. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the only language you 

can point to is that -- is that "any dispute" language 

on 50a? 

MS. PILLARD: That's right, and I think 

that's very important. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are hanging your whole 

-- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators 

not only found that the contract did not prohibit it, 

but found that the contract positively authorized class 

action, upon that language on 50a? 

MS. PILLARD: Together with the language on 

49a where the panel expressly rejects the idea that all 

you need is the absence of language forbidding it. 

Right? 

So they've already -- they've set the issue 

up exactly as you -- your hypothetical would require 

them to. They've said: It's not enough to find --

MS. PILLARD: It's on 49a, the second 

sentence under the heading of "Discussion of Parties' 

Contentions." They say, "Claimants argue that Bazzle 

requires clear language that forbids class arbitration" 

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Clear language" is the 

point of that sentence. "Claimants argue that Bazzle 

requires clear language that forbids class arbitration. 

The panel, however, agrees with Respondents that the 

test is a more general one. Arbitrators must look to 

the language to ascertain the parties' intention whether 

they intended to permit or to preclude class action.” 

MS. PILLARD: I would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The point of those two 

sentences is simply that in order for us to find that 

you didn't preclude it -- and if you didn't preclude it, 

it's okay -- you don't need clear language. We have to 

look to everything. 

MS. PILLARD: I -- I respectfully disagree, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's how I read 

the two sentences. 

MS. PILLARD: But I think that what's very 

important here is that judicial review is under a very

deferential standard, which is confined to correcting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just 

saying that they're -- they’re giving up a lot. This 

is the basic reason that you require, I thought, fairly 

clear language that you are agreeing to arbitrate. They 

are giving up their right to go into court. They have 

an agreement between A and B that they will arbitrate a 

dispute, and they say you are giving up your right to go 

to court with the dispute between A and C. 

And the "any dispute" language that you're, 

you know, quite understandably relying on refers to any 

dispute arising from the -- making performance or 

termination of "this charter party." "This charter 

party" says nothing about arbitrating with C. 

MS. PILLARD: No, but this charter party is 

the same agreement that the Petitioners have with every 

absent class member. We wouldn't be here if every --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but they can 

agree to arbitrate. They can agree to arbitrate with 

some and not with others, even if it's the same 

contract. They may decide that your client is a very 

reasonable person; they are happy to submit that to 

arbitration. 

Or it's a very big and important client, and 

they don't want to get into court with you. They may

charter party, different -- different parties --

MS. PILLARD: But they've --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and different 

results. 

MS. PILLARD: Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

MS. PILLARD: They've already entered into 

agreement. They've already said they are going to 

arbitrate with the absent class members, so everybody 

has the same contract that says "any disputes," 

and the question is: Do the arbitrators, under that 

broad language, have the authority? 

And I would point this Court to the -- this 

Court's decision in Mastrobuono, which read a clause 

requiring arbitration of any controversy to empower 

arbitrators to award punitive damages, and that was 

despite established New York State law to the contrary. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's where I started 

this. We don't get many contract interpretation cases, 

and that's why I -- I needed to go back to Jack Dawson, 

who is a great contracts professor. And I am --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contracts.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contracts. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't have that 

pleasure, but the --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: The -- but the -- as I recall, 

the way I would have interpreted -- imagine a worker who 

says: I have a right, permission -- it's permissible 

for me to eat lunch next to the machine. The employer 

says no. The question was what is -- does the contract 

permit this or not? 

So the arbitrator or the judge reads the 

words. Nothing. They have no idea. Then the judge or 

the arbitrator reads the rest of the contract. Hasn't a 

clue. Then the arbitrator or the judge goes and looks 

and sees what's practice around here? "I don't know." 

Then they might look to what happens in the rest of the 

industry. Then they might look to what happens in 

foreign countries with comparable industries. Then they 

might look to public policy. 

They might look almost to anything under the 

sun they think is relevant, and the way, in jargon, you 

describe the bottom line is: They have found a meeting 

of the minds as to what this means. 

Now, of course, it isn't really a meeting of

the minds. But that's just the summary of the 

conclusion as to what, objectively read, those words in 

the contract mean. Now, that's how I think I would have 

learned it. 

Is that still done, or is there some other 

way of describing it? 

MS. PILLARD: I think that's pretty good 

contract law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If that's contract law --

MS. PILLARD: And that’s the way I understand 

it. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- then I take it what 

they're saying is: It may be true that the arbitrators, 

when they looked at some of those elements, really got 

it wrong. Now, if they are correct on that -- this is 

the other question I have. You are going to say: No, 

they're not -- they didn't get it that wrong; wrong, 

maybe, but not that wrong. 

All right. Now, can they not do this? The 

next person who has this form contract does not so 

readily agree it's up to the arbitrator to say whether 

that contains a class action or not. Rather, they say: 

I read this contract as reserving that question to the 

court. It's not the same language as was there in 

Bazzle; it's not the same industry of the kind you had

in Bazzle; and, therefore, a judge should decide that. 

That's the meeting of the minds on the who question. And 

then we’ll get it all resolved, because the judge might 

come out differently if they're right, and maybe 

arbitrators will follow the judge. 

I’m interested, because we might have to write 

something, in your answer to that question. 

MS. PILLARD: I think that if they wanted to 

write around it, they could do that, as this Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not -- we know they're 

going to -- they have something already in place. 

MS. PILLARD: Could it be interpreted to 

say --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. PILLARD: -- this is a question for the 

court? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 

MS. PILLARD: I think -- I don't see the 

language here in this contract, but they could try to do 

that. There's nothing in the FAA that bars it. 

And, you know, as we've emphasized, the 

contract interpretation, under ordinary contract rules 

that the FAA has consistently applied in -- and this 

Court has consistently applied to the FAA in -- in many, 

many cases -- it's ordinary contract law we're talking

about here. 

Now, I just think one thing -- when we are 

thinking about contract law, which is ordinarily in the 

province of the States, I think it's important that the 

New York Appellate Division, in Cheng v. Oxford Health 

Plans, has since approved just such an arbitrator's 

contract interpretation under New York law, allowing 

class arbitration under a 1998 pre-Bazzle clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Allowing. 

MS. PILLARD: -- like this one. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Allowing. See, that's 

where I get hung up. There’s a difference 

in arbitration -- and it's a fundamental difference --

between allowing something and a background rule that 

requires it if you don't say anything about it. 

The difference I see with the hypothetical 

Justice Breyer put is that you are talking about the 

details of a contract once it's agreed there is a 

contract. There's a contract that governs the 

relationship between the employer and the employee, and 

you're trying to figure out if it says anything about 

where they eat lunch. 

This is the much more fundamental issue of 

whether you've even agreed to arbitrate with this 

person. Is this guy your employee or just somebody who

came in off the street? 

And I think what your brother's position is, 

is that this is just somebody who came off the street; 

the class members. I didn't agree to do anything with 

them. 

MS. PILLARD: Well, I think, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that that goes back to whether any disputes can 

plausibly be read to encompass the class mechanism, 

because if it can, well, then, by agreeing to that 

contract, you have, in effect, agreed to something that 

delegates to the arbitrator the ability to use that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --

MS. PILLARD: So when you picked --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I --

MS. PILLARD: -- your arbitrator you picked 

your arbitrator knowing that. And here, they had 

extra notice, right, because this case had been filed 

in court as a class action? They knew when they picked 

these arbitrators -- and you can tell by the caliber of 

arbitrators they picked -- that they knew this could be a 

class arbitration, and so they are picking people who 

are up to that task. 

Now, they also know that they are going to 

dispute that, but if we're right that the arbitrators,

judicial review, have -- have sustainably interpreted 

this contract to give the arbitrators the authority to 

proceed on a class basis, well, then, I think your 

objection --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

that's what it comes down --

MS. PILLARD: -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

disappears. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what it comes 

down to --

MS. PILLARD: Right.

interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators 

the authority to proceed on a class basis. 

Not enough, right, under your view, if 

there's nothing in there that precludes them from doing 

so? 

MS. PILLARD: I think that's a question of 

State law. For example, under the State law at the time 

in South Carolina, what the South Carolina Supreme Court 

found in Bazzle was that the contract was silent, but 

the -- applying two rules of contract construction, 

contra proferentem -- well, one rule of contract 

construction and one FAA rule, which is the Moses H. 

Cone rule, the court said: We find this contract

authorizes it. Right? So there was contra proferentem. 

There was also, which I haven't mentioned 

and I should, the Moses H. Cone rule, which says when 

there’s any ambiguity about the scope of issues that 

have been given to the arbitrator, we put a finger on 

the scale in favor of giving the issue to the 

arbitrator. So if it's unclear, any disputes, well, 

maybe that only is about contract issues, where the 

court in JLM said, no, it's antitrust, too --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what -- what 

happens --

MS. PILLARD: -- and the arbitrators say 

procedure, too. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens if you 

get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says: As we read 

the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the 

intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant --

you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the 

same time there is nothing in there that says you may 

not. And I looked at the intent of the parties 

and background rules, and nothing there says you may 

not. 

What do you understand to be the answer? Can 

they proceed on a class basis or not?

background rule --

contract law, which is on page 49. We look to the 

parties' intent and the language to ascertain whether

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I don't think,

authorizes class action or class procedures. They were 

only asked to decide whether it either permitted it or 

precluded it, but is that what the question really was?

take to understand as “authorize,” and the reason -- and 

this is something that the court, in the context of 

Sixth Circuit Dub Herring case, says -- they explain why 

do we use the language "permit"? 

We use it because they are not saying

think, for purposes of whether the contract is giving

“authorized.” 

JUSTICE STEVENS: See, as I understand it, 

in the supplemental agreement, they were asked a 

question about the meaning of the underlying arbitration 

agreement. 

MS. PILLARD: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I can't find what that

whole case, if we could find out what it is.

MS. PILLARD: Thank you.

MS. PILLARD: Thank you. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- apply Rule 3, and 

therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the 

question put in Rule 3. Is that right? 

MS. PILLARD: I think that's correct, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So then we could get the 

question by reading page 7 of the blue brief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is that what's on 

56a of the joint appendix, Construction of the 

Arbitration Clause? That's what Mr. Waxman referred us 

to? 

MS. PILLARD: Yes, that's right -- 56a of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Upon appointment, the 

arbitrator shall determine, as a threshold matter." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What page? 

MS. PILLARD: Are you at -- on the buff --

MS. PILLARD: 56a. Exactly. It's -- I’ve 

bracketed it here. It's under heading 3, Construction 

of the Arbitration Clause. 

"Upon appointment, the arbitrator shall 

determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, 

partial, final award, on the construction of the 

arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration 

clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of 

or against a class." 

So the question put to them is: Is it 

permissible in that phase? And the question put to them 

in the next phase is: Do you actually want to use it in 

the context of this case? 

I did want to address the language that --

that Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: May I -- you know, that 

doesn't help me a lot. What does it mean, if it permits 

it? I mean, I guess you could say, if there's a 

background rule, that whether the parties agree to it 

or not, it's okay. 

Does “permits it” mean “authorizes it”? Does 

-- does that mean whether the parties have agreed to it? 

Is that what “permits” mean there? 

MS. PILLARD: In my view, it means it 

authorizes the arbitrators to choose. We are talking

here about a question of arbitration procedure, as this 

Court correctly characterized it in Bazzle. 

And, typically, what you have is an 

arbitration clause that says you arbitrate any

arbitration provider’s rules; and, therefore, what you 

have is the arbitrators have to select the procedures. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you and I have a --

MS. PILLARD: So they're not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. 

If you and I have a contract -- you’re going 

to sell me a car, and we write up a contract and we 

enter into it, and it provides for arbitration if we 

have a dispute. I also buy a car from Mr. Waxman, and I 

Xerox that contract. It's the exact same contract. 

We have a dispute, and we go to arbitration. 

Can Mr. Waxman come in and say, I got the same contract, 

and I've got the same dispute. Arbitrate with me, too? 

MS. PILLARD: I would say that if 

you have -- well, if they've chosen the arbitrator and 

we have chosen the arbitrator, and it's the same 

arbitrator and the arbitrator wants to put them 

together, under this language, I would say the 

arbitrator does have the authority to do that, yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Now, suppose

I have a contract just with you and -- to arbitrate --

or I -- I have the same contract with Mr. Waxman, but 

it has no arbitration clause. 

And he says, well, the dispute is the same, 

you are arbitrating that, can I come in, too, and get 

bound by your decision? 

MS. PILLARD: I would say no. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would say no. 

And the reason is? 

MS. PILLARD: He doesn't have an arbitration 

agreement with you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not that I -- he 

doesn't have any arbitration agreement with me or that 

it's not the same arbitration agreement? 

MS. PILLARD: He doesn't have an arbitration 

agreement that has the same language, that has -- the 

same or substantially similar language giving the 

arbitrator the authority to use class procedures. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say the intent 

is pertinent when we enter into the contract, okay? And 

there’s good evidence about what you and I meant the 

contract to mean, and there’s not any evidence about 

what Mr. Waxman and I meant the contract to mean. Say 

we’ve got an arbitration clause in both cases. 

Can we arbitrate -- can I be required to

arbitrate Mr. Waxman's contract with -- along with the 

one that you and I have entered into? 

MS. PILLARD: I think your question is 

getting to we have evidence of subjective intent here 

and none there, but the New York law, as is the law in 

many jurisdictions, is an objective intent standard, so 

you look to the language as evidence of intent. 

And on this intent question, I did just want 

to respond to a question that Justice Alito had asked 

Mr. Waxman about Mr. Persky saying there has been no 

agreement that has been reached on this issue, which is 

in the joint appendix, the buff-colored appendix, on page 

77a. 

Now, he clarifies in the next sentence that 

what he -- what he is speaking to there is there has 

been no agreement to bar class arbitrations, right? But 

this is in the context of disputes over whether this 

maritime expert witness testimony is going to be 

admitted. And I think it's very clarifying that two 

pages later, at page 79a of the joint appendix, Mr. 

Persky expressly makes the argument that we believe the 

arbitrators adopted, which is that the arbitration 

clause here contains broad language, and this language 

should be interpreted to permit class arbitrations. And 

at the end of the following paragraph he continues:

"Use of 'any' normally means all and includes class 

arbitration" except -- "unless expressly excluded." So 

he is two pages later making –-

JUSTICE SCALIA: What page -- what page are 

you quoting from? 

MS. PILLARD: I’m -- I’m sorry. I'm quoting 

from the buff-colored joint appendix at page 79a around 

the middle of the page and then in the following 

paragraph. 

So he’s clearly making the argument here, 

and he doesn't make it in the brief that Mr. Waxman 

cited. 

And I think the arbitrators correctly 

rejected the -- the Respondents' framing of that issue 

and actually went further, as they say in their opinion. 

They didn't think that those were adequate grounds to 

rule for the Respondents, for us. They thought they had 

to find an intent in the contract. And then Mr. Persky 

does make that argument, which I think is the winning 

argument, here on page 79a. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask 

you this question? Let's assume that you prevail in 

this case. I -- I would assume that the tankers are now 

going to add to their contract, as many contracts do, a 

provision saying no class action -- you cannot proceed in

a class action. If the arbitration agreement says 

agreed to arbitrate any and all disputes, but you may 

not proceed on behalf of a class, would that preclude 

you from bringing a class action any place? 

MS. PILLARD: I think it would if -- and if 

the -- that might be the exact kind of fact situation 

that if the arbitrators somehow ignored that in reading 

the contract and said, oh, you -- we still have the 

authority to authorize a class, that is the kind of 

thing that under this very deferential standard of 

review might be exceeding their powers. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are many, many 

contracts -- and pick up your average credit card 

agreement -- that will say you may not bring this as a 

class. 

MS. PILLARD: Many such contracts, and 

indeed there are contracts that started doing that back 

in the '90s. I think the case before -- Discover Bank 

is a party that started to put express no-class-action 

terms. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you won't get --

you win this case, but then all the future AnimalFeeds 

lose because they’ll just put in the arbitration 

agreement you can't proceed on class.

was incumbent on them to do that here if this was 

something that they were so concerned about would be 

such a burden on them. And the fact that they did not 

do that, even though class arbitration has been 

something that has been happening actively in California 

for at least a quarter century -- this is one of the 

largest, you know -- with an economy --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Three points, so I will 

take 25 seconds for each point. 

First of all, these contracts in the class 

are not all the same. These are form contracts that are 

drafted by the charterers and their brokers, and they 

involve different clauses, including different 

arbitration clauses.

The second point, the Rule 3, I think, 

fairly does encapsulate the question that the parties 

presented to the Court, which is to construe the 

contract, the question that the Bazzle plurality sent 

back. The AAA amicus brief in this case, which I 

commend to the Court, on behalf of no party says over and 

over and over again, we drafted the rules to provide 

procedures to answer the Bazzle contract question. We 

have no opinion about the answer to the Federal 

statutory question that arises if the answer to the 

-- the meeting-of-the-minds question is no meeting of the 

minds as a matter of contract law. 

And if you find -- and much of the 

discussion this morning has focused on this -- that, 

well, somehow the arbitrators did just decide the 

meeting-of-the-minds question, they didn't decide the 

legal consequences of no meeting of the minds, then just 

as in Keating and as in Bazzle, you will not be able to 

reach the very important, fundamental FAA statutory 

question in this case. And the next generation of 

lawyers will come before you or your successors to get 

it answered. 

Now, as to the contract question, I do want 

to address your point, Justice Breyer, about the 

toolbox. It is true that in answering the contract --

what is -- what did the parties intend? Was there 

really a meeting of the minds here? And, by the way, 

let me just say that when Ms. Pillard says, well, we 

don't know whether the parties in this industry agreed 

or disagreed, all of the -- the evidence was undisputed 

that since the days of Marco Polo the background 

principle in maritime law has been bilateral, rigorously 

bilateral.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
