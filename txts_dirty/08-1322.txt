CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1322, Astrue v. 

Ratliff. 

Mr. Yang. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

EAJA provides that in an appropriate case a 

court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other 

expenses incurred by that party. Every court of appeals 

to have addressed the question, including the court 

below, recognized that the plain meaning of EAJA's text 

directs payment of EAJA fees and other expenses to the 

prevailing party, and not her attorneys. 

Moreover, EAJA's relationship to the fees 

approved under section 406(b) of the Social Security Act 

and this Court's decisions in Jeff D. and Venegas in the 

section 1988 fee context make clear that Congress 

designed EAJA, like other fee-shifting statutes, 

to work within traditional attorney-client fee 

relationships, under which the attorney looks to the 

client for payment.

Congress has also provided that, subject to 

exceptions not relevant here, all funds payable to the 

-- by the United States to an individual who owes a 

valid delinquent debt, Federal debt, shall be reduced by 

administrative offset. 

There is no dispute in this case 

that the prevailing party in this case, Ms. Kills Ree, 

owed a valid delinquent debt to the United States, 

received notice of that debt, had the opportunity to 

repay that debt or enter into a repayment agreement that 

would have avoided offset, failed to do so. Congress 

directed in the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 

that agencies and the Department of Treasury here shall 

offset such payments for delinquent debts. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that the 

Commissioner of Social Security in the past paid EAJA 

awards directly to attorneys and that this is still 

done in cases in which the client has assigned the 

payment to an attorney? 

MR. YANG: That is true in part. Prior to 

2005, the Treasury Department did not yet implement, 

fully implement, the Debt Collection Improvement Act 

with respect to certain payments. Here, these are 

miscellaneous payments. Treasury undertook the very 

large undertaking of computerizing the system to provide

for offsets by tackling things like tax refunds, Federal 

benefits, most contractor payments, large payment 

systems that the government deals with on a day-to-day 

basis, and only in 2005 was able to implement 

miscellaneous offsets. 

Since 2005, the government has been 

offsetting EAJA payments. Now, in some circumstances 

where a debt is owed -- where an EAJA payment is made 

and a court, for instance, orders the government to pay 

the attorney, the government's policy is to check 

whether or not there is a delinquent debt a prevailing 

party owes, and if not, then the government may accept 

the assignment or comply with the --

JUSTICE ALITO: What gives the Federal 

Government the right to override State law on that 

issue? Suppose the situation was that another creditor 

would have priority over the attorney if the money had 

been paid directly to the claimant. 

What gives the government the right, in 

effect, to override that by paying the money directly to 

the attorney, unless the government believes that this 

is payable to the attorney under -- under EAJA? 

MR. YANG: I don't believe so. There's two 

circumstances where -- that we might be talking about. 

The first circumstance might be where a court has

ordered the government to pay the attorney. That 

happens in a number of cases. 

When the government does not have a debt 

which is receivable from the prevailing party, it 

complies with the district court's order. It simply 

does not have a dog in that fight. When we have an 

assignment that the government recognizes, that's true 

in any kind of context where you might have an 

assignment. The government recognizes the assignment. 

If there are third-party creditors who are able to come 

in, they may come in and contest that. They likely 

wouldn't have notice of it. But it's no different than 

any other assignment that the government might accept, 

from a party, of the debt, and that is not an infrequent 

event. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What authority does a court 

have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney? 

MR. YANG: Well, it certainly doesn't lie in 

EAJA. Courts have recognized that they retain equitable 

authority to recognize a constructive trust or an 

equitable lien to enforce an agreement between the 

attorney and client that the client will pay over to an 

attorney funds received pursuant to an award such as 

EAJA. And in that context, although courts haven't been 

particularly clear in their reasoning -- they have cited

to equity -- the courts have provided that when, for 

instance, an attorney represents a client pro bono or 

represents a prisoner pro bono, that the court will see 

to it that the payment actually received doesn't 

ultimately land in the hands of the client and enforces 

the understanding, either expressed or implicit, between 

the attorney and client that the funds that the client 

receives will go to the attorney. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen in the 

case -- in case it is a prisoner who is this 

prevailing party? Would the -- would the attorney fee 

be paid to the prisoner? And if not, to whom would it 

be paid? 

MR. YANG: The attorney fee under EAJA is 

payable to the prevailing party, which would be the 

prisoner. Now, attorneys would likely come in, the 

attorneys for the prisoner, and ask the court to 

exercise its equitable authority to recognize a 

constructive trust over the fees that are actually paid 

to the party and prevent the party from keeping that 

money. But a prisoner is ultimately no different than 

any other prevailing party under EAJA. It is the 

prevailing party to whom Congress has directed the court 

shall award fees and other expenses.

court's broad equitable authority trump what you say is 

what the statute says? 

MR. YANG: They are not trumping it, Your 

Honor. The -- there's two things going on when a court 

recognizes an equitable trust. First, it has to 

necessarily recognize the right of the prevailing party 

to the payment. The prevailing party obtains the payment, 

and only once the prevailing party actually has title to 

the thing does equitable trust or a constructive trust 

attach. So it's recognizing in the EAJA context that 

the prevailing party is the one who is entitled to the 

fee, but then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you actually have 

to transfer it or --

MR. YANG: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the statute 

says pay the prevailing party. 

MR. YANG: Correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you’re saying 

the court can say: No, pay the lawyer. 

MR. YANG: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In certain --

MR. YANG: In order to recognize the 

agreement between the party and the attorney.

between the party and the attorney? The Equal Access to 

Justice Act provides that fees will be paid to the 

prevailing party. Where does the prevailing party have 

a contract with the attorney to turn the fees over? 

MR. YANG: I'm sorry. I didn’t --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that pursuant --

maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you said that 

there is a contract between the prevailing party and the 

attorney. And where is -- how does that contract come 

about if it's simply a case that the lawyer is 

representing pro bono a plaintiff? 

MR. YANG: Well, as this Court recognized in 

Venegas in the section 1988 context, it's commonplace 

either for there to be an expressed or an implied 

agreement to pay over any statutory award that the 

prevailing party may receive to the attorney. And I 

think, in the absence of any indication otherwise, courts 

are well positioned to simply say, you know, if they 

haven't agreed otherwise, the normal practice would be 

for a prevailing party, if they were to receive 

something under a statutory fee-shifting provision like 

section 1988 or like EAJA, to agree to pay it to the 

attorney. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't the 

government setoff depend upon who owns the money under

State law? I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the 

Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership. 

And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable 

ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does 

the government have to do the setoff? 

MR. YANG: Well, that might be true if we 

were relying on a common law offset. But in this 

context, Congress has directed that all Federal 

payments, unless there is an exception -- and there is 

no exception in this case -- are to be offset before 

payment, any payment, to the debtor. So in this case, 

Congress has effectively established a priority scheme 

whereby when a debtor owes a delinquent valid debt to 

the United States and the United States owes an 

offsetting obligation to that individual, Congress has 

provided that no Federal funds shall be paid to the 

individual and instead that the debt -- the government's 

debt shall be offset against the debt that the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the client 

is bankrupt? What happens then? 

MR. YANG: The same rule would apply. No 

Federal payment would -- well -- I believe that the same 

rule would apply. I've not carefully studied the 

bankruptcy provisions, and I hate to venture into a very 

complicated area to give you something definitive. But

my belief is that, based on the very clear text of 

section 3716 of Title 31, which was amended by the Debt 

Collection Improvement Act, that no payment shall be --

even in bankruptcy, the payment goes to the -- has 

to go to the debtor first, and then it goes to the estate 

-- that no payment shall be made from the Treasury and 

instead an administrative offset shall be undertaken to 

collect the government's debt. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a way for the 

lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case 

against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA 

fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent 

you and I can get paid for this. But the client says: 

There are a lot of debts I owe the government. 

Now, is there any way they can work it out 

so he can get the representation? 

MR. YANG: Well, sure. There’s --

JUSTICE BREYER: What? 

MR. YANG: As we indicated in our brief, 

there's several things that can be done. First, the 

attorney can determine whether there is in fact a debt 

which is eligible for offset, and that can be done by 

asking the Treasury with a valid Privacy Act waiver from 

the client. If that is the case, the client retains the 

right, which Congress expressly codified in section

3716, the right to enter into a repayment agreement. If 

that is done, there will be no offset, and the repayment 

agreement is largely governed by the Federal claims 

collections standards, which are codified at 31 C.F.R. 900 

to 904, and those -- those provisions provide in section 

901.8, for instance, that installments shall -- should 

bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 

the debtor's ability to pay. And in some instances, the 

government agency is able to compromise that debt if the 

debtor is unable to repay it within a reasonable amount of 

time. The agency should consider the age, health, 

present and potential income, as well as assets of the 

debtor, in order to determine the --

JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the lawyer 

and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer 

says: Here, I can get some money for this client and 

that will help everybody, but I want to be paid. So I 

want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment 

schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and 

I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to 

give it to the government. And then they can sign a 

piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets 

to keep the money. 

MR. YANG: That -- that's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And has that ever happened?

MR. YANG: I don't know that that's happened 

in this offset context. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But it could now. Now 

people would know about, and they could do it. 

MR. YANG: It could well happen, and in 

fact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what’s -- what’s the 

authority for the government to enter into the agreement? 

MR. YANG: The authority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if the statute 

says there has to be an offset, that's it. 

MR. YANG: Well, the statute also provides, 

under section 3711, for the Department of Justice and the 

Department of Treasury to establish guidelines for 

agencies. They have done so in Parts 901 to -- or 900 

to 904 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do the guidelines 

reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical? 

MR. YANG: Well, the statute actually 

reflects Justice Breyer's hypothetical, because at 

section 3716 -- this is at page 9a of the government's 

brief’s appendix -- the head of the agency, prior to 

implementing an administrative offset must advise --

this is on a4 -- the debtor of the opportunity to make a 

written agreement with the head of the agency to repay

the amount of the claim. That reflects the practice in 

the Federal claims collections standards of agreeing to 

repayment of such claims. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

would motivate the government to agree to give to a 

lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government, 

thinks it's entitled to? I mean, it's one thing to work 

a repayment plan. That starts on the proposition that 

the individual can only each week or month or whatever 

give a certain amount of money over. But what --

MR. YANG: Well, I think the hypothetical was 

premised at the beginning of the lawsuit rather than at 

the end. If -- if the case were at the end and the 

government were ordered to pay EAJA fees, the offset 

would be automatic. We would not agree at that point to 

split the -- the offset with -- with the attorney. But 

in the beginning of the lawsuit, when the attorney is 

undertaking representation of the client, the attorney 

is able to do precisely what Congress intended, which 

was to have debtors come to the United States and 

take -- to avail themselves of the opportunity to repay 

their debts to avoid an offset. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's a 

fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the 

government's position, to get fees, is substantially

unjustified. And so the government lawyer is going to 

sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position 

that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point 

pay the fees to you, not to the client. 

MR. YANG: Well, not at all. The 

government's interest in an installment plan is not 

motivated by EAJA. The government’s interest is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the 

attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we 

were talking about, the attorney's interest is. He 

thinks the government is going to take a substantially 

unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that 

case that he gets paid. 

MR. YANG: This is a separate question, 

which is whether there is really any deterrent or how 

large the deterrent effect would be having the specter 

of a fee offset. And as we explained in our brief, this 

Court in Underwood explained that, because EAJA awards 

are not given to every prevailing party and are only 

given to parties where the government's position is not 

substantially justified, it is -- one cannot reliably 

determine in advance whether the government's position 

is going to be so unreasonable that you’re going to get 

an award of fees. 

And that -- that suggests that any deterrent

effect of having the possibility of an offsetting -- an 

offset for the client's debt is small. And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's going 

to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's --

and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is 

an agreement already in effect. The government says, 

well, if we’re -- you know, if we’re liable for EAJA 

fees, this is how we are going to handle it. 

MR. YANG: I may have misspoken --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the 

first piece of -- that would be the first piece of 

evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get 

EAJA fees. The government thought they might even take 

a position that qualified. 

MR. YANG: Let me back up. I may have 

misspoken. What I intended to convey is that at the 

beginning of the case when an attorney is deciding 

whether to represent a client, the case has not been 

litigated, we don't know whether the government's 

position is going to be found to be substantially 

unjustified or not, the attorney -- if the attorney 

checks and wants to determine whether the client has 

a -- a debt owed to the government that would be subject 

to offset, the attorney can go to the government and say: 

Let's enter into a repayment plan so that my debtor gets

on the government's good graces and no longer is subject to 

have a tax -- a tax return, for instance, offset or any 

other payment that the government may owe to that 

debtor in the future, including EAJA. But it's not 

because of the EAJA payment that you would enter into 

the agreement. The government --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but say he goes 

in to the government and says, look, I’m about to sue 

you, and I’d like to sit down and negotiate a nice 

agreement about the repayment. 

MR. YANG: Well, I guess the attorney may 

say, I'm about to sue you, but the government certainly 

is not motivated because of the lawsuit. The 

government -- whether an attorney is going to sue the 

government or not, the question is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers 

are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: 

I'm going to sue you. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. YANG: Well, I guess that certainly gets 

our attention. But the reason that the government would 

enter into a repayment agreement is because that is an 

opportunity for the government to collect a debt that is 

delinquent, valid, and outstanding. 

And what Congress intended to do in the Debt

Collection Improvement Act was not to have additional 

Federal funds be paid to debtors who have been given 

multiple warnings of the debt and are essentially, you 

know --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with your 

argument is this pot of money is actually not going 

to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your 

argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing 

party and is entitled to get the award. But the money 

is not being paid to the debtor. It's for the benefit 

of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted 

done. 

MR. YANG: Well, actually, either --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what the --

I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer 

to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when 

they have to not only do the work in the case, but now 

have to do the work for the government in getting their 

client to negotiate an agreement with the government on 

something that's completely unrelated to the claim. 

MR. YANG: I guess a --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- it's sort of --

MR. YANG: There’s a few answers --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- illogical. 

MR. YANG: There’s a few answers to that.

EAJA applies not only in the Social Security context; it 

applies in all civil actions in which -- not sounding in 

tort, in which there’s not another specific fee 

provision, brought -- brought by or against the United 

States. 

Congress intended -- and this is in the 

statutory findings which precede EAJA in section -- I 

believe it's 202 of the Act; it is -- to diminish the 

financial deterrent on individuals, businesses, and 

organizations caused by the expense of providing -- of 

litigating a case. This is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like 

you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay 

the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer. It would 

make sense if the client has paid the lawyer and then 

there is reimbursement under EAJA that what -- what 

you're describing would make sense in that situation. 

But in most of these situations, the client doesn't have 

the wherewithal to pay the attorney upfront, of course. 

MR. YANG: That may be true in the Social 

Security context, but there are many instances in 

which -- this is the -- this is the normal way that, 

you know, clients and -- and -- and their -- their 

attorneys work out fee arrangements. Sometimes clients 

will pay their attorney in advance; sometimes they will

pay as the litigation goes forward. And by the time you 

have the EAJA award the client will have paid all or 

part -- sometimes none -- but all or part of the -- of 

the fee award. 

JUSTICE GINSBURGH: Is it --

MR. YANG: Congress directed -- the language 

is very clear: Courts shall award to the prevailing party 

fees and expenses --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that mean --

MR. YANG: -- incurred by the party. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The award goes to the 

prevailing party. So, therefore, the attorney's fee is 

income to the client --

MR. YANG: I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is taxable income 

to the client? 

MR. YANG: This is -- the answer to that is 

complicated and, generally, yes. The IRS is of the view 

that attorney fee awards to prevailing parties, whether 

it's EAJA or otherwise, are deemed to be taxable income 

to the client. 

Now, the clients, of course, will have an 

offsetting deduction for expenses incurred by -- in --

in the course of producing or collecting income, and 

that was recognized by this Court's opinion in Banks.

That deduction is, of course, subject to certain limits. 

It has to be in excess of 2 percent of the adjusted 

gross income and subject to the alternative minimum tax, 

which wouldn't apply to Social Security claims. 

But the general answer is yes, it is income 

when the prevailing party receives a fee. There is an 

offsetting deduction. However, there's a -- some 

uncertainty with whether some fee awards when the 

underlying benefit obtained is not taxable, whether 

that -- the IRS will treat such payments to -- the fee 

awards, as --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Like pain and suffering, 

but that's not --

MR. YANG: Yes, so, but also certain 

Federal benefits, including Social Security benefits, 

have a very complicated tax relationship. Social 

Security benefits are taxable in part. It depends on 

the size and the amount of other income. 

So, the answer is actually quite complicated 

whether fees are taxable under EAJA in the Social 

Security context. But the general rule is, yes, fee 

awards to a prevailing party are income and subject 

to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then, in turn, income 

to the attorney when -- if the client --

MR. YANG: Correct. Just as, you know, when 

I'm -- you know, I am paid my salary and taxed on it, 

and then when I pay for services, the person to whom I 

pay also has income, and they are taxed as well. This is 

not an unusual situation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the 

underlying assumption -- and some of the question would 

have been put to you by the court -- is that the 

government has somehow benefited because the money is 

created to offset the debt. It really isn't. It 

would -- this would be true if an attorney were suing 

a third party and creating a fund, and the government 

said, ah, there's the money. In this case, it's just 

being paid from one account to the other. The 

government would be better off if there were no suit 

at all. 

MR. YANG: That's correct. If the 

government never had an EAJA award, it at least would 

be less of a debt that it could collect. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just paying itself 

from one account to the other. 

MR. YANG: That's correct. The government 

is -- ultimately zeroes out here. The person that gets 

the benefit is the prevailing party, because the 

prevailing party has eliminated a debt to the United

States by having that offset by the EAJA award. So the 

prevailing party obtains the benefit, which is precisely 

what Congress intended here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The government 

zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a 

legal position in court against a small business that 

was substantially unjustified. 

MR. YANG: And it has paid its EAJA award by 

offsetting that award against the debt that the business 

owed to the United States. The government is -- at the 

end of the day, the balance sheets of the government 

have not changed. And with -- from the perspective of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think the 

idea -- well --

MR. YANG: From the perspective of the 

prevailing party as well. The prevailing party has an 

obligation to the attorney. Those are the attorney's 

fees incurred which have not yet been paid. The 

prevailing party also has an obligation to the 

government in the -- in the amount of a debt. It has 

income that comes in through the -- through the fee 

award, and whether that goes to offset the debt to the 

government or offset the -- for use to pay the attorney, 

the prevailing party ultimately gets the benefit of that 

fee award. And the government has paid the EAJA award

as required by statute. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how 

much the -- the Treasury typically collects in a year 

under these EAJA offsets? Does it put a dent in the 

Federal deficit? 

MR. YANG: We don't, and the reason we don't 

is because each agency that -- which is the subject of 

an EAJA order submits to Treasury a payment request 

based on that order, and they check “miscellaneous 

payment.” That agency doesn't know whether that payment 

is offset. Treasury receives that -- that request of 

payment and sees that it's a miscellaneous payment, 

checks it against a debt, and may offset. But Treasury 

doesn't know that the miscellaneous payment was an EAJA 

award. 

So we don't have any statistics that we can 

point to, to say how often this -- this occurs. I can 

say that the financial management service executes one 

-- over one billion payments per year, and that offsets 

of those payments account for $4.8 billion. So about 

two-tenths of 1 percent of payments from the Federal 

Government result in offsets. 

I’d like to reserve the balance of my 

time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. LEACH

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. LEACH: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 

I’d like to discuss with you this 

morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the 

government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal 

services she performed, that Congress invited her to 

perform, to show that the government's position was 

legally erroneous and was not even substantially 

justified. 

And my first point arises from your 

question, Justice Scalia. You asked whether State law 

determines who has the priorities here in terms of 

offset, if I understood. And the answer is that 

actually Federal law determines that, specifically the 

Debt Collection Improvement Act and regulations. The 

Act requires mutuality of a debt between the debtor and 

the government before the government can offset. And the 

regulations, which I’ll quote in just an instant, 

require that before offset can occur, the government must 

look to who has the beneficial interest in the payment. 

In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it. 

Specifically, 31 C.F.R. 285.5(b), which is

quoted at page 45 of the red brief, defines, quote, 

"offset," close quote, as withholding funds to satisfy 

a debt owed by a payee. And "payee" -- and this is 

critical -- is defined as the same -- in the same 

regulation, also quoted at page 45 of our reply brief, 

as "the person entitled" -- as the person entitled to 

the benefit of all or part of a payment. In other 

words, not the legal title holder if there is a 

difference, but the person with the beneficial interest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The prevailing party 

gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of 

the debt she owed to the government. That's a real 

benefit. 

MR. LEACH: Well, Your Honor, I think that's 

a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's 

not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who --

because the question is who has the beneficial interest 

in the fee payment? And when we look to that question, 

because that's what's at issue here, is the fee payment. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this argument 

circular? The -- the issue is who is -- to whom is this 

payment to be made. And if it's to be made to the --

the claimant, then it's not for the beneficial interest 

of the -- of the attorney. 

MR. LEACH: Two responses, if I could,

Justice Alito: First, the word "payment" gets thrown 

around a lot in the briefs. It can mean two separate 

things. It can mean who receives the payment first; in 

other words, who is the check mailed to; or it can mean 

who the check is ultimately entitled to -- who is 

entitled to benefit from it. 

And the government's -- my second point is 

the government's reply brief at page 10 to 12 concedes 

that, but for the government's alleged right to offset, 

the attorney does indeed have the beneficial interest in 

the attorney's fee. And the government gives three 

reasons, and only three reasons, why its alleged right 

to offset trumps the attorney's beneficial interest. 

The first reason the government gives is the 

government says that the -- the constructive trust, which 

the government acknowledges exists in the -- in -- in 

favor of the attorney with respect to the fee payment, 

does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the 

client. And that's true, but that's not the point. 

The point is the attorney had the 

beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the 

moment the fee reached the client, if it's payable to 

the client in the sense of "sent to." The beneficial 

interest had to precede that in order for a constructive 

trust to arise.

The government's second argument --

JUSTICE BREYER: On the first one, imagine 

that the -- a trust owes some money to the government. 

Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers. 

Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay? Separate 

debt? One. That money goes to the trust. Right? 

MR. LEACH: If -- I'm not --

JUSTICE BREYER: The trust first owes -- the 

trust owes $1,000 to the government. The trust then 

independently recovers $500 from the government on a 

different matter. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The government couldn't 

offset that? 

MR. LEACH: Of course it could. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Of course it could. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the trust is not a 

person entitled to the benefit of the payment. 

MR. LEACH: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: The beneficiaries of the 

trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment. 

MR. LEACH: If I understood your 

hypothetical, if the trust is entitled to $500, then the 

trust I think would be entitled to the benefit of the

payment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not entitled to the 

benefit of the $500. The trust holds money for the 

benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. So --

MR. LEACH: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- it can’t -- you agree 

that that couldn't be? 

MR. LEACH: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and once you agree 

that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on 

your first argument. I'm not sure. 

MR. LEACH: Okay. I don't think so, because 

if we are talking about payments to persons, you know, 

if a person -- if a person owes a debt of $10,000, 

receives $500 on the debt, the person receives the 

benefit of that $500. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, similarly, the -- the 

guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money 

that he has just gotten from the government, including 

the attorney's fees. It happens that he can't keep 

those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the 

$500. He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, 

just as the trust eventually has to give the $500 to the 

beneficiary. So I'm simply saying -- drawing a

parallel, which -- go on to the next issue. 

MR. LEACH: All right, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me -- can 

trusts -- can trusts recover EAJA fees? 

MR. LEACH: I don't know, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I don't either. 

I’m looking at the definition. It doesn't say "trust." 

It says a lot of other things, like corporation, 

association, unit of government. I just don't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I’m having trouble with 

this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from 

State to State. But as a general matter, under State 

law, let's say that the employee makes a contingency fee 

arrangement with a lawyer to sue the employer and wins 

$50,000. It's a one-third contingent fee. The -- the 

employee already owes the employer $40,000. It would 

seem to me under the general principle of offset that 

the employer has to only pay $10,000, and the attorney 

is not going to get his full fee. 

MR. LEACH: That’s --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's just -- that's 

just the law of offsets. 

MR. LEACH: That's true. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because again, it's the 

same party. If they created money by suing some third

person, then that's different. 

MR. LEACH: I think that's true. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so I -- it 

seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for 

is just contrary to the standard law of offsets. 

MR. LEACH: Well, Your Honor, with what I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's even worse 

because the Federal statute says that there shall be 

this offset first as a matter of priority. 

MR. LEACH: Actually, Your Honor, the 

Federal statute provides for offset in accordance with 

regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department. 

And those Treasury Department regulations were what I 

quoted right at the beginning of my argument. We have 

to look at who is entitled to the benefit of the 

payment, not the benefit in a generalized sense of the 

lawsuit. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in the generalized 

sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described 

to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but 

he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the 

employer who is entitled to an offset. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. And the difference, Your 

Honor, is that in your hypothetical we’re talking about 

one sum of money that’s recovered in the name of the

claimant. In this situation, we’re talking about a 

statutory fee award, which is created only based on the 

work of the attorney and which is labeled an attorney's 

fee and separate from the benefit --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is it different? 

Look. This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do 

With EAJA. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It has to do with when the 

government's allowed to offset some money. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And it's allowed to offset 

some money when the money is money that it would otherwise 

give to a payee. All right? 

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And then you've defined 

"payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in 

that money. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that the client 

here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether 

he's a person or whether he's a trust. That was my 

point. 

MR. LEACH: I understand, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

MR. LEACH: And my point about the statute 

is simply that the statute is subject to the regulation 

which looks to who's entitled to benefit. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, let's take the 

regulation: "A person who is entitled to the benefit of 

all or part of the payment." Ultimately, isn't it the 

plaintiff who has recovered that is entitled to the 

benefit, because this money is given to him in order 

that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to 

the lawyer? 

I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the 

lawyer and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no? 

MR. LEACH: Not so, Your Honor, in Social 

Security cases, which this is, and in Veterans cases, 

which together account for more than 90 percent of all 

EAJA awards. In Social Security cases, 42 U.S.C. 

406(b)(2), set out in our appendix, makes it a Federal 

crime for any lawyer to charge, receive, demand, or 

collect a fee payment directly from a client, other than 

under past -- the 46 U.S.C. 406 past-due benefits, 25 

percent, or EAJA. 

And this is a critical difference. In the 

non-EAJA, in the non-Social Security, non-Veterans 

contexts, you know, about 10 percent of cases, you've got 

-- conceivably, you've got, often, clients paying lawyers

on a traditional pay-as-you-go basis. But in a Social 

Security case or a Veterans case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And in those cases, you 

agree the offset can be made? 

MR. LEACH: Absolutely. Absolutely. 

The difference here in all these Social 

Security and Veterans cases is that the attorney is 

barred by law from receiving money on a 

pay-as-you-go basis. So the attorney has never been 

paid. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In exchange for getting 

25 percent of the recovery? 

MR. LEACH: No. Actually, Your Honor, in 

exchange for showing in Federal court, if I understand 

your question. I hope I do. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: My understanding is that 

the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security 

benefits gained for the client is 25 percent of the 

recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer. 

MR. LEACH: That's true. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that, just as a 

background in this case, did Ms. Ratliff get that 

25 percent? 

MR. LEACH: No, Your Honor. There was no 

25 percent fee here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was because it 

was too small to be bothered with? What was the reason? 

MR. LEACH: She did not apply for a 

25 percent fee. It would have been quite small, had she 

received it. It would have been much smaller than the 

EAJA fee. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she could keep only 

one from the --

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: She could keep only the 

larger of the two. 

MR. LEACH: Had she received the EAJA fee, 

she could have kept it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the difficulties 

with your position is that Congress did exempt a number 

of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't 

exempt Equal Access to Justice fees. 

MR. LEACH: Yes. And the -- there are two 

points there, Your Honor. I mean, EAJA fees -- I'm not 

claiming all EAJA fees are exempt. As I just said --

spoke with you, Justice Scalia, if the -- in a non-Social 

Security, non-Veterans case where the client has paid 

the attorney and then an EAJA fee comes down, that’s 

clearly subject to offset. You have to look to that 

regulation and who is entitled to the benefit of the fee

payment. 

And the reason that the Debt Collection 

Improvement Act doesn't address this in 1996 is that in 

1996, the government had never taken the position that 

attorney fees were subject to offset in Social Security 

or Veterans cases. And in fact, in 1996, there were 

three court of appeals decisions on the question of 

whether a creditor could offset a statutory fee award: 

Plant -- these are all of our briefs -- Plant, Fourth 

Circuit, 1979; Duncan -- I'm sorry, Plant is Fifth 

Circuit, 1979; Duncan, Fourth Circuit, 1989; Curtis, 

Eighth Circuit, 1993. 

All those cases said that the creditor may 

not offset a statutory fee award against the creditor's 

debt because the fee is for the attorney. That’s why 

Congress couldn't have conceivably thought to address it 

in 1996. 

And some of the questions take me toward the 

point that you asked about before, Justice Roberts --

Chief Justice Roberts. And you suggested, or you said, 

that EAJA says: Pay to the prevailing party. If I heard 

you correctly. In fact, Your Honor, the language of the 

statute is, quote, "award to the prevailing party... 

fees and other expenses...incurred by that party." 

And the two parts that we haven't really

addressed yet are that what is awarded is attorney's 

fees. And this "incurred by" language -- with respect to 

that attorney's fee language, "attorney's fees" has a 

traditional meaning. It's a meaning this Court has 

recognized in all those cases bullet-pointed at pages 19 

to 21 of our briefs. It's a fee earned by and paid to 

an attorney. And in Gisbrecht v. Barnhart in 2002, this 

Court specifically described the real parties in 

interest in attorney's fees litigation as the attorneys, 

recognizing the reality that attorney fees go to 

attorneys. 

In addition, the language "incurred by that 

party" -- what does it mean here? Well, outside of EAJA, 

it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- money the 

client takes out and pays to the attorney. We know in 

Social Security cases and Veterans cases it can't mean 

that, because that's illegal. That's a Federal crime if 

the attorney does it. 

So what does it mean? Well, the government 

concedes at page 8 of its reply brief that that language 

"incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the 

client's implied or express obligation to pay the 

attorney the fee received. So this is where the 

government's argument is circular, I think, 

Justice Alito, in the sense that that "incurred by"

language only is satisfied and an EAJA award only may be 

made where the client has the express or implied 

obligation to pay the attorney. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say that in 

Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept 

pay-as-you-go? Is --

MR. LEACH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't mean that 

there is not either an express or an implied contract 

between the attorney and the Social Security recipient. 

MR. LEACH: I agree. That's what I was 

trying to say. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if there is that 

implied contract, then it is an obligation of the 

recipient. 

MR. LEACH: Yes, that's what I was trying to 

say, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see how that 

leads you where you want to go. Then the payment given 

to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by --

by paying off an obligation that the Social Security 

recipient has. 

MR. LEACH: Yes, but that obligation exists 

only to the extent of the EAJA fee. It's not a separate 

obligation. The attorney can't turn around and go

against the client. I mean, 406(b)(2) prohibits the 

attorney going against the client for any fee other than 

the 406(b) fee, which is separate, if there is a 406(b) 

fee, or the EAJA fee. And when --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it --

MR. LEACH: We have been talking 

-- I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I'm clarifying, 

is it your position -- and this is something I want to 

ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is 

awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even 

in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute 

you view them as blocked from --

MR. LEACH: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from seeking anything 

other than the EAJA fee or the 406 fee? 

MR. LEACH: Yes, that's what 406(b)(2) says, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that once the offset 

happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had 

other money, the attorney would be blocked from going 

after it? 

MR. LEACH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because by the terms of 

the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?

MR. LEACH: They can only seek what? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Either the EAJA fee or 

the 406 fee. 

MR. LEACH: Yes, and we have been talking as 

if EAJA fees and 406(b) fees are sort of contemporaneous 

in every case. In fact, the data cited at page 14 of the 

red brief is that 46 percent of Federal court Social 

Security cases result in a remand. Only 5 percent result 

in an award of benefits. So there are going to be far more 

EAJA fees in Federal court than there ever are 406(b) fees. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you calculate the fee 

under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending 

on the case? Do you ever calculate it under both so that 

you get some under each? 

MR. LEACH: Yes, Your Honor. And that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- you calculate 

it under both so you get some under each? 

MR. LEACH: No, section 3 says how this 

works, of the -- of EAJA 1985. It says if there are two 

fees, the attorney keeps the larger fee --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

MR. LEACH: -- and sends the smaller 

to the client and vice versa. 

And that’s the situation, for example, 

where you could have an offset of an EAJA fee in a

Social Security case. Let's say there is a 406(b) fee 

that's $6,000. Let's say there is an EAJA fee that is 

$4,000. Under section 3, that -- the attorney doesn't 

keep that $4,000. That $4,000 winds up in the client's 

pocket. The government can offset that. That's --

that's what integrates all this discussion we’ve been 

having about EAJA fees not being exempt. We have to 

look to the beneficial interest. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In what percent of the 

Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is 

there an EAJA fee? 

MR. LEACH: Forty-six percent. No, that's not 

right. It's about 42 percent. And I get that from 

combining two numbers. There are 5,481 EAJA awards per 

year. That's red brief page 4. And there are about 

13,000 Social Security civil cases per year. That's 

green brief page 22. Fifty-four -- 13,000 divided by 

5,481 is 42 percent. 

And this bring me to the point the 

government was making in suggesting that an attorney at 

the beginning of a case could never know whether or 

not there -- there is going to be an EAJA fee, because, 

you know, you can't know at the beginning, they argue, 

what position the government will take, whether or not 

the government's position is substantially justified or

not. 

Well -- and the government cites 

Pierce/Underwood from 1988 from this Court, in which 

this Court said exactly that -- Pierce v. Underwood. 

Pierce v. Underwood is outside the Social 

Security context, outside the Veterans context, so 

Pierce v. Underwood is in this less than 10 percent 

category of cases under EAJA which are not Social 

Security or Veterans. 

In a Social Security case or a Veterans 

case, the attorney has the record before proceeding into 

court, before deciding whether to proceed into court. 

And the attorney can look at that record, read it, and 

have a pretty good idea of whether or not the government 

position might be substantially justified or not. 

I don't ask you to take my word for any of 

this. Let me tell you what the data shows. 

The data, Justice Ginsburg -- this is where 

the 42 percent of Federal Social Security cases result 

in an EAJA award. If it's 42 percent, that's quite a 

high number of cases in which the government's position 

is found substantially -- not substantially justified as 

well as legally erroneous. 

In Veterans cases, it's even worse. The 

Court of Veterans Appeal Web site -- this the number of

cases -- all together -- number of dispositions per year 

and the number of EAJA awards. And for 2008 and 2009, if 

you add up the numbers, out of all the Veterans 

disability cases filed, 70 percent, 7-0, result in an 

EAJA award. So there’s quite a large number of cases 

in which -- in -- in a Veterans context or Social 

Security context where the government's position is 

found not to be --

MR. LEACH: No. The government says -- has 

said that in its reply brief.

point you asked, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, skip my points. 

They’re too complicated. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LEACH: Well -- but during -- during 

Mr. Yang's argument, you asked about this -- this 

repayment agreement. The concept of a repayment 

agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking 

about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two 

reasons: Number one, SSI benefits by statute are 

limited to, quote, "aged, blind, and disabled people who 

have little or no money." 

So, I don't know where the disabled or blind 

or aged person is going to get the money to enter into

any repayment agreement. 

But the second reason it's fanciful is that 

the attorney only has 60 days from final agency action 

to file the case in Federal court. And, so, there is 

60 days to, you know, meet with the client and try to 

get an answer out of the government. I've never tried 

to do this -- I don't know anyone who has -- but I don't 

think you’re going to get much of an answer at 60 days 

asking the government to do this so the attorney can 

then recover a fee. 

Finally, there’s -- there’s a critical 

point here that I need to get to, which is that I think 

Congress has told us exactly what this language means. 

Here's why. 

In 1985, Congress enacts EAJA and uses this 

section 3 language which talks about who gets the fee, 

large or smaller fee. Okay. In 1992, Congress extends 

EAJA to Veterans claims. And when it does that, in 38 

U.S.C. 5904, Congress uses the same language, down to 

the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in 

1985. 

During this entire period -- and here's why 

that's important -- during that entire period from 1985 

to 1992, and indeed continuing many years after that, 

but for purposes here, 1992, the administration is every

time paying the attorney’s fee to the attorney under 

EAJA. And so when Congress in 1992 uses the same 

language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for 

Social Security EAJA claims 7 years earlier, 

Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the 

settled administrative construction --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the -- I 

thought the government said they only did that when --

when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney. 

MR. LEACH: Mr. Yang was talking about from 

2006 on. From 1990 -- from 1985 to 2006, every EAJA fee 

went to the attorney. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no 

offset in the picture because the government wasn't 

offsetting. 

MR. LEACH: Two responses, Your Honor: The 

offset came into the picture in 1996, but the government 

says it wasn't practical to 2005. Even if you grant them 

that point, the agency had to make -- totally apart from 

offset, the agency had to decide who these fees should 

be paid to under section 3 -- I mean under EAJA. 

The government had to say, who does this 

statute say fees should be paid to? Now, had the 

government said, well, fees go to the client, says, you 

know, award to the prevailing party, fees and other

expenses, we are going to pay attorney's fees to 

clients, which had never happened. But had the 

government said that -- that's not what they said. 

They look at the statute. They look at the 

fact that the attorney earned the fees, and they say we 

are going to pay these fees to the attorney. So that's 

what’s going on at the time Congress in 1992 copies its 

1985 language --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress has provided 

in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, 406, 

that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the 

attorney. Here it used different language; it said pay 

the prevailing party. 

MR. LEACH: Just two points, 

Justice Ginsburg: Number one, we get back to this 

question about does payment mean who receives the check 

or who is entitled to benefit from it? Number two, EAJA 

doesn't say pay to the party. EAJA doesn't use the 

phrase “payment”; 406 says payment to the attorney. EAJA 

doesn't say that, "payment," at all. The only place you 

find "pay" in EAJA is where it says the government 

cannot be required to pay a filing fee. 

There is this, shall award to a prevailing 

party fees and other expenses, and (d)(2)(A) defines 

“fees” to include quote, "attorney fees," close quote.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

MR. LEACH: Thank you. And -- and so 

“payment” isn't even in EAJA.

MR. LEACH: Thank you very much, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Yang, you have 

4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. YANG: I believe I heard counsel concede 

that EAJA fees outside of the Social Security context 

are payable to the prevailing party and therefore 

subject to offset. That's true. EAJA does not draw a 

distinction between Social Security fees and other types 

of fees. Section 2412 uses the same language, court 

shall award to the prevailing party fees and other 

expenses. I believe that disposes of this case. 

Second, counsel relies on a definition of 

“representative payee” in the offset regulations. That's 

addressed at reply -- our reply, page 2, footnote 1. A 

representative payee -- as the Federal Register provisions 

that relate to this make clear, it refers to things like 

attorneys, it refers to things like parents, where the 

beneficial interest is not that of the attorney or the

parent but the client and the child. 

It would be entirely unworkable if any time 

that a payee owes some debt that a third party might 

claim an interest to, that the government would have to 

find out the payee's finances and obligations in order 

to execute an offset. It's simply not the way the 

offset program was designed, and it's not reflected in 

the regulation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is your 

adversary correct that under 406(b) --

MR. YANG: (2). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- (b)(2), that if these 

attorneys -- if any attorney attempts to collect from 

a Social Security or Veterans client any fees outside 

of those granted --

MR. YANG: No. Section 206(b) of the EAJA, 

which is reproduced on 4a of our appendix, states that 

section 206(b)(2), the provision you were talking about, 

shall not apply with respect to any such award, meaning 

any award under EAJA, so long as where the attorney 

receives fees, the smaller fee is returned. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you -- do 

you dispute your friend's statement that 42 percent of 

the time in Social Security cases the government's 

position is unjustified, and 70 percent of the time in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- 70 percent of the time 

the government's position is substantially unjustified? 

MR. YANG: In cases -- in the VA context, the 

number is not quite that large, but there’s a substantial 

number of cases at the court of appeals --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What number would 

you accept? 

MR. YANG: It was, I believe, in the order of 

either 50 or maybe slightly more than 50 percent. It 

might be 60. But the number is substantial that you get 

a reversal, and in almost all of those cases, EAJA --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's really 

startling, isn't it? In litigating with veterans, the 

government more often than not takes a position that is 

substantially unjustified? 

MR. YANG: It is an unfortunate number, Your 

Honor. And it is -- it's accurate.

With respect to the question of in the 

Social Security context, EAJA awards occur not only --

excuse me, 406(b) awards under the Social Security 

Administration do not apply in only the 5 percent of the 

cases that get judgment entered. 406(b) provides that 

any time a judgment that leads to an award of benefits 

is made, then 406(b) fees are awarded. 

So even if in cases that were remanded to 

the Social Security Administration, as in this case, you 

could get 406(b) fees. It’s just a question of the 

timing. You have to do so after a remand determines the 

amount of the fee. So in all cases in which a claimant 

ends up recovering back benefits -- prevailing and 

recovering back benefits as a result of a successful court 

case, that attorney is entitled to payment under 406(b) 

pursuant to the fee agreement with the client. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would that be in 

this case? What was the -- the amount? 

MR. YANG: That is not in the record, but 

what is in the record -- actually, no, this is not in 

the record, either. But the court's -- I can tell you that 

the district court's opinion at the underlying case, 

pursuant to the government's concession, awarded --

determined that 2 additional months of benefits would 

be paid.
