3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case 10-1399, Roberts v. Sea-Land 

Services. 

6  Mr. Gillelan. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II, 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. GILLELAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Dana Roberts was injured and shortly 

12 thereafter became disabled in the course of his work for 

13 Sea-Land in fiscal year 2002, but he was not awarded 

14 compensation until fiscal year 2007.

 The question presented here is whether the 

16 maximum weekly rate established by section 6 of the 

17 Longshore Act that was in effect at the time his 

18 disability began or that which was in effect at the time 

19 he was awarded compensation governs his case. He is 

entitled to whichever maximum is the applicable one. 

21  Section 6(c) of the Act provides explicitly 

22 that the applicable maximum is that in effect at the 

23 time that the claimant is "newly awarded compensation." 

24 The term "award" or "awarded" in the Longshore Act has a 

consistent meaning throughout, contrary to the views of

1 the court of appeals below; and that meaning is a
 

2 compensation order filed pursuant to section 19(e) of
 

3 the Act, which is described in section 19(e) as "the
 

4 order making the award."


 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens in the 

7 case --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the two parties are 

9 at extremes and that there is indeed something in the 

middle. I mean, you say it has to be the determination 

11 of entitlement to compensation by the agency. The other 

12 side says no, it's just entitlement, whether it's been 

13 decreed or not. Why -- why wouldn't it be an award, 

14 however, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid 

the amount due, which is what he's supposed to do 

16 anyway, right? Why wouldn't that be an award of 

17 compensation? 

18  MR. GILLELAN: Well, because the statute --

19 in some sense of the word "award" it is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, a sense that -- that 

21 the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense 

22 that the other side argues here. 

23  MR. GILLELAN: I think that the text will 

24 not bear that reading, in particular because the 

payments that you are describing that could be

1 considered an award are described throughout the Act as 

2 payments "without an award." Now, how the claimant can 

3 have been newly awarded benefits at the time the 

4 employer makes a payment "without an award" I think 

defies the meaning of that word. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- well, I wish you 

7 would submit the sections of the Act that use it that 

8 way, that say "compensation without an award." 

9  MR. GILLELAN: Section 14(a) through (e) 

refers to compensation payments without an award. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

12  MR. GILLELAN: Those are the provisions. 

13 Section 14(a) and (b) directs those payments without an 

14 award.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- and the 

16 critical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most 

17 compensation payments are the -- are as a result of 

18 voluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding? 

19  MR. GILLELAN: That is true, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and then in those 

21 cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily 

22 make this compensation available, then measuring --

23 the -- the pay would be measured by the time the 

24 employer makes -- makes the compensation available, 

right?

Official 

1  MR. GILLELAN: I think not, because the --

2 the statutory provision says it's the award that's 

3 determinative. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no award. 

6  MR. GILLELAN: But there can be an award. I 

7 think that's the critical --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have -- what is --

9 I mean, there can be.  But here's a person who has been 

injured and gets compensation without having to bring 

11 any legal proceeding for it. What is the weekly -- the 

12 measure then? It can't be an award, the date of the 

13 award, because there is no award. So, what is it? 

14  MR. GILLELAN: The employer that wants to 

lock in this year's maximum rate and not have his 

16 liability progress above that simply needs to have an 

17 award entered. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, he doesn't. No, he 

19 doesn't. He can just begin payment. This (c), which is 

the section we're talking about here, doesn't just 

21 provide for newly awarded compensation. It also says 

22 "survivors currently receiving compensation for 

23 permanent total disability or death benefits." 

24  "Currently receiving." Now, does that mean 

it has to have been decreed by the agency? I don't

1 think so. 

2  MR. GILLELAN: That provision, which -- that 

3 clause --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: That clause.

 MR. GILLELAN: -- that separate clause --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

7  MR. GILLELAN: -- which is not in this case, 

8 because --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But it --

but it applies to the question, it seems to me, that 

11 Justice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it? 

12  MR. GILLELAN: No, I think not. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

14  MR. GILLELAN: The function of that clause 

is that in permanent total and death cases, because 

16 there's an annual escalator provision, whatever your 

17 rate is this year is going to go up -- if it's a 

18 permanent total or death case -- is going to go up each 

19 October 1st by the increase in the national average 

rate. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: But only if you've been 

22 receiving compensation. 

23  MR. GILLELAN: If you -- if --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? If neither the 

employment -- if neither the employer gives you the

1 compensation voluntarily nor as you -- as you contend, 

2 there has been an award by the agency, you're out; (c) 

3 doesn't apply. Right? 

4  MR. GILLELAN: I wouldn't say (c) doesn't 

apply, no. I think --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: How else would it apply? 

7 You are either receiving compensation, which I would 

8 understand to mean receiving it from the employer or by 

9 reason of an award, or else you've been newly awarded 

compensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been 

11 paid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket. 

12  MR. GILLELAN: Well, the -- the function of 

13 that separate clause is for cases in which an award has 

14 been entered of death benefits or permanent total 

disability benefits, and everything up to that point is 

16 governed by the maximum that's in effect at the time of 

17 that --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say that, 

19 counsel. It says "survivors currently receiving 

compensation." It doesn't say "by virtue of an award." 

21 It says "receiving compensation." So, if the employer 

22 is paying it voluntarily, you're in there. And then it 

23 goes on and it contrasts with receiving compensation 

24 those newly awarded compensation. You're not yet 

receiving it, but you've been awarded it.

1  MR. GILLELAN: Well, Mr. Roberts did not 

2 fall within the currently receiving compensation --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. 

4  MR. GILLELAN: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I'm just trying to make 

6 sense out of the provision. And it doesn't seem to me 

7 to make any sense unless you read it just the way I 

8 suggested. 

9  MR. GILLELAN: Okay. I hope I can provide 

that sense. The function of that separate clause is 

11 that a claimant who has been awarded compensation at a 

12 given rate, at the -- which is the maximum at the time 

13 of the award, will continue to receive compensation 

14 in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say that. It 

16 says nothing about an award. The last part talks about 

17 an award. It says "currently receiving compensation for 

18 permanent total disability or death benefits." And if 

19 you're receiving it from your employer, I don't know why 

that isn't covered by that. Why isn't it covered? 

21  MR. GILLELAN: I can certainly see that 

22 those terms would appear to apply --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

24  MR. GILLELAN: -- to that situation in which 

the employer is paying compensation for death or for 

9

1 permanent total disability. That wouldn't provide us 

2 for a maximum -- any applicable maximum. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it affects 

4 your case. It's just a matter of understanding what 

this provision is talking about. 

6  MR. GILLELAN: Yes. And the -- what I'm 

7 trying to say about the function of this clause is that 

8 a claimant who has been awarded compensation for 

9 permanent total disability -- let's assume the employer 

hasn't paid anything until the ALJ issues an award, and 

11 at the time that award is issued the maximum is $1,000 a 

12 week, and the employer was making -- the employee was 

13 making more than 1500. So, that maximum is the rate. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: But if the employer has 

been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee 

16 for not having an award, right? I mean he's in the same 

17 position; the employer has conceded the liability. 

18  MR. GILLELAN: He certainly is not in the 

19 same position, no.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would 

21 Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his 

22 proposition that those currently receiving voluntary 

23 payments from the employer fall under subsection (c). 

24 Would his reading require the employer every year to 

recalculate the benefits to the maximum that's 

10

25

Official 

1 established that year? 

2  MR. GILLELAN: Yes, it would. Yes, it 

3 would. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's why his 

reading --

6  MR. GILLELAN: And that is precisely the 

7 function of that clause. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The function of (b) is 

9 to set a maximum that will control all payments present 

and future. 

11  MR. GILLELAN: Yes, yes, definitely. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, if you read it 

13 the way he does, that maximum would change each year. 

14  MR. GILLELAN: Yes. And for permanent total 

disability and death cases --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why 

17 that's so only for employment -- for employer payments 

18 and not the case for awards. If that's so for the 

19 employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have 

been decreed? Why don't they change every year? 

21  MR. GILLELAN: They do. If the award is for 

22 permanent total disability or for death, they do. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, then my reading 

24 makes perfect sense.

 MR. GILLELAN: Yes, your reading does make 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 perfect sense. And the function of that second -- that 

2 -- the clause for those currently receiving compensation 

3 for permanent total or death is that even when the 

4 maximum continues to go up after the date of an award, 

that new maximum is the applicable one for the 

6 continuing period of disability or survivorship. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When -- one of the 

8 arguments on the other side that I thought made some 

9 sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular 

point in time when you're figuring out what the amount 

11 of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make --

12 that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to 

13 calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but 

14 in terms of the applicable maximum, we're going to wait 

however long it takes and calculate that as of this 

16 point. Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the 

17 applicable numbers at the same point in time? 

18  MR. GILLELAN: Marginally more sense, 

19 perhaps so. But that is an argument that should be 

addressed to Congress. Congress could easily have made 

21 section 6(c) turn on the time of injury. Instead, they 

22 provided very explicitly --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if we think --

24 if we think the statute -- in other words, your 

argument, your response, is that the statute is 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 unambiguous and it can't be read --

2  MR. GILLELAN: Yes. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in a more 

4 sensical way.

 MR. GILLELAN: Yes. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

7  MR. GILLELAN: Yes, and that each use of the 

8 term "award," contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, is 

9 consistent with that. That is, whenever Congress refers 

in this statute to an award or compensation being 

11 awarded, it is talking about the order making the award 

12 as it's described in section 19(e). 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really have to 

14 establish that, do you? All you have to establish is 

that it is -- there is no way in which "newly awarded 

16 compensation" means entitlement to compensation. That's 

17 all you have to establish. 

18  MR. GILLELAN: That is exactly correct. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to show that 

it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never 

21 used to mean entitlement to compensation. 

22  MR. GILLELAN: That is -- that is exactly 

23 correct, and I --

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Are you conceding in answer 

to these questions that your reading doesn't really make 

13

25

Official 

1 any sense; that's just what Congress -- that's what 

2 Congress did? 

3  MR. GILLELAN: No, I hope I'm not conceding 

4 that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what sense does it 

6 make? What -- why should the ceiling depend on whether 

7 an employee is getting compensation voluntarily from the 

8 employer or as a result of a formal award? If you have 

9 two identical -- identically situated employees and one 

is getting the compensation without an award and one is 

11 getting it with an award, as you understand the term 

12 "award," why -- what sense does it make to treat them 

13 differently? 

14  MR. GILLELAN: I would say they certainly 

are not identically situated. The claimant who has an 

16 award --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: They're identically situated 

18 in every respect except one. One has a formal award; 

19 one does not. What sense does it make to treat them 

differently then? 

21  MR. GILLELAN: There are serious 

22 consequences of the fact that one has an award and the 

23 other is being paid only without an award. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, if I understood 

your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 that they are treated differently. The one who is 

2 receiving compensation is treated the same, under the 

3 same provision. There are two parts to it: survivors 

4 currently receiving compensation and survivors newly 

awarded compensation. 

6  Those two classes are treated exactly the 

7 same. The only one that is treated differently is 

8 somebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor 

9 has yet received an award.

 MR. GILLELAN: No. No. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

12  MR. GILLELAN: No, no. The clause that 

13 depends on whether you're currently receiving only 

14 applies to permanent total disability and death cases. 

In all other cases, the clause that says "newly awarded" 

16 is the only applicable provision. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. Partial disability, 

18 in other words. 

19  MR. GILLELAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

21  MR. GILLELAN: And temporary total. 

22 Temporary total has -- the rates do not go up each year. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Would you then go back -- I 

24 did have the same question Justice Alito asked, and I'd 

like to hear the answer. The answer -- that there --

Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1 I'll add one footnote, perhaps, which -- make it a more 

2 complete answer, and that is that it makes very little 

3 sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1, 

4 1990, for example. He is now disabled. And so, we 

calculate what his wage was. His wage was $200 a week. 

6 And now we say: But that shouldn't exceed twice the 

7 average weekly wage, and we're not going to apply it to 

8 him. 

9  You're going to apply it to him at some 

random date. His wage that he's getting paid is figured 

11 out as of January 1, 1990. 

12  MR. GILLELAN: Yes. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: But the maximum that it 

14 could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he 

finishes a proceeding. 

16  Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would 

17 you distinguish and why would you get that result? For 

18 those two reasons, it doesn't seem to make much sense to 

19 me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense. 

Now, you explain why that is. 

21  MR. GILLELAN: Okay. Okay. I think the 

22 point is to encourage the employer to get an award 

23 entered promptly because that way they will lock in that 

24 early maximum rate or minimum rate. The minimum rate 

provision applies exactly the same way under section 

16

Official 

1 6(c). 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought Congress 

3 wanted the system to operate so that people just did it 

4 voluntarily without an award.

 MR. GILLELAN: Well, they want that to 

6 happen as often as possible, but the employer has the 

7 right in any case to file a notice with the Department 

8 of Labor saying we do not believe the claimant is 

9 entitled to compensation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, it really doesn't 

11 make a whole lot of sense. I mean, it seems to me you 

12 have to acknowledge it would be a much better statute 

13 had it been written differently. And really your 

14 argument here is it's not up to us to revise the 

inadequacies of a statute. I mean, your argument is you 

16 just can't read the language that way. And it provides 

17 a stupid result. There are such things as stupid 

18 statutes, and this is one of them, right? 

19  MR. GILLELAN: I don't think it's stupid, 

but yes, my basic argument is it isn't. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But you think -- you think 

22 it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to 

23 give a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that 

24 all the employers who are going to do this voluntarily 

and there will never be a problem with it -- all should

1 be encouraged to go and get a certificate from the 

2 Department of Labor. All right. I'll take that as --

3 something. 

4  And now, why is it I can't read the statute 

the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense? I 

6 don't see any words here that stop me from reading it. 

7  MR. GILLELAN: "Newly awarded compensation" 

8 are the critical words. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Where now there exactly? 

It says -- you mean in (c)? 

11  MR. GILLELAN: In -- yes, 6(c). 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: You just told me that just 

13 has to do with permanent or total disability, and this 

14 is far --

MR. GILLELAN: No. Excuse me. The other 

16 clause of that provision, the one that says "currently 

17 receiving compensation" -- that one only applies to 

18 survivors and permanently totally disabled workers. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: But why -- why don't they 

both? I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that --

21 we now have a special thing, you know, which these 

22 people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it 

23 and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this 

24 individual, and the Secretary, the Secretary or his 

delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time.

1 And they've got a special thing here for -- for 

2 permanent people, permanently disabled, and they're 

3 saying as to those people, we're giving them a break. 

4 They can't look for more work. They can't look for --

they're dead, for example, and they can't find other 

6 sources of income. And so, we say that, that if the 

7 average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin 

8 with, we will raise it a bit. 

9  MR. GILLELAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that applies not only 

11 to the people who are just getting this for the first 

12 time in the relevant period; it also applies to all 

13 those who have been getting it. It applies to both 

14 groups. Well, that makes sense to me.

 MR. GILLELAN: For permanent total 

16 disability --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Right. 

18  MR. GILLELAN: -- and death. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

 MR. GILLELAN: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: So, the whole thing applies 

22 just to the permanently disabled and the death things. 

23 What says it applies to anybody else? 

24  MR. GILLELAN: No, the -- the clause --

1 whole -- the whole -- all of (c). That's -- in my thing 

2 here, that's seven lines. All of (c) applies to 

3 permanently disabled and those who died. 

4  MR. GILLELAN: Well, that's certainly -- no 

one has put forward that construction, and that would

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what happens to 

14 your argument if we disagree with you that employers 

have a way to seek a compensation order? As I read the 

16 regulations, the only way they can do that is if the 

17 employee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the 

18 claim then sets the process in motion. I can't imagine 

19 that an -- any employee, knowing that a future award 

could help them, would bother filing a claim to help the 

21 employer lock in his rate. 

22  MR. GILLELAN: I think -- actually, my 

23 experience, my universal experience with this statute, 

24 is that that is not a realistic view of what claimants' 

behavior is.

1  The critical difference is an -- the entry 

2 of an award does not merely confirm that the employer is 

3 making payments; it requires it to continue making those 

4 payments until --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not my question. 

6 Most of your argument is premised on the -- I thought, 

7 that the employer could lock in his rate --

8  MR. GILLELAN: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- by seeking an award.

 MR. GILLELAN: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If I disagree with you 

12 that the Act doesn't provide for that and neither do the 

13 regulations, that only employees can seek awards, what 

14 happens to your argument?

 MR. GILLELAN: Oh, I think -- well -- I have 

16 trouble accepting that hypothetical situation because --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, as I've studied 

18 it, I think that's the case. So, assume that fact to be 

19 true, that employers have no regulatory or statutory 

right to seek an award. They can either stop paying and 

21 have the employee make a claim or not. 

22  How -- what does this do to your argument, 

23 if that's accurate? 

24  MR. GILLELAN: Nothing. It simply requires 

the employer to induce the claimant to file a claim if

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By stopping payment.
 

3  MR. GILLELAN: Yes. Yes.
 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that destroys the
 

whole voluntary payment aspects of this. 

6  MR. GILLELAN: Well, they wouldn't --

7 indeed, they wouldn't have to stop payment. They simply 

8 need to tell the claimant: If you don't file a claim, 

9 we're going to stop payments. No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't it an odd statute? 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. Is your argument 

12 this now -- I'm sorry to be so slow. But that, look, 

13 there is a statute here; it that says compensation 

14 cannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual weekly 

-- or the weekly wage. Then in (3), it says how to 

16 calculate that particular number. And then you go over 

17 to (c), and (c) says that calculated number applies to 

18 those newly awarded compensation. 

19  And you're saying "newly awarded 

compensation" means somebody got it through an award, 

21 not somebody got it automatically. And since somebody 

22 got it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't 

23 apply when you just get it because they pay for it, it 

24 just doesn't apply. You have to go get the award. And 

the word you're turning on is "newly awarded."

don't -- they don't come under either one of those two

say the statute doesn't make sense.

22 encourages the employer to have an award entered so that 

23 it will have the benefit of the current maximum rate and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. You've 

6 been -- you've been waiting the longest. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: I think the way the argument 

9 has gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't 

make sense, and you've been saying, as you have every 

11 right to say, yes, but this is what the statute says 

12 based on the "newly awarded" language. 

13  But that does assume that "newly awarded" 

14 can't mean an entitlement. And then you run up against 

some other statutory provisions where an award does seem 

16 to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an 

17 entitlement to funds. So, 908(d)(1), it seems as though 

18 the word "award" means entitlement; 910(h)(1), it seems 

19 as though the word "award" means an entitlement; and 

933(b), which says "award in a compensation order," 

21 suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or 

22 awards can be made differently because of an entitlement 

23 that is automatically paid. 

24  So, I guess there are three places that it 

seems to me your reading of the word -- your limited

1 reading of the phrase "newly awarded," you know, runs 

2 into problems in those three ways, and I'm left then 

3 thinking we should do what makes sense. 

4  MR. GILLELAN: I may have missed what the 

third of those was. I have the --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: 933(b), 908(d)(1), and 

7 910(h)(1). 

8  MR. GILLELAN: Ah, okay. Yes, 9 -- the 

9 section 8(d)(1) that they're referring to refers to an 

award to an -- the unpaid portion of an award to an 

11 employee who dies before that award has been paid out. 

12 Their reading of "award" in that provision is 

13 contradicted by the subsequent paragraph of the same 

14 subsection, which says "an award may be made after the 

death of the injured employee." It's 908(d)(3). 

16  Now, that is impossible on their reading of 

17 "award" -- on the reading they give "award" in section 

18 8(d)(1). No, what it means in 8(d)(1), as throughout 

19 the Act, is an award. And if none has been entered 

while the claimant is still alive, it's entered after 

21 his death. And the survivors under that provision take 

22 the rest of it that had not been paid before the death. 

23  Now, we have essentially the same analysis 

24 of those other provisions. Yes, in those other 

provisions as well, it does mean a compensation order.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- you're 

6 making your case harder than it has to be, it seems to 

7 me, by saying that it always means an award of 

8 compensation by the agency. 

9  I -- I think in -- in 8(d), I don't think it 

means that, but it certainly means an amount due and not 

11 an entitlement. It means an amount, a specific amount 

12 due, and that explains its meaning elsewhere, but that's 

13 quite different from saying that it means entitlement. 

14  MR. GILLELAN: No doubt it is, yes. And --

and perhaps there may be some variation in the meaning 

16 in the other provisions. That's possible. But in 

17 section 6(d), we think it has to mean the entry of an 

18 award. That's the only definite event it could refer 

19 to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I think that's true, 

21 but only because of the earlier portion of 6(c) which --

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT 

8  MR. PALMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 Petitioner's interpretation of section 906, 

11 which hinges entirely on the date of an administrative 

12 compensation order, renders that provision impossible to 

13 apply in the many cases expressly contemplated by the 

14 Act in which there is no such order. That 

interpretation also creates arbitrary distinctions 

16 between beneficiaries' benefit levels based on 

17 administrative happenstance.

1  MR. PALMORE: The statute provides for the 

2 award of damages, and I think this is -- this -- the key 

3 to this, understanding how this scheme works, is 

4 understanding section 914 and section 913. These are at 

page 17a --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: But we're not talking --

7  MR. PALMORE: -- of the appendix.
 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- about how the scheme
 

9 works. Grant you that it makes a lot more sense your
 

way, but you -- will you grant that it's not up to us to

12  MR. PALMORE: It's absolutely not up to 

13 you --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. PALMORE: -- to rewrite the statute, 

16 Justice Scalia. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, what we're talking 

18 about is whether "awarded" in that provision can bear 

19 the meaning that you want to give it. Let's assume that 

Congress passes a -- a new statute providing for tax 

21 credits for -- for each child, okay? My wife gives 

22 birth to a child just before Christmas, and I say, oh, 

23 goody; I've been awarded $2,000. I wouldn't say that. 

24 That's not a normal use of the language.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I am entitled to it under

3 occurs, I don't say I've been awarded $2,000. You might 

4 say it analogously. I mean, you know, oh, hey, I've 

been awarded $2,000. But that's analogous. And 

6 statutes are not written by analogy; they're written to 

7 say what they say. 

8  And I don't know anybody that would use the 

9 term "awarded" the way you want it used. The Chief 

Justice's example is another one: Oh, good, I've been 

11 awarded damages. 

12  You haven't been awarded damages. You're 

13 entitled to them. 

14  MR. PALMORE: I think Justice Kagan 

highlighted three provisions where the statute does in 

16 fact use the word "award" to indicate a statutory 

17 entitlement. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's go through those. 

19  MR. PALMORE: I'd be glad to, Justice 

Scalia. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you show me 

22 how -- I agree with you that they don't mean the entry 

23 of an award by the agency, but I don't agree with you

entitlement.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. PALMORE: -- "filed by the deputy 

6 commissioner" shall have certain legal consequences --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

8  MR. PALMORE: -- that aren't important here. 

9 That sentence, even read by itself, suggests there can 

be an award that's not in a compensation order. 

11  Moreover --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes. Yes. 

13  MR. PALMORE: -- the last sentence says: 

14 "For purposes of this subsection" -- not the purposes of 

the entire Act -- "for purposes of this subsection, the 

16 term 'award' with respect to a compensation order means 

17 a formal order issued by the deputy commissioner, an 

18 administrative law judge" --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's true. And 

what that means is that it can be considered an award if 

21 you've gotten it from the employer voluntarily. That is 

22 still an award of compensation. 

23  That's all that that last sentence proves. 

24  MR. PALMORE: I think it contemplates -- it 

certainly precludes, I think, Petitioner --

 MR. PALMORE: Well, the actual -- the 

6 "actual receipt" interpretation that Your Honor is 

7 advancing is not one that's been advanced in this case. 

8 It would have extraordinarily -- extraordinary practical 

9 difficulties, and application would be really 

inconsistent. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. I think he's 

12 persuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking 

13 about, subsection (c), the only meaning left for "award" 

14 is an award by the agency, because --

MR. PALMORE: Well, I'd like to try -- I'd 

16 like to try to convince you otherwise. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you have to show 

18 me one other provision at least where the only meaning 

19 you can give "award" is entitlement to money.

 MR. PALMORE: Well, I think section 

21 910(h)(1), another provision cited by Justice Kagan, is 

22 another example. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: (h)(1)?

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "compensation to 

3 which" --

4  MR. PALMORE: Right. This is a very 

complicated provision, but what's important to note here 

6 is that Congress made -- this was Congress's attempt to 

7 provide additional benefits to beneficiaries whose 

8 disabilities commenced before 1972. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. PALMORE: They make a critical --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What page are you on? 

12  MR. PALMORE: I'm sorry. Page 15a of the 

13 appendix to the gray brief. 

14  The specifics aren't as important as the use 

of the phrase, and it's one, two, three, four, five 

16 lines from the bottom, "or his survivor was awarded 

17 compensation as the result of death." So, it makes a 

18 key determinant for figuring out how these adjustments 

19 are going to be made whether someone was awarded 

compensation prior to October 27th, 1972. There's no 

21 indication here, and it would make no sense to suggest, 

22 that Congress meant to distinguish between people who 

23 had a formal compensation order and those who didn't. 

24  I think -- but if I could go back to 

section --

34
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His answer to that was 

2 that the provision also permits an entry after someone 

3 -- of an order after someone dies. 

4  MR. PALMORE: That's his answer on some of 

the other provisions --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it's -- the 

7 incongruity is taken care of by the Act directly. 

8  MR. PALMORE: Right. But here that -- here 

9 there'd be no reason for someone to go in and get a 

compensation order, because these were long-past 

11 disabilities, and Congress was simply creating a rule 

12 for how to true up these past beneficiaries and provide 

13 them additional benefits. 

14  But I think if you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does "awarded 

16 compensation at less than the maximum rate" mean? I'm 

17 not sure what that refers to. 

18  MR. PALMORE: There was an old maximum. 

19 Prior to 1972, there was a $70 maximum.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

21  MR. PALMORE: Okay. So, if someone was --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't you entitled to get 

23 the maximum? No? 

24  MR. PALMORE: Yes. But some people --

two-thirds of their average weekly wage resulted in a 

35
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 figure below the maximum, right? So, for those people, 

2 what section 910(h)(1) did was said if you were awarded 

3 compensation at less than the prior maximum, you're 

4 going to get an inflation adjustment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I got you. 

6  MR. PALMORE: For everyone else who was 

7 already at the maximum, they got a new, statutorily 

8 created time of injury, which is itself significant, 

9 that Congress went -- used that route.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

11  MR. PALMORE: But there's no indication --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right. It doesn't 

13 make sense. It --

14  MR. PALMORE: Well, it doesn't make sense 

under Petitioner's reading. I think it does make sense 

16 under our reading. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes. 

18  MR. PALMORE: Okay? 

19  And if you go to page -- page 17a, I think 

these are the key provisions for understanding how 

21 section 906 works in the statutory scheme. Section 914, 

22 at the bottom of the page, 17a to the Government's 

23 brief, provides that employers must pay compensation 

24 without a compensation order promptly, as soon as they 

have notice of an injury.

1  (b), which is on the next page, 18a, says 

2 that the first payment has to come in 14 days, within 

3 14 days of notice of the injury, unless the employer 

4 controverts liability.

 So, if I'm an employer, I have an employee 

6 who's injured, I've got to get out my checkbook on day 

7 14 and start writing checks. I need to know what number 

8 to fill in. I need to know --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're doing 

that -- you're doing that without an award. 

11  MR. PALMORE: Correct. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how can you say 

13 what the employer pays should be considered an award? 

14  MR. PALMORE: Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's without an 

16 award. 

17  MR. PALMORE: Because if you don't consider 

18 that, then the -- the statutory maximum provision is 

19 impossible to apply because then it's unclear -- and I 

haven't heard Petitioner answer what the statutory 

21 maximum is. If that employee who gets his first check 

22 after 14 days has not been newly awarded compensation 

23 and --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we're back --

we're back to (b) overrides (a). You -- you're saying

3  MR. PALMORE: No, I'm saying that --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I agree with the 

Chief Justice. Without an award, it seems to me it 

6 tends to help the Petitioner. 

7  MR. PALMORE: That use of "award" clearly 

8 means compensation order, and I'm not here to suggest 

9 that the -- that the statute never uses the word "award" 

to mean compensation order. Often it does, and in this 

11 case, that provision does. But the larger point is that 

12 that employer has to start payments in 14 days, and he 

13 has to know what statutory maximum applies. Under 

14 Petitioner's view of the statute, there is no answer to 

that question, because that employee has not been newly 

16 awarded compensation. So, section 906(c) --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: And in what percentage of 

18 the cases are we in that world? 

19  MR. PALMORE: It's a -- in a substantial 

majority of cases no claim is ever filed, Justice Kagan. 

21 Page 38 of the red brief points to legislative history 

22 before Congress in 1972 which demonstrated that, and 

23 that remains the case. This is a workers' 

24 compensation scheme that encourages employers to pay 

without administrative compulsion. It's supposed to be

encourage employers to pay, because they can stop just 

6 by saying they contest, right? 

7  MR. PALMORE: Absolutely. They have a 

8 statutory right to controvert. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so, your reading I 

think leads to protraction. And they get that date of 

11 injury rule no matter how long they string it out under 

12 your reading. If you read -- what is the magic 

13 phrase -- newly --

14  MR. PALMORE: Newly awarded compensation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can say, well, that 

16 means in the case of the employer who pays promptly, 

17 pays immediately and continues to pay voluntarily, that 

18 the compensation is acquired when the employer starts 

19 paying voluntarily. But if the employer is not paying, 

then the compensation is newly awarded when there's an 

21 award. 

22  So, I don't see why -- what kind of problems 

23 this statute would have if we say newly awarded could 

24 mean awarded by the statute, which would be newly 

awarded when you're injured; but it can also mean

1 compensation ordered by an award. So, you have the 

2 employer who pays promptly can lock in that early date, 

3 but if he doesn't pay promptly, the -- then the ceiling 

4 is going to go up till the time the award is entered.

 What's wrong with that reading? 

6  MR. PALMORE: That's again a reading that 

7 hasn't been advanced in this case, but I understand Your 

8 Honor's question and Your Honor's point. I think that 

9 reading of it would be very difficult to apply because 

there may be many cases where an employer will write one 

11 or two checks and then stop. There made be cases in 

12 which an employer will write a check for the wrong 

13 amount; there will later be a dispute about what the 

14 proper benefit level would be.

 So, I think you'd develop a whole body of 

16 case law and controversy about what it meant for the 

17 employer to have paid, in that sense. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those aren't 

19 going to be the typical cases, I think. You said there 

may be cases, and I suppose there may be. I assume what 

21 happens -- employers just don't write checks. They say 

22 this is how we calculate what we owe you. And it is 

23 based on the maximum of this year, not any future ones, 

24 and if the employee says no, no, no; I have a right to 

get the -- then the employer will say, well, okay, I

1 either agree with that or not, but you don't get a 

2 check. 

3  MR. PALMORE: Well, the -- the employer will 

4 need to protect itself by writing that check unless it's 

going to controvert liability. Justice Ginsburg pointed 

6 to one of Petitioner's arguments that this provides an 

7 incentive for employers not to controvert liability when 

8 they don't have a good-faith basis for doing so, but 

9 section 928 of the Act provides for attorney's fees in 

that situation. So, there's already a remedy for that 

11 kind of situation. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I understand 

13 the amounts at issue here. What is a usual amount 

14 that's at stake in this sort of case? We're talking 

about the concerns -- I guess on both -- about 

16 gamesmanship, but how much difference are we talking 

17 about? 

18  MR. PALMORE: Well, the --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know; maybe 

you don't have statistics, on an average. 

21  MR. PALMORE: Well, I can -- we can use this 

22 case as an -- as an illustration. So, in this case, the 

23 Petitioner's disability began in 2002. So, our view is 

24 that that's when he was initially awarded compensation. 

And so, the 2002 maximum of $966 applies.

Official 

1  Petitioner's view is that because he 

2 received a formal compensation order in 2007, the 2007 

3 maximum applies, this 1,114. 

4  So, it can make a considerable difference. 

I think, though, that Petitioner recognizes --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The consequence -- I 

7 mean, there's the time value of money, too. The 

8 consequence of the employee saying I'm going to wait 5 

9 years because I think the maximum is going to be a lot 

higher is that he doesn't get anything in the meantime, 

11 right? 

12  MR. PALMORE: Well, that's -- that's right. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's reasonable for 

14 an employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll 

wait. 

16  MR. PALMORE: That's right. The larger 

17 point though is that in many cases in which compensation 

18 is paid without compulsion of a compensation order, an 

19 employee never files a claim. Section 913 expressly 

contemplates that by saying that an employee has 1 year 

21 in which to file a claim from an injury unless he has 

22 been receiving payments, in which case the time runs 

23 from the last payment received. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- just for my 

technical knowledge here. The -- the employee suffers

1 partial disability on February 1. He then doesn't 

2 notify the employer until, let's say, February 10, and 

3 then the employer waits for a week or so, and then 

4 begins to pay.

 Now, is the employer supposed to calculate 

6 the -- the weekly wage that he's paying on in the week 

7 February 1 to February 10 or -- 3 days, he puts it 

8 aside. But -- in the first week or does he do it on the 

9 first week he got notice? How is that -- how does that 

work? 

11  MR. PALMORE: Well, he needs to provide --

12 he needs to make a payment within 14 days --

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm saying he has to 

16 write the check now. 

17  MR. PALMORE: Right. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: And the wage could have 

19 changed in those few weeks.

 MR. PALMORE: It's from the --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: The first week he didn't 

22 get the notice. Then the second week he did get the

6 We can't mean it to read "award" by the -- by the

8 the time that he became entitled to some money.

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

11  MR. PALMORE: -- Justice Breyer. And --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: And the tough thing is

we have situation 3 and 4, and they're not present here;

MR. PALMORE: Well, I think there are --

7 what's the most analogous thing you can find anywhere

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief -- your brief 

8 seem to use the "newly awarded compensation," your 

9 meaning of it, at the time of injury, the time of 

disability, the time of entitlement to compensation. 

11 And it seems to use those terms interchangeably. What 

12 term are you settling on and why? 

13  MR. PALMORE: Okay. I think we address this 

14 in footnote 9 of our brief. It's the commencement of 

entitlement to disability benefits, which is almost 

16 always going to be when disability itself commences. 

17 Petitioner has pointed out that there is an 

18 idiosyncratic set of cases in which, if a disability 

19 lasts more than 3 days but fewer than 14, you're not 

compensated for those first 3 days. So, in that unusual 

21 circumstance, it would be day 4, but the employer who 

22 writes that check at day 14 is going to know. That's --

23 that's the key. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you can do it. You 

can say it's the time that the statute awards him the

1 compensation. That's the English language. 

2  MR. PALMORE: That's -- that's correct, 

3 Justice -- Justice Breyer. And I think that --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: But it's the statute that's 

doing the awarding.
 

6  MR. PALMORE: To make his -- I think
 

7 Petitioner has developed kind of a procedural
 

8 work-around to the -- the problem created by his
 

9 interpretation the statute, which is that he needs a
 

compensation order in every case to make the scheme make 

11 sense. To get compensation order, he needs a claim in 

12 every case. And as the colloquy before reflected, the 

13 way he can get a claim in every case, because in many 

14 cases claims are not filed today, is that the employer 

must threaten the disabled employee to cut off benefits 

16 if that employee doesn't file a claim, threaten to 

17 controvert liability when that employer has no 

18 good-faith basis for doing so. All to get the employee 

19 to file a claim that the claim -- employee doesn't think 

is necessary, to get a compensation order which serves 

21 no other purpose than to trigger this maximum rate 

22 provision. 

23  That's contrary to the way this statute is 

24 supposed to work. The statute is supposed to encourage 

amicable agreement between employers and employees to

1 avoid administrative process and the gearing up of the 

2 administrative machinery wherever possible. 

3  And Petitioner's proffered solution to the 

4 problem of the absence of a compensation order in every 

case is contrary to that of the entire thrust of the 

6 Longshore Act as a workers' compensation scheme. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And your answer to the --

8 to the problem of an employer protracting -- so he 

9 doesn't have to pay sooner; he can wait till later -- is 

there would be no penalty as long as the employer says 

11 I'm -- I'm contesting, but you say the attorney's fees, 

12 that's -- is that --

13  MR. PALMORE: Attorney's fees and interest, 

14 both of which are generally applicable remedies that 

apply to cases that don't implicate the statutory 

16 maximum or the statutory minimum. This -- Petitioner's 

17 solution using his reading of the statute to deal with 

18 employer delay is over-inclusive and under-inclusive. 

19  It's over-inclusive because it's going to 

deal with cases in which there hasn't been delay by any 

21 responsibility by the employer, but there's been 

22 administrative delay, there's been a dispute. 

23  But it's also under-inclusive in that it 

24 only deals with those small number of cases that deal 

with the statutory maximum or minimum.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT 

7  MR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

8 please the Court: 

9  I'd like to begin, if I may, by addressing 

Justice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions on 

11 whether the term "award" can bear the meaning that we 

12 ascribe to it and then explain why, since it can bear 

13 that meaning, this is the only sensible interpretation 

14 of the Act.

 First, it is not uncommon, Your Honor, to 

16 use the term "award" to describe a benefit conferred by 

17 a statute. The dictionary definition is a benefit 

18 conferred. Your Honor, Justice Scalia used a 

19 formulation -- what if a statute awards a tax credit? 

Well, the Court's decision in New Energy Company v. 

21 Limbach began: An Ohio statute awards a tax credit to a 

22 certain producers of ethanol. 

23  I think even Your Honor was the author of 

24 that decision. It is --

(Laughter.) 

49

15

20

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, I -- I agree 

2 with that. You can speak of the statute as awarding 

3 something. But when you use the phrase "newly awarded," 

4 you're not referring to the enactment of the statute; 

you're referring to the time at which the person 

6 qualifies under the statute. And I don't know any usage 

7 of that sort, that a person -- well, you know, when my 

8 wife has a baby, I've been awarded money. 

9  You haven't been awarded money.

 MR. KEISLER: I think the party becomes 

11 newly awarded at the time the party becomes disabled, 

12 and, therefore, there is an amount due under the 

13 statute. And --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's what you say. 

But I don't know -- I don't know any common usage that 

16 employs the term --

17  MR. KEISLER: But it is a usage within the 

18 Longshore Act elsewhere, as Mr. Palmore --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- the 

business was newly awarded the tax credit at the time 

21 they made the deduction? 

22  MR. KEISLER: At the time they became 

23 qualified for what the statute required them to do to 

24 get the tax credit, yes. And that is how it is used in 

910(h)(1), as Justice Kagan said. It's how it's used in 

50
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 908. And section 933 specifically provides Petitioner's 

2 definition of "award," a formal compensation order, but 

3 says it is only for purposes of this subsection. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not the way 

it's used in 914. 

6  MR. KEISLER: That's correct. And that's 

7 why this is a case like Robinson v. Shell Oil, in which 

8 the word "employer" was used throughout Title VII in 

9 different ways. And what the Court said is you then 

have to look at the context of the individual provision 

11 in which the word appears that you're construing to 

12 determine how the word is being used in that particular 

13 provision. 

14  And here the most fundamental reason why it 

is an untenable construction of this Act to rely on the 

16 date of a compensation order to determine the applicable 

17 maximum rate is that then the Act would be silent as to 

18 the maximum rate in the vast majority of instances in 

19 which compensation is paid, because, as Mr. Palmore 

said, in the vast majority of instances no claim is 

21 filed. And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, when no 

22 claim is filed, no compensation order will ever be 

23 issued. 

24  And that's not an accident. That is a 

function of a very central feature of the Act's design 

51
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 that Petitioner's interpretation is entirely at odds 

2 with. The Act is designed to enable compensation to be 

3 calculated precisely and as early as possible so that 

4 the money can get into the employee's hands very quickly 

and with a minimum of instances in which the 

6 administrative machinery has to be invoked. That's why 

7 the norm is no compensation order. 

8  And so, Petitioner's interpretation is 

9 counter to that in at least two respects: It relies on 

the existence of a compensation order, which in most 

11 instances won't and shouldn't issue, and it would 

12 maximize, rather than minimize, the number of instances 

13 in which someone has to go and get an order to force 

14 compensation orders out of the system to make 

Petitioner's interpretation work, even though everything 

16 is happening exactly as the Act says it should. The 

17 employer is voluntarily paying exactly the amount that 

18 the employee says is due, and there's no need to get the 

19 agency involved.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how much of a 

21 practical problem is this? I understand the -- the 

22 amounts are here, but it's 5 years, and apparently the 

23 employee was happy to wait 5 years to get an award. 

24 Normally, if you're an employee and you're disabled, and 

the employer says, well, here's what we're going to give 

52

1 you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we 

2 have, you're not going to say: I'm going to wait; these 

3 wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to 

4 wait a year; maybe I'll wait 4 years because I think 

there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going 

6 to cash in on that; I'm going to be without money for 

7 the next 4 years and I'm disabled, but -- I mean, that 

8 doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation. 

9  MR. KEISLER: But if Your Honor thinks about 

the situation in which the employee is voluntarily 

11 receiving from the employer everything that the employee 

12 agrees is due, then the question is, in that 

13 circumstance where the employer is doing everything 

14 right, what can the employer do to force out of the 

system a compensation order that will lock in the 

16 maximum rate? And Petitioner's solution to that problem 

17 evidences the problem with his position. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, I mean --

19 I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a 

situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and 

21 they write at the end of the check, you know: This is 

22 in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the 

23 whatever. 

24  MR. KEISLER: But there is no compensation 

order until that employee files a claim. And under 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 Petitioner's interpretation, there would therefore be no 

2 knowable maximum rate. And Petitioner's solution to 

3 that problem, on page 16 of his reply brief, is to say 

4 that the employer should threaten a bad-faith cutoff of 

funds. The employer should say I will cut you off 

6 unless you file a claim. 

7  That's bad for everyone. It's bad for the 

8 employee who has access to payments delayed. It's bad 

9 for the employer who apparently is being told it must 

controvert liability in bad faith, because the employer 

11 doesn't in fact disagree that the employee is entitled 

12 to liability, or face a 10 percent penalty for cutting 

13 off the employee without a basis for controverting 

14 liability. And it's bad for the agency who suddenly has 

all these claims filed. All in a situation in which 

16 everything is working exactly as the Act intends.

16  MR. KEISLER: An example --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll get it from the 

18 transcript. 

19  MR. KEISLER: I think it's the employee who 

was receiving voluntary payments, and everything is 

21 proceeding the way the Act intended. But the employer, 

22 in order to know what its maximum rate will be, in order 

23 not to be surprised 5 years hence by a maximum rate that 

24 only then can be known, has to force a compensation 

order out of the system. And the only way Petitioner

1 says the employer can do that is by threatening a
 

2 bad-faith cutoff of funds.
 

3  Whether it happens frequently or
 

4 infrequently, Mr. Chief Justice, I think an
 

interpretation that relies on a mechanism that is so 

6 obviously counter to the way the statute is supposed to 

7 function is, by virtue of that, an extremely unlikely 

8 and unnatural interpretation of the statute. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: About what percentage of 

the compensation cases involve the statutory maximum? 

11 Because if you -- if your pay is less than the statutory 

12 maximum, this issue doesn't come up. 

13  MR. KEISLER: In 1972, Congress was told 

14 that it would be about 10 percent. My understanding is 

since then, it's grown so that I'm told that about 20 

16 percent of cases today require application of the 

17 maximum rate. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the maximum 

19 always go up?

 MR. KEISLER: Ever since 1972, each year's 

21 maximum as calculated by the Secretary of Labor has been 

22 higher than the preceding year. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Theoretically, it 

24 can go down.

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Keisler, if I could just 

4 go back to this language. If -- if according to Justice 

Scalia's old opinion, the statute awards compensation at 

6 the time of disability, essentially what you would be 

7 saying is that an employee who becomes disabled in a 

8 certain year is awarded compensation at that time. Is 

9 that right?

 MR. KEISLER: That's right, Your Honor. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I -- I didn't say 

12 in that opinion that the -- the employer in -- in that 

13 -- or whoever it was that was entitled under the statute 

14 -- was "newly awarded" it. I agree the statute awards 

it, but when you say somebody is "newly awarded," you're 

16 talking about an event at that time. And that's --

17  MR. KEISLER: I think the function --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different usage. 

19  MR. KEISLER: I think the function of 

"newly" in this statute is something different, 

21 Justice Scalia. And that relates to the questions that 

22 Your Honor and Justice Breyer were asking about the 

23 relationship between the "currently receiving" clause 

24 and the final clause. I think the "currently receiving"

1 disability and death, is an adjunct to another provision 

2 of the Act, section 19(f), which provides for a COLA, a 

3 cost-of-living increase, every year for that narrow 

4 subset of the most disabled of employees. They and they 

alone get that annual bump-up. 

6  And so, that "currently receiving" clause is 

7 written for that category to make sure that their 

8 bump-up isn't capped by a static maximum rate. The 

9 other part of the clause, "newly awarded compensation," 

is about everybody else. 

11  Now, I think the use of the word "newly" 

12 there is just to distinguish it from the "currently 

13 receiving" clause, which is escalating year by year. 

14 And those newly awarded compensation, meaning at one 

point, fixed in time -- only when you are "newly" 

16 awarded compensation are you then going to have your 

17 maximum rate fixed. 

18  And then -- and both Petitioner and we 

19 agree -- whatever it's fixed at, whatever year, that 

stays the same for the duration of your collection of 

21 compensation. 

22  If the Court has no further questions, I 

23 thank the Court. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Gillelan, if I got that right, you have

2  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II,
 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, let's assume an
 

employer pays, continues to pay over a period of time, 

6 and the employee needs more money and goes in and says 

7 you owe me more money; I'm going to make a claim. The 

8 board says no, he doesn't owe you more money; he was 

9 paying the right amount. And so, you're not entitled to 

the 1200 you're asking for; you're only entitled to the 

11 1,000 he was paying. 

12  Under your view, if that happened 5 or 10 

13 years after the payments started, would the employer be 

14 liable for the higher average 10 years later?

 MR. GILLELAN: Only, of course, if the 

16 employee's own wages at the time of the injury qualified 

17 for that, but yes. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming it does, that 

19 the answer is "yes"?

 MR. GILLELAN: Yes. Yes. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what stops an 

22 employee from simply doing what I said? What stops an 

23 employee from kicking up his own maximum by -- whenever 

24 he chooses to do it, years and years later?

 MR. GILLELAN: Well, I think in that

1 situation, the claimant hasn't triggered that award. In 

2 fact, the claimant has triggered the maximum that's in 

3 effect at the time of that award that only makes -- it's 

4 an award only of what the employer has been paying. 

It's not a denial, as it's characterized in the 

6 Government's brief. But it is an award only of what of 

7 the employer has been paying. 

8  If the claimant did not bring it forward 

9 with that and the employer let it go for still further 

years, then even a subsequent year's maximum would be 

11 the actual --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we find any ambiguity 

13 in the statute, in the statutory language, would it then 

14 make more sense to adopt your meaning or the 

Government's, given all of the factors that the 

16 Government argues counsels in its favor? 

17  MR. GILLELAN: I think each of those 

18 arguments is fallacious. They misdescribe the statute 

19 in their reasons why this is not a sensible provision. 

But even if there is an ambiguity --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume that --

22  MR. GILLELAN: Before we lose, that -- the 

23 other possible meanings of "newly awarded" have got to 

24 include what they say the test is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
