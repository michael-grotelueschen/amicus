3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first today in Case 10-8974, Perry v. New Hampshire.

 Mr. Guerriero. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD GUERRIERO 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. GUERRIERO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

9 it please the Court:

 An eyewitness identification made under a 

11 suggestive influence presents a unique danger of 

12 misidentification and a miscarriage of justice. It is 

13 that danger of misidentification which implicates due 

14 process and requires an evaluation of the reliability of 

the identification. The constitutional --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, does your 

17 position depend on police involvement at all? 

18  MR. GUERRIERO: No, Your Honor. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- if a private 

investigator shows a picture or -- that has no 

21 connection to the police, a company's investigator --

22  MR. GUERRIERO: What I would suggest is 

23 that --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or the news media 

publishes a picture of someone that it thinks --

Official 

1  MR. GUERRIERO: I have a two-part answer to 

2 that. The -- the significance of the suggestive 

3 influence is how it affects reliability. Most of the 

4 time that influence, the defense will allege, is from 

some police activity and rightly so because they're 

6 mostly involved and rightly so because police suspicion 

7 is the kind of influence that would direct the witness's 

8 attention and say that's the man. 

9  But it's not necessarily required, and in 

fact in -- one of the Federal court of appeal cases, 

11 Dunnigan v. Keane, involved exactly that, a private 

12 investigator, where a private investigator from a bank 

13 showed surveillance photos to the witness and then later 

14 the witnesses made an ID. I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Guerriero, if it's 

16 not -- if it's not limited to suggestive circumstances 

17 created by the police, why is unreliable eyewitness 

18 identification any different from unreliable anything 

19 else? So, shouldn't we look at every instance of 

evidence introduced in criminal cases to see if it was 

21 reliable or not? 

22  MR. GUERRIERO: No, Your Honor. I suggest 

23 that eyewitness identification evidence is unique, and I 

24 think that this Court recognized that in Wade and in the 

subsequent cases, in fact described it at that time as

1 probably the leading cause of miscarriages of justice. 

2 And in fact experience with the DNA exonerations that 

3 we've seen recently in the last 10 or 15 years have 

4 shown that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, at least for all 

6 eyewitness testimony, there would have to be some 

7 pretesting for reliability; is that -- is that your 

8 contention? 

9  MR. GUERRIERO: No, Your Honor, and I don't 

think that's exactly what the Court said in Wade and the 

11 subsequent cases. It's the combination of eyewitness 

12 identification testimony plus the suggestive influence 

13 which makes -- which brings it to sort of the height of 

14 suspicion and creates the greatest risk.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in this case, in 

16 which category do you place the eyewitness testimony? 

17 Is it police suggestion, or is it suggestive but not 

18 through any manipulation on the police's part? 

19  MR. GUERRIERO: In our case, we do not 

allege any manipulation or intentional orchestration by 

21 the police. But our position is that it appeared to the 

22 witness, to Ms. Blandon, that Mr. Perry was in fact a 

23 suspect, and she looked down, and there was that 

24 suspicion.

 Now, if we would have been able to have our

1 due process claim heard, the judge may or may not have 

2 agreed that that was suggestive and created a risk. 

3 But --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that our cases 

which exclude or -- or require reversal when there's 

6 eyewitness testimony impaired by the police -- you think 

7 that's really limited to eyewitness testimony? Suppose 

8 the police created suggestiveness in another category of 

9 evidence. Let's say -- let's say voice evidence, that 

the killer had left a message on the -- on the phone. 

11 And the police in some manner create suggestiveness that 

12 causes a witness to identify that as the voice of the 

13 killer. You really think that we would say, well, this 

14 is not eyewitness testimony; eyewitness testimony 

creates a special risk? Don't you think that we would 

16 say, whenever the police render evidence unreliable, it 

17 -- it should be excluded? 

18  MR. GUERRIERO: I think that may be a 

19 separate due process claim. For example, if the 

police --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. But that -- that 

22 impairs your argument, because if we accept your 

23 argument for eyewitness, we should similarly accept it 

24 for everything else. There's nothing special about 

eyewitness.

1  MR. GUERRIERO: I -- I disagree, Your Honor.

3 something special about eyewitness identification 

4 testimony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm saying we don't 

6 mean it. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. GUERRIERO: Well --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm saying that it's 

unbelievable that if the -- if the police created 

11 testimony, not eyewitness testimony, but testimony that 

12 was unreliable because of police suggestiveness, I think 

13 we would throw that out as well. Don't you think so? 

14  MR. GUERRIERO: I -- well, I think that in 

any case -- and I think the Court has said this in other 

16 circumstances, that in any case a defendant could raise 

17 a due process claim and say, either because of the way 

18 the prosecution handled the evidence or because of the 

19 -- the combination of rulings on evidence, that there 

was a due process violation that implicated fundamental 

21 fairness. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, suppose that 

23 the police talked to this -- to the lady that was in the 

24 -- in the apartment and saw the thing out the window and 

said: We -- we think we've solved this case, but you

1 can't look at this man. We don't want to you look at 

2 this man. Don't tell us. We're not going to let you 

3 look out that window. 

4  It seems to me that the defendant might have 

a due process argument that the police interfered, that 

6 she couldn't say, right when he was there, that's not 

7 the man. I don't know what you want the police to do in 

8 this case. It seems to me it would have been (a) 

9 risking this argument from the defendant and (b) 

improper police conduct not to ask the woman, is this 

11 the man? 

12  MR. GUERRIERO: I disagree, Your Honor. If 

13 the police wanted to ask her to make an identification, 

14 they could have done a line-up procedure or a photo 

line-up procedure fairly promptly that would be distinct 

16 from and much more fair than the show-up at the scene. 

17 And there was no emergency or exigency here that would 

18 require a show-up. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- what about 

unreliable eyewitness testimony in favor of the 

21 defendant? Let's assume the same suggestiveness that 

22 causes you to exclude it when it's been introduced by 

23 the prosecution, but here it's being introduced by the 

24 defendant to show that it was somebody else, okay? Is 

that going to be excluded?

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it should be 

4 excluded under the rules of evidence? If you say it's 

so unreliable -- this is a one-way door? 

6  MR. GUERRIERO: The Due Process Clause --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: All of the evidence that --

8 that causes the defendant to be convicted is excluded, 

9 but -- but any -- any evidence -- any evidence on the 

other side is not? 

11  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, the defendant is 

12 obviously not trying to deprive the State of its liberty 

13 in the same way that the State is trying to deprive the 

14 defendant of his liberty at trial. So, the Due Process 

Clause would not apply in that sense. That's not to say 

16 that there wouldn't be evidentiary grounds for the State 

17 to raise that objection. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but you see, when --

19 when it's the State that causes the unreliability, I can 

see why it is a -- a ground that can be invoked only by 

21 the defendant. But when you come up with a theory that 

22 it doesn't matter whether the State was the cause or 

23 not, I don't know why it wouldn't work both ways, that 

24 the evidence is inherently unreliable, and it ought to 

be excluded whether it helps the defendant or hurts the

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you answered that 

7 due process works only in favor of the defendant.

19  JUSTICE ALITO: I take it from your -- I 

take it from your answers that simple unreliability is 

21 not enough. If there's testimony --

22  MR. GUERRIERO: That's right. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: -- eyewitness testimony that 

24 seems of very dubious unreliability, that cannot be 

excluded.

At least not on that ground.

Something more is needed;
 

That's right.
 

But suggestiveness doesn't
 

9 require any police involvement? Is that right?

 MR. GUERRIERO: That's right. And --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Can you just define what you 

12 mean by "suggestiveness"? 

13  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, I think the Court has 

14 given examples. If it's effectively a show-up or a 

show-up -- the example in Foster involved a couple of 

16 different kinds of suggestiveness. One was where the 

17 police did a line-up where the defendant was the only 

18 common person. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but those are all 

situations where the police is involved -- the police 

21 are involved. 

22  MR. GUERRIERO: Right. The nonpolice 

23 examples of suggestiveness that rise to the due process 

24 level are mostly going to be show-ups. The example in 

Dunnigan v. Keane was a private investigator showing --

1 from the bank. They had an ATM card that was stolen 

2 from the person, and he --

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if you have 

4 cross-racial identification? Would that qualify on the 

ground that studies have shown that those may be less 

6 reliable? 

7  MR. GUERRIERO: That may be a separate 

8 ground to move for a jury instruction or for an expert. 

9 I'm not sure that -- we certainly don't argue here and 

it wasn't argued below that that's a separate due 

11 process ground. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? I mean, that's 

13 the point. Why not? What about an eyewitness 

14 identification from 200 yards? You know, normally you'd 

leave it to the jury, and the jury would say that's very 

16 unlikely. But you want to say it's -- it has to be 

17 excluded, and if it's not, you retry the person. What 

18 is magic about suggestiveness as opposed to all of the 

19 other matters that could cause eyewitness identification 

to be wrong? 

21  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, two answers to that, 

22 Your Honor. First, it's not that these things are --

23 are always excluded, and in fact the Court has set a 

24 very high bar. I mean, the standard is this evidence is 

excluded only if it's very substantially likely to lead 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 to a misidentification. So --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that, but I
 

3 need to know what you mean by "suggestiveness." What
 

4 does that mean? Can you just give me a definition of
 

it? 

6  MR. GUERRIERO: It is conduct or 

7 circumstances that point -- that tell the witness that's 

8 the man. And, most commonly, it would be showing a 

9 single photograph or presenting the person as a suspect 

or it appearing, as in this case, that the -- the 

11 defendant was a suspect. And that's essentially how the 

12 Court has defined it, as conduct that says that's the 

13 man. 

14  So, there may be some things that the 

defense argues that are suggestive, and the trial court 

16 looks at it and says, you know, that's a very slight 

17 suggestion. You say he is the only guy in the line-up 

18 with a mustache. I don't even -- I'm not going any 

19 further. I don't think that's sufficient suggestion. 

That doesn't qualify as saying that's the man. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: But just to repeat Justice 

22 Scalia's question, once you're not talking about police 

23 suggestiveness, once you're talking about suggestiveness 

24 that arises from non-State conduct, why should we be 

focused on suggestiveness as opposed to any other cause 

13

25

Official 

1 of unreliability? 

2  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, because that's what --

3 my first reason is that that's what the Court focused on 

4 in Wade as -- as the main danger.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the Court was focusing 

6 on police suggestiveness. That's the context of all our 

7 cases. Now, you might say, well, look, there's a bigger 

8 problem, and the bigger problem is the unreliability of 

9 identifications generally, but that doesn't relate to 

suggestiveness per se. 

11  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, I think our position 

12 is in between there. We're not saying that there's a 

13 due process right to have eyewitness evidence excluded 

14 generally without some suggestiveness. What we are 

saying is that if the suggestion comes from a nonpolice 

16 source or if it, as in this case, involved the police 

17 but their involvement was unintentional, it's just 

18 accidental, that that suggestiveness should still be 

19 considered because --

JUSTICE BREYER: What does that mean? 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you distinguish the --

22 do you distinguish the husband's situation? He was an 

23 eyewitness too, but there was a motion to suppress her 

24 testimony. Is that an example where there's an 

eyewitness testimony but no suggestiveness? Why didn't

1 you move to suppress the husband's statement? 

2  MR. GUERRIERO: Trial counsel simply did not 

3 move to suppress that testimony. I don't have a good 

4 explanation, and, to be frank, I would have filed the 

motion to suppress his testimony as well. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you'd put them both 

7 in the same category? 

8  MR. GUERRIERO: I would have. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't it -- this 

may be -- just, again, following up on Justice Alito's 

11 question, but there's always a degree of suggestiveness. 

12 It's not like the person is, you know, picked randomly 

13 off the street and saying, you know, do you know this 

14 person? It's in the context of an investigation. The 

person has some contact with it. So, there's always 

16 some suggestiveness that, well, this person might have 

17 something to do with what went on. 

18  MR. GUERRIERO: That's right. And if there 

19 -- if it rises to the level of what the Court has given 

as examples of a show-up or the same defendant appearing 

21 in a line-up or something else that says that's the man, 

22 then that raises a red flag. And it's not a --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But whenever --

24 whenever the witness is asked, at least there's a 

suggestion that this might be the man. And I don't know 

15

1 why you would think that's any greater than this is the 

2 man. The police don't come up usually and say, this is 

3 the person that we think did it; is that who you saw? 

4 They say, did you see this guy?

 MR. GUERRIERO: Actually, I disagree with 

6 that aspect of your question, Your Honor. And in fact I 

7 think the proper police procedure in certainly the 

8 police departments that I'm familiar with will instruct 

9 the witness that -- do not assume that anyone that we 

think is a suspect is in this line-up. And that's in 

11 the standard witness instructions, and they may even do 

12 multiple line-ups where they say, okay, we're going to 

13 show you three sets of eight, and the suspect -- or 

14 there may or may not be a suspect in any of them. We 

just want you to look at this set and see if anyone --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about a 

17 situation like the one we had here, where you're not 

18 talking about a line-up? 

19  MR. GUERRIERO: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're talking 

21 about the scene of a crime, and the police says, do you 

22 know this person, did you see this person, or anything 

23 else? That in itself, any type of identification in the 

24 course of an investigation, I think you would have to 

say is suggestive, because the person is not picked up

1 randomly. 

2  MR. GUERRIERO: It is, but the key is that 

3 it's not the suggestion that results in exclusion. It's 

4 the suggestion that raises the red flag that allows the 

defendant to say, would the trial court please evaluate 

6 this according to the standards? 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this is --

8 again, this is just following up, I guess. But I 

9 remember in law school one of the things in criminal 

law, the professor says, all right, everybody be quiet. 

11 And then a certain amount of time goes by, and then he 

12 starts asking people, well, how much time went by? And 

13 people -- some people say 4 minutes, some people say, 

14 you know, 1 minute. And it turns out, if I'm 

remembering correctly, to be a lot shorter than most 

16 people think. 

17  So, that's at least, the point was trying to 

18 be made anyway, at least as unreliable as eyewitness 

19 testimony. So, your argument would have to cover that, 

wouldn't it? 

21  MR. GUERRIERO: I --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, how long 

23 were you there before this individual came into the 

24 shop? The person says, I was there for 5 minutes. And 

that ruins the person's alibi, when it turns out, you

1 know, study after study would say, you know, it really 

2 was 45 seconds or 1 minute. 

3  MR. GUERRIERO: I think it's important to 

4 look back at what the Court said in Wade and in fact how 

what the Court said in Wade has been borne out. Of 

6 course, there's aspects of unreliability to any kind of 

7 evidence. Somebody could come and claim that there's 

8 issues with false confessions or issues with forensic 

9 evidence. I think last term somebody made a claim --

tried to assert a claim regarding DNA evidence that was 

11 akin to an eyewitness identification claim. 

12  But the point is that this kind of evidence 

13 was singled out by the Court and recognized as having 

14 particular dangers, and it's been borne out by the 

studies, not psychological --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, that was in 

17 the context of procedures that the police had 

18 instituted. 

19  MR. GUERRIERO: It may be that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your -- and your 

21 rationale goes much beyond it. In a way, you're 

22 infringing on the province of the jury. I don't usually 

23 like to reminisce, but there was a case I had where a 

24 prosecution witness was very, very certain, all too 

certain. And I said: Do you ever take your wife out to

has taken your order, he has brought your food, and you 

6 were under no stress at the time.

8  MR. GUERRIERO: Right. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there was good light.

 So, you teach the jury this way. And you're 

11 just -- you're just usurping the province of the jury, 

12 it seems. 

13  MR. GUERRIERO: I don't think so, Your 

14 Honor. I mean, we're -- what -- I think what this Court 

has said is that this is a special category of evidence 

16 that has to be red-flagged by or can be red-flagged by 

17 the defense for the trial judge to look at it and say --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: What is --

19  MR. GUERRIERO: -- on a case by -- I'm 

sorry. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead. You were saying 

22 on a case that all you want to do is red-flag it for the

2 standard --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, how does 

4 that differ from what exists in I think every State and 

certainly in the Federal Rules in Rule 403? The judge 

6 may exclude evidence if its relevance is outweighed by 

7 its prejudice or misleading the jury. So, why, in any 

8 instance where you think that this statement about to 

9 come in is unreliable for various reasons, you say: 

Judge, will you please look please look at Rule 403? I 

11 have some experts over here and whatever else you want 

12 that would show that this is misleading to the jury. 

13 For all the reasons you have said in your brief, right? 

14  All right. So -- so, since that is already 

the law and it does apply to every piece of evidence, 

16 including all the things we've been talking about, what 

17 is it that you want to change? 

18  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, to answer the first 

19 part of your question, what's different about this 

evidence is that --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say what's 

22 different about it. I'm not looking for a difference. 

23 I'm looking -- I'm saying they're all the same. And, 

24 indeed, we do what you want right now. It's called Rule 

403 in the Federal system. What I'm asking you is what

1 is it you want done, since all you want is the judge to 

2 look at it carefully, that is not done at this moment? 

3  MR. GUERRIERO: The analysis under 403, 

4 which New Hampshire of course has as well, will accord a 

certain weight and value to the opportunity of counsel 

6 to cross-examine the witness and to make arguments to 

7 the jury. And unlike any other kind of evidence, this 

8 Court has said, precious though it is, the right of 

9 cross-examination does not always --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but, judges don't, I'm 

11 sure -- I'm not 100 percent sure; you'd have to ask a 

12 trial judge. But I am sure there are instances where 

13 judges say under Rule 403: I conclude it is misleading 

14 and it is prejudicial and it can't be made up for; 

therefore, I exclude it. 

16  All right? That happens. Now, since that's 

17 what you want the judge to do, I repeat my question: 

18 What is the difference between what you're asking for 

19 and what already exists in the law?

 MR. GUERRIERO: The --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Unless -- well, go ahead. 

22  MR. GUERRIERO: I'm sorry. 

23  The difference is that under a normal 403 

24 analysis, when I told the judge, when I said she never 

could describe his face, she couldn't even say what

1 clothes he was wearing, the judge will respond to me and 

2 say, that's fine; that's all great fodder for 

3 cross-examination. But the difference with this kind of 

4 evidence is that it's not just ---

JUSTICE BREYER: Whoa, wait. Let me stop 

6 you there, because now what you seem to be saying is it 

7 isn't the case that you simply want the judge to look at 

8 this with care; rather, you want the judge to change her 

9 result. You want sometimes this to be excluded where 

under 403 it is sometimes not excluded. All right. 

11 Now, I asked, if that's what you want, that's a 

12 different matter. That's a substantive standard. And 

13 so, you're proposing a different substantive standard, 

14 and I want to know what it is.

 MR. GUERRIERO: It's -- it's the standard 

16 that this Court has established: If it's reasonably --

17 reasonably likely or substantially likely to lead to a 

18 risk of misidentification at trial. Very substantially 

19 likely.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But that would be really a 

21 great change from the way trials are now conducted, 

22 wouldn't it? Let me give you this example: A victim is 

23 raped, and the victim doesn't really have a very good 

24 opportunity to see the perpetrator. It's dark, the 

person has a mask and so forth. A couple of weeks go

1 by, and the victim reads on article in the paper that 

2 says so-and-so has been arrested for a rape in another 

3 part of the city. There's a picture of that person in 

4 the paper. And the victim says that's the person who --

who raped me. 

6  Now, you want to make it possible for the 

7 judge to say to the -- that victim may not testify and 

8 identify the person -- that that person -- that the 

9 victim says was the perpetrator of the rape, on the 

ground that the newspaper picture was suggestive, even 

11 though there wasn't any police involvement, and when you 

12 look at all the circumstances, the identification is 

13 unreliable. 

14  Now, maybe that's a good system, but that is 

a drastic change, is it not, from the way criminal 

16 trials are now conducted? 

17  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, it's certainly not the 

18 change from what the law is in the Federal circuits that 

19 we cited. And I would also point out that in one of 

the --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know of cases like 

22 that in which the judge has said that eyewitness 

23 identification cannot come in? 

24  MR. GUERRIERO: In Thigpen v. Cory, which is 

a Sixth Circuit case, the court said -- in fact, they

Official 

1 specifically used the phrase "police machinations" --

2 that this did not arise from police machinations. It 

3 was basically happenstance in that case that the witness 

4 was -- the witness identified the defendant, and that 

was excluded as unreliable.
 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we've said in our
 

7 case, Neil v. Biggers -- that was a rape case, and we
 

8 allowed it. We allowed the eyewitness.
 

9  MR. GUERRIERO: Well -- and I think the
 

Court said in all its cases, and in particular in 

11 Simmons, that each case --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, in fact, we said that 

13 it was unnecessarily suggestive but that it was still 

14 reliable.

 MR. GUERRIERO: And it may be. I mean, it 

16 may -- you could have an extremely -- you could have a 

17 -- the police could do a show-up intending to produce an 

18 ID, but if the witness got a very good look at the 

19 person, was calm, was maybe a police officer like in 

Brathwaite, and the court said, we don't care how 

21 deliberate this -- and even if there's manipulation, we 

22 don't care how much of that there is, we find it's 

23 reliable here. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose that there were some 

other category of testimony which proved even more 

24
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 unreliable than the category that you're talking about. 

2 Let's say that it turned out, study after study after 

3 study, that jailhouse informants lie. And so, the 

4 testimony of jailhouse informants is likely to be just 

completely unreliable, to, you know, double as much as 

6 eyewitness testimony. Same rule for that? 

7  MR. GUERRIERO: I think it would be a very 

8 high burden for the defense to meet there, but if the 

9 finding was that there are times that a witness, that --

like in the eyewitness situation, where the witness 

11 truly believes that they're identifying the right 

12 person, but they are actually not and it could result in 

13 a miscarriage of justice, then I do believe fundamental 

14 fairness requires the Court to say due process doesn't 

allow that evidence. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Well, now we're 

17 talking about -- now we are setting up a standard that 

18 applies outside eyewitness testimony. It's just 

19 testimony that we find to be -- categories of testimony 

that we find to be extremely unreliable will be subject 

21 to this new due process red flag. Is that right? 

22  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, I don't think so, Your 

23 Honor, but more for a factual reason in that the Court 

24 said in 1967 that this is the leading cause of 

miscarriage of justice. The studies and -- not just

1 studies, but the transcripts and records of actual 

2 trials. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I understand you have 

4 very good empirical evidence which should lead us all to 

wonder about the reliability of eyewitness testimony. 

6 I'm just suggesting that eyewitness testimony is not the 

7 only kind of testimony which people can do studies on 

8 and find that it's more unreliable than you would think. 

9  MR. GUERRIERO: Well, it may -- if somebody 

else came along and said we've done a study and we find 

11 this kind of evidence, that in 75 percent of the 

12 wrongful convictions, this evidence contributed to the 

13 miscarriage of justice, then I would think the Court 

14 should take a look at that. But I don't think any other 

evidence matches that. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about all the -- all 

17 the other safeguards that you have? I mean, you can ask 

18 the judge to tell the jury be careful; eyewitness 

19 testimony is often unreliable. You can point that out 

in cross-examination --

21  MR. GUERRIERO: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- ask all those 

23 questions. You can say something about it in your 

24 summation to the jury. And, as Justice Breyer brought 

up, you have the evidence rule that says if the

1 prejudicial value outweighs probative value, that the 

2 judge can say, I'm not going to let it in. 

3  Why aren't all those safeguards enough? 

4  MR. GUERRIERO: If all of those safeguards 

were enough, even when the police made --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, leaving aside the 

7 police --

8  MR. GUERRIERO: Okay. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because, there, 

there's an interest in deterrence, in deterring the 

11 police from manipulating evidence. 

12  MR. GUERRIERO: I don't think deterrence is 

13 the primary basis of the Court's cases, Your Honor, 

14 because the Court has said that if it proves to be 

reliable, no matter how manipulative the police were, 

16 this evidence comes in. So, the basis of the rule is 

17 not primarily deterrence; it's the risk of an unfair 

18 trial and the risk of a miscarriage of justice. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is a difference 

between --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- suggestive and 

23 suggested by the police.

a --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it would be admitted. 

7  MR. GUERRIERO: I mean, I think that that's 

8 a -- that's a tricky issue to consider, because 

9 suggestion coming from the police is different from 

manipulation. And if -- if the rule is unintended 

11 suggestion from the police implicates due process, then 

12 Perry was entitled to a due process analysis, because 

13 the unintended suggestion here was apparent police 

14 suspicion as he stood there.

 MR. DELANEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

suspect and use unnecessarily suggestive techniques that

1 skew the fact-finding process. The central concern --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now we've changed the 

3 language of Wade when it talks about intentional or 

4 unintentional. And you're suggesting that police 

manipulation always has to be intentionally suggestive? 

6  MR. DELANEY: I'm not --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if the policeman 

8 tells you he wasn't really thinking or focusing on a 

9 distinguishing characteristic in the line-up?

 MR. DELANEY: That may play a role, Justice 

11 Sotomayor, but only in a limited sense, and not in the 

12 way the Petitioner is suggesting we look at 

13 unintentional conduct. First, for the due process 

14 inquiry to trigger, there must be an arranged 

confrontation of a suspect and a witness by the police. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

17 you think would have happened here? There was a reason 

18 the police asked this defendant to stay put. They 

19 didn't want him to leave the scene, correct?

 MR. DELANEY: That -- that's correct. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In your judgment -- I 

22 think Justice Kennedy hit the nail on the head. My 

23 suspicion is that at some point they would have asked 

24 the witnesses in the building and engaged in a show-up. 

What's so different between intentionally doing the

1 show-up and holding the defendant in the back yard 

2 standing there next to a police officer, so that anyone 

3 who wants to -- like this woman, who wants to find the 

4 guy, can just point to that one? What's the difference?

 MR. DELANEY: The difference in this case is 

6 the role that the police played in bringing about 

7 potential suggestion under your hypothetical. What the 

8 Due Process Clause is concerned about is the role of the 

9 police in essentially stacking the deck, putting their 

thumb on the scale and skewing the fact-finding process. 

11 It goes to the integrity of the process --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. I mean, the way not 

13 to skew it was to put him in the police car and just let 

14 him sit there in the dark. So, they intentionally made 

him wait at the scene of the crime. 

16  I'm not talking about whether this was 

17 necessary or unnecessary, because I think that a 

18 perfectly good argument could be made that the police 

19 acted reasonably and necessarily. All right? It makes 

no sense to move a defendant that far from the scene of 

21 a crime if you're not sure he's the one who committed 

22 the crime, he or she. 

23  But I'm going to the question of how do we 

24 define, if we write this opinion, manipulation without 

getting into a mens rea type analysis and adding yet

1 another layer to Biggers? 

2  MR. DELANEY: Well, first, I don't think you 

3 need to go there in this case. You can simply say that, 

4 based on the factual findings of the State court, the 

police did not induce any type of show-up --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not -- we face 

7 that problem anyway, even if we -- whether or not we 

8 decide in this case that it doesn't matter that the 

9 police manipulated it, we're always going to have the 

problem of when has there been police manipulation; 

11 right? 

12  MR. DELANEY: That's correct. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that -- that's not 

14 a creation of this -- of this case.

 MR. DELANEY: That's correct. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: And I -- I would guess that 

17 in the case you're talking about, just telling the 

18 person to stay where he is, is not -- now, it would be 

19 different if -- if the defendant was -- was caught two 

blocks away and the police bring him back to the scene 

21 of the crime and make him stand there so that the woman 

22 can see him from the window. That's quite different. 

23  MR. DELANEY: It is quite different. And 

24 Stovall tells us that the test is an objective one. We 

look at the totality of the circumstances to determine 

31

1 whether there has been suggestive conduct. 

2  Now, in that regard --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say 

4 that's -- when you say that's different, you're not --

you're not suggesting that that would be suggestive, are 

6 you? 

7  MR. DELANEY: No, I'm not. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because presumably, 

9 that's the same argument -- that's for the jury and the 

counsel. They can say during cross-examination the guy 

11 was two blocks away, you know, and wasn't it only 

12 because the police brought him back that you -- you 

13 know, all of that. I don't see what difference it makes 

14 in terms of whether you have a suppression hearing 

before the trial. 

16  MR. DELANEY: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

17 Justice. It would not make a difference in that regard. 

18 And on the facts of this case, we do have clear factual 

19 findings that this police officer in no way -- in no way 

induced this witness to move towards the window and 

21 identify a suspect who just happened to be standing next 

22 to a police officer. 

23  If the concern under due process in this 

24 area has been a deterrence rationale, which this Court 

has stated in both Neil v. Biggers and in Manson v.

Official 

1 Brathwaite, that must be the guiding principle. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's both, right, 

3 General Delaney? I mean, the Court has certainly talked 

4 about deterrence, but the Court also has very 

substantial discussions in all of these opinions about 

6 reliability. And from the criminal defendant's point of 

7 view, it doesn't really much matter whether the 

8 unreliability is caused by police conduct or by 

9 something else.

 So -- so, tell me a little bit why you think 

11 the police conduct here -- you know, that has to be 

12 there in every case? 

13  MR. DELANEY: That is true, Justice Kagan, 

14 that -- that the opinions have discussed both issues. 

And I would offer two considerations. First, to the 

16 extent that the courts have talked about reliability as 

17 the linchpin or the likelihood of misidentification 

18 playing a role, they have only done that read in context 

19 within and only after an unnecessarily suggestive 

circumstance has been applied. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: I think that that's not 

22 right. I mean, the reason we want to deter this conduct 

23 is because the conduct results in misidentifications, in 

24 unreliable testimony. That's the reason that deterrence 

is an important goal, is because this conduct leads to 

33
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 unreliable testimony. 

2  MR. DELANEY: That is correct, and if we 

3 expand that out and we apply that rationale to the 

4 circumstances of a case not involving police activity, 

we lose that deterrence rationale. There is no 

6 deterrence involved in a suggestive circumstance that 

7 does not involve the police. Civilians are not going to 

8 be repeat players in this system. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what you're -- what 

you're saying, I take it, in the answer to Justice 

11 Kagan, was that there's really a two-part step. First, 

12 was the police procedure unnecessarily suggestive? And 

13 then if it was, are there other reliability -- was 

14 reliability impaired?

 So, you go -- you ask both questions. 

16  MR. DELANEY: And that is the Biggers test. 

17 And if we looked at reliability further as sort of the 

18 touchstone of our due process inquiry, we would need to 

19 misplace completely the role of examining whether the 

suggestive circumstances are unnecessary. An -- an 

21 inquiry into necessity only makes sense in the context 

22 of a police investigation or police work. And if we 

23 look at Stovall, certainly there's an example of a case 

24 that was a show-up, where this Court said that, despite 

the clearly suggestive circumstances, that show-up was 

34
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 imperative and necessary because the witness may have 

2 been about to die. 

3  The Court did not conduct a reliability 

4 analysis. So, if reliability is the linchpin, it puts 

the Stovall holding in question, and really Stovall 

6 would be undermined. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: What you seem to -- what 

8 you're saying -- what you're saying seems to suggest 

9 that the rule we're talking about here is really not an 

aspect of due process per se, but, like the Fourth 

11 Amendment exclusionary rule, it's a special due process 

12 exclusionary rule that is meant to deter conduct that 

13 could result in a constitutional violation. 

14  Is that right?

 MR. DELANEY: I -- I think that's correct, 

16 Justice Alito. And the analogy I would use would be to 

17 your perjury cases. In Mooney, you have clearly set a 

18 due process standard that prevents police or prosecutors 

19 from knowingly using false evidence. And the concern 

there is how the police will skew the fact-finding 

21 process. Stovall and the identification cases are very 

22 similar to that. 

23  Our concern, in essence, is that the police 

24 through unnecessary suggestion in that circumstance are 

going to skew the fact-finding process and, in this 

35

1 instance, in essence, create a false or altered memory. 

2  JUSTICE ALITO: If -- if the exclusionary 

3 aspect of this is not part of due process itself, then 

4 doesn't it follow that what due process requires is 

reliability? So, doesn't that mean that -- that the 

6 Petitioner's argument is correct, the due process 

7 standard is simply reliability, not suggestiveness? 

8  MR. DELANEY: It's -- the standard is not 

9 reliability, Justice Alito. The standard for due 

process in this area is the use of orchestrated police 

11 suggestion. In --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what about cases 

13 with inflammatory evidence, too many lurid photos or 

14 testimony that ignites prejudice in the community? 

That's -- that's a -- that's reliability. 

16  MR. DELANEY: That is, and we have both 

17 constitutional and non-constitutional tools and 

18 procedures right now to address that. At the base, we 

19 require prosecutors, under Jackson v. Virginia, to have 

some minimum level of evidence so that a rational trier 

21 of fact can establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

22  Above that, under the Sixth Amendment, we 

23 provide tools and procedures that allow a defendant to 

24 assess the reliability of evidence through 

cross-examination and summation and the right to 

36
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 counsel. And, beyond that, we have non-constitutional 

2 sources under the rules of evidence that are 

3 specifically designed to assess the relevance and the 

4 reliability of the evidence. But if we go before that 

and say that the Due Process Clause, after all that, has 

6 some additional standing in -- in your jurisprudence to 

7 assess reliability, we really have gone to a very 

8 different place. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: You have two cases. You 

have Mr. Perry's case; then you have another case that's 

11 very similar. In fact, it's identical, except that in 

12 that instance the police officer talking to the witness 

13 said, would you take a look out the window and see if 

14 you recognize anybody?

 Now, from the perspective of the defendants, 

16 the cases are -- seem -- as far as whether they get a 

17 fair trial, the cases are identical; are they not? The 

18 evidence is the same. The suggestiveness is the same. 

19  MR DELANEY: No, Justice Alito. Those cases 

are quite different. And to the extent we did have 

21 objective evidence that the police here had in some way 

22 brought that woman to the window to, in essence, conduct 

23 a show-up, then we may have triggered the first prong of 

24 Biggers. And the court would then be required to do two 

things: First, to determine whether the circumstances 

37
 
Alderson Reporting Company

10

15

25

Official 

1 were suggestive and, independent of that, also determine 

2 whether it was necessary or not, depending on the 

3 circumstances of the investigation. 

4  So, if in fact the police officer had 

directed the witness to the window, there may be at
 

6 least grounds for the Biggers and Manson analysis to
 

7 come into play. These facts are very different from
 

8 that.
 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm not sure you
 

answered Justice Alito's questions about why there 

11 should be this difference between these two cases. Now, 

12 you might want to say that where police conduct is 

13 involved, the chances of an unreliable identification 

14 are greater. Or you may want to say something else. 

But the question is: If we're focused on reliability, 

16 why are those two cases any different? 

17  MR. DELANEY: Well, if we do look back, to 

18 determine whether the circumstances involving the police 

19 are any more -- of more serious concern, if we look back 

to Wade, this Court did talk about the unique role of 

21 police suggestion in this context of confrontations, and 

22 it specifically focused on the manner and the degree of 

23 suggestion in which the manner that police or 

24 prosecution present a witness, present a witness to a 

suspect, what impact that can have.

1  That unique aspect of police suggestibility, 

2 the fact that a police officer when it brings someone 

3 forward is going to influence a witness to a high 

4 degree, does play a role and is the grounds upon which 

the Stovall cases have been built. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, tell me -- they gave 

7 the hypothetical of the police pointing out the 

8 defendant out the window. But earlier you said it might 

9 be a different case if the defendant was two blocks away 

and they brought him back. Same scenario. They do 

11 that, bring him back two blocks; make him stand at the 

12 scene of the crime; and go upstairs, talk to the woman 

13 and she spontaneously says it's the guy standing over 

14 there. That would entitle the defendant to a Wade 

motion? To a Wade hearing? 

16  MR. DELANEY: You would look at the 

17 totality of the circumstances. And to the extent from 

18 an objective standpoint it could be demonstrated that 

19 the police intentionally brought that witness back to 

the scene --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're now -- we're now 

22 at mens rea again. So, what has surprised me about this 

23 case is in some ways the way the State court wrote this, 

24 because if the State court had simply said something 

like there was no unnecessary show-up here, they were

1 just holding someone until they could figure out what 

2 happened, there was no suggestiveness by the police 

3 because the woman pointed out the window, throw out the 

4 motion, we wouldn't be here. The argument has become 

something else now because you're trying to define a 

6 level of intent on the part of the police to create 

7 unreliability that I think just complicates the inquiry. 

8  MR. DELANEY: And I -- and, Justice 

9 Sotomayor, I'm not trying to create that complication. 

And, in fact, I would -- I would reference the State 

11 court decision a little bit differently. It did ground 

12 its holding specifically in a finding that there were no 

13 sort of suggestive techniques at play here and no 

14 inducement. The trial court order very specifically 

said it disagrees with the show-up characterization, 

16 that the witness had pointed out the Petitioner without 

17 any inducement from the police officer; the officer did 

18 not direct the witness's attention to the window, and 

19 the officer did not ask whether a man in the parking lot 

was the man who broke into the cars. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I think that --

22  MR. DELANEY: On those facts, that can 

23 dispose of this case without getting into the issue of 

24 mens rea.

4 the need for police manipulation. If you define it that 

way, then we do get into a mens rea discussion rather 

6 than what I think Biggers and Wade were about, which is 

7 are the circumstances created by the police 

8 unnecessarily suggestive. 

9  MR. DELANEY: Yes. And I agree with you 

that the inquiry under the -- under the first prong of 

11 Biggers is just that. It's an objective inquiry based 

12 on the totality of the circumstances. 

13  If there are no further questions -- because 

14 the defendant's conviction was the product of a fair 

trial, because the State court properly applied this 

16 Court's jurisprudence and precedent in the area of 

17 eyewitness identifications, and because the Petitioner's 

18 proposed rule would markedly expand this Court's due

State court judgment be affirmed.

24  ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

25

Official 

1  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

2  MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

3 please the Court: 

4  A due process inquiry is required only when 

there's a police-arranged confrontation in order to 

6 obtain an identification and then the police 

7 unnecessarily suggest that a certain suspect is guilty. 

8 And that's because, as the State has said, the Court's 

9 central concern in these cases is the State putting a 

thumb on the scales, gaining an unfair advantage. Just 

11 as, as Justice Scalia said, the State can't create a 

12 false document and introduce it at trial, it can't 

13 manipulate someone's memory and then use that evidence 

14 to prove guilt at trial.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, do you mean to say, Ms. 

16 Saharsky, that there can never be a due process 

17 violation from the admission of unreliable evidence? 

18 Assuming that the State has not created that evidence, 

19 has not produced that evidence, but the State knows that 

the evidence is unreliable or has a very substantial 

21 chance of being so, that that can never be a due process 

22 violation? 

23  MS. SAHARSKY: I'm saying that's where the 

24 Court's cases are now. The State can't knowingly 

introduce perjured testimony, but you're not talking 

42

Official 

1 about perjured, knowingly perjured, testimony.
 

2  If the question is just unreliable, the
 

3 Court has said on numerous occasions -- it's rejected
 

4 claims like that and said the Constitution doesn't
 

protect to ensure all evidence is reliable. It provides 

6 a process by which the court can test reliability 

7 through cross-examination, confrontation, et cetera. 

8 The Court has -- and that was in Crawford. 

9  The Court has also said -- and if I could 

just add one more thing -- in the due process context, 

11 that where the check comes in is in Jackson v. Virginia, 

12 that the verdict has to have enough evidence to be 

13 supported, each element of the crime, beyond a 

14 reasonable doubt that a rational jury could find it. 

So, that is a due process check. 

16  But where the Court's cases stand today, the 

17 Court has not found, so far as we can tell, a case where 

18 it said that the mere introduction of unreliable 

19 evidence would violate the Due Process Clause. And 

every time it's been confronted with a claim like that, 

21 in Dowling, for example, in Colorado v. Connelly, the 

22 Court has rejected such a claim. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'll give you an extreme 

24 example. The extreme example is where an identification 

has been produced by torture, but the torture has been 

43

25

Official 

1 by a non-State actor. Same answer? 

2  MS. SAHARSKY: That is an extreme example. 

3 There are many reasons why (a) the prosecution would 

4 never introduce that kind of evidence to begin with and 

(b) that there would be other checks on the process in 

6 addition to the confrontation and cross-examination 

7 types of things that we talked about. 

8  There would be a check on the process 

9 through Brady and Giglio, for example, that if the 

government knew that those were the circumstances of the 

11 identification, they would have to turn that evidence 

12 over to the other side. There would also be checks in 

13 terms of the trial process if the government actually 

14 put on evidence like that. So, it is -- it is very 

unlikely that such a thing would happen. 

16  We're not saying that the Court has to hold 

17 in this case that due process could never play a role 

18 there. But what we're saying here is this is very 

19 routine, run-of-the-mill evidence. Someone who saw what 

happened and wants to come into court and tell the jury 

21 that. And, as Justice Kennedy noted, you know, what 

22 Petitioner is asking for here is to take all of those 

23 away from the jury, really usurping the jury function 

24 and having these mini-trials where the court itself is 

trying to decide reliability.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is interesting. I was 

2 trying to find a case where some other class of evidence 

3 was excluded because it's unreliable. And as --

4 Thompson v. Louisville, as you say, is just insufficient 

evidence, and that's different. Inflammatory evidence 

6 might be an example. 

7  MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I mean, that's 

8 different because --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Lurid photos or something 

like that. 

11  MS. SAHARSKY: I mean, there you have, first 

12 of all, a separate constitutional provision of an 

13 impartial jury, and you have you a direct influence upon 

14 the jury. So, it's not just unreliable evidence being a 

due process problem. You have this separate Sixth 

16 Amendment protection, and then you have it acting 

17 directly on the jury. So, we think that's a different 

18 case. In the due process context, where the Court's 

19 cases have really focused is on the State tilting the 

scales, the State corrupting the process by knowingly 

21 introducing perjured testimony or by, for example, 

22 refusing to disclose material exculpatory evidence. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think there were some 

24 early cases when fingerprint testimony couldn't come in, 

when fingerprint technology was just new. I don't know

1 if those were due process or not. 

2  MS. SAHARSKY: I can't say. I mean, when 

3 you look -- when look at the Court's more current cases, 

4 though, to the extent that the Court has heard arguments 

like this evidence is too unreliable, we need a special 

6 Constitutional rule, for example, in Ventris, with 

7 respect to jailhouse snitches, the Court rejected that 

8 argument. When the Court was told in Colorado v. 

9 Connelly there were concerns about reliability, it said, 

no, reliability is up to the jury, and it uses the State 

11 rules of evidence, and this Court's not going to be a 

12 rulemaking organ for rules of procedure. The 

13 Constitution puts in place the various checks on the 

14 process: compulsory process, cross-examination, et 

cetera. And then outside of that, it's really the role 

16 of the States to mold the trial process. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: I was intrigued by what your 

18 brief said about Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Do you 

19 think that a Federal judge under that rule may exclude 

the testimony of a witness on the ground that the 

21 witness is, in the judgment of the trial judge, 

22 completely unbelievable? 

23  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean you would need 

24 to meet the standard of Rule 403, which is that the --

the probative value of the witness would be

1 substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. I think 

2 it is unlikely that evidence would -- of an eyewitness, 

3 which the Court has said, particularly in cases like 

4 Biggers and Manson, is fairly probative, important 

evidence; the Court wanted to let it in, even in the 

6 circumstances of where you know, the police played a 

7 role in manipulation. So, probably, no, the Court 

8 wouldn't -- wouldn't take the evidence --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: But you think in theory that 

could be done? So, if you put on a cooperating witness 

11 in the case and this witness has made a hundred 

12 inconsistent statements previously and has been 

13 convicted of perjury, that the judge could just say you 

14 can't put that witness on because that person is -- is a 

liar, and I'm not going to have the witness testify in 

16 my courtroom? 

17  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean, Rule 403 isn't 

18 talking about whether evidence is true or false. It's 

19 talking about unfair prejudice to the jury, unfair 

prejudice being -- outweighing the probative value of 

21 the testimony. So, you know, I think it would be a call 

22 for the judge in that individual case. I don't know 

23 that that -- that that kind of argument has been made 

24 very often.

 But it's not just that trial protection;

1 there are numerous trial protections outside of the
 

2 constitutional limits that the States have put into
 

3 place specifically with respect to eyewitness
 

4 identification testimony. For example, there are
 

special jury instructions that most States use, and New 

6 Hampshire used special jury instructions here. And 

7 there's something that's really notable about these 

8 instructions, which is that what Petitioner wants is, 

9 when the jury has made a determination here, looking at 

factors like how far was the witness away from the 

11 person, how long was it before -- between the crime and 

12 when she made the identification, the jury heard all of 

13 those factors, heard argument on it, was instructed on 

14 those things, and it made a determination. And what 

Petitioner wants is for a trial court -- this Court, 

16 after the fact -- to use those exact same factors and 

17 come to a different conclusion. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the -- was the Daubert 

19 case, our expert witness case where you have to have a 

threshold showing -- was that due process or was that 

21 just -- that was just rule of evidence. 

22  MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, it was just interpreting 

23 Rule of Evidence 702. So, you know, at the end of the 

24 day, what -- what Petitioner is really asking for here 

is not some kind of threshold inquiry, but really taking

1 the question of reliability away from the jury. And it 

2 would be a very big change in our system. And --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we did it --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are a 

number of circuits that already follow your adversary 

6 rules. I think it's not just one or two. It's about 

7 five or six. 

8  The floodgates open there? How many -- how 

9 many suppressions of witness identification has occurred 

in those circuits? 

11  MS. SAHARSKY: It is not many, but the 

12 principle the Petitioner is arguing for is a significant 

13 one. It is that the Due Process Clause protects 

14 against -- protects reliability. And I assure you that 

once this Court says that that is the case, that there 

16 will be defendants throughout the United States making 

17 arguments about all different kinds of evidence, not 

18 involving the police, being unreliable and that that all 

19 needs to be taken away for -- from the jury, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, suppose the --

21 lie detectors, for example, that's been taken away from 

22 the jury on a categorical basis, right? 

23  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there are some State 

24 rules of evidence that do that, but, I mean, we're

1 fundamentally unfair at trial to not allow -- this --

2 to -- this evidence if given to the trial would be 

3 fundamentally unfair. And, you know, the Constitution 

4 has enshrined the jury as the fundamental guarantee, as 

the fundamental protector of liberty; and to think that 

6 that same Constitution through the Due Process Clause 

7 means that run-of-the-mill evidence has to be taken away 

8 from the juries, that the trial court can itself look at 

9 factors like how good of a view the person had --

JUSTICE ALITO: There surely is some minimal 

11 due process requirement for the admission of evidence, 

12 isn't there? Are you saying there is none? If a State 

13 abolished the hearsay rule, could it -- would it not be 

14 a violation of due process if the prosecution introduced 

quadruple hearsay? 

16  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think that there 

17 would initially be a problem with respect to the 

18 Confrontation Clause, and the court would probably go 

19 through the analysis that way. We're not saying that 

the court --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Let me give --

22 you're right. Let me give you another example. Let's 

23 say you have -- the State puts on a witness who -- who

1  MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And I think that the 

2 answer that I would give is the same one to the question 

3 Justice Kagan asked, which is where the Court is now, 

4 the Court has never said that the introduction of some 

kind of evidence is so unreliable it would violate due 

6 process. In Dowling, for example, it had evidence 

7 that --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is tea-leaf reading okay? 

9  MS. SAHARSKY: What I'm saying is the Court 

doesn't need to address that question here. It also 

11 doesn't need to foreclose it. But this is very 

12 run-of-the-mill evidence. It doesn't mean that the 

13 Court could never find that some kind of evidence is so 

14 problematic that the Due Process Clause could preclude 

its admission, but what we're talking about here is 

16 fairly run-of-the-mill evidence. 

17  I would just point the Court to the decision 

18 in Dowling, which was about a prior conviction for which 

19 the person had been acquitted; and then that evidence 

was let in at his trial, and he said that's a problem. 

21 That evidence is too unreliable and too prejudicial, and 

22 the Court said that's not for the Due Process Clause. 

23 The Constitution gives you the process to test evidence. 

24 It doesn't ensure that all of the evidence that's going 

be introduced be reliable. And that's what Petitioner

12  MR. GUERRIERO: I will try to make three 

13 points in those 2 minutes. 

14  I would ask the Court to consider the 

circumstances that would be excluded if the Court 

16 accepts the rule proposed by the State, that there has 

17 to be some intentional manipulation or intentional 

18 orchestration. Suppose that rather than the accidental 

19 or happenstance show-up we had here, suppose that the 

accident was in the line-up at the police station, and 

21 the police were completely in good faith, getting to the 

22 mental state issue, and -- but in spite of their good 

23 faith, there was suggestion in the line-up. Would the 

24 trial court look at that and say, even though this was a 

suggestive line-up, we're not going to consider a due

1 process claim because it wasn't intentional or 

2 deliberate manipulation? We would suggest that that 

3 would be contrary to the principle that the primary evil 

4 is the risk of misidentification.

 Consider another circumstance. Suppose 

6 there are two witnesses at the police station, and in 

7 spite of the best efforts and good rules of the police, 

8 witness one looks at the line-up and then -- or looks at 

9 the photo line-up so that they can't be changed, let's 

say, and leaves the line-up and somehow communicates to 

11 witness two, I picked the one on the bottom at the 

12 right; I think that's the one. That suggestion would be 

13 very powerful from the person who experienced the very 

14 same crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Tell that to the jury. 

16 What jury isn't going to be -- I mean, the more 

17 persuasive your argument is, the more likely it is that 

18 a jury will take care of that. 

19  MR. GUERRIERO: The problem is that the 

witnesses who have -- are under the suggestive influence 

21 actually believe what they're testifying to, and the --

22 that's why the Court said in Wade cross-examination for 

23 this one kind of evidence -- not floodgates, but this 

24 one kind of evidence -- cross-examination may not always 

be enough. The witness's sincerity has a powerful

1 effect on the jury. 

2  The last point I want to make is that this 

3 is not going to open the floodgates, as we say, or 

4 create a slew of new claims. Under the Watkins case, 

this Court knows that there -- there's not even required 

6 to have a separate hearing on this evidence. And the 

7 reason a separate hearing isn't required is because 

8 these issues would be fleshed out in front of the jury. 

9  This is only a question of what legal 

standard applies when the judge hears the defendant's 

11 objection that this violates due process, there's a --

12 there's a substantial likelihood of misidentification. 

13 So, it's not any new claims. It's not any separate 

14 hearings. It's simply a question of what exactly is the 

due process rule.
