 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board 

of Education. 

Mr. Gordon.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEDDY B. GORDON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Crystal Meredith wanted to do what most moms 

and dads do all across this country. She wanted to put 

her son's hand in hers and walk around the corner and 

enroll her son in school.

 But the enrollment, there was a barrier, and 

the pickaxe, that barrier was person satisfied as a 

quota. There were seats within the school. It wasn't 

at capacity. It wasn't near any one of the percentages 

or tipping percentages that the quota system in 

Jefferson County public schools applied. But she was 

not allowed in.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that because she 

applied 4 months late? If she had applied before the 

deadline in March, would you be here? Would there be 

any issue?

MR. GORDON: Well, of course, Justice 

Ginsburg, she moved into the system in August. When she 

moved into the system, she was assigned to a school 

called Breckenridge-Franklin, which was an all year 

round school. Then she was -- her choice was managed 

and she was sent an hour away from where her other 

school is. She applied by transfer, which is the system 

that you use.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was she living 

before?

 MR. GORDON: I think she was living in 

Florida, and she moved into Kentucky.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So she -- that was --

August was the first opportunity she had to apply?

 MR. GORDON: Yes. So that's across the 

board. Anyone that moves in, they are -- there is a 

cluster school or an attempt school, and if you are not 

-- a majority of the time you are not allowed there 

because of your race. In other words, they want to 

assign children to schools that don't have the greater 

percentages of either African-American or Caucasian. So 

in Bloom Elementary, although it was 67-33 -- and keep 

in mind in kindergarten, according to their own rules 

and regulations, didn't even apply. The plan was so 

inflexible --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But she, she could 

have -- if she had been there at the deadline, the child 

would have been admitted to -- if she had been there in 

March instead of August?

 MR. GORDON: But the deadline applies to 

that school which presumably is closest to one's 

residence. Now, whether or not you get into that school 

or don't get into the school still depends on the quota.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're past that. 

When she didn't get the assignment that she requested 

for her son --

MR. GORDON: Sure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- did she appeal that?

 MR. GORDON: She filed a transfer. The 

transfer was denied. And at that time, litigation had 

commenced and because litigation had commenced -- and 

routinely these appeals are denied. All of her efforts 

were futile.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about for first 

grade? Did she make an application for first grade?

 MR. GORDON: Me understanding is that she 

did. That was denied, because the only time Joshua got 

into --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's in the record, 

that she made an application for the first grade?

MR. GORDON: I believe it is. I believe it 

is. In either event, if she didn't it would have been 

futile because we had already made her the third amended 

complaint on behalf of all the parties, and we had asked 

for injunctive relief within the litigation. But Joshua 

did not get into the school because of -- until they 

moved. They had to move a block away. So if you live 

in one block and you can't get into that school, your 

choice is managed. The plan was clearly inflexibility 

and it didn't apply to kindergarten anyhow, but it still 

caused our Joshua to go an hour away from his home.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a claim 

for damages as well.

 MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to this 

plaintiff?

 MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 

it's the third amended complaint, the May 2nd complaint, 

and there was a request for $25,000 damages.

 And within these schools, in other words, 

this honorable Court has never applied, other than in 

remedial, has never applied compelling interest in a K 

through 12 setting. In fact, those rights are not 

co-extensive. The school -- this honorable Court has 

previously stated in, for example, the Hazelwood case,

which was a First Amendment right case, that that didn't 

apply to K through 12, or should it be 1 through 12 

setting.

 And in the Hazelwood case, that was a basic 

First Amendment right and of course the First Amendment 

right was exactly what Justice Powell championed as 

academic freedom within the Bakke case. So clearly 

Bakke and Grutter are distinguishable. This falls into 

Gratz, where you clearly have a quota, not less than 15 

or greater than 50 percent, is totally inflexible as 

applied to our --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it compare with 

the system that was in effect from, what was it, 1975 

until 2000?

 MR. GORDON: I'm sorry. It's the same 

remedial program that -- this Court has found even in 

Dowd that when the remedial program has achieved its 

result we should no longer carve out that exemption 

under the Equal Protection Clause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that there's 

something of an anomaly there, that you have a system 

that is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it, 

works for 25 years, and then the school board doesn't 

have to keep it any more, but it decides it's worked 

rather well, so we'll keep it.

What's constitutionally required one day 

gets constitutionally prohibited the next day. That's 

very odd.

 MR. GORDON: Well, I take issue that it 

worked very well. In other words, did the Jefferson 

County --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The board decided it 

liked the way things were going, so it kept it or 

something close to it.

 MR. GORDON: Well, of course Brown versus 

Topeka Board of Education was time applicable. If you 

use time applicable now for the Jefferson County Public 

Schools --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the 

plan that they've had for 25 years, and they decided to 

keep it.

 MR. GORDON: And in the Hampton case, which 

I won, all right, they didn't go to any race-neutral 

alternatives at all. As Justice Kennedy pointed out --

I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Gordon, in responding 

to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal 

with the fact that this Court said in the second Swann 

case that the -- that a school district, particularly a 

school district like Swann which had been in violation,

had been found in violation, had the same interest after 

unitary status had been attained in maintaining the 

unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status 

beforehand; that if those interests are identical why 

doesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two 

interests, unitary status from segregation in one case, 

preservation of unitary status in the other, are 

reasonable if they are identical?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, this 

Court over and over again has said once a remedial plan 

is accepted there should be race-neutral alternatives 

under the narrow and tailored requirement. What this 

school board did after I won --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Race-neutral alternatives 

for what? To accomplish what?

 MR. GORDON: To accomplish the same means. 

In other words, what they could have done, as 

Justice Kennedy pointed out, was put more magnet 

schools, more traditional schools, have more open 

enrollment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gordon, isn't it the 

case that once you've achieved unitary status, which 

means that the effects of past intentional 

discrimination have been eliminated, the only way you 

can lose unitary status is to discriminate

intentionally? Isn't that right?

 MR. GORDON: Certainly. That's the Dow 

case, that says you no longer --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And isn't there a 

distinction between unitary status and unitary 

condition? Unitary condition is a descriptive 

situation. It describes a district in which there is, 

in fact, enough of a racial mix so that there is no 

credible claim either that there is de facto or de jure 

segregation; isn't that correct? There is such a thing 

as unitary, a unitary condition?

 MR. GORDON: Certainly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And is the preservation of 

a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling 

governmental objective?

 MR. GORDON: In Hampton, this -- our Court 

found that it was unitary status as opposed to unitary 

condition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Uh-huh.

 MR. GORDON: If you want to go with unitary 

condition, then I still think you go back to Brown and 

you say has it worked. In other words, let's make it 

time applicable. Does this honorable Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you mean, it 

doesn't work? I don't understand.

MR. GORDON: It hasn't worked. It just 

absolutely hasn't worked. So we've decided --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand what it 

is that hasn't worked.

 MR. GORDON: Why do we have to choose 

between diversity and educational outcome? I thought it 

was supposed to be both. Why can't we have diverse --

why can't we have them both. It's not diversity or 

educational outcome. It's diversity and educational 

outcome. For 30 years in this country --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I think that's what your 

friends on the other side are arguing.

 MR. GORDON: No. The friends on the other 

side are arguing that there's some type of improvement 

in educational outcome solely because you sit black 

children next to white children.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Not an improvement exactly, 

but maybe from the Constitution's point of view. That 

Constitution wanted, as they said in the Slaughterhouse 

cases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and 

their children and make them full members of American 

society. And part of that was that the State couldn't 

insist that they go to separate schools.

 Now, the question from a constitutional 

point of view that you're being asked is how could that

Constitution which says that this is intolerable, that 

segregated school, and insist that the school boards in 

Swann and elsewhere take the black children and white 

children and integrate them? How could the Constitution 

the day that that decree is removed tell the school 

board it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do 

what it's been doing, and we'll send the children back 

to their black schools and their white schools?

 That I take it is why the Court in Swann 

said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in 

the public schools when the school board so chooses. 

Now, that's the general question that I think 

Justice Ginsburg began and Justice Souter was following 

it up. And I would appreciate your response.

 MR. GORDON: My response is that you have 

those series of cases that say once you've achieved the 

unitary status, you know longer get to carve out that 

exemption to the Fourteenth Amendment, and if we're 

going to carve out these exemptions to the Fourteenth 

Amendment, if we're going to say we're going to not 

apply Gratz where it's a quota system and we are solely, 

without any type of individual holistic review applied 

to these kids, then there should be some improvement in

holistic review to a kindergartner?

 MR. GORDON: Well, of course this system 

didn't apply to kindergarten anyhow. But the answer is 

it's not. You have to decide.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I can understand an 

approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you 

judge it on all these merit factors and other factors. 

But for a child entering the first grade, I don't 

understand this individualized holistic approach. What 

else is there other than that the child is of a certain 

age and therefore will enter a certain grade?

 MR. GORDON: That it would violate your 

ruling in Gratz --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I want to know -- you 

said that there are alternate, alternative means, so I'm 

asking what they are.

 MR. GORDON: Out of Hampton, there was no 

race-neutral -- race alternative means used. For me, I 

would use all these millions of dollars. I would reduce 

teacher-student ratio. I would -- I would give 

incentive pay to the better teachers. I would more 

magnet schools, more traditional schools. We presuppose 

that we're going to have bad schools and good schools in 

this country. I don't think we can no longer, longer 

accept that.

We can no longer accept an achievement gap 

of 25 to 30 points by the majority of African American 

kids in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and throughout this 

country by the fourth grade. Educational outcome is the 

only key, the only key to unlock the chains of poverty.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's not that white 

children and black children are no longer sitting 

together on the same school benches?

 MR. GORDON: Then let's make sure they go to 

the better schools. In Jefferson County, Kentucky, 

racial politics is involved when we had so much white 

flight. African Americans in Jefferson County, 

Kentucky, the largest percent go to the worst performing 

schools. The lowest percent go to the better performing 

schools. That can't be constitutional. That can't be 

discriminatory, and that can't be an exemption under the 

Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection.

 I'd like to save a little bit, the remainder 

of my time, Your Honor.

 Petitioner's son was denied the opportunity 

to transfer from Young Elementary School to Bloom 

Elementary School solely on the basis of his race.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, can I ask 

you a question that's prompted really by your argument 

in the last case. I wonder about the purity of the 

motive that's required. Supposing you had a city like 

Chicago with a neighborhood school system and in one 

neighborhood there was a school that was 100 percent 

African American, both student body and faculty, and up 

on the North Side there's a school that's 100 percent 

white, both students and faculty. Would it be 

permissible for the school board to decide that it would 

be healthy for both schools to have five African 

American schools in the North Side school and five white 

teachers in the South Side school?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And then order that, hire 

teachers to do that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think I'd have to -- I 

mean, I think it would depend --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The only purpose is racial 

integration.

the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was 

done in a way that made it express that the teachers 

were going to be moved, that you were basically going to 

have five and five, you were going to have a quota at 

the two schools on the basis of race, I would say that 

that would be unconstitutional.

 I would think, though, that there are many 

ways you can accomplish similar objectives without 

making it so explicit. And I do think that in this 

context, I mean, there is an independent constitutional 

value in not having these kind of express racial 

classifications drawn.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand, and I'm just 

wondering whether in your view that independent value 

could ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing 

value of having some African Americans see some white 

teachers and vice versa?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but I think that's the 

point, which is that is an important objective, but I 

have little doubt that that can be accomplished without 

the kind of five by five quotas.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You have doubt -- you have 

little doubt. Are you an educational expert? I mean, 

the -- it seems to me from what I read, that there is a 

terrible problem in the country. The problem is that

there are lots and lots of school districts that are 

becoming more and more segregated in fact, and that 

school boards all over are struggling with this problem. 

And if they knew an easy way, they'd do it.

 So I don't know whether this is exactly the 

only way to do it or not. I do know courts are not very 

good at figuring that out. And I guess that's why the 

Court previously has said it is primarily up to the 

school district. What's your response?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whatever it takes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, if I could 

be clear, though, what I was saying in response to 

Justice Stevens' question was really focused not on the 

broader problem, but specifically with respect to 

faculties. And I think that one is a little easier in 

the sense that I don't know of any school districts that 

have tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in 

teaching that he was indicating. I'm not here to tell 

you that this problem is simple to solve. I'm here to 

tell you, though, that I think the Constitution provides 

an answer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just say some. We want 

to -- we're going to make a decision there will be some 

white teachers and some African-American teachers in the 

other. And we're going to do it no matter -- if the

Constitution permits it. And that's our only motive.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, let 

me tell you what I certainly think they could do, which 

is to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in 

these two faculties. What we're going to do is we're 

going to mix some of them up, we're going to do it in a 

way that looks at a variety of factors, including who is 

good with young kids, who is good with older kids.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: My example is 100 percent 

motive to avoid 100 percent segregation.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And I think if what they 

end up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent 

motive, but a racial classification, then I think runs 

afoul of the Constitution.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just some, any without 

violating the Constitution.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Just to be clear, our 

answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation, 

no racial classification, is that it is still okay. 

Now, some members of the Court may disagree with us on 

that. But what I would say is it probably doesn't have 

that great an import in practice, because although it is 

easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the 

absolute and sole motivating factor, I think in this 

context in particular, I mean, nobody -- you know,

nobody is trying to do this solely for a race-based 

motive. In this context, they also have an educational 

goal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement, do 

you know how Joshua would have been assigned prior to 

the establishment of unitary status in this case?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: He would clearly have been 

assigned to one school, and one set of schools on the 

basis of his race.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know 

whether that would have been the magnet or the so-called 

resides school or somewhere else?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I guess I don't. And 

maybe I'm missing something. But I think that -- you 

know, the dual school system predated the court ordered 

decree, which is part of where we have gotten to with 

resides schools and the like. If I can come back to the 

facts of this case, I think it's important to recognize 

that he was denied transfer to Bloom, even though there 

were empty seats available at Bloom school.

 So if he had been an African-American, he 

would have been allowed to transfer to Bloom. Instead, 

he was prevented. And there was an empty seat sitting 

there in that school. And that's why I think this case 

does prevent a very stark racial quota.

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you this, and I 

think this applies to the case we have got, as well as 

to Justice Stevens' hypothetical. You said in 

Justice Stevens' -- in answer to Justice Stevens' 

hypothetical, that they could achieve a result, 

legitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within 

the respective faculties of these schools if they took 

other things in addition to race into consideration. 

You mentioned ability as teachers and so on.

 But at the end of the day, the object of 

doing this, which Justice Stevens' hypo assumed, and I 

think the object of doing it which your answer assumed, 

was the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties.

 My question is: Why do thy have to hide the 

ball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other 

things, ability to teach, educational credits, whatever 

you could come up with when at the beginning and at the 

end, the objective is to achieve a racial mix?

 Why can't they do that candidly and employ a 

criterion that candidly addresses that objective?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, 

there are several responses. One is that the 

Constitution puts a particular premium on avoiding 

express racial classifications.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it has developed that

concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to 

hurt or to stigmatize. Here, there is stigmatization 

going on as between black and white, when we say there 

is a value in mixing them up.

 Therefore, why should that same concern 

about referring to race at all be applied in this case.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, you 

may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it 

was clear there was stigma going on, but you have 

extended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board. 

And I have to say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We have extended it in 

cases in which benefits were being denied. In 

Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and so far as I know in 

the kindergarten system in these cases, no educational 

benefit was being denied.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Nothing was being rationed.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think choices were 

being denied. And I think you made the distinction 

earlier between an educational -- guarantee of some 

educational opportunity and a choice. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that is simply another 

way -- when you say it is the choice that's being 

denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis,

that is simply another way of saying you may never use 

the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the 

educational objective. You're saying the same thing in 

a different way.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That may be, 

Justice Souter. But what I guess I would say is the 

logic of your argument would certainly require 

reconsideration of the Gratz case. And this Court in 

that context thought that individualized consideration 

even if it was going to be very difficult in the context 

of the University of Michigan's 25,000 admissions to the 

undergraduate program, this Court said individualized 

consideration was part of the constitutional guarantee.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In Gratz, the 

characteristics of individuals that could be considered 

were arguably relevant to a distribution decision. 

Here, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by 

relaxing other standards. The whole point is to achieve 

a value which comes from mixing the races, from 

distribution.

 And, therefore, why is it appropriate to 

look to other things as opposed to looking at that 

candidly, if that is a legitimate objective?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Because I think, 

Justice Souter, if you think it is an important value to

have a degree of integration in the schools, well, I 

think you can take race neutral means that will get you 

a degree of integration in the schools.  What I think is 

troubling, and what happens in cases like this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you may use those race 

neutral means only for the purpose of achieving that 

mixture. I take it that's the assumption of your 

answer.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The objective is fine. The 

important thing is simply to hide the ball.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But if you decide that 

candor is an affirmative good in the use -- in the race 

area, I think what you get is necessarily what you have 

here, which is strict racial bands. 50, 15 percent. 

That's not a degree of integration. It is a clear 

effort to try to get the individual schools to mimic the 

overall demographics --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why is -- I'm trying to 

find out -- I understand what you think of Gratz. We 

can agree or disagree about that. But the overall view 

of the Constitution, that interpretation that you have 

in your mind, if it really forbids it, no use of race, I 

mean, basically -- all right? Think -- go back to 

Cooper versus Aaron. Go back to the case where this

Court with paratroopers had to use tremendous means to 

get those children into the school. That's because the 

society was divided.

 Here we have a society, black and white, who 

elect school board members who together have voted to 

have this form of integration. Why, given that change 

in society -- which is a good one -- what -- how can the 

Constitution be interpreted in a way that would require 

us, the judges, to go in and make them take the black 

children out of the school?

 See, my objection to your approach to the 

Constitution is primarily a practical one.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I understand that, 

Justice Breyer. But I think the answer to that is that 

the lesson of history in this area is that racial 

classifications are not ones where we should just let 

local school board officials do what they think is 

right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Are you prepared to just 

say, all right, they can do it some, just be careful 

about it? How far will you go with that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think everybody concedes 

that strict scrutiny is going to apply here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're 

saying we'll do it some, just be careful about it?

GENERAL CLEMENT: No, we would -- you know, 

I think we would have to look at the details of the 

plan. That's what narrow tailoring meant. And I think 

that's what -- you know, Justice Kennedy made the point 

in his opinion in Grutter that the problem with 

approving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see 

to use race in a context is that then you deprive the 

courts of any role trying to refine matters, and seeing, 

maybe the racial situation would be narrowly tailored, 

but it is sure not these 50-15 bands.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Judge Kozinski thought the 

real problem here was we should not deify strict 

scrutiny. That's what's caused all the problems.

probably could have cited two of your opinions for that 

proposition. But you know, the rest of us do have to 

work with --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is often true that 

sometimes doctrines do have unintended consequences when 

you push the logic of extremes. There is no doubt about 

that.

that, but the rest of us do have to work with this

unintended consequences when this Court ignores them.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. And it also 

has some real world consequences when we decides we're 

not going to apply the normal scrutiny we would to 

racial classifications just because we've made some -- I 

don't know based on what judgment that in this case, it 

is benign, so we can trust the local school officials.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it isn't that we've 

made a judgment, the local school board has made a 

judgment which has a lot of experience under both 

systems.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: There's a lot of 

experience in Brown, too, and those were local school 

boards, too. And I think the lesson is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know the race of the 

school board here? I mean, that was not -- how do we 

know these are benign school boards? Is it stipulated 

that they are benign school boards?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I missed that in the joint 

stipulation, Justice Scalia. I would like to say one --

if I could make one point here, which is, I really do 

think that it's worth looking at how this operates in 

practice. And the fact that it leaves seats effectively 

fallow in schools. Because that really marks it as a 

quota. And it's interesting, when that same district

court judge --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that how it worked 

under the plan that was forced on the school district? 

I thought it was roughly the same plan?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It was, Justice Ginsburg. 

But I think there's a difference when you move past 

unitary status. It's interesting. In the very case 

where the court, Hampton II, where the same district 

court found unitary status, he then because the Equal 

Protection Clause was not shielded by the decree, had to 

apply it to the use of these same racial bands in the 

context of magnet schools.

 And what did this same district court judge 

find there? He found they operated, quote, as a hard 

racial quota. Because the effect of these 50-15 bands 

was to keep hundreds of seats at Central High School, a 

popular magnet school empty, and away from 

African-American students because the district wanted to 

maintain its predetermined racial balance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right in thinking 

that the government in 2000 opposed terminating this --

the compulsory plan?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: You mean the United States 

government?

GENERAL CLEMENT: Or the school board? They 

actually both opposed, which is something -- shows you 

something of the anomalies that you can get from this 

situation, which is the school board wanting to continue 

its practice of using these racial guidelines actually 

opposed the finding of unitary status. I would say, 

though --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was the 

United States?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yeah, we had some specific 

objections in which we thought that two of the green 

factors were not satisfied. That argument was rejected 

by the district court.

 If I can go back to the judge's finding 

about the magnet schools, what is so interesting is the 

same judge finds the same guidelines to be a hard racial 

quota as to the magnet schools, but not as to the 

neighborhood schools. Why does he make that 

distinction? Because he finds that the neighborhood 

schools are basically equal, and therefore, denying a 

student an opportunity to attend to one rather than 

another was not an injury of constitutional magnitude.

 But I would have thought it is far too late 

in the day, and the Chief Justice suggested this as 

well, to say that just because two schools are basically

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS J. MELLEN, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. MELLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case presents a story of a community 

that once maintained racially segregated schools, that 

desegregated those schools only when a court ordered it, 

and that today maintains racially integrated schools 

with broad community support.

 This case presents a story of a board of 

education that replaced a desegregation decree with a 

student assignment plan that works, that stopped the 

white flight that was the result of the desegregation 

decree and has stabilized enrollment in our public 

schools. This case presents a success story and it's a 

success that was achieved in compliance with this 

Court's strict scrutiny test.

story where the meaning of Brown versus Board of

Education is you can never take race out of politics?

 MR. MELLEN: I think, Your Honor, that Brown 

is very much distinguishable. In Brown, the Topeka 

board maintained two systems of schools. And admission 

to those schools, admission, not assignment, was based 

solely on race. That stigmatized the black children. 

It sent the message that the white race was dominant and 

superior and that the black race was inferior. That 

caused great harm to those black students and this Court 

properly remediated it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And this doesn't? I mean, 

this which is somehow based on the notion that a school 

that is predominantly black or overwhelmingly black 

cannot be as good as a school that is predominantly 

white or overwhelmingly white? That doesn't send any 

message?

 MR. MELLEN: The plan, Your Honor, is not 

based solely on that supposition. This plan is based on 

the supposition that a school that is racially 

identifiable, and that would include a white racially 

identifiable school, does not provide to the students in 

that school the compelling benefits that our board 

believes are presented by racial integration.

 The compelling benefits, some of which are 

the benefits that this Court identified in Grutter, from

the racial diversity that was a byproduct --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about white 

flight, you're not talking about black flight. And 

what's going on here is makes sure that there are a 

certain number of white students or as high a proportion 

as you can get. In schools that would be otherwise be 

overwhelmingly black. And it seems to me if you are 

appealing to stigmatization, that -- that is based on an 

assumption that it seems to me is stigmatizing.

 MR. MELLEN: This plan -- and the Federal 

courts have held for years school districts do have an 

interest in avoiding white flight. And As I said, this 

plan has prevented -- has stopped white flight and has 

stabilized enrollment in our schools.

 But this -- this plan was adopted, Your 

Honor, for the purpose of providing the compelling 

benefits of racial integration, some of which this Court 

identified in Grutter, some of which the District Court 

found were not present in the University of Michigan Law 

School case, but are present in an elementary and 

secondary system of schools. For example, the District 

Court found that this plan makes our public schools more 

competitive and attractive and results in broader 

community support for those schools.

true. I think it is also probably true that the people 

in your community and the people on your school board 

are acting in the utmost good faith. And that what they 

have done is going to help the education of many 

students.

 The question is whether or not we can say 

that an insincere school board, people that want to play 

the race card, who want to play the race trip, the --

the race chip, that want a system in which they can use 

race for political advantage, can do this based on the 

color of the individual child's skin. That's what's 

involved here.

 MR. MELLEN: I don't think that's what is 

involved in this case, Your Honor, because the District 

Court found that the board's motives were indeed 

legitimate and that there was no basis --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm conceding that. The 

Constitution assumes that this might not always be the 

case. Are we going to look at the sincerity of the 

school boards, school by school board, school board 

member by school board member?

 MR. MELLEN: I don't think that would be 

proper for the courts to do that, Your Honor, but the 

other issue that's presented by these cases is whether 

the use of race is narrowly tailored. And the District

Court found in this case that it was, was for a variety 

of reasons. So I think that this case does not, Your 

Honor, present the hypothetical that you suggested and 

in other cases with different factors --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it, but it presents 

the principle that this Court is confronted with. If we 

for the first time say that a system that has achieved 

unitary status. So that the courts no longer have the 

authority or the need to supervise them, can then turn 

around and use individual skin color as a basis for 

assignment, we've never said that. And that takes us on 

a very perilous course.

 MR. MELLEN: You've never said it, Your 

Honor and the question has never been presented. A 

similar question was presented in the University of 

Michigan Law School case. And this Court held the use 

of a racial classification to satisfy a compelling 

interest and in a narrowly tailored manner --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the university cases 

this Court ran as far away as it could from using racial 

quotas. It talked about the fact that there was an 

individualized assessment. At, at issue was a 

university student who could understand the reasons for 

being rejected on, on the grounds of race, race being 

one criteria. That isn't this case.

MR. MELLEN: That's not this case, Your 

Honor, because our board asserts a different compelling 

interest. The compelling interest asserted by the 

Michigan Law School was viewpoint diversity. A 

different kind of -- it's a byproduct of that.

 This Court asserts an interest in -- this 

board, I'm sorry, asserts an interest in racial 

integration and we believe that there are compelling 

benefits from racial integration and that this board 

provides them to all students, both black and white.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Once again, once again, 

one of the rationales for the law school cases was a 

First Amendment rationale. And you, and I think 

properly so, say that this is, this is not your 

interest. I agree with you. But that means that that 

case is completely inapplicable to help you.

 MR. MELLEN: I don't think it's completely 

inapplicable, Your Honor, because this case presents the 

same basic doctrinal question that was presented in 

Grutter, whether a Government agency can use race as a 

classification with a compelling interest with narrow 

tailoring. This Court in Grutter identified several 

benefits of racial diversity. Some of those benefits 

are presented in the elementary and secondary school 

context. And we have additional benefits that are

presented by racial integration.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Mellen, here is a 

question I should have asked friends on the other side. 

But I think it is raised by Justice Kennedy's question, 

so let me put it out.

 Are there circumstances under which there is 

reason to suspect the motivation of school districts 

when they come up with a plan in effect to require a 

mixing of the races in the schools that is more or less 

tailored to the relative percentages in the communities? 

Is -- are there circumstances in which that would be 

done for malign as opposed to benign purposes?

 MR. MELLEN: I think it could be, Your 

Honor. And this Court has said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And what -- give me some, 

or give me or an example.

 MR. MELLEN: Your Honor, I'm not sure I can 

think of one because I come from a community with a long 

history of, of not doing that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Easy. Easy. Take a school 

district that is overwhelmingly minority. And --

overwhelmingly black, if you will. And a school board 

that reflects that. And in which by reason of 

residential patterns, the white schools, despite the 

same expenditure of money, same level of teaching and

everything else, the white schools are better schools.

 And the school board could decide we would 

like our race to get into those better white schools. 

Not because we want mixing. We just want, want them to 

get into those schools.

 Wouldn't that be a situation in which the 

board could then come up with a -- you know, these good 

schools ought to have 80 percent blacks in them? I 

would not consider that a benign objective.

 MR. MELLEN: There might be, Your Honor, 

under those circumstances a compelling interest in doing 

that. The question would be whether it is narrowly 

tailored. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there's a 

compelling interest in doing it at all. They're doing 

it for a racially selfish reason. They want their 

constituency, they want the 80 percent of black 

students, to be in the better schools. You consider 

that a valid interest, and a non-racial interest?

 MR. MELLEN: No. No, Your Honor. Of course 

with that explanation, I do not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think the school 

board in that case would use the clumsy means of racial 

integrational mixing as opposed simply to devoting more 

money to the black schools?

MR. MELLEN: I would certainly think, Your 

Honor, that a wise school board would use other methods 

to achieve that result. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I would think so, too.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why did you say -- in 

truth, maybe I missed it. In your response to 

Justice Kennedy, I think you said, when he asked, that 

this Court has never said that the explicit use of race 

by a K through 12 school board was constitutional, and I 

thought the Court had explicitly said that in Swann.

 MR. MELLEN: I, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that, that 

Justice Powell explicitly said it. I that Chief Justice 

Rehnquist had explicitly said it. I thought if you went 

back in sense to the slaughterhouse cases, you'll find 

in 1872, this Court thought that the primary objective, 

the primary objective of that Fourteenth Amendment was 

to take people who had been formerly slaves and to bring 

them into this society, and that all of phrases of that 

amendment should be interpreted with that objective in 

mind. I mean, it didn't say that explicitly there, but 

it seems explicitly and implicitly this Court has said 

that.

 MR. MELLEN: Well, I agree, Justice Breyer. 

And I misspoke, I used one word incorrectly. I said --

I should have said this Court has not held.  I agree 

with General Clement that Swann was dictum, but a very 

strong dictum. And we do think it applies here. 

Dictum.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think -- I think 

we were communicating. Swann was a case where there was 

de jure discrimination. Bakke was a university case. 

This is a different case.

 MR. MELLEN: It is indeed a different case, 

Your Honor. We do not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's, and it's a 

troubling case.

 MR. MELLEN: We do not contend, Your Honor, 

that the purpose of this plan is to remediate past 

discrimination against black students. This plan is 

intended to provide benefits to both black and white 

students.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your arguments do 

not depend in any way on the prior de jure segregation?

 MR. MELLEN: They do not, Your Honor. We 

would agree that we stand on the same footing as the 

Seattle district, as a unitary district this case needs 

to be measured against whether a board has a compelling 

interest and -- or board feels quite strongly that there 

is compelling interest for the racial classification

that's employed in --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about the other part? 

Because I think the Solicitor General -- I hope, I don't 

want to put words in his mouth -- but I think he agrees 

that Brown held out the promise of an equal education, 

that the country worked for 35 or 40 years to try to get 

a degree of integration, and that maintaining it is 

important. I think the Government agrees with that. 

They think this case goes too far. And in that I think 

he's referring to narrow tailoring. It isn't narrowly 

tailored enough. So I would appreciate knowing why you 

think it is.

 MR. MELLEN: We think it is, Your Honor, for 

the very reasons that the District Court held it is. 

The District Court addressed each of these points 

regarding narrow tailoring which this Court identified 

in Grutter, looked at them very carefully and concluded 

that it is narrowly tailored. One of that issues that's 

already been discussed this morning is individual 

consideration. We agree with the position that the 

Circuit Court took in the Ninth Circuit that in a 

situation in which the compelling interest is racial 

integration, that it makes no sense to take into account 

other background characteristics of students other than 

their race.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were to become 

relevant, would this record show -- this is the school 

district -- and this would be in the regime of the 

Court-ordered desegregation plan, because you are just 

recently emerged from that -- that the school district 

has tried means other than race conscious, of race 

classification in order to obtain the diversity benefits 

you seek?

 MR. MELLEN: The school district has, Your 

Honor. In fact this plan uses those --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And were those magnet 

schools? And could you tell me about that?

 MR. MELLEN: Magnet schools, Your Honor. 

And with respect to history, Your Honor, it is somewhat 

complex, because although the Court ruled in the Hampton 

case in 2000 that the degree was dissolved then, the 

board honestly felt beginning in 1981 that the decree 

had been dissolved. And so the board in 1984, 1991, 

1996 made what it thought were voluntary modifications 

to the plan.

 Beginning in the late 1980s, the board began 

to introduce more choice into the system including 

magnet schools, magnet programs. The board uses race 

neutral lotteries to determine enrollment in some 

schools. But the board feels and it feels very strongly

based on conversations that board members and staff 

people have had with other school districts that have 

tried race-neutral measures including Charlotte 

Mecklenburg, Wake county and San Francisco -- that 

race-neutral measures alone will not do the job and the 

experience in those districts indicates that they will 

not do the job.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your starting place 

was the plan that was compulsory, that was forced on the 

school district in 1975? That is basically the same 

kind of plan?

 MR. MELLEN: Well, Your Honor, I would say 

that the starting point was that plan. The board has 

modified it considerably since then to make assignments 

more stable and predictable, to make the use of race 

more narrowly tailored. It is in concept the same plan, 

because it has some of the features, but the board has 

added many features that that plan did not have.

 The 1975 desegregation decree was really 

quite a blunt instrument and that's why it was so 

controversial in the community. That's why there was 

massive white flight. This plan, this board has very 

wisely modified that plan to make it much more 

acceptable to the community so that we stopped the white 

flight. We stabilized our enrollment. We have a

community now that very broadly, the public opinion 

surveys show, that supports racial integration whereas 

in 1975, they were opposed to it, sometimes violently.

 This is as I said at the outset a success 

story.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen if you 

couldn't use this system?

 MR. MELLEN: And that would depend, Your 

Honor, on what this Court said we could not use.

 We do know that four of our schools, magnet 

schools are now not subject to racial guidelines because 

of the District Court's decision in the Hampton 2 case. 

One of those schools, Central High School, is far 

outside the racial guidelines. It has a black 

enrollment of about 83 percent. At two of those other 

magnet schools black enrollment has declined. It's 

declined by about by about a third in two of those 

schools. And that is only in the space of a few years.

 Our school board staff has conducted some 

hypothetical scenarios as to what would happen without 

the racial guidelines. Some hypothetical scenarios 

involve choice. Some involve purely neighborhood 

schools. All of those scenarios show substantial 

resegregation, particularly in elementary schools.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do any of those study the

possibilities of the system in which you elect to go 

into a system where race counts?

 MR. MELLEN: Some of those scenarios, Your 

Honor, did have some degree of choice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are they written out 

anywhere we can see them? Or are there articles on 

this?

 MR. MELLEN: They are not in the record in 

this case, Your Honor. They were in the record in the 

Hampton case, so if you read the Hampton 2 opinion you 

will see that the district court included a lengthy 

footnote in which he basically summarized those 

scenarios.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you say your plan has 

the overwhelming support of the community, does 

"community" mean those parent who have children in 

the schools?

 MR. MELLEN: Some of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that ought 

to be the really -- the people who are the objects of 

this experiment. Do they think it's doing --

MR. MELLEN: They do indeed, Your Honor. 

Those surveys were surveys by the University of Kentucky 

Research Center of parents.

satisfaction with it break out along racial lines? Or 

was it evenly divided?

 MR. MELLEN: It was fairly evenly divided, 

Your Honor. One of our expert witnesses said that --

well, both of them said that they were quite surprised 

that the findings were so positive. One of the expert 

witnesses said that unquestionably this is a community 

that values diversity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?

 MR. MELLEN: That's the testimony of Edward 

Kiefer, Your Honor, from the university of Kentucky. He 

was responsible for the survey --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And he's talking about the 

parents of students in the school?

 MR. MELLEN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

That's -- there are some other surveys, I believe, that 

include the entire community. But I think you'll see in 

the record some that are parents only.

 I would like, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, 

to respond very briefly to some of the facts concerning 

Joshua, because you asked about that. There is nothing 

in the record that says that Ms. Meredith moved into the 

district in Florida just when she showed up at 

Breckenridge-Franklin. With respect to her appeal, in 

fact the litigation had not commenced when she would

have had an opportunity to file an appeal. The 

stipulation of facts says that she did not apply for 

Joshua for the first grade.

 Now, Ms. Bloom -- excuse me. Ms. Meredith 

-- and this is not in the record because it took place 

after the record was closed -- but Ms. Meredith 

reapplied for a transfer after Joshua finished the first 

grade. That transfer was initially denied. She 

appealed. The transfer was granted and Joshua does now 

attend Bloom. I think that's relevant because the 

Solicitor General made an argument in his brief that 

this plan allows the student to be trapped in a school. 

We would certainly not agree that an assignment to any 

one of our fine schools could be a trap. But in any 

event, students can reapply each year and that has 

happened. It happened here in the case of Joshua --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, how is 

race used? Do the administrators have discretion in the 

weight they will give to it on a case by case basis?

 MR. MELLEN: I don't think exactly, Your 

Honor. Race is used, as the district court found, 

really as the final factor, a tipping factor. Residence 

comes into play. Choice comes into play. Lotteries in 

some schools come into play.

the question: Is it used fairly evenly across the board 

when it is the tiebreaker?

 MR. MELLEN: We don't used the word 

"tiebreaker," Your Honor. The record indicates --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: To tip the tipping point, 

whatever.

 MR. MELLEN: The record indicates that race 

would be the dispositive factor in no more than 2 to 3 

percent of the choice applications.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That means -- that leads 

to the question of why do they need it?

 MR. MELLEN: I think they need it, Your 

Honor, because it sets a boundary. It defines what 

racial integration means. If staff had come to this 

board with a plan that said, our goal is racial 

integration --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's symbolic that race 

counts?

 MR. MELLEN: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

I think it simply sets the outer limits within which our 

process of choice and other methods of assignment works. 

Without that boundary, it could be transgressed one 

student at a time.

 The guidelines I think are very much like

the dike because a few drops of water were coming out. 

He knew it would become a flood eventually if he didn't 

do that. We think that is exactly the case here, that 

without these guidelines one student at a time could 

transgress them and ultimately we would have a 

resegregated school system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mellen, I've been 

looking at Dr. Kiefer's testimony. Is this what you're 

referring to: "There was remarkable agreement among 

every group in Jefferson County Public Schools about how 

desirable having diversity in the schools was"?

 MR. MELLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have no double about 

that. I mean, if you're going to ask anybody, you know, 

do you prefer integrated schools or would you prefer 

lily-white schools, nobody is going to say give me a 

lily-white school. Of course nobody's going to say 

that.

 I was asking whether the parents whose kids 

can't go to the schools they want to go to, including 

the neighborhood schools, do they like this particular 

system of achieving the racial diversity? Is there any 

testimony about that?

 MR. MELLEN: The great majority do, Your 

Honor. And I think if you look at the University of --

University of Kentucky survey, which is in the record --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is in the record?

parents. It asked whether guidelines were proper. It 

asked whether assignment on socioeconomic status would 

be preferred. There are a lot of questions in that 

survey and I think you might find --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not in your joint 

appendix here?

 MR. MELLEN: It's not in the joint appendix.

Your Honor.

earlier about the status of the particular plaintiff. 

You're not challenging standing or raising mootness, are 

you?

that Ms. Meredith did not suffer undue harm within the

whole and students as a whole do not suffer undue harm.

 There have questions in the first case about 

an end point. I might address that briefly. We believe 

that the use of race in this plan is self-limiting in 

several respects. If racially segregated housing in 

Jefferson County continues to decline, which it has 

somewhat since the 1970s, and the board has reason to 

believe that the presence of racially integrated schools 

during that period contributed to that -- there are 

several amicus briefs that were filed in this case that 

set forth research that supports that conclusion. If 

racially segregated housing continues to decline and if 

this plan meets its purpose of diminishing racial 

stereotypes and promoting better cross-racial 

understanding throughout the community, we can foresee a 

time when this board will not see a reason to use this 

plan or may modify it further to make it even less 

restrictive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a time horizon 

longer or shorter than the 25-year time horizon that was 

discussed in Grutter?

 MR. MELLEN: I can't predict the future, 

Your Honor. I can say it could be shorter for another 

reason. That is that this plan is inherently subject to 

democratic review by elected school board and by the

voters. It could end sooner than that if the board and 

the voters change their minds. I can't predict whether 

it might end longer than that. I can only say that this 

board has a long history of modifying the plan. As I 

said, they modified it in 1984, 1991, 1996, 2001. It's 

in the very nature of how a board of education works 

that they continue to tinker with things.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the attitude is the 

one that this board has taken, then the same reasons 

would exist for the plan as long as there is segregation 

in housing.

 MR. MELLEN: I wouldn't limit that, limit it 

to that, Your Honor. I think that an important factor 

are racial attitudes in the community. I think that 

this board feels that the plan does serve to ameliorate 

racial stereotypes, promote cross-racial understanding. 

Our community still has a long way to go in that 

respect. We do have some racial issues in Jefferson 

County. But we believe this plan helps them. And in 

the future a board may look at our community, may look 

at how racial relations work in our community, and may 

well decide that, even though housing is still somewhat 

segregated, we can do without this plan or again we can 

modify it to make it less restrictive, which in fact the 

history of this plan shows that this board has done.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would this board 

have to have in order for it not to be temporally 

limited in your opinion? Any plan can be changed in the 

future. So why does the fact that this can be changed 

in the future make it a plan that has a temporal 

limitation?

 MR. MELLEN: Well, Your Honor, it does not 

have fixed temporal limitation of 25 years or 10 years. 

As I said, that's not how school boards operate. But it 

is inherently subject to review on a temporal basis 

because each time we have a school board election the 

plan potentially is in play, and it could be modified at 

any time in that sense.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEDDY B. GORDON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GORDON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 First of all, to respond to one of the 

questions that was asked, it's very important that it is 

equally consistent in the 1992 plan to effectuate or to 

prevent white flight that the plan itself was changed to 

subjugate African American kids to the worse performing 

schools. If you find that equally consistent, then you 

have a question of whether or not illegitimate notions 

of racial inferiority applied or racial politics applied 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. I didn't 

understand it.

 MR. GORDON: Well, in the '92 plan and from 

that point on, which I showed, which was held in the 

Hampton plan, in the Hampton case -- in other words, in 

the Hampton case I proved, or the facts proved or the 

plaintiff proved, that African American kids were denied 

entrance into the better schools solely because of race.

 Within the vacuum of that case, there was 

also proof that showed the largest percent of African 

American kids were sent or denigrated or subjugated to

the worse performing schools rather than the best 

performing schools. That becomes the question of racial 

politics and racial animus, and that's what the '92 plan 

did. And what it did to attract -- or prevent white 

flight, was have less African American kids go to the 

better performing schools on the entire K through 12 

setting.

 That can't be what this Court wants to carve 

out as an exemption to the Equal Protection Clause. The 

Equal Protection Clause, that's on neutral parchment 

with black ink. There's no percents. There's no box to 

check. We can't have this in our school system, to have 

another 25 or 30 years in our school system, which will 

perpetuate racial isolationism because it does nothing 

to stop the achievement gap. There were race-neutral 

alternative tracks.

 All I can say is that, may this day be the 

embryonic beginning of Dr. King's dream, as paraphrased, 

that all children are now judged by the content of their 

character and their education, not by the color of their 

skin.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
