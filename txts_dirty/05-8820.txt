 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear arguments 

next in Lawrence V. Florida.

 Ms. Bonner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY C. BONNER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MS. BONNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Mr. Lawrence in this case made an 

application for relief in the state courts of Florida, 

that unfortunately was denied to him, the relief that he 

sought. Consequently, he came here to the United States 

Supreme Court on a certiorari review and the certiorari, 

although it was denied, he did present to this Court an 

issue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act. 

It is well within the power under 28 U.S.C. 2104 for 

this Court to modify, vacate, remand. In other words, 

this Court can and could have affected that judgment.

 Our position is that this -- there is a 

distinction between the, quote, "appellate jurisdiction" 

under 2104 and the original writ of certiorari which 

would lie in this Court in some instances. When one 

uses the appeal, one is not making a new application. 

We respectfully suggest that the utilization of the

emphasis in 2244 should be on application and what was 

before this Court on petition for certiorari was the 

application, the document, the issues, which had been 

presented below in the Florida courts and this Court was 

sitting to determine whether it would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would presumably, 

though, be limited in some ways. For example, if the 

application for state post-conviction relief raised 

arguments under state law, those would not be a proper 

subject of a petition for certiorari.

 MS. BONNER: Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

And the issues which were raised were the same ones that 

were raised in the state court and were of 

constitutional dimension that Mr. Lawrence raised here. 

But our point is if the emphasis is on the application, 

then until the finality of action on the application --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the 

application is the application -- the petition for 

certiorari is the application?

 MR. PECK: No, sir. I'm saying the 

application under 3850 in Florida state trial courts, 

which then goes to the Florida State Supreme Court, is 

the application upon which this Court would be acting. 

If it were not acting on that, what would it be acting 

on?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we can't act on it 

unless, unless it's final. We, we need final action by 

the state court, don't we?

 MS. BONNER: Well, except --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can it be final action 

and yet still be pending?

 MS. BONNER: To utilize the word "final" 

there would be -- we can use the word "final" after a 

jury determination and that in one effect, in one sense, 

is final. And when Florida is done it's final in some 

sense. But it's not final under 2104 because this Court 

can modify it, can remand it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's final as far as the 

application for state review is concerned.

 MS. BONNER: There -- it is the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is the text that 

we're dealing with here.

 MS. BONNER: Yes. It is the application for 

state review which comes before this Court. We're 

asking you to review the lower court's rulings on the 

application.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I take it you're talking 

about language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2).

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it tolled the statute

while the "properly filed application for state 

post-conviction or other collateral review is pending." 

So the question is during the 90 days after they said no 

to you in the state court and you had a chance to file 

the writ, is that application pending? And you say yes, 

that application is pending, that application is pending 

and subject to various motions, such as a motion or a 

petition for certiorari.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it is pending.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir that is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's where we are in this 

argument.

 MS. BONNER: That is exactly our position.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

 MS. BONNER: That this application is 

pending.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the other 

way to read the language is that the state application 

is final -- otherwise you couldn't file the Federal 

petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect 

what happens with your application for state relief, but 

the state application itself is final and over.

 MS. BONNER: In that sense it is not final 

in that it can be altered and that this Court can

order --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it has to be 

final before you can file a petition for cert.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir. It's the vagaries of 

the use of the language --

JUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that? I would 

have thought it said that there has to be a final 

judgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of 

the state court concerns that application which is still 

pending and will continue to be pending at least for 90 

days in your view.

 MS. BONNER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it doesn't require a 

final state application. It requires a final judgment 

about the state application.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, that's exactly true, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what about the 

argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't 

require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state 

procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final 

decision in the state court and that it makes sense to 

treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to 

the exhaustion requirement?

 MS. BONNER: Well, Your Honor, first of all, 

it would require this Court to substitute the word

"exhaustion" for the word "pending" in the statute. 

There is no reason to believe and there is much reason 

not to believe that Congress intended exhaustion has a 

concept which should be read into this particular 

context in which we're dealing. In point of fact, in 

the 1995 proposal for habeas reform the word 

"exhaustion" was in there. It was taken out in 1996. 

Unfortunately, the Congressional history and the 

speeches on the floor, etcetera, are not really 

illuminating, except the concept of exhaustion 

apparently the legislature, the Congress, felt would be 

subject to interpretation differently in different 

states.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know what 

is pending with respect to when the state defendant, 

movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari? Is 

that --

MS. BONNER: Well, I believe.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the state 

post-conviction application still pending on the 90th 

day?

 MS. BONNER: I believe it is, Your Honor, 

and I think the logic that this Court has used in the 

context of 2255's obtains as well, and it -- it is 

pending because the reason that we have 90 days -- it's

an unusual amount of time that we have to come to ask 

this Court for relief. And I believe that part of that 

time and part of the reason for the existence of that is 

that we can contemplate whether we should be filing a 

petition for certiorari.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, anybody who 

wants the additional time -- this law was passed to 

prevent people from delaying. But anybody who wanted to 

delay would then have to file a cert petition, I assume?

 MS. BONNER: I would suggest to you, Your 

Honor, that it should be -- this should be construed the 

same way that the finality of a state conviction, the 

finality of a Federal conviction, and the finality of a 

2255 are determined, and that is at the time that either 

this Court has dealt with certiorari by denying or 

granting it or that 90 days has, has been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you filed --

so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?

 MS. BONNER: Yes, I do, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you want the 

additional time that it takes for an opposition, for 

waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it, 

then you have to file a petition for cert?

 MS. BONNER: I don't -- that is not my 

position, Your Honor. I believe that the 90 days should

obtain no matter what so that we'll have a universal 

rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. BONNER: -- that practitioners will not 

be making this error because they will be acting in 

concert --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Chief's point is 

that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being 

more than 90 days because then you would have, in 

addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert 

petition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of 

the petition, and the statute of limitations would be 

tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed 

90 days.

 MS. BONNER: That is true, ma'am.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- does your 

argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within 

the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court, 

wanted to file the habeas application in the district 

court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it 

would be premature because the, the state application is 

still pending?

 MS. BONNER: I believe that the way that we 

have been seeing the opinions come from this Court and 

from the various courts around the country are that

there seems to be a favorable disposition to protective 

2254, 2255 petitions. I agree with the premise of Your 

Honor's question that it would be pending and it would 

be pending here and therefore, you should not go to 

district court and file a 2254. Now whether you can and 

you can do it in a protective fashion is another entire 

issue which isn't really raised here because he did seek 

certiorari review.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you read the tolling 

provision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the 

tolling provision that's before us?

 MS. BONNER: No. Certainly I do not. And 

the state really did not analogize to 2263 as I believe 

perhaps they should have analogized to it. 2263 of 

course is the opt-in provision which moves things along 

on an even quicker track than a one year, and you have 

180 days to file, and the Congress was absolutely clear 

and this was enacted at the same time that the 

provisions at issue were enacted, that it was 180 days 

after final state court affirmance and you had to, you 

had to file. That's it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think Congress really 

wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling 

concepts in these provisions?

 MS. BONNER: I think they did, and one of

the reasons that I believe that they did, number one was 

to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the 

states were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is 

that they told, as well, in 2263(B) the main difference 

between 2263(A) and (B)(1) is that the time when you're 

getting your certiorari petition ready for this Court 

under the opt-in provision is not tolled. But the time 

when this Court is considering the post-conviction 

certiorari request is tolled. It's tolled clearly by 

statute. I cannot presume and would not presume that 

what Congress did was write these in numerical order and 

when it got to 2263 come up with a new and exciting 

idea, and then not go back to 2254 and 2244 to change 

the language there.

 I think Congress meant something different. 

And what it meant was the trigger time, the time that 

was going to be elapsing between the petition, between 

your final decision and when you could go to certiorari.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, what about 

2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the 

time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the 

time for seeking such review? Your reading of D(2) is 

that that's what they meant when they said the state 

application was pending. The state application or the 

time for seeking review of the state application, and in

-- just in just a few sections above that they expressly 

said that shouldn't we read pending in a different, 

different direction?

 MS. BONNER: Well, the distinction, I have 

at least two things to say about that. The distinction 

between the two sections, that would be (D)(1)(a) and 

(D)(2), one is dealing with one thing, a judgment which 

has reached finality and it is determining when that 

judgment is final. They would have had to rewrite the 

tolling provision because it is not speaking about a 

judgment. It is speaking about an application which is 

a process. And the second thing is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they would 

have just said during the time of the application for 

state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for 

seeking review of it.

 MS. BONNER: I believe that Congress is 

presumed to have read, written its laws knowing the 

history of interpretation of this Court. And pending 

has a very long tradition and this Court's role in the 

state-Federal continuum obviously is of well defined 200 

plus-year-old role, and the part of that role is that 

you as this Court are the final arbiters and the only 

true people who can make the decision about what the 

Federal Constitution says.

The state would have you read this as if it 

says application for state post-conviction relief is 

pending in the state court. I would be hesitant to 

rewrite the statute since Congress did not invite me to 

do so as the state has actually done by saying, pending 

in the, in the state court. And that is not the concept 

that we have lived with for 200 years or 200- plus 

years. Pending means until it is, cannot be any longer 

acted upon, and it is clear here, you as this Court can 

upon it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the final, the 

judgment in the criminal case is still pending because 

it can be acted upon?

 MS. BONNER: Not the judgment in the 

criminal case, but I would suggest that the judgment in 

the 22 -- I mean the 385.1 procedures in Florida which 

would be that post-conviction application because that's 

where we are. We have reached finality on the, after 

this Court has had, after we have either come to this 

Court for certiorari or the 90 days is exhausted.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying, are you 

arguing that there, during this period, there is an 

application for state relief pending in the state courts 

or that there is an application for state relief pending 

in this Court?

MS. BONNER: I am saying that the

here, because that court can be ordered by --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where is it pending?

 MS. BONNER: -- this Court to act upon it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Where is it pending?

 MS. BONNER: It is pending still in state 

court because this Court can order that court.

 JUSTICE GINSBERG: I thought your argument 

on brief was that it is pending here and the statute 

says pending. It doesn't say pending, as your statute, 

you compared it with says. That pending, the 

application is pending someplace. Where is it pending? 

Not in the state court anymore. They have reached their 

final judgment, but it's still pending in your case here 

because you filed a petition for cert.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, ma'am. It just is, also, 

I -- there is some case law which speaks to the fact 

that it remains pending or unsettled or unsure or 

unfinal when a court can order another court to act on 

it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In the same sense that it 

is pending after the trial court has acted but before 

the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants 

a state appeal.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know where it's 

pending. Whether it's still pending in the state trial 

court or in the state appeals court. But nobody denies 

that it's pending. And I understood your argument to 

be, whatever mending means there, pending means here 

because there is no modifier that would limit the same 

-- the same construction.

 MS. BONNER: Yes. That is -- that is so, 

sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in what sense is 

it an application for state post-conviction review when 

it's pending before us? We are considering a claim that 

the state erroneously decided a Federal question --

MR. BONNER: You are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but it's not an 

application, it's an application for our review, not 

state post-conviction review.

 MS. BONNER: It began as a complaint. This 

is, analytically, everyone seems to have a little bit of 

pause because of exactly the context of your, of your 

comment, of your question. But there is only one 

lawsuit, complaint, whatever you wish to call it, which 

we are dealing with, and that is the one that seeks 

post-conviction relief in Florida. If you're

unsuccessful there, you go to the Florida Supreme Court 

and that same application is what we come to this Court 

on. There is nothing else out there. The state seems 

to tell us, or suggest to us that it's some kind of an 

independent state -- uh, Federal action.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It's a Federal writ, isn't 

it? It's an application for a Federal writ. It's not 

an appeal in state criminal -- state case.

 MS. BONNER: But it comes under this Court's 

appellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction 

for writs of certiorari.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you succeed you're going 

to get an order from this Court to the state court say, 

saying, go back in this state proceeding that has been 

begun, and do it right. So the focus of it is still the 

state proceeding even though we may correct it under 

appellate jurisdiction.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir. The state brings 

forward an argument that this certiorari before this 

Court is not a part of, not an integral part of and in 

fact not any part of the state process. I believe they 

come to that conclusion because they insert what they 

wish the statute said, rather than what the statute 

actually says, and we are attempting as best we can to 

interpret what Congress did not, what you wish it did.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any, I 

suppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the 

average disposition time is for a petition for 

certiorari in a case like this?

 MS. BONNER: I believe it's like 44 days if 

you don't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. From the time 

of, I suppose the pertinent question would be from the 

time of final state, final state judgment, eventual 

filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our 

disposition? Presumably, probably five or six months?

 MS. BONNER: It's not usually that long. 

This Court is very efficient with that. And that's one 

of the points --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't you 

take, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get --

MS. BONNER: You get 42 or so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you get a two 

month extension.

 MS. BONNER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you get another

you're from for the extension. Get another month for 

the opposition, at least two months, month and a half, 

for us to dispose of it. It probably comes out to about

six months.

 MS. BONNER: It could, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now I guess -- my 

question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of 

limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize 

it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly 

an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.

 MS. BONNER: Well, Your Honor, it is not a 

one-year statute of limitations per se. That may be 

what looks good on paper with the writing of the statute 

and the expressing of the statute to the public, that 

one year is what's going to happen. But when one takes 

into account the exhaustion requirement and takes that 

time out, we are still not talking about a 365-day 

process.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask on that, 

Ms. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time 

elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal 

proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral 

relief?

 MS. BONNER: It's quite a while. Your 

Honor. I wouldn't know the average.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's more than six 

months, I assume.

 MS. BONNER: It's a long time, Your Honor.

And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Two, three, four, five 

years.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And all that time, the 

statute has been tolled?

 MS. BONNER: Exactly, till it's -- that's 

why I don't look at exactly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The question is whether 

there may be another six months added on to that five or 

six-year period.

 MS. BONNER: Yes, sir. And one of the 

important things here is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the reason 

that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the 

exhaustion of the state procedures. This additional 

period is when it's pending, not before the state but 

before a Federal court.

 MS. BONNER: But it's the state petition 

which is pending for your review. And one of the things 

I want to point out is that the 90 days, when they 

passed habeas reform, they were not speaking about 30 

days, 20 days, 60 days, 90 days or even the six months 

that Your Honor posits. It was 10 years, 12 years, 14 

years. And that was I think the major impetus to

encourage the Congress to put the 365 day on there.

 This Court has complete control over the 

certiorari process. You know, being lawyers we always 

do file at the last minute, but of course it's this 

Court's rules which gives us the 90 days versus another 

period of time. It is, the petition for certiorari is 

not like a notice of appeal, because it's not just a 

one-page document that's laid out in the Federal 

statutes for us to do. It's an application to, it's an 

application for review and it is, it takes some time to 

fashion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any -- any 

statistics on how many petitions for cert from state 

post-conviction collateral review are granted? In other 

words, if we are talking about an additional six months 

in every case, how many of those are actually granted?

 MS. BONNER: I don't know how many are 

granted, Your Honor, but one thing that struck me as I 

was reading through these cases is that many are granted 

to the state. And of course, when the state goes to 

certiorari from post-conviction, from a post-conviction 

loss on its side, then the whole process is turned on 

its head, and many, many times this Court has granted 

certiorari to the state. And that is another problem 

that happens with this tolling if you read pending the

way the state wants you to read pending, because what do 

we do then? What do people do?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but if the state 

is petitioning for cert it means you've won.

 MS. BONNER: It means you've won.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So presumably you're 

not looking forward to further --

MS. BONNER: No. But what happens to the 

time? How do you count that time if you lose here?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose you'd have to 

file a protective petition with the district court 

saying we won but we might still lose.

 MS. BONNER: I guess. And - you know, a 

protective -- to litigants, protective and to district 

court judges, I believe and state court judges, 

protective petitions are kind of anathema, because since 

you don't know what you're going to raise -- and in the 

2254 you have more of an idea, certainly, because you're 

limited in many instances if not all instances to those 

things which were exhausted -- but obviously there are 

new claims that are brought up because there would not 

be a stay and abey. There would not even be a request 

for stay and abey if there were things that the Federal 

courts find.

the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about 

the availability of equitable tolling.

 MS. BONNER: I'm sorry. I didn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would be very 

surprised if the court found you were out of time 

because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.

 MS. BONNER: I'd be surprised --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And have it granted.

 MS. BONNER: I'd be surprised too, but I've 

practiced a long time and I've seen some very odd things 

happen in courts and, both a stay and abey, and the 

other procedures that have been discussed by this Court 

have not been handed down as mandates to the lower court 

to require the lower court to rule in a certain way, or 

to absolutely stay, or to entertain protective motions 

and then permit those protective motions to be 

supplemented at a time later. If Your Honors do not 

mind, I will reserve some time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KISE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: Petitioner's case amounts to no more 

than a disagreement with AEDPA's recognized policies and

procedures, and an improper attempt to convert ignorance 

of settled law into an extraordinary circumstance 

warranting equitable relief. AEDPA's plain language and 

recognized purpose is established, that tolling does not 

extend to the post-conviction certiorari process. 

Additionally, ignorance of settled law whether by an 

incarcerated pro se petitioner, by private counsel, or 

by appointed counsel is not an extraordinary 

circumstance and does not excuse prompt filing.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kise, can I ask you 

what your view in this matter would be if the Court 

grants certiorari, would the application be pending 

during the period that the case is under advisement in 

this Court?

 MR. KISE: No, Your Honor. And I'm assuming 

your question is asking me, grant certiorari based on an 

application filed by the petitioner.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Either way.

 MR. KISE: Well, in both circumstances the 

answer would be no, and in both circumstances I think 

the relief that would be accorded --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask a second 

question. Suppose it were reversed, we send it back for 

further proceedings in the state trial court, would you 

say that it's still not pending during the further

proceedings?

 MR. KISE: It may be pending in state court 

during the further proceedings, but it's not pending 

during the time that it is at this Court, because this 

Court has not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So it started pending 

again after an interruption, is that the way it would 

be?

 MR. KISE: Based on equitable principles, I 

think that would be the interpretation, yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Forget about equitable 

principles, statutory principles. Is there a lack of 

continuity, where you could have it pending for a period 

of a couple years and then an interruption, and then it 

can resume pending after the interruption?

 MR. KISE: You're using the phraseology 

interruption, and I would, would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, period when it's not 

pending followed by a period when it begins to pend.

 MR. KISE: In that unusual circumstance, 

Your Honor, I think principles of equitable tolling 

would apply to keep the petitioner's ability to file.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But there would be no 

statutory right in your view, it would depend on the 

equitable considerations?

MR. KISE: I believe that's correct, Your 

Honor, because statutory pending contemplates a 

finality, it contemplates -- and I think that this is, 

it is one of the fundamental problems, I believe, with 

petitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only 

the plain language of the statute but what this Court 

has said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2). In 

Duncan this Court said that state, the word state 

modifies both post-conviction and other collateral 

review, and established that we are talking about a 

state application.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't say state 

pending or pending in state court, and what I want to 

do is go back and ask a question somewhat along the 

lines that Justice Stevens asked. Is the application 

pending in the period between the disposition of the 

petition by the state trial court and the determination 

by the petitioner whether or not to go forward for state 

appellate relief?

 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe it is, 

and I believe that's what this Court said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: By the same token, why 

isn't it pending between the final disposition by the 

state appellate court and the determination to seek cert 

here?

MR. KISE: Well, I have two answers to that, 

Your Honor. First would be, that's inconsistent with 

the language utilized by this Court in Carey where the 

Court defined pending as until final resolution through 

the state's post-conviction --

JUSTICE BREYER: That was the issue in that 

case. This issue wasn't in that case.

 MR. KISE: Correct, Your Honor, but the 

language utilized nevertheless --

JUSTICE BREYER: I can't when I write 

something, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it 

happens to be a state case, refrain from using the word 

state. I wouldn't say there is an implication in 

writing an opinion that it doesn't mean Federal as well. 

As least I can't find that written in the opinion 

anywhere.

 MR. KISE: Fair enough, Your Honor. Then 

with respect to the second part of my answer to your 

question, Justice Souter, that it cannot be both final 

for 1257 purposes and pending --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But why isn't your sister's 

answer to that adequate? It is the state judgment that 

is final, but action on the petition is not yet final 

until it has gone through the period allowed for final 

review by this Court.

MR. KISE: I would, I would respectfully 

disagree with that, with that nondistinction, if you 

will, Your Honor, in the sense that the application --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're distinguishing 

between a state judgment and an application upon which 

further, further proceedings can be had. Why is that a 

nondistinction?

 MR. KISE: Because I would, I would disagree 

with the notion that further proceedings could be had on 

that application. The basis for this Court's certiorari 

of jurisdiction is that it is subject to no further 

review or correction in any state.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that the, the 

petition for cert is granted and this Court grants 

relief. The relief as I understand it is going to 

consist of a remand to the state court saying you did 

something wrong on this application before, go back and 

do it over again and do it right. It's the -- it is the 

state application which is going to be the subject of it 

and that therefore, it is the state application that 

necessarily is the subject of the cert petition.

 MR. KISE: I would say, Your Honor, that the 

state application may be the subject matter of what you 

are looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but 

what the Court is ruling on is the petition for

certiorari, which was a Federal court ruling on --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's a petition for 

certiorari to review action taken on a state petition, 

just as at the state level, whatever may be the, the 

nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial 

court to the state appellate court, is an application 

which relates entirely to the original application for 

relief that was filed in the state trial court. It 

seems to me the two situations are exactly parallel.

 MR. KISE: And I would respectfully 

disagree, Your Honor, because I don't see how it can be 

final for 1257 purposes and still pending for purposes 

of the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBERG: But that -- that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the application 

that is not subject to review. We review the state 

court judgment, not the state application, correct?

 MR. KISE: In this case, Your Honor, the 

application is the state court. I mean, the judgment is 

what is being reviewed, and it is a final judgment in 

the application. The Florida Supreme Court in this case 

has no power at all once they have issued the mandate to 

go back and modify, to correct it six months later. If 

the Florida Supreme Court decided, you know, we made a 

mistake in that application, they don't have the power

sua sponte to correct it. It is final. It is over. 

The state's province has been completed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But they would correct it 

if we told them to.

 MR. KISE: In that circumstance, yes, Your 

Honor, certainly they would in a circumstance, in the 

very unusual circumstance where this Court were to 

accept certiorari and then subsequent to the acceptance 

of certiorari, then reverse the ruling.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And when it got back in 

the state supreme court, they would still be working on 

the application that had been pending until the end of 

the proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back 

to life after we sent it back.

 MR. PECK: Yes, Your Honor, but that is, 

again, the extraordinary circumstance. And that I think 

points out the, one of the flaws in petitioner's 

argument, and that is that that's making the exception 

the rule, that clearly Congress did not intend to add 

what I believe Chief Justice Roberts alluded to earlier, 

an extra three months, an extra six months.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you're saying, 

though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible 

rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions 

to make sense. Surely that's a sound principle, isn't

it?

 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. And I don't 

think that this would be a lot of exceptions. I think 

this would be, the only exception would be, to the rule 

that we are advocating would be in the unusual 

circumstance, the one in 5,000 cases, the one in 1,000 

cases, the exceptional case where this Court actually 

grants certiorari, those cases are exceptional in and of 

themselves.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Those are the most likely 

where people are going to get mixed up. I mean, I'm not 

following -- I think I think this argument about the 

word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful 

arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both 

sides of this. I just can't get a clear answer. So if 

I were right about that and there is no clear answer 

from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back 

to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me 

that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns 

are practical. If we take your position, we have words 

right next to each other, near each other in the same 

statutory provision, meaning different things. And I've 

learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and 

lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up. 

And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they

get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have.

 The second concern of Justice Stevens, which 

is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who 

intuitively are going to cause the problem. Because on 

a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very 

good Supreme Court case. And that's going to be the 

case where he forgets to file in the Federal court 

because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and 

behold, the Court grants it. And now what happens? On 

your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other 

interpretation, it seems to work out fine. So those, I 

would say are the two practical problems, and anything 

you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.

 MR. KISE: Thank you, Justice Breyer, and I 

would respectfully answer your question I think in three 

ways. First, drawing a distinction between when the 

state petitions for certiorari and when the habeas 

petitioner petitions for certiorari. Under both 

circumstances, equitable principles would apply, but 

they would apply in I think different ways. But in 

either circumstance, the ability of the petitioner to 

subsequently seek habeas review would be protected. And 

so what we are advocating is not making those 

exceptional cases the rule. In a case where the state 

petitions for certiorari there isn't an ability, there

is no way to even file a protective habeas because there 

is nothing to file. You've won, the habeas petitioner 

has won in the court below. There is no cause of 

action. There isn't a basis upon which to file a 

Federal habeas claim, so even a protective one would be, 

it wouldn't be premature, it would be effectively 

nonexistent. So from an equitable standpoint, the 

extraordinary circumstance which the courts have 

recognized, the circuits have recognized that the test 

for equitable circumstance is, the extraordinary 

circumstance would be this Court accepting certiorari.

 And then the exercise of diligence on the 

part of the petitioner is if the petitioner did 

everything he or she could under that circumstance, 

because there would be no way for that petitioner to 

file for a Federal habeas review because there would be 

no basis for it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask -- it seems very 

strange to me. I can understand protective filings when 

you've lost, but it seems to me a very strange 

protective filing. When you've won in state court and 

the government has taken certiorari, can you file, file 

in Federal district court? What do you say? What are 

you complaining about?

 MR. KISE: Exactly my point, Your Honor.

yourself? I mean, if we come out your way, how -- how 

MR. KISE: There isn't a need to cover us 

up, Your Honor, because you've won in state court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Provided equitable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're worried about 

winning in the Supreme Court.

 MR. KISE: In the one in 1,000 or one in 

5,000 cases, equitable principles would then apply. The 

distinction may not be clear between statutory tolling, 

what the statute actually provides for, and equitable 

tolling, equitable principles that have been applied by 

the court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're asking us to 

say that the Congress has written a statute which 

doesn't take account that the state might sometimes file 

a petition for certiorari that would be granted. And 

you say oh, that's so rare, that's so extraordinary. It 

happens. It's part of the system.

that way? Would you advise a client that way?

JUSTICE SCALIA: You've won here and the 

state is taking certiorari to the Supreme Court. Don't 

worry about making a protective filing in the district 

court because, you know, if by chance the Supreme Court 

reverses, equitable tolling will apply. You know, you 

roll the dice with equity.

 MR. KISE: I don't think there would be -- I 

think it would be ill advised to, to direct a petitioner 

to file in Federal court under those circumstances 

because there would be nothing to file. What would be 

the complaint?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree.

 MR. KISE: There would be absolutely nothing 

to file.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The irony of your position 

is that it has those harshest consequences in those rare 

cases where there was a denial of constitutional right.

 MR. KISE: Your Honor, I would respectfully 

disagree that it has its harshest consequences, because 

that's where the equitable tolling principles would in 

fact apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBERG: Why do you need equitable 

tolling? Why can't you use, why isn't it most sensible 

to use the model when -- for the time clock on direct 

appeal, say there has been a conviction affirmed by the

begin to run until after the 90 days has elapsed; isn't 

that right?

 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why shouldn't it be 

the same way for collateral review as it is for direct 

review? Direct review, everyone agrees that you get the 

state final judgment. But then you have 90 days and 

nothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is 

granted, until the cert process is done. Why shouldn't 

it be just the same for collateral review?

 MR. KISE: I would say it's different, Your 

Honor, respectfully, for two reasons: One, because this 

Court has said that direct review is different in 

numerous cases. And two, because the statute makes that 

distinction. Congress in (d)(1)(A) utilized that very 

specific language that included the, the certiorari 

period and in (d)(2) did not use that language, and it 

is the absence of that language that indicates that 

tolling is only to apply while a petitioner is 

exhausting relief, state relief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well that means, that 

means that if a petitioner who has had his state

application for collateral relief denied wants to 

petition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the 

possibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has 

to do two things at the same time: One, prepare a 

petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare 

a complaint to file in a Federal district court.  That's 

a lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't 

represented.

 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I would say 

that in many circumstances that would be the case, but 

not always the case. It depends on how much time is 

left on the Federal statute of limitations, how much 

time is remaining, how long did it take to get through 

the state post-conviction process. How timely was the 

filing in the state post conviction process. And how 

much time is remaining, assuming for what was 

discussed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here there were 31 days, 

right?

 MR. KISE: Then they would need to file --

yes, Your Honor, and they would need to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They'd have to file a 

Federal court complaint and a cert petition within the 

31 days.

 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your

Honor, because the amount of time that would elapse 

before this Court were to rule on the cert petition 

would consume that 31 days. And I don't think that's 

inconsistent with what Congress intended here because 

what Congress intended by this provision was to provide 

petitioner -- well, what this Court said in Duncan, what 

this Court has recognized, is that the scheme that has 

been put together here by Congress is one which 

encourages petitioners first to file and exhaust their 

state remedies, recognizing and giving deference to the 

principles of comity, and then second to file, once 

they're done with their state process, once they've 

completed the state process and exhausted their state 

remedies, to file their Federal habeas, in the words of 

this Court in Duncan, "as soon as possible."

 And the anomaly that would be created by 

petitioner's construction would be it would be the only 

time under all of AEDPA where a petitioner could file in 

Federal district court but isn't required to file. And 

so I would submit to this Court that it cannot be both 

exhausted and pending at the same time. It would not 

fit within the scheme that this Court has already 

determined the structure of (d)(2) is designed to 

accomplish.

 The principle is that you are to, as a

habeas petitioner, go quickly to state court, and we're 

going to give state courts the first opportunity at 

these Federal constitutional questions. And yes, 

Justice Stevens, it may take some time. It may take 

several years in Federal -- in state court, before they 

accomplish that purpose. But that's the state's issue 

because it's the state's judgment and the state is 

taking its time and it shouldn't be -- and this is what 

Congress recognized I think in (d)(2) -- that, that, 

that the petitioner should not be penalized for that 

time. That's why it was tolled.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it, is it clear that he 

can go to district -- I mean, I'm not familiar with how 

these things work. Is it possible that when there is an 

appeal or certiorari pending here there can be 

proceeding in district court a habeas action on the 

same, on the same matter that we are considering on 

certiorari?

 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe there 

can. I believe, there is, in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: District courts do that? I 

mean, they would be considering the same, the same 

issues we are, I suppose?

 MR. KISE: Well, I don't know that they 

would be considering the exact same issues, Your Honor.

And there are many things that can be done -- petitioner 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're sure that happens, 

that while cert is pending here there is a habeas 

proceeding ongoing in district court?

 MR. KISE: Well, I certainly hope that in 

the 10 of the 11 circuits that have agreed with 

Florida's position here that that is happening, because 

if not then they are at risk, depending on how --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't a district judge 

who knows that there's a cert petition pending just say: 

Well, I'll wait; this petition will be held pending the 

Supreme Court's disposition of cert.

 MR. KISE: I would respectfully say to Your 

Honor that it's not an automatic stay. I mean, perhaps 

there would be a stay at some point. But there are 

things that can be accomplished in Federal court before 

the undertaking of the review. There is the Rule 4 

screening process in habeas. There is the initial 

review by the district court to see if the filing itself 

meets the procedural requirements. There is the asking 

for an answer by the state. There is discovery that can 

take place.

 All of this can take place while the cert 

petition is pending before the Federal district

undertakes any review of the merits. Now, if there gets 

to be this juxtaposition where it looks like there is 

going to be a conflict between the Federal district's 

court's review of the substantive merits and that is 

going to conflict with this Court's certiorari review, 

well, then I think a stay would be implemented.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll accept your 

view as being the personal experience. I'm rather 

surprised that district courts would go through all of 

these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and 

they may not have to.

 MR. KISE: Well, they may not have to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure if I would 

tell the district courts that's what they ought to do, 

is a wise expenditure of resources. I'll think about 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, it sort of 

depends on how often cert is going to be granted, 

doesn't it? If you're a district court and you have 

hundreds of these habeas petitions being filed, you can 

either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed, 

one in one thousand or whatever the number is, because 

they might be granted. I think you'd probably take your 

chances depending on the petition. If it looks serious 

and there's a petition pending you don't have to

proceed. If it's frivolous perhaps you can proceed.

 MR. KISE: I think that's exactly right, 

Your Honor. I think that's really the point, and you've 

obviously articulated it better than I did in my 

previous answer. But that's exactly right, that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true the real 

problem with the capital cases? The state's interest in 

getting things moving is the strongest in the capital 

cases, I think.

 MR. KISE: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In the non-capital cases 

there is an interest in promptness, but the longer the 

guy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state. 

But you do want to get your death cases terminated as 

soon as you can. And what we're really talking about as 

I understand it is whether in most death cases we'll add 

on a period of six, eight, nine months to the total 

period. And in most of those death cases, which is a 

limited number -- I don't know, you have a couple 

hundred people I suppose in death row -- in those cases 

it's going to be seven, eight, nine years anyway.

 MR. KISE: Well, it may be that long. It 

may be a shorter period. But I think what we need to 

look at is not what we would think would be the 

preferred time frame, but what Congress said was the

preferred time frame. And Congress is saying that it's 

one year, and the only time it's tolled is when the 

petitioner is doing what it should be doing to exhaust 

state remedies. That's again what this Court said in 

Duncan about describing this entire structure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's if you're formally 

right on the metaphysical question. But if you're not, 

now thinking you just gave a response to the Chief 

Justice that said, well, really the Federal district 

judge when he gets these things just has to look at them 

and then he figures out whether he is going to stay it 

or whether he's going to proceed on some issues or 

whether he is going to do something else.

 And that's what you thought was fairly easy. 

You have the experience there and I just wonder how easy 

it is. I mean, why wouldn't it be easy? Because I 

guess before doing anything the judge has to know what 

this thing is about. And that's where it seems to me to 

take the time of a district judge. They have many, many 

petitions. Sometimes they are well organized, sometimes 

not. He sends them to a magistrate possibly. The 

magistrate has a lot to do, and the time consumed is the 

time finding out what is this case about. Is that fair 

characterization or not? How easy is it?

 MR. KISE: I think it's partly fair, Your

Honor. What I would say is the time -- certain time is 

consumed just determining whether or not under the Rule 

4 screening process, whether or not the petition meets 

the formal requirements, whether they've articulated the 

claim in the correct way and whether it's worthy of the 

state response, if there's discovery that needs to be 

had.

 I mean, all of these things can be taking 

place and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more 

than that -- and I don't pretend to have the exact 

number or the statistics -- but in the very, very usual 

circumstance where cert is actually granted, I think 

then a stay could be put in place. And I don't think 

it's fair to say, respectfully, that Congress intended 

to forestall this entire process while this Court 

undertakes certiorari review.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kise, there are two 

applications. Your answer to the petitioner is you have 

to file in the Federal court within that 31 days. If a 

prisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a 

Federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get 

any assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other, 

isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that 

you're proposing going to be an incentive or a 

disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a

right to do? He is going to have to pick one or the 

other if he is in this timeline.

 MR. KISE: Well, respectfully, Your Honor --

and I know that that is the petitioner's argument and I 

see that you have given me that question, but I don't 

know that it is that much of a choice. I mean, I think 

that they can file, they can file both in those 

circumstances and, and depending on the particular 

circumstances -- and this is back to the equitable 

tolling principles -- for statutory tolling purposes, I 

think the answer is they must file both or they forfeit 

the right to one or the other. If they choose not to 

file for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90 

days forfeited that right; and if they don't file within 

the statutory period then they have under AEDPA missed 

the statute of limitations deadline.

 But I would, I submit to you that it is 

possible to do both, and in circumstances where there is 

some impediment to them doing just that, if they 

exercise diligence, if they are doing everything they 

possibly can and it is not possible to file both at the 

same time, well, then I think under the facts of the 

proper scenario that equitable principles might apply. 

But again, to say that Congress built into the system 

this automatic time period that's going to be tacked on

to a very short one-year statute of limitations, a 

statute of limitations that is designed to really move 

things through the system rapidly, is, respectfully, I 

don't think the correct interpretation of the language, 

and I don't think it is consistent with what this Court 

said in Duncan or, with respect to Justice Breyer, what 

this Court said in Carey.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me be clear on your 

answer to Justice Stevens' earlier question. Where 

there is a reversal of the state judgment by, by this 

Court, and the case is remanded to the state, you don't 

argue that what occurs then is equitable tolling? But 

you say that the case is again pending once it goes back 

to the state, is that right?

 MR. KISE: I think once it's back in the 

state system then it would have to be considered 

pending, because the statute contemplates that while 

it's part of the state process it would be pending.

 If the Court has no further questions, thank 

you.

I've heard the state over these many years 

say that a simple exception will help the defendant and 

don't worry, we will not proceed, we'll ask for -- don't 

worry, we won't object. Kind of what we're getting here 

is, we won't be objecting to a stay if there is a stay 

requested. However, they objected to the stay here that 

the United States district court entered. In an 

exercise of honesty, he said: I'm going to wait for the 

Supreme Court to decide what happens in Artuz, whether 

they accept cert or not. And they vigorously.

 Objected and utilized a good little built of 

time litigating it on an interlocutory type appeal.

 One of the practical problems is if this 

case is in both courts, this one and the United States 

district court, where is the record? Is -- It's just 

the most practical of things. And also, where is the 

lawyer, who is the lawyer?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Records don't have 

to -- typically are not filed with the petition for 

cert. So the record would be back in the lower court.

 MS. BONNER: So that solves that. The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear, it 

is your position that to get -- you think everyone's 

entitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or 

not.

MS. BONNER: Yes, I do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To get the 

additional time for an opposition that would be 

considered here, you have to file the petition for cert. 

In other words, if you don't file after the 90th day 

it's no longer pending.

 MS. BONNER: Absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So then why 

wouldn't the result of your position be that every 

person who is denied state post-conviction relief is 

going to file a cert position to get the additional 

time?

 MS. BONNER: Why is my position that they 

would not?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't that lead 

to that result? If Congress was concerned that people 

were stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one 

way to string it out under your reading, but not under 

the state's reading, would be to file a petition for 

cert.

 MS. BONNER: Well, Congress couldn't have 

been too concerned about that 90 days because it 

certainly permitted the trigger to have the 90 days 

included within it, and this Court has allowed the 90 

days --

wanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration 

of the time for seeking review. They did not say that 

in (d)(2).

 MS. BONNER: They did not say that, but they 

said while the application is pending. And the state 

did not address for this Court what is pending here if 

it's not that application from state court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Does your argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you could also say 

that except in capital cases the defendant will not have 

an incentive to delay. He wants to get out, right?

 MS. BONNER: Of course, of course. And you 

know, frankly, I think all of the defendants on death 

row --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if the 

defendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress 

think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations? 

They did that because they thought people were stringing 

out their -- and they were applying for Federal habeas 

after too long of a delay.

case I was looking at statistics as to the average 

length of time that a case was pending before, between 

conviction and the filing of the 2254, and 

Mr. Lawrence's petition was filed within days of what 

the average was before the AEDPA. That comes up in a 

statistical analysis I believe by the Department of 

Justice cited to by the state.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't the title of a 

statute indicate the category of cases that Congress was 

primarily interested in?

 MS. BONNER: Oh yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The death penalty.

 MS. BONNER: Oh yes. When they joined 

together in anti-terrorism, effective -- the -- just the 

word effective was plenty to convey to us what they 

actually mean. The other big problem that's not been 

addressed is these people in a practical sense do not 

have the same lawyer for both proceedings. Many people 

who were more than willing to practice in state court 

are not willing to practice in Federal court. It's a 

more formalized, rigorous endeavor.

 And in this case what happened was 

Mr. Lawrence had a lawyer who practiced in the state and 

obviously must have prepared for him that initial place 

holder, if you want to call it, 2254, because it's

think there is any way that anyone can contemplate that 

that would be Mr. Lawrence's doing in his own right.

 Also, whether it's 90 days or six months as 

Your Honor has said, it's always in the control of this 

Court. Once the 90 -- this is not a frolic of 

unnumbered years. When someone files a petition he 

either files it by the time 90 days is over or he is out 

of court, or he files it and this Court is quickly 

reviewing it after some input from the other side.
