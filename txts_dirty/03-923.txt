 (10:02 a.m.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in 

Illinois against Caballes.

 General Madigan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. MADIGAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and 

may it please the Court:

 This Court has made clear on several occasions, 

including 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond, 

that a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a Fourth 

Amendment search, and if something is neither a search nor 

a seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendment 

justification.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we've held that it's 

certainly not a -- a full-blown search. It's not a search 

in the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in 

-- in the classic sense either. We -- we have said that 

that is a kind of seizure.

 Why do -- I think your -- your argument assumes 

that this for -- for purposes of search analogies that 

something is either a -- a full-dress search or it's not a 

search at all. Why isn't there a -- a possibility of --

of a kind of middle ground on searches just as there is on

seizures?

 MS. MADIGAN: Well, this Court made clear in 

Arizona v. Hicks that it did not want to go down the road 

of creating something known as a quasi-search so that 

courts and police officers would be in the position of 

trying to determine whether or not something was a search 

or not. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I -- I can -- I can just 

imagine the problems, but I mean, what -- I think what's 

-- what the -- what's bothering me about the case is that 

if we persist in -- in saying that -- that it's -- that 

it's an either and or question with no question with no 

possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the 

police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage 

in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that 

prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any 

homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog 

gets a sniff of something when the door is opened. We're 

-- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog 

intrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's 

bothering me. Why -- why should we -- why should we open 

that vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle 

ground that would prevent it?

 MS. MADIGAN: Well, I would start with the 

reality that dog sniffs by their very nature, as this

Court recognized in both Place and Edmond, are very unique 

both in terms of the manner in which the sniff is 

conducted, as well as the content of -- of the information 

that the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going 

to be able to reveal the presence or absence of 

contraband. And this Court has recognized that 

individuals have no privacy interest in the possession of 

contraband. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that imply that your 

answer is yes to the question? If we say, as you urge, a 

dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to 

parade up and down every street in the country with dogs 

sniffing car trunks.

 MS. MADIGAN: Yes. Because a sniff is not a 

search, a police officer would be able to take a 

narcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her. 

I can tell you that because of the limited resources --

and this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association 

of Chiefs of Police amicus brief -- that that is not 

likely to occur.

 In addition, I can also tell you that in the 

State of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train 

their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people. They 

only use them on objects.

 But yes, in answer to both of your questions,

because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs 

could be used to walk down streets. They could, 

hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they 

are used in parking lots. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are used. I mean, we 

don't have to make it up. From cases we've had here, we 

know that they're used in places like bus depots to -- to 

sniff luggage that -- that passengers have carried through 

on -- on buses.

 MS. MADIGAN: Yes, they are. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the republic seems to have 

survived. 

MS. MADIGAN: I agree.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One could characterize those 

episodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine. I 

mean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would 

not put up with walking up and down an ordinary street. 

So the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. These aren't sniffs for --

for explosives. These are sniffs for drugs and -- and 

these -- these are not buses that are coming in from 

France. They're coming in from one American city to 

another. And -- and there's no more need in -- in that 

case than there was in this case. It was just a good -- a 

good place to find criminals who were carrying unlawful

drugs.

 MS. MADIGAN: In the present case, Mr. Caballes 

was traveling from Las Vegas, Nevada apparently on his way 

to Chicago, Illinois. He was pulled over for speeding. 

Another officer overheard when Master Sergeant Gillette 

called in to dispatch that he effected --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt, General 

Madigan? 

MS. MADIGAN: You may. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: He was pulled over for 

speeding at 71 miles an hour in a 65 miles an hour zone on 

I-80. Right? 

MS. MADIGAN: Yes, that is correct, Justice 

Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Did they know in advance that 

he was someone to look for? Because I don't imagine you 

arrest everybody on I-80 that goes 70 miles an hour. I've 

done it many times myself is why --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Inadvertently. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Inadvertently.

 (Laughter.) 

MS. MADIGAN: We always like to have you in 

Illinois. 

Obviously, the Illinois State Police have the

ability to pull somebody over whether they're going 1 mile 

over the speed limit or 26 miles over the speed limit, but 

there is nothing in the record to indicate that they were 

looking for Mr. Caballes as he was traveling eastbound on 

I-80 towards Chicago. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does the record tell us what 

time of day it was?

 MS. MADIGAN: Yes. It was approximately 5:10 

p.m. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you answered one of the 

earlier questions about the possible intrusiveness of dogs 

everywhere by saying, well, you don't have a privacy 

interest in contraband, but that's never true. You don't 

have a privacy interest in the murder victim's body, but 

you still have to have a warrant to go in and get it. So 

that -- that just doesn't work unless I missed something. 

MS. MADIGAN: You do not have a privacy interest 

in contraband, as this Court has recognized in the 

Jacobsen case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you have a privacy 

interest in your person and in your place, and that's what 

we're talking about. So that seems to me that that just 

doesn't help us. 

MS. MADIGAN: 	 Well, there is a distinction

that's made in terms of Fourth Amendment protections that 

are given to homes and people versus cars. Ever since the 

Carroll case, it has been recognized that a warrantless 

search of a car can be done if they found probable cause. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's because of the 

nature of the place being searched not because of the 

nature of what you're searching for.

 MS. MADIGAN: Correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it just can't be that -- so 

the fact that you don't have a privacy interest in 

contraband, it doesn't seem to me -- I -- I don't think 

you need that argument. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you should use it. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. MADIGAN: I -- I plan on continuing to use 

it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do you -- are you 

sure that Kyllo, you know, the -- the imaging case, would 

have come out the same way if the only thing -- the only 

thing -- that the imaging could pick out is not any of the 

other private activities in the home, but the only thing 

it could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife 

through the heart? Are you sure the case would have come 

out the same way? I'm not at all sure.

 MS. MADIGAN: I would hope the case would come

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any authority for 

that other than Justice Scalia's speculation about how 

this --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- how his Kyllo case might 

have been written? 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What about a house and -- and 

the use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a house 

just because the police think, you know, it's possible 

this is somebody growing marijuana in the basement or 

something? Is that all right? 

MS. MADIGAN: I would argue that, yes, it is all 

right to walk a dog around a house, but then as Justice --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How do you -- how do you 

reconcile that with the heat sensor case then?

 MS. MADIGAN: The thermal imager that was used 

in the Kyllo case was able to reveal intimate details of 

the house. A dog sniff is only going to reveal the 

presence or absence of contraband, and because of that, 

that's where we suddenly get into the tension between 

Kyllo and Place and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the dogs get a little

more sophisticated in the future and can also smell a 

certain kind of perfume, something like that? Would then 

the whole analysis change?

 MS. MADIGAN: Well, then you would end up in a 

situation as to whether or not an officer had probable 

cause when a dog, in fact, alerted. If he was alerting to 

the presence of perfume as opposed to narcotics, there 

would be--

JUSTICE STEVENS: How would you know whether 

the -- the dog -- I don't think the dog alerts, as I'm 

alerting, for one reason or another. He just alerts.

 MS. MADIGAN: Well, they're very well trained 

dogs. In fact, in the State of Illinois, the dogs and 

their handlers go through 320 hours of training, and 

they're specifically trained to only alert to narcotics. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I just learned this morning 

that some very well trained dogs that are trained to alert 

for explosives will also alert for certain kinds of rubber 

in a tire. They didn't realize that. And I think it's 

entirely possible that dogs would -- there will be false 

alerts by -- by dogs because it's triggered by something 

that -- that is not really anticipated.

 MS. MADIGAN: One of the things that does take 

place during the training of these narcotics-detection 

dogs is to make sure that they are not alerting to things

that are not narcotics or -- I don't know exactly how the 

explosive training is conducted because we don't train our 

dogs in Illinois for explosives, but they purposely train 

them on narcotics not to alert to plastic wrap that is 

frequently the container used for narcotics, not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would agree the 

analysis would be different if there could be an innocent 

cause of the alert as well as the contraband being the 

cause of the alert.

 MS. MADIGAN: It depends. The analysis would be 

different if the dog was known to or had been trained to 

actually alert to the non-contraband. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or if that happened a large 

percentage of the time. I mean, surely you'd concede that 

the search is unreasonable if, for every -- every one 

time, you -- you make somebody open his bag because the 

dog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody 

open his bag because he has apples in it. I mean, 

wouldn't that go to the reasonableness of --

MS. MADIGAN: Well, it would actually go to 

whether or not that dog provided -- that dog's alert 

provided probable cause to conduct a search. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we -- we don't have 

the probable cause question before us, do we?

 MS. MADIGAN: You do not have the probable cause

question before you. This dog was determined to be 

reliable by the trial court and the Illinois Appellate 

Court, and it was not part of the Illinois Supreme Court's 

decision. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So what again in your view is the 

best distinction from Kyllo?

 MS. MADIGAN: Two things. One, the thermal 

imager used in Kyllo was able to reveal intimate details 

that individuals --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Like what? I thought it was 

just heat? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MS. MADIGAN: There was some disagreement on the 

Court about exactly what it revealed, but in terms of 

intimate details, it then allowed somebody --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Excuse me. What details? It 

is a device that measures heat.

 MS. MADIGAN: Because it could measure heat, it 

could also potentially determine when somebody was taking 

a bath, taking a sauna, and doing other intimate things in 

the house. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think there was a reference 

to my lady's bath in the opinion. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: A nice turn of phrase, as I 

recall.

JUSTICE BREYER: What was -- and what was the 

second?

 MS. MADIGAN: The second one would be the 

distinction between houses and cars and the protections 

that houses are given under the Fourth Amendment, which 

are far greater than the protections that people have in 

their cars. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so you think if this 

were a house, that the Kyllo case would apply?

 MS. MADIGAN: If this were a house in the 

situation, it would certainly bring out the tension 

between Kyllo and Place --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't there -- didn't Kyllo --

wasn't what -- what the Court was worried about in Kyllo 

not just the relatively crude heat imaging that existed in 

the case before it, but the prospect of more and more 

sophisticated heat imaging which -- which we had evidence 

was already in development that would enable you to see 

people moving around a room? I thought the case referred 

to that. Now, are we going to have more and more --

what's going to happen with dogs? I -- I can't imagine 

that -- that this thing is going anywhere other than 

smelling narcotics and smelling bombs. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you would argue that

the same rationale should apply if, instead of using dogs, 

you had some sophisticated device that would buzz or ring 

a bell or something whenever the odor of -- of narcotics 

was present, wouldn't you?

 MS. MADIGAN: I would argue that. So if there 

was an ability to create a -- a mechanical dog, for 

instance, we would again say that the use of a mechanical 

dog sniff would not be a search and therefore would not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There's nothing magical about 

the fact that it's an animal rather than a sophisticated 

device. It has better detection capacity than a human 

being does. That's the only difference. 

MS. MADIGAN: You are correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in discussing the -- the 

answer to the -- the Kyllo issue, you've -- you place an 

emphasis on the protection given to a house. Would you go 

back to Justice O'Connor's question and my earlier 

example? Is it still your answer that the police can walk 

dogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to 

the front door and ring the bell and see what it -- what 

it sniffs when the door is opened --

MS. MADIGAN: I would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- without there being a search 

and hence no Fourth Amendment concern?

 MS. MADIGAN: Yes, Justice Souter, I would say

that that is possible because the sniff itself is not a 

search and it only reveals the presence or absence of 

contraband, which is something that the individual does 

not have privacy expectations --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But then -- then the --

then there is no significance in the house.

 MS. MADIGAN: There is potentially significance 

in the house because the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when does -- when does it 

occur? I mean, if -- if -- first you say the -- the house 

is -- is a matter of significance for Kyllo analysis. 

We're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one, 

between Kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the 

house. They can sniff the foundations. They can go to 

the front door, et cetera. I don't see that the house, in 

fact, is functioning as a distinction at all. 

MS. MADIGAN: This Court's precedents have shown 

us that in fact Fourth Amendment protections are higher in 

the home than they are in the car. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I realize that, but it 

seems to me your basic argument, if I understand it, is 

there is simply no search here, and because there is no 

search here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with 

a house or a parking lot or a car on the road. No search 

is no search. So for purposes of -- if I -- I want to

understand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes 

of your case, there is no significance in the house 

because there doesn't have to be. The question doesn't 

arise because there's no search. Is that --

MS. MADIGAN: Justice Souter, that is absolutely 

correct. A search, as far as we are concerned -- and I 

believe it's based on the precedents of this Court -- is a 

sniff is not a search, and therefore it requires no Fourth 

Amendment justification. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said there's no 

disturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the 

dog sniff from some other governmental intrusions. But 

dogs can be frightening, humiliating. It seems to me that 

there is some association with the idea that I have a 

right to be let alone by my government and having a large 

dog circle my car.

 MS. MADIGAN: There are in this country millions 

of dogs, many of the types of dogs that are used by 

narcotics detection teams, such as Labrador retrievers and 

shepherds, are identical to the pets that people own. We 

encounter them in the parks, on the streets, and I would 

contend that an officer cannot be in the position of 

making a determination as to whether or not the individual 

that he encounters is going to be frightened by the dog.

 Mr. Justice Stevens, if I may, I'd like to

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. WRAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. WRAY: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 There's no dispute that respondent here was 

lawfully stopped based on probable cause. There's also no 

dispute that the entire stop took less than 9 minutes. 

The question is whether a second officer's use of a drug 

dog to sniff outside of that car during those 9 minutes 

required some separate Fourth Amendment justification. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with -- with 

General Madigan that it doesn't make any difference 

whether the -- the dog is a -- is a mechanical instrument 

or not? Do you agree it makes no difference? 

I thought that one of the -- one of the points 

in -- in the imaging case was that this was a new 

technology which didn't exist and that although the 

ordinary rules in 1791 was that there was no search unless 

-- you know, unless you enter the house or unless you --

you physically intrude upon the person's -- at least the

person's clothes, we made an exception to that rule 

because of this new technology that enabled you to find 

out things without having to intrude into the home or into 

the person. Now, but -- but this is not a new technology. 

This is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 1791 

just as they had it today. And the rule that when there's 

no intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to 

depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there 

would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology 

that would enable you to find out all sorts of things.

 MR. WRAY: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you shouldn't --

you shouldn't assume that -- that the fact that this is a 

canine makes no difference. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you going to rely on the 

fact that dogs were trained to do this sort of thing back 

in the 18th century?

 MR. WRAY: I'm going to rely on -- on three 

distinctions between this case and Kyllo, Justice Stevens.

 The first is that the three points that the 

Court looked at in Kyllo were: one, as has already been 

referenced, the fact that it's a home, the most sacred 

place under the Fourth Amendment; second, that it revealed 

certain intimate details; and third, that that was a 

technology --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It was potentially revealed. 

It did not actually reveal any details. 

MR. WRAY: As -- as General Madigan referenced, 

there is obviously some disagreement within the Court on 

that issue, but the -- the fact was that the technology in 

Kyllo revealed information about heat in the house which 

could be thought to reveal intimate details about the 

house. 

The third point in Kyllo, which I think Justice 

Scalia is referring to, is that that was technology that 

was not in general public use. Dogs have been used by law 

enforcement across the country since Place and before to 

sniff everything from --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But not in 1790. 

MR. WRAY: Not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you come here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that, do you? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you come here having 

researched all about dogs in 1790? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WRAY: Justice Kennedy, I cannot, I regret 

to say, tell you what dogs were doing in 1790. I can tell 

you -- and this is maybe a factual thing that might be of 

interest to the Court -- that the dogs who train -- who 

are trained to alert to detect things -- it's not that

they are sniffing things that all dogs can't already 

smell. It's rather that they are trained to let the 

handler know that they've smelt whatever it is they've 

been trained to smell. So the smells that are coming out 

of Respondent Caballes' car are exposed to every dog.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you really think this would 

be a different case if the officer had a device that did 

exactly what the dog -- dog did?

 MR. WRAY: We -- our position would still be, 

Justice Stevens, that as long as the device only revealed, 

as this does --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I would think you'd take --

MR. WRAY: -- the absence or presence of 

contraband, it would still be constitutional. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you rely on the -- in --

in distinguishing Kyllo, why do you rely on the house if 

there's no search? Why do you have to rely on the fact 

that there was a house involved there? You -- you listed 

that as one of your three distinctions. 

MR. WRAY: We don't believe we have to rely on 

it, Justice Souter. We do believe that there were three 

things that were important in Kyllo. The fact that it was 

a home was one of those things. Again, the -- the fact of 

a home, the fact that it was technology not in general 

public use, and --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that didn't go to whether 

it was a search or seizure. I think it goes to whether it 

was an unreasonable search or seizure. Don't you think 

so? That what -- what might be unreasonable with respect 

to a home would not be unreasonable with respect to a 

suitcase?

 MR. WRAY: Yes, Justice Scalia, that's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but your -- is -- is it 

-- I understand it to be your position that there simply 

is no search here. Period.

 MR. WRAY: That is correct, Justice Souter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's because it's a dog sniff.

 MR. WRAY: We would -- we would submit this is 

not a search because, as this Court recognized in both 

Place and Edmond -- and the Jacobsen case is also 

significant because the Court said that the reason this is 

not a search, there using the dog sniff by analogy, is 

because it compromises no legitimate privacy interest.

 The language of the Court in Place is 

significant because it says that we are aware of no other 

investigative procedure that is so limited in both the 

manner in which the information is obtained and in the 

content of the information revealed. That language goes 

not only to why it's not a Fourth Amendment search but why 

the use of the dog sniff during a probable cause traffic

stop here, where it doesn't prolong the duration, does not 

transform an otherwise lawful seizure into an unlawful 

one. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Do you -- do you 

think it's -- it's reasonable to say that if the police 

take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the 

foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door 

and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open, 

that there is -- there is no compromise of a privacy 

interest? 

MR. WRAY: Well, there would be a question as to 

whether the officer, the human officer, that is, could be 

on private property -- I take it from your hypothetical, 

Justice Souter -- in the first place. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, the Fourth 

Amendment analysis after Katz doesn't -- doesn't depend on 

trespass, and -- and you have said up to this point that 

there is no search. And then you have quite rightly said 

that we have had as a consideration in our minds 

analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police 

were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest.

 So I'm assuming -- I'm assuming that the police 

can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can 

certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell. 

And if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting

the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to, 

is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the 

privacy interests of the people who own the house?

 MR. WRAY: Our position would be -- the answer 

to that question is yes. The Court does not have to 

resolve that issue to decide this case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, we could separate 

the home from the -- from what happened here and still 

validate the search here if we held that it was a search, 

but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the 

person was carrying contraband. It's the only thing 

that's disclosed. Whereas, if you -- if you did the same 

thing with -- with regard to a house, which is a more 

sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an 

unreasonable search. We -- we could reach that result if 

we wanted to, couldn't we?

 MR. WRAY: I think you could, Justice Scalia. 

It's important to distinguish --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the other hand, if it were 

a drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs 

are frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view 

for the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around 

the public street where cars are parked around that known 

drug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some 

contraband in the cars? Is that okay?

 MR. WRAY: We believe it would be okay, Justice 

O'Connor. It would be important not to use the dogs in a 

way to constitute a new seizure because in that case, 

you're not talking --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm -- I'm assuming parked 

cars. You haven't interrupted anybody. Nobody is in the 

car, parked on a public street.

 MR. WRAY: In that instance, we believe that 

would be acceptable under the Fourth Amendment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you give no 

significance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the 

course of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had 

already been curtailed to a significant extent?

 MR. WRAY: We believe, Justice Kennedy, that the 

-- that that context here makes this an even easier case 

under the Fourth Amendment, that is, the dog sniff not 

being a search compromising no legitimate privacy 

interests during the course of a lawful probable cause 

stop, which we know from Atwater -- the officer could have 

simply placed the woman under full custodial arrest and 

taken her down to jail -- was not an activity that 

transformed the seizure into an unlawful one. 

The Illinois Supreme Court's concern and where 

we think they got off track was that they were concerned 

that the use of the dog sniff during this 9-minute traffic

stop was that it transformed it -- it used the language 

that it transformed the sniff into a drug investigation. 

We would submit that the Fourth Amendment is about the 

reasonableness of searches and seizures and not about what 

the scope of the government's investigation is. And in 

that sense, the court got off track.

 These -- this is a -- this is a means that law 

enforcement has been using properly in reliance on this 

Court's decision in Place, reinforced just 4 years ago in 

Edmond, for more than 21 years to detect everything from 

drugs to bombs to smuggled -- we have beagles in the 

airports that smuggle produce that's being smuggled in. 

Dogs are used all over the country with great 

effectiveness in law enforcement, and the -- we -- that is 

a -- a technique that we want to encourage law enforcement 

to pursue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there -- are there any 

manuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the 

time and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?

 MR. WRAY: Justice Ginsburg, there is extensive 

training of law enforcement to use dogs. It's a multi-

week program that requires --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't mean the training to 

make the dog alert properly. How the police will use 

them, when, under what circumstances.

 MR. WRAY: Justice Ginsburg, each agency has 

different policies about when they use dogs and what 

purpose they're trained for. In this case, as you heard, 

they're being used in the context of highway interdiction, 

and so they're trained to sniff around vehicles 

specifically.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH E. MECZYK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MECZYK: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 The State does not offer any Fourth Amendment 

justification whatsoever in regards to -- in this case. 

It argues instead that there -- there was no need for any 

justification, and that is incorrect for two reasons.

 The dog sniff in this case invaded a Fourth 

Amendment interest of Mr. Caballes in the context of a 

routine traffic search. The sniff in this case was, in 

fact, a search. Albeit it was a limited intrusion, it was 

still a search nonetheless. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do you say that? I 

mean, is -- is anything that I observe a search? I mean, 

suppose I -- I'm a policeman and -- and I'm looking out

for, I don't know, people with a nervous tic because I 

think that that might be somebody who's about to commit a 

crime or has committed a crime. Have I searched that 

person because I -- I observe something external?

 MR. MECZYK: Any observation I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there no difference between 

an investigation and a search?

 MR. MECZYK: There is in this case -- see if I 

understand you correctly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It seems to me your brief 

and -- and your statement here both seem to assume that 

there's a search whenever the police investigate.

 MR. MECZYK: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not so. They -- one 

can investigate without searching. 

MR. MECZYK: Well, to -- see if I understand 

your question correctly. If you're looking with someone 

with that nervous tic, that would be something in open 

view or plain view. That's not the type of investigation 

I'm talking about. There is in fact, most respectfully, 

an investigation technique here. There's an investigation 

measure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that isn't the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a policeman who 

smells marijuana coming out of a car or a residence. He's

walking down the street, public street, and he smells 

marijuana. 

MR. MECZYK: The only way I can analogize that, 

Justice Kennedy, is that it -- that is akin to a plain 

smell or plain view. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So once you say 

that, you realize that there are billions and billions of 

searches that go on every day that the police don't have 

to justify at all. They just look around.

 MR. MECZYK: I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? There are billions of 

them. So the real question is do they have to give a 

justification for this. And the argument that they don't 

is simply that it's not in the person's house. When you 

go out in a public place, even in your car, you might run 

into people or animals with sharp noses. And a lot of 

them can detect marijuana. And you know, maybe it's a 

Limburger cheese. I don't know. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: But people are sniffing things 

that they don't sniff through windows into your house, but 

they do get odors in your car on the street. So this is 

the kind of search. Yes, it's a search, but one that the 

police don't have to justify.

investigative tool. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's a specific 

investigative tool when I put on my glasses to look 

through a window.

 MR. MECZYK: Well, this is --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why it has to --

why that matters if in fact all -- if you go into a car, a 

police car, and you have -- drive through the neighborhood 

and look around, you are using a specific investigative 

tool, the police car, to look around and find out what's 

going on.

 MR. MECZYK: This is a far more -- most 

respectfully, this is a far more sophisticated 

investigative tool. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to get to is in 

my own mind it's not a question of the tools. It's a 

question of the expectation of privacy.

 MR. MECZYK: Then maybe I can see if I could 

answer your question. Mr. Caballes in this case indeed 

had an expectation of privacy. When he was asked by the 

police officer in this case if he can consent to the 

search, he said no. He did not want that law enforcement 

officer looking in --

it's not a search.

 MR. MECZYK: Well, there were --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It was the stop of the cars 

in that case that caused the result.

 MR. MECZYK: The way I understand Place it was 

contextually limited. In Place, the whole purpose of the 

seizure, the taking of the luggage, was to submit it to a 

drug-detection sniff. That is the opinion authored by 

Your Honor, that specifically stated -- I'm not going to 

say took for granted, but it specifically stated that the

-- the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Fine. We had a context there 

where we supported it, but in the process said the sniff, 

the dog sniff, was not a search.

something else here.

 MR. MECZYK: Well, I think that first in -- in 

that case, in Place, the -- the Court --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The context here was a 

legitimate traffic stop.

 MR. MECZYK: But it was -- unlike Place, the 

legitimate traffic stop here was completely unrelated to 

the purpose of the dog sniff. There was an absolute --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The dog sniff is not a 

search. What difference does it make?

 MR. MECZYK: Well, again, I would again 

respectfully assert that the dog sniff is a search and the 

way Place was decided, first, the decision had to be made, 

in the context of -- of that case, what was worse. What 

were they going to do with the luggage? Were they going 

to open the luggage first? So, of course, the Court had 

to decide in that case that it wasn't that kind of a -- a 

search. It wasn't as egregious a search as actually 

opening the luggage. 

Then you --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: This -- the trunk of the car 

didn't have to be opened here.

 MR. MECZYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The trunk of the vehicle did 

not have to be opened here. You're talking about a dog

sniffing on the exterior of the vehicle that was

MR. MECZYK: Again, in this context, unlike in 

Place, there was absolutely no relationship between the --

the dog sniff and the dog sniff of Caballes' trunk and the 

sniff of the luggage that was placed at LaGuardia Airport 

in Place. There's a great distinction. Moreover --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose a policeman follows me 

around. He just -- just follows me around, observing with 

his -- with plain eyes, nothing else. Now, is that a 

search? Does he need probable cause to do that? Now, he's 

wasting his time and he's wasting public money and maybe he 

should get fired for doing it, if he has no reason to follow 

me.

 MR. MECZYK: It's not a search.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And maybe -- maybe I'd have a 

harassment action against him if he does it, you know, 

blatantly. But is that a search?

 MR. MECZYK: It is not a search. If he follows 

you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So -- so the mere fact 

that one is in investigating something doesn't make it a 

search. What does make it a search?

 MR. MECZYK: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The fact that you find out

something? 

MR. MECZYK: I think here the most distinctive 

point here is that Caballes had already been stopped 

unlike the hypothetical that you just presented to me. 

Caballes was already stopped for one -- for probable 

cause. There's no question about that. But then now the 

police launch into a wholly unrelated investigation 

that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it would be better if 

he hadn't been stopped? If -- if they just -- just 

randomly walked up to somebody who was going through a 

toll booth and had the dog sniff the car, you think that 

would be a better case --

MR. MECZYK: I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for allowing it than -- than 

yours?

 MR. MECZYK: Even in that case, even in a 

hypothetical where they used the dog for a toll booth, I 

have a problem with that. That to me is a search. It's 

different than -- I would assert it's different than if 

they walked -- one of the hypotheticals that the Justices 

asked my adversary in this case, when they asked, well, 

what if they walked the dog instead around a -- parked 

cars or parked cars at a stadium? It depends for what 

purpose they want to walk those parked -- that dog around

those parked cars. My assertion is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they said it's to find 

out if there's any contraband.

 MR. MECZYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer was they are at 

liberty -- the police are at liberty to use dogs to find 

contraband. And your -- Illinois I think was very candid 

with the Court in saying we have taken from your decisions 

that a dog sniff is not a search. So anything else is a 

matter of police policy. It had nothing to do with the 

Fourth Amendment. 

MR. MECZYK: Well, I -- I strongly differ. I 

have to look at the purpose that they are going to use the 

dog for. This Court --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does it matter if, for 

instance, in today's world on Capitol Hill we're concerned 

about terrorist attacks. What if the dog is trained to 

alert to explosives? Now, can the police just decide 

they're going to sniff any car that's parked on Capitol 

Hill?

 MR. MECZYK: Justice O'Connor, it depends on the 

purpose. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes or no, in your view. The 

purpose is to disclose potential explosives in a parked 

vehicle.

 MR. MECZYK: The answer is yes. I have no

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Wherever it is. 

MR. MECZYK: Wherever it is because I look at it 

as a public safety exception. And this Court in the 

Edmond case specifically condemned a general search -- a 

general crime -- let me use the exact words. General 

interest in crime control, to quote the Edmond case. And 

that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: I still want to go back to my 

question because I think you may have an answer to it and 

I want to focus you --

MR. MECZYK: I'm struggling, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I want to focus you on the 

question. I think what you're doing, which is a 

reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to 

the English definition of search. I say forget that. 

Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a 

whole range of searches that don't even fall within the 

Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a 

justification. And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs 

is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word 

English search. 

So I want to know why it is that this dog search 

is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e.,

one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of 

what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.

 MR. MECZYK: It invades a public -- I'm sorry. 

It invades a private space that in this particular case 

the respondent Caballes had a privacy interest in, that he 

wanted to exclude the whole world from going inside his 

trunk. That's the difference. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't respond to 

one point in Place, if I remember correctly. It must be a 

legitimate expectation of privacy, and if the only thing 

the dog can detect is something illegitimate, how can you 

say there's an invasion of a legitimate expectation in 

privacy?

 MR. MECZYK: Well, it is -- it's true that one 

does not have an expectation of privacy in contraband, but 

by the same token, I have an expectation or Mr. Caballes 

had an expectation of -- of privacy of what's inside that 

closed trunk, his car. The Carroll doctrine is still good 

law. We still apply the Fourth Amendment in cars. It's 

true that the home is sacrosanct, but just because it's a 

home, it's not a talisman where -- where the Fourth 

Amendment no longer applies. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was something you said 

in -- in your brief that I thought was unclear. So may I 

ask you --

 MR. MECZYK: Of course. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if Officer Gillette, the 

one who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the back 

of his car, instead of having the second officer come with 

the dog, would it have been permissible? I thought you 

had conceded that it would be a different situation if the 

dog was already there when the car stopped.

 MR. MECZYK: First of all, Justice Ginsburg, my 

recollection is that Trooper Gillette, who was the officer 

who stopped Caballes, did not have a -- a dog in the car. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, he didn't, but I'm asking 

you to imagine that he did. 

MR. MECZYK: I see. If he had a dog in the car 

and the dog just happened to have alerted without his 

cuing the dog or walking the dog -- and I'll answer that 

in a moment too -- that would be pure serendipity. That 

might happen. If -- if the dog just happened to have 

alerted. But if the troopers deliberately drove the car 

close by -- and in reality, that's not what happens. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I would like to take 

this scenario as it is except that when the officer gets 

out of the car, his dog comes with him. 

MR. MECZYK: Okay. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is very -- make no other 

changes except that Gillette has the dog and Gillette with

the dog go to Mr. Caballes' car.

 MR. MECZYK: My understanding of the way this 

works, Justice Ginsburg, is that he just couldn't go up to 

the car without -- and the dog would alert. My 

understanding of the way these dogs are trained is that 

they specifically -- that the officer has to walk the dog 

around the car, the vehicle, first of all. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: He does that. He does that.

 MR. MECZYK: He does that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, in this case.

 MR. MECZYK: He does that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MECZYK: To cue the dog. In other words, 

tell him it's not playtime anymore, that he has to work.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. MECZYK: To trigger something in the -- in 

the canine brain. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be bad? Would it be 

bad if that's what he did? 

MR. MECZYK: It wouldn't be bad that's what --

well, yes. In this case it's very bad because it's a 

search. There's no question. I'm not coming off of that.

understand what you meant in your brief when you said if 

the dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped 

Caballes, the situation would have been different. 

MR. MECZYK: I -- I think what I meant there --

there would have been -- it would have been purely 

happenstance, almost like plain view. It would have been 

-- without him even cuing the dog or starting to walk the 

dog around, my answer to that Justice Ginsburg is that 

that would have been all right. 

Except now that -- the more I think about it, 

I'm not so sure that it would be all right. And my answer 

to -- and the reason for that is I think in that case the 

officer, if he could do such a thing and the dog would 

alert, would be exploiting the situation, would just be 

taking the dog and walking him around the car and seeing 

that the dog alerted. So in other words, there -- there 

would be, I think, an exploitation of -- of the -- of the 

traffic stop. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then it really makes no 

difference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his 

car or whether the dispatcher called another officer who 

had the dog. 

MR. MECZYK: That is correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't -- so you're 

retracting that.

 You, I think, were asked but I'm -- I'm not sure 

you fully answered. Suppose the police, as Atwater would 

allow, arrested, made a full arrest of Caballes, and then 

they impound his car. In the place where they put it, 

couldn't they have a dog go around the car there?

 MR. MECZYK: Yes. Yes. I -- if we had an 

Atwater situation -- in this case there wasn't an Atwater 

situation because there was first a warning given. You're 

correct. There was a warning given. I'm sorry. The 

officer Gillette told Caballes he was going to give him a 

warning. So unlike the Knowles --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. He could 

have. I mean --

MR. MECZYK: He could have, but he didn't. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is -- is --

MR. MECZYK: But he didn't. He didn't. 

Instead, he chose to treat this as more of a Knowles 

situation. This case is -- is on all fours, no pun 

intended, like Knowles. In other words, in the -- in 

Knowles v. Iowa, the Court -- a case of this -- I'm sorry. 

Let me untwist my tongue. In Knowles v. Iowa, you had a --

you had a traffic stop and after the traffic stop, there 

was a statute that said unrelated to the traffic stop, you 

can go in and search. And this is the same thing. This 

officer here Gillette treated Caballes as the officer in

Knowles in -- treated Mr. Knowles in Iowa. It's the exact 

same thing. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the difficulty 

that I have with that argument is take the -- take the 

case of -- of the arrestable offense in which it is 

undoubtedly the case that although the police don't 

normally arrest, they -- they can. Your -- if I 

understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact, 

do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and 

indeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an 

inventory search because they've got to protect themselves 

against claims that they lost property and so on. So 

there's no question that in that case, as -- as you have 

argued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and 

certainly can use the dog. But if they choose not to 

arrest on the highway, they can't. 

My problem is how can you say that there is a 

reasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if 

you admit that the police can search in case number one. 

How does that affect the reasonable expectation of 

privacy?

 MR. MECZYK: To me, once a person is told that 

he is not going to be under arrest, it changes the whole 

complexion of the case. I think it's a completely 

different -- a completely different scenario. We don't

have an arrest. It doesn't matter. Atwater --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the officer change his 

mind? I mean, he -- he did say I'm just going to give you 

a citation, and then he said, mind if I search your car. 

This is before the -- the dog showed up. And suppose the 

person who had been speeding said, yes, I mind. Don't 

search my car. And then the police said, well, in that 

case I'm going to arrest you.

 MR. MECZYK: It's a difficult question, but I 

have to look at what -- I think reasonableness is judged. 

Again, I'm going to remember what the -- those cases 

taught. I think what Knowles taught, that reasonableness 

is judged by what the police actually do as opposed to 

what they might have done. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Meczyk, I assume that your 

answer to whether it's lawful to have a -- a dog at a bus 

depot just to sniff the bags of people who were coming 

off, without stopping them, but just -- just to have the 

dogs there, that's unlawful.

 MR. MECZYK: It depends --

JUSTICE SCALIA: For narcotics, not for bombs, 

not for -- just -- just for narcotics. The police think, 

you know, a lot of narcotics goes on interstate buses. 

We're going to put a dog in the bus depot.

 MR. MECZYK: It's a little less problematic to

me, Justice Scalia, than the type of stop I'm talking 

about here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

MR. MECZYK: It's a little less problematic. 

One, because it's a public place and I -- I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so is the road, for 

Pete's sake. 

MR. MECZYK: I know, but -- but here I think 

there's a lesser expectation of privacy. Well, I don't 

even want to go that far. I -- I have to answer your 

question. I think that submitting the dogs without any --

submitting the luggage without any reasonable articulable 

suspicion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MECZYK: -- unlike the case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MECZYK: -- unlike the case in -- in Place, 

that that to me is still a search. So --

think you should say. 

MR. MECZYK: And I am saying it.

it you don't --

robbery. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: He stopped the car and he walks 

around. Anything wrong with that?

 MR. MECZYK: There's nothing wrong if he can 

detect Limburger cheese. That to me is like plain smell. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. MECZYK: As awful as that --

JUSTICE BREYER: So plain --

MR. MECZYK: As awful as it might be --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- so what 

you're saying is -- and this must tie back to reasonable 

expectation of privacy. All right? Because it's okay for 

the policeman to do it, and it's okay for dogs to do it in 

the bus station, and it's okay to use a dog not in the bus 

station with a car if in fact you actually are going to 

put him under arrest, although here you had probable cause 

to do so, I take it. And now you have to draw a pretty 

fine line. But it's not okay where it's not the bus 

station, but it is the car and in fact the dog is doing 

the sniffing -- and there are a lot of dogs around that 

can sniff -- and you did have probable cause but you

if it were going into the bus terminal just to sniff for 

narcotics, unlike explosives, it would be an impermissible 

search.

 MR. MECZYK: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

What makes this particular so --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but is -- why -- why 

don't you simply say, look -- have a very simple line. If 

they can arrest, they can sniff. If they can't arrest, 

they can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to 

drugs or whatever.

 MR. MECZYK: I would agree with that if I use an 

-- if -- if you're referring to an Atwater type scenario. 

If they have probable -- if they decide to arrest, even 

though it's on a minor traffic case, such as Atwater, 

which was a seat belt, as long as it's -- if -- if it's 

minor and if the officer elects to choose to do a full-

blown arrest, then all the consequences that follow from 

that arrest are -- it's going to happen. Excuse me. It's 

going to happen. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- what is the answer 

to the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that 

case? Isn't your expectation of privacy identical, 

whatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of 

privacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to 

the discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or 

not?

 MR. MECZYK: I -- I think that when the officer 

does a full-blown arrest, as was envisioned in Atwater,

you know that you -- the person knows that he or she does 

not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that the --

the reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the 

officer's discretionary judgment whether or not to arrest. 

Isn't that what you're saying?

 MR. MECZYK: Essentially yes, because I think 

that the officer takes a physical action. It's just more 

than words. It's also his deeds. I think in Atwater, 

unlike Knowles -- in Atwater, in that case, I think the --

the officer did make an election, and there was a full-

blown or a full-fledged arrest. And I think there your --

your reasonable expectation to privacy does, in fact, go 

out the window. 

But this is so different. This was just a 

warning. Period. It was nothing worse than a warning. 

What makes this stop so pernicious is that it takes place 

in front of the whole world and is accusatory. It is 

profoundly embarrassing, and it is humiliating to everyone 

on the street. So if a person is stopped and the officer 

just decides to stop you for a minor traffic offense, 

that's the worst part about this case. Just a minor 

traffic offense, really a frivolous offense, basically 

what any law-abiding citizen would happen to -- it could 

happen to anyone. And as this Court has said, even in

Whren, there are so many multiple technical violations of 

-- of -- technical violations --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I think it's worse if 

-- if you're subjected to it without having committed any 

violation at all. Every time I travel abroad and come 

back into the country, customs officers have dogs and --

and they parade the dogs through -- through the baggage 

terminal. Do -- do I feel offended by that? 

MR. MECZYK: No, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't a public safety 

matter. They're -- they're not smelling for bombs. 

They're -- they're smelling for contraband. And according 

to you, that is bad.

 MR. MECZYK: That -- in that situation, when you 

enter the country -- and this Court has said many times 

again -- it's a border search. There's nothing that I can 

argue against the border search. It's the -- or the 

functional equivalent of the border. That is a border 

search. I bring luggage to the airport, in today's world 

I have a lesser expectation of privacy. If I know I'm 

traveling abroad and coming into the United States, that's 

different. That's different in an airport. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. A bus station is 

different, though.

 MR. MECZYK: A bus station here inside the

United States is different I think. I -- I look at your 

airport hypothetical as being -- as dealing with a border. 

If it's not at a border and I use your hypothetical, it's 

at O'Hare Airport or Reagan International Airport and they 

bring a dog up to sniff for drugs at the carousel, that to 

me is a search. It's like -- I think you said in one 

opinion once if it -- you used the duck analogy, well, if 

it walks like a duck or quacks like a duck. Here it's 

still a search. It walks like a -- a dog and it acts like 

a dog, but its specific function is in fact to search out 

in public and humiliate people. 

If there are any further questions. 

I respectfully ask this honorable Court to 

affirm the wise judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court. 

Thank you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Meczyk.

 General Madigan, you have I think about 3 

minutes left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. MADIGAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens. 

Let me make three brief points. 

Number one, Justice Ginsburg asked a question 

about something that was in the respondent's brief, 

whether or not it made a difference if a dog was with

Master Sergeant Gillette when he initiated the stop or if 

the dog was later brought, as was the case here, by 

Trooper Graham. Really what Mr. Caballes is arguing for 

here is an inadvertence requirement which this Court very 

clearly held in Horton, there is no such requirement of 

inadvertence. And so a law officer, if they are at a 

lawful vantage point, do have the ability to detect 

incriminating facts. That is not something that has to 

occur inadvertently. It can happen intentionally.

 Second, Justice Scalia asked a question about 

plain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does 

not effect an incremental search or seizure. And 

therefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not 

require Fourth Amendment justification.

 And let me finally acknowledge something that 

Justice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by 

walking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a 

search. Let me -- now, that is certainly a closer case 

than whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a 

search, which we say is not. But ultimately you would 

reach a similar result because the principle is not going 

to extend to cars in the same manner in -- in Kyllo as the 

thermal imager did.

 Finally, if there are no further questions, we 

would ask that the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court
