 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-893, AT&T 

Mobility v. Concepcion.

 Mr. Pincus.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Ninth Circuit concluded in this case 

that a State law may mandate the use of a particular 

procedure in arbitration as long as the law also 

requires the use of that same procedure in litigation. 

That interpretation of section 2 of the Federal 

Arbitration Act would permit a State to oppose in 

arbitration any procedure employed in court and thereby 

require arbitration to be a carbon copy of litigation, 

precisely what the Act was designed to prevent.

 Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act 

provides that an arbitration agreement may be held 

unenforceable under State law only if the State law rule 

being invoked to invalidate the agreement qualifies as a 

ground that exists in law or equity for the revocation 

of any contract. Respondent argues that, because

California's Discover Bank rule does not facially 

discriminate against arbitration, it falls within the 

savings clause. But the plain language of the savings 

clause makes clear that it is not limited to statutes 

that discriminates facially against arbitration.

 By referring to "any contract," it makes 

clear that, as this Court has said, the rule must be 

applicable to contracts generally.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if a State 

finds it unconscionable to have an arbitration clause in 

an adhesion contract which requires the arbitration to 

be held at a great distance from -- from where the other 

party is and requires that party to pay the cost of the 

arbitration? Can a State not find that to be 

unconscionable?

 MR. PINCUS: It can, Your Honor, and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that wouldn't apply 

to other -- to other contracts.

 MR. PINCUS: But the legal doctrine that the 

State is applying there, as States have and as we 

discuss in our brief, is a doctrine that applies a 

general principle of unconscionability with principles 

elucidating how it applies that apply evenhandedly 

across the board.

judgment? Are we going to sit in judgment? I know you 

say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a 

State wants to apply a lesser standard of 

unconscionability, can we strike that down?

 MR. PINCUS: If it wants to apply a lesser 

standard to arbitration clauses, yes, absolutely you 

can, because that would -- that would violate what is at 

the core of the provision, which is discrimination 

against State law.

 If a State -- if a State enacted -- if the 

legislature enacted a statute and it was headed 

arbitration -- unconscionability, rather, and section 1 

of that statute had general principles to be applied to 

all contractual provisions to determine 

unconscionability: It must shock the conscience, the 

question is addressed with respect to the party before 

the court against whom the contract is going to be 

applied, and the third principle is unconscionability is 

decided ex ante. And then section B said -- I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference, 

then, with the act that you are positing? A State comes 

in -- or I should ask: Is there no difference between a 

State saying these terms in a contract are 

unconscionable, making the petitioner always pay the 

fees and making him or her arbitrate in a different

State -- that is unconscionable -- or a general rule of 

State law that says in a contract of adhesion the 

stronger party can't impose undue cost or expenses on 

the other side to vindicate their rights, whether it's 

in litigation and/or arbitration.

 In your mind, there is no difference between 

those two things, between these two approaches to the 

issue?

 MR. PINCUS: I don't think so, Justice 

Sotomayor. Maybe if I could finish with my example, it 

may elucidate the distinction that I'm trying to draw.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you address 

Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no 

difference between those two things, then how can a 

State find those terms unconscionable? Under what 

theory, general theory of law, would they be -­

MR. PINCUS: I think the critical question 

is: Is the State applying the same principles to 

arbitration, of unconscionability to arbitration 

agreements, as to other agreements? And in my example I 

was positing a first provision that laid out three 

principles that would be applied.

 If part B of that section, or part 2 of that 

section, said with respect to arbitration agreements, on 

the other hand, we are going to require that the

procedures be equivalent to what is in court, we are 

going to look at the time the dispute arises rather than 

ex ante, and we are going to look at the effect on 

everyone, then I think it would be quite clear that that 

would be discrimination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is bad, absolutely, 

but that's not what the State is going to do. The State 

is simply going to say: We find this to be 

unconscionable. And you say it's not unconscionable; 

it's very fair. And the State says: Eh, we think it is 

unconscionable.

 Are we going to tell the State of California 

what it has to consider unconscionable?

 MR. PINCUS: Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I 

don't think that's what the State is doing here. I 

think what the State is doing here is saying -- is not 

saying, under the same principles we apply elsewhere, 

this is unconscionable. They're just saying, it's quite 

clear that it's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's nothing -­

MR. PINCUS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is nothing that 

indicates that California's laws are applying a 

different concept of unconscionability. You haven't 

come up and said, oh, look what they did here. And in

another case they said it has to shock the conscience.

 Maybe across the board, California is 

saying: We think that unconscionability should have a 

broader meaning. Is it unfair to the weaker party 

to the bargain? Is there really no genuine agreement 

here? And if that is so, that will fit our definition 

of unconscionability.

 You don't have anything that says -- the 

California court hasn't said: We are applying a special 

definition of unconscionability to arbitration 

agreements.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, they haven't said that, 

Your Honor, but their opinion makes clear that they do. 

For example, the statute in California that defines 

unconscionability specifically says unconscionability 

shall be assessed at the time of contracting.

 Here, the decision holding the Discover Bank 

rule is specifically based on a determination of 

unconscionability, not ex ante, when there would be a 

variety of situations to consider, but it is explicitly 

based at the time the dispute arose.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I was under the impression 

MR. PINCUS: So it's clear that they are 

applying a different -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: I was under the impression, 

Mr. Pincus, that Discover Bank specifically cites a case 

which arose not in the arbitration context, but instead 

in the general litigation context, which is this America 

Online case, and thereby made clear that its rule, 

however different it may seem to you from normal 

contract provisions, its rule applied both in the 

arbitration sphere and in the litigation sphere.

 MR. PINCUS: Justice Kagan, I think that 

question goes to -- to a separate question. I think 

Respondent has two arguments. One is, because this rule 

applies to all dispute resolution provisions, it is a 

general -- it applies to any contract that qualifies 

under section 2. We think that that clearly can't be 

the case, for several reasons.

 First of all, section 2 says "any contract," 

and that, the Court has said, means principles that 

apply to contracts generally, not principles that are 

limited to dispute resolution contracts.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, this -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, any contract that 

would have an arbitration clause.

 MR. PINCUS: True, Your Honor. But if the 

provision meant that, then as long as -- as long as a 

State law banning arbitration said, we are banning

arbitration in any contract, then the State could say it 

applied to any contract. Or a provision that said 

juries are required to resolve every dispute, whether in 

arbitration or not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we criticize one 

feature of this? You are not claiming that, vis à vis 

litigation, arbitration is being disfavored, which was 

the original concern about arbitration agreements and 

what prompted the Federal Arbitration Act. The courts 

didn't like to have their business taken away, and so 

they were disfavoring arbitration contracts.

 That is no part of the picture here, as far 

as I can see, because the rule is the same whether it's 

litigation or arbitration.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, we -- we do make an 

argument, Your Honor, that the impact of this rule is 

much more significant on arbitration than it is on 

litigation, because it basically -- with respect to 

litigation, it is reaffirming the default rule, but with 

respect to arbitration, it has a quite significant 

different effect, which is really to transform 

arbitration in the ways that the Court described in 

Stolt-Nielsen.

 And so we do argue that it does have a 

disproportionate burden, but our principal argument here

is that the "any contract" requirement means that the 

State law rule being applied has to be a rule that 

applies generally to contractual provisions, as the 

Court has said.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but some -- some 

elements of unconscionability can only arise in a 

litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring 

the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a 

distant location. How could that possibly apply in -­

to any other contracts?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, that -- that now turns to 

the second argument that Respondents make, which is, 

even if the mere fact that it applies to litigation and 

arbitration satisfied section 2, the rule satisfied -­

satisfies section 2 because it is merely a specific 

application of California's general unconscionability 

rule.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. PINCUS: And -- and our response to that 

is: It is quite clear that in three critical respects, 

it is the principles that were applied -- not the 

result, but the principles that were applied in order to 

find unconscionability here -- are different than the 

principles applied in every other context. By example

JUSTICE SCALIA: Three? What are the three?

 MR. PINCUS: The three are, first of all, 

looking to the effect on people other than the parties 

to the dispute. In every other case -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to ask you 

about that. Right.

 MR. PINCUS: -- the question is: Is it fair 

to the person before the court to apply the contract to 

them? Here, the district court found it was quite fair 

to apply to that person; the problem was third parties.

 The second issue: When is the 

unconscionability decision made? As I said, the statute 

says ex ante. Here, the decisions explicitly say: We 

are going to look at it at the time the dispute arises.

 Third question: The general standard is 

shock the -- so unfair as to shock the conscience. Here 

the standard is: Is there a deterrent effect equivalent 

to a judicial class action?

 Three critical differences, three 

differences that are not differences in result, but are 

differences in the legal principles that are being 

applied to determine unconscionability.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that Discover 

Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that 

correct?

MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's California law. 

And what they say in Discover Bank is -- they are 

talking about class waivers in both arbitration 

contracts and not arbitration contracts. And they say 

they are void when it's a consumer contract of adhesion, 

when they predictably involve small amounts of damages, 

when it is claimed that the party with the superior 

bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately 

to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually 

small sums of money, and the waiver becomes in practice 

the exemption of the party from responsibility for its 

own fraud.

 Now, seems to -- those seem to be the 

principles that apply. Those principles apply to 

litigation. They apply to arbitration. What's the 

problem? They don't say anything there about the things 

you mention. They just mention four things, which I 

just read.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, and the only -- as I 

said, there are two questions in this case and I think 

it's helpful to keep them separate. One is: Is it 

permissible, simply because the rule applies to both 

litigation and arbitration, is that sufficient to

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I would guess it's 

like Switzerland having a law saying, we only buy milk 

from cows who are in pastures higher than 9,000 feet. 

That discriminates against milk from the rest of the 

continent. But to say we want cows that have passed the 

tuberculin test doesn't. So I guess we have to look at 

the particular case.

 And here, my impression is -- correct me if 

I am wrong -- the class arbitration exists. It's not 

a -- it's not like having a jury trial. You could have 

it in arbitration. You can have it in litigation. So 

where is the 9,000-foot cow, or whatever it is? Where 

is the discrimination?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think this is exactly 

the 9,000-foot meadow, Your Honor, because I think the 

problem here is there is -- it is not possible, based on 

the language of section 2 or any other basis that we can 

think of, to say a statute that requires the full use of 

discovery procedures in court and in arbitration or 

factual determinations by a panel of six individuals 

selected at random -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, are they 

necessarily saying that? As I read it, the plaintiff 

brought a case to court, not to arbitration, and then 

there was a motion to stay the State court litigation.

Why isn't it a proper reading of this case 

to say: You want -- if you are in the arbitration 

forum, it's bilateral, but you can't dupe these 

plaintiffs out of a class action? So if you don't have 

a class action in arbitration, you can have it in court. 

That is, the class action is preserved, not necessarily 

in the arbitration forum, but in the court.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think the problem, 

Justice Ginsberg, is both prongs of that requirement are 

independently problematic. I think, for the reasons 

that I was just saying and I think for the reasons that 

the Court explained in Stolt-Nielsen, requiring class 

arbitration is just the same as requiring discovery or a 

jury trial or all of the other judicial processes in 

arbitration. And if the alternative prong of that is to 

say, well, if you don't do that you must exclude these 

claims from arbitration -­

have to arbitration -- class actions in all arbitration 

proceedings. They are identifying a class of cases in 

which they pursue the State, who's their own sovereign, 

and the savings clause in the FAA permits them in law or 

equity to set forth rules to say in this subset of cases 

there is a substantive right being affected. That is 

different than rules that are looking at procedures and 

setting uniform procedures in both.

 How do we draw the line between a law that 

says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one 

that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the 

superior party retains the right to do discovery but 

tells the inferior party, you can't? And a State says, 

that's unconscionable.

 MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think that's the 

precise difference between the two issues that are -­

that are in this case. For the reason we have been 

discussing, we think there is a very strong argument 

that a rule cannot qualify to be saved under section 2 

simply because it applies even-handedly to arbitration 

and litigation because of the fact that that would sweep 

in all of these other rules that we are talking about.

 And an additional reason, to respond to 

Justice Breyer's question, is that at the time that the 

FAA was enacted the ouster doctrine did apply to

arbitration litigation. It was a broad doctrine in 

which courts said: We are going to invalidate any 

contractual provision that deprives us of jurisdiction 

whether it directs the claim to arbitration or it 

directs the claim to some other court.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Pincus -­

MR. PINCUS: And so the very same argument 

being made here could have been made then.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not 

understanding what test you are asking us to formulate. 

Justice Scalia started this by saying, how about a 

provision prohibiting certain kinds of attorney's fees? 

How about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of -- a 

law prohibiting certain kinds of discovery provisions? 

And you said that would be fine, for the State courts to 

hold those things unconscionable, but it's not fine for 

the State court to hold a class arbitration prohibition 

unconscionable.

 So what separates the two? How do we know 

when something is on one side of the line and something 

is on the other? Both procedures, but you say some are 

fine, to say that those procedures are unconscionable, 

but other procedures if you held them unconscionable 

that would not be sufficient.

 MR. PINCUS: What separates the two is, is

determination is made applying principles that apply to

doctrine across the board.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: The State says yes.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, but I think -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: The State says it absolutely 

is. Now, who are we to say that the State is wrong 

about that.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, let me answer that in two 

ways, Justice Kagan. First of all, let me explain why 

the hypotheticals that you posit and that Justice Scalia 

posited and that Justice Sotomayor posited have been 

addressed under the traditional unconscionability 

doctrine that we described. In all of those cases, what 

courts have said is this provision -- we are measuring 

whether it is unconscionable at the time of contracting; 

we are looking at the effect on the party before the 

court; can this person get to arbitration, is the fee 

too high, is it too far away. What about -- we are 

looking at the effect on this particular person and we 

are deciding whether it shocks the conscience or 

whatever their across-the-board State standard is.

 And in all of those cases, that's what those 

courts do, and that's why those provisions have been

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that -- I don't 

want to interrupt your complete answer.

 MR. PINCUS: Sure.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought that was the 

gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that 

traditional unconscionability in California and 

elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is 

before the tribunal. So here it would be unfairness to 

the Concepcions, rather than unfairness to other members 

of the class who are not before the court.

 MR. PINCUS: That's exactly right, 

Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Pincus, the State 

says, well, our unconscionability doctrine may not have 

done that in the past, but now in the year 2010 it 

actually applies to more things than it did in the past, 

and we do take into account third parties and that's our 

new unconscionability doctrine. Now, it may be a good 

unconscionability doctrine or it may be a bad 

unconscionability doctrine, but it's the State's 

unconscionability doctrine.

 MR. PINCUS: But it is not the State's

general unconscionability doctrine, Justice Kagan. It 

is a doctrine that applies only in the context of class 

waivers and that's the problem. If the State were to 

adopt a general statute that said, for unconscionability 

purposes henceforward we will look in assessing the 

unconscionability of every provision at third parties, 

at the impact on third parties and whether it's fair to 

them, perhaps they could do that.

 I think there might be some reasons why a 

State wouldn't do that, because that would upset a lot 

of things in the judicial system that we think of as 

routine, such as confidential settlements and the fact 

that arbitration doesn't require publication or estoppel 

and all kinds of rules could be invalidated on that 

ground. But at least it would be an even-handed rule 

that the State applied across the board, and it would 

also apply to things like the level of rent in rent 

contracts and statutes of limitations and all sorts of 

things.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, why, why?

 MR. PINCUS: But here, that's not -- I'm 

sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? That's I think what 

Justice Kagan is getting at. If a State wants to have a 

doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a

certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've 

never done it before, but now they do it, and on that 

kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration 

contract and on the other. And here what they've done 

is they have listed the four characteristics from 

Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with 

litigation have to satisfy those four.

 At which point I think Justice Kagan said, 

so what if they've never done this before? They sure 

have done it now. And what's the basis for saying that 

the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law 

forbids California from doing that?

 MR. PINCUS: Two answers to that, 

Justice Breyer. First of all, they haven't done it 

generally with respect to contracts. They have made up 

a special rule that is targeted on a special kind of 

contract and that carries -- to the extent one is 

worried about discrimination -- nonfacial discrimination 

designing the category of contracts relating to 

litigation or dispute resolution is precisely the kind 

of category that most presents the risk of 

discrimination that isn't facial.

 And again, whatever any contract means, we 

think it has to mean that the category of dispute 

resolution contracts can't be one that satisfies any

contract, because at the time the law was enacted the 

ouster doctrine did just that and it was the doctrine 

that was being targeted.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that 

all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts 

pertain to a class that is not entirely universal. 

Suppose the State had a statute referring to banks, 

contracts with banks. That doesn't apply to all 

contracts. It doesn't apply to railroads. But we know 

that it applies to a class that generally includes both 

arbitration and non-arbitration. And that's this case, 

because there can be class action rule with respect to 

litigation and class action rules with respect to 

arbitration. So you have to have some rule that 

recognizes that you don't have to have the entire 

universe of contracts.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm not quite sure 

what your test is. You have a few of them in your 

brief.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think the "any 

contract" language of the statute shows that Congress 

was not enacting -- was not providing that everything 

other than facial discrimination qualifies for the 

savings clause, because it could have said any

nondiscriminatory rule. It said a rule that applies to 

any contract. And the reason for that we think is 

because of the ouster doctrine it was confronted with, 

which did apply to both arbitration and litigation 

contracts, and because of the risk generally that a 

contract rule could be devised that maybe didn't 

facially discriminate against arbitration, but had the 

effect of targeting arbitration disproportionately and 

that's what is going on.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you have special 

rules applicable to banks?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, most -- most -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Contracts by banks, can't a 

State say, you know, certain bank contracts have to have 

this or that?

 MR. PINCUS: In most of the examples that we 

have looked at of situations like that, the contract 

principles that are being applied are general 

principles, and perhaps they are being applied -- they 

are being specified for four particular categories of 

contracts, like the UCC, but they are tied to general 

principles.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They claim that here. They 

claim it's the general principle of unconscionability.

discussed, the problem here it has the label 

"unconscionability" on it, but the test that is applied 

has nothing to do with the test that is applied in every 

other context. So it's an easy case to decide. Going 

back to my statutory example, this is an 

unconscionability -- this is a test that may have the 

label on it, but everything that the court looks at to 

find unconscionability or to find this impermissible are 

things that are not looked at in the other context. And 

in the other context, indeed as the district court said, 

this contract is more than fair under our general 

unconscionability standard, because it -- the people 

before the court are better off than they would be in a 

class action.

State has devised a rule that clearly discriminates, but 

has simply put the label on -- of unconscionability, 

surely the FAA permits the Court to look at that. 

Otherwise it's -- the protection will be reduced to 

nothing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if we look at the 

California law and we find other instances of 

unconscionability that are applying a standard less 

stringent than "shock the conscience," then we would say 

okay?

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. I think that 

the critical question here -- are there other cases that 

look to the effect on the party before the court? We 

found none and -- and Respondents have found none. Are 

there other case that assess the -- whether it's 

unconscionability at the time of the dispute rather than 

at the time of contracting? There are none. The 

statute specifically requires it to be done at the time 

of contracting. And are there cases that say, we are 

going to look at whether something is -- not whether 

something is so unfair as to shock the conscience, but 

at whether it is the equivalent to some statutory 

procedure? There are none. And that's the problem.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GUPTA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 As I think several of the questions this 

morning have brought out, the question here is not what 

this Court would decide if it were sitting as the 

Supreme Court of California and applying the State's 

common law in the first instance. Rather, the question 

is whether the State law at issue falls within a 

statutory savings clause that expressly preserves 

contract defenses available at law or in equity.

 The State law at issue here is not 

preemptive, for three reasons. First, it is consistent 

with the equal footing principle or nondiscrimination 

principle that this Court has consistently recognized is 

embodied in section 2.

 Second, it's consistent with two key 

purposes that the savings clause fulfills under the FAA:

ensuring that arbitration is a matter of consent and not 

coercion; and that it represents merely a choice of 

forum, but not an exemption from the law.

 And third, the State law at issue is a 

correct and legitimate application of the State's common 

law to which this Court should defer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just go 

to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused 

particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle 

that applies to every other contract.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, let me be clear about what 

I mean by the second reason. I think that the savings 

clause in the FAA serves two critical purposes, and that 

is that the -- the contract law doctrines ensure 

consent. You don't have arbitration unless you have a 

consensual agreement between both parties, and you look 

to State contract law to determine whether there is 

consent.

 And also, I think as this Court has 

repeatedly said about arbitration under the FAA, it 

represents a choice of forum, but it doesn't withdraw 

the parties from the substantive liability rules of the 

State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the 

substantive State liability rule on the issue you are

addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex 

ante, and with respect to arbitration you are 

considering it at the time the dispute arose. Isn't 

that a discrimination against arbitration agreements?

 MR. GUPTA: Well, first of all, I think it 

is a -- it's a question of State law whether the 

determination is ex ante or ex post. But we actually -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure. That's 

true in all of these cases.

 MR. GUPTA: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a question of 

what the State law provides; then you consider whether 

it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.

 MR. GUPTA: Right. And the Discover Bank 

application of State unconscionability law we believe is 

an ex ante analysis. It looks at whether the contract 

is fair or exculpatory at the time that the contract is 

made; and indeed there is -- the two arguments that Mr. 

Pincus made about California unconscionability law are 

somewhat at war with themselves. He said that the -­

the doctrine looks to third parties and that that's 

illegitimate; and he said that the doctrine is ex post 

and that's illegitimate. But in fact, from the 

perspective of a consumer that's entering into this 

contract, from the perspective of any AT&T consumer,

they don't know whether they are going to be among the 

very few consumers who detect fraud, recognize a legal 

claim, or hire a lawyer to do so, and come forward and 

seek compensation. And so the Concepcions are situated 

just like any other AT&T customer, and that is the point 

at which fairness is assessed.

 So from the perspective of California 

unconscionability doctrine, the Concepcions and -- and 

all the other AT&T customers are not differently 

situated. It's not a question of whether the 

Concepcions, once they have chosen to make a claim, 

whether the contract is then fair to them; it's whether 

it's fair to any AT&T customer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what other 

area of contract law does the court consider 

unconscionability not with respect to the parties before 

the court, but with respect to third parties?

 MR. GUPTA: Well, I think, first of all, the 

California State law is applying an exculpatory clause 

prohibition that has been on the books since 1872 in 

California. And if you look at the cases, many of which 

we've cited in our brief today -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that -­

doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather 

than third parties?

MR. GUPTA: No. In fact, the -- the 

California courts have developed a test that says, we'll 

-- we'll enforce exculpatory clauses, or what would 

otherwise be exculpatory clauses, if they don't have 

significant public effects.

 So the test under that statute is actually 

to look to the public effects, the effects of similarly 

situated people that are parties to the contract. And 

for example, there was a case in the early 20th century 

under that statute where the question was whether a 

banking contract was unfair; and what the court said is 

that -- that parties to the contract are not the only 

people that matter here; what matters is the interests 

of the banking public.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a general 

rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public 

policy could be unenforceable. It seems to me that's 

quite different than saying we're worried about third 

parties that are in the same position as these 

particular parties. In other words, it's not simply 

adverse public consequences, but it's a different mode 

of analysis than I'm familiar with under basic contract 

law.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, again, I want to try to 

explain why I don't think that the Concepcions are -­

are any different from the -- what Mr. Pincus is 

describing as third parties. At the time that they 

entered into the contract, the question is whether the 

contract ex ante is unconscionable as to them. And 

they're just like anyone else. They don't know whether 

they will detect this fraud and be able to come forward. 

And so the question is -- is that -- is that 

unconscionable as to them? It's not looking only to the 

effects on third parties.

 But there is also an exculpatory clause 

prohibition that has always taken into account the 

effects on the public. And both of those are at work in 

Discover Bank.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe you can explain 

it this way. Compare what the Concepcions have 

available to them under the contract with what going 

through the arbitration, all the procedures leading up 

to arbitration and arbitration, against what they would 

get at best if this were allowed to proceed on a class 

basis.

 MR. GUPTA: Right. The California -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Why is -- why are they 

better off with a -- with a class adjudication?

 MR. GUPTA: Because from an ex ante 

perspective, again when they enter into the contract,

they have -- there -- it's not reasonable to be -- to 

expect that they will be among the very few people who 

will recognize that there's fraud, recognize a legal 

claim, and come forward. And so from that perspective, 

it -- it is not reasonable them -- for them to give up 

the benefits that they would get from a class action.

 A class action incentivizes lawyers and 

others to detect for this fraud. It makes it -- it 

makes it economically justifiable to come forward with 

these kinds of claims.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And -- and isn't that what 

distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability 

analysis?

 If the district court correctly understood 

the way the AT&T Mobility scheme works and --and the 

district court said that under the revised arbitration 

provision nearly all consumers who purchase the 

informal -- who pursue, I'm sorry, the informal claims 

process, are very likely to be compensated promptly and 

in full, etcetera, etcetera. If the district court 

understood that correctly, the scheme here was -- is 

found to be unconscionable because it doesn't allow the 

enlistment of basically private attorneys general to 

enforce -- to enforce the law. And isn't that quite 

different from ordinary unconscionability analysis?

MR. GUPTA: I don't think it is. I mean, 

obviously it's impossible to come up with a precise 

analogy that is going to be on all fours. But in our 

case we cite -- in our brief we cite cases involving 

unreasonably shortened statutes of limitations, where 

the California courts for over 100 years have found that 

those can be deemed unconscionable. And the principle 

is the same. Those kinds of clauses can interfere with 

the parties' ability to have notice that they have a 

claim and take action on that claim. That -- that kind 

of procedural limitation has always been deemed 

unconscionable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that this doesn't 

have what's called a blowout clause. Suppose that that 

kind of clause was not in there. And the consumer opts 

out of the arbitration. Arbitration doesn't -- doesn't 

go well. Anyway, can the consumer then insist on the 

arbitration that the consumer bargained for, the 

individual arbitration that the consumer bargained for?

 MR. GUPTA: Well, under this clause the 

consumer will always have the ability to proceed on a 

bilateral -- on a bilateral basis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then the bank has to 

have -- liability exposure for two different 

proceedings?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are saying then 

California can say it's unconscionable to allow the 

parties to agree that there will be just the single 

arbitration proceedings? I don't see how the third 

parties are necessarily protected. If you say that the 

consumer still has the election, that certainly isn't 

what they bargained for. Maybe I'm -- maybe that's just 

a quarrel with the content of the unconscionability 

standard.

 MR. GUPTA: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Rather than FAA, but I 

think it does bear on at least section 4 of the FAA.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, and maybe I'm 

misunderstanding your question, but I think, you know, 

that's true of any of the procedural limitations that 

the Petitioners concede would be subject to the 

unconscionability doctrine. A person would still be 

free to proceed under a basis that would otherwise be 

unconscionable.

 For example, if you had an arbitration 

clause that limited important remedies -- it banned 

punitive damages, injunctive relief, insisted on a 

distant forum, required excessive fees -- those would be

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I've asked your 

adversary this question and I'm not sure yet what his 

answer is, so I'm asking you it. How would you propose 

to distinguish between facially neutral contract law 

defenses that implicitly discriminate against 

arbitration and those that do not? What's the test you 

would use to tell the difference between the two? 

Because obviously there are subterfuges that some legal 

systems could use to address themselves just to 

arbitration. So how do we tell the difference?

 MR. GUPTA: Right, and we don't deny that's 

true. But it's not that different from the way this 

Court approaches State law in general. You start from a 

position of deference. The Court says this is facially 

nondiscriminatory law, it's generally applicable, but 

there's a limit on that. If the State law is -- if the 

State is engaging in obvious subterfuge to deny 

federally protected rights, this Court has always said 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we test that?

would be an objective determination. You would see 

whether the State court is telling the truth. Is this 

law really being applied in the same way in the 

arbitration context and outside of the arbitration 

context. And here we know because, as Justice Kagan 

said, the first California appellate case on point is a 

case outside of the arbitration context, the America 

Online case. The Discover Bank case relied on that case 

when it struck down a class-action ban in the

standards the Court has used. If it's not a credible 

rule of State law, if the State is not really doing what 

its saying, and the result is the deprivation of 

Federally protected rights, this Court has always said 

that there's a limit on deference to State law. Now -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's in the 

independent and adequate State ground context, which 

strikes me as quite different. We have a statute here 

that says the arbitration agreements have to be treated 

like any other contract, any contract. I don't see how 

that's the same as obvious subterfuge.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, I'm addressing -- Justice 

Sotomayor's question, if I understand it, is when you 

have a facially nondiscriminatory rule of contract law, 

where when you look at the face of the opinion nothing 

suggests it's nondiscriminatory. And the question is 

how do you tell whether the State court is not telling 

the truth? And I think in that circumstance you'd have 

to -- I can't think of any other way you would do the 

analysis.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You have to -- you would do 

it differently, because they might be telling the truth. 

The example that your brother lawyer gave is this: That 

we have a State and the State says, if you have a 

contract, in the dispute resolution provision, whether

you have arbitration or not, that provision is void if 

it says you won't have a judge, and it's void if it says 

you won't have a jury, and it's void if it says that you 

will not go to the United States courthouse for deciding 

all Federal claims.

 That applies whether there is an arbitration 

clause or not an arbitration clause. Now, that would 

seem to me no subterfuge. It is absolutely clear. They 

are not lying. It just happens to prevent arbitration. 

And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that 

once you get into class actions you will discover you 

have something that really looks like a court case. You 

have to have discovery, you have dozens of lawyers 

involved, you have depositions, you are running off 

every 5 minutes to the judge or to somebody to say is 

this deposition good, bad or indifferent. You have 

methods for enforcing the deposition. You have all 

kinds of things.

 He can make a much bigger list than me. So 

he says: This case is like the case of California 

saying everybody can decide it any way they want as long 

as they do it before a Federal judge. Okay? Now what's 

your answer to that?

 MR. GUPTA: Obviously we concede that those 

kinds of rules are preempted.

JUSTICE BREYER: But what's your answer to 

his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this 

case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue, 

which you concede is a discrimination?

 MR. GUPTA: Right. I think there are two 

limiting principles in addition to the discrimination 

inquiry. Discrimination doesn't get you there. You can 

then ask, is the rule tantamount to a rule of 

non-enforceability of arbitration agreements. So for 

example, if a State law says you cannot waive the right 

to a public jury trial. Now, obviously that renders all 

arbitration agreements unenforceable. It contradicts 

the general rule of enforceability. To read the savings 

clause to allow a rule like that would be to read -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about a 

rule that says what you have to have in any contract is 

a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure 

apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but 

you have to follow exactly those procedures?

 MR. GUPTA: I think that would bring into 

play the second limiting principle, because parties 

could contract, obviously, to agree to certain 

procedural rules like that. But I think that that would 

bring into play a principle of obstacle preemption.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why isn't this

obstacle preemption?

 MR. GUPTA: Right. I think one of the 

purposes -- we agree with Petitioners about this. One 

of the purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act is to 

allow parties to contract their procedures, to tailor 

their procedures; and in general the courts ought not to 

be interfering with those kinds of consensual decisions.

 But there are two other important purposes 

at play, and no statute pursues its purposes at all 

costs. One of those purposes is to ensure that there's 

not coercion, that you have a consensual agreement; and 

another, just as important, is to ensure that 

arbitration merely represents a change of forum, but 

isn't an exemption from the law. So that's -- I think 

that's at work in the examples that Petitioner concedes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gupta, is -- I'd like 

you to focus on Stolt-Nielsen. In Stolt-Nielsen this 

Court said that, absent express consent, no class 

arbitration. If the seller or employer, whoever it is, 

doesn't want that class arbitration, doesn't have to 

have it.

 And here that's surely the case; the ATT has 

not consented to class arbitration. Then California law 

says: Well, that's okay; then you will be subject to a 

class-action suit in court. But the very purpose of the

arbitration agreement was that you would be in 

arbitration and not in court. So why isn't 

Stolt-Nielsen dispositive of this case?

 MR. GUPTA: I think Stolt-Nielsen is 

properly read as -- the questions there was a question 

of contract interpretation. The question here is 

whether the agreement is valid in the first place, 

whether you have a contract. What Stolt-Nielsen tells 

you is that you cannot impose class arbitration on an 

unwilling defendant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here you have an 

unwilling defendant who doesn't want class arbitration.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, the defendant here has 

specified in its arbitration agreement that if the 

class-action ban is invalidated, it would prefer to face 

any class-wide proceedings in court, and that choice is 

up to the defendant. If the defendant chose to face 

class-wide proceedings in arbitration, they could do so 

under -- under the California rule, or they could elect 

to do so in court, and they could do so under whatever 

procedures they specified in the agreement or that were 

specified in a subsequent agreement between the parties.

 California law doesn't impose any particular 

procedures on the party. It just insists that in 

circumstances where the ban would function as an

exculpatory clause, that there is some avenue for 

class-wide proceedings, where claims wouldn't feasibly 

be litigated individually. I don't -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gupta, AT&T says that 

nobody would ever choose class arbitration; it's the 

worst of both worlds. You get all the procedures, you 

get broad liability, but at the same time you have no 

judicial review, so that this will effectively kill off 

arbitration in the consumer context.

 MR. GUPTA: I think one answer to that is 

that some parties have chosen class arbitration, and we 

cite some examples in the brief. There have also been 

hundreds of class arbitrations conducted by the American 

Arbitration Association, the leading arbitration 

association. Class arbitration has existed for a 

quarter century, so it's not something that is foreign 

to arbitration.

 But also, I just refer back to what I said 

to Justice Ginsburg, which is that this is a matter of 

consent. Nobody is forcing defendants to face class 

arbitration, and nobody is forcing them to face it on 

terms that they haven't consented to. So if there are 

concerns about -- about the ability of class arbitration 

to effectively manage the process, they can be tailored 

by the parties. And in fact, there are even hybrid

procedures where -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course. The question is 

not whether they are being forced to accept class 

arbitration; it's whether they are being coerced into 

abandoning regular arbitration. That's really the 

issue.

 MR. GUPTA: I mean, one could say the same 

thing about many of the procedural limitations that both 

parties agree are subject to the unconscionability 

doctrine. If a defendant said: Well, we don't want to 

face arbitration unless we can ban punitive damages or 

other important remedies, unless we can insist on 

certain kinds of discovery limitations that the State 

courts deem unconscionable because they don't allow the 

parties to vindicate their rights individually, the same 

argument would hold true. The defendant would be able 

to say: Well, that's -- you know, if we can't have 

arbitration on our terms, we won't have arbitration at 

all.

 That is not what the Federal Arbitration Act 

says, though. The Federal Arbitration Act puts 

arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other 

contracts. It forbids States from discriminating 

against arbitration, but it doesn't require them to 

remove all impediments that -- that a party may wish

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, as long as 

those impediments are removed on an -- on an equal 

footing with all contracts.

 MR. GUPTA: That's right. That's right, 

Your Honor, and I think -- you know, we concede that if 

the California courts were discriminating against 

arbitration agreements, if they were applying one rule 

to class-action bans or other kinds of procedural 

limitations in arbitration and another outside of 

arbitration, that would not fall within the savings 

clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to a 

question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm 

not sure I understood your answer.

 What is the difference between a State rule 

that says that the rules of civil procedure must be 

followed in any adjudication and a rule that says that 

class adjudication must always be available?

 MR. GUPTA: I think in the first instance, I 

don't think that -- I'm assuming that you're describing 

a rule that purports to apply general contract law, 

let's say unconscionability; right?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, uh-huh.

MR. GUPTA: I don't think -- I think it 

would be hard for a State to credibly claim that the 

absence of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 

systematically exculpate one party from -- from 

liability. That just -­

JUSTICE ALITO: No, I just -- I'm not 

putting this under an unconscionability label. These 

are just general rules, and the question is whether 

they -- whether they can be applied, whether they 

constitute discrimination against -- against 

arbitration.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, whether or not they 

constitute discrimination against arbitration, I think 

your first hypothetical would be preempted, because a 

State could not credibly be serving the purposes that 

the savings clause serves in insisting on the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why?

 MR. GUPTA: Because -- because I don't think 

that a credible argument can be made that that 

systematically serves and functions as an exculpatory 

clause.

 There are going to be questions of degree 

here, but take, for example, discovery. I think that 

both parties would agree that if an employer said: I

get discovery and you, the employee, don't get discovery 

for your fact-bound discrimination -­

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but I really would 

appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one 

that was posed before.

 What is the difference -- let me change it 

slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the 

rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that 

says that class adjudication must always be available?

 I think your answer comes down to the 

proposition that the former is inconsistent with the 

idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not 

allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the 

idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed. Is 

that correct or not?

 MR. GUPTA: No, I think -- I think -- I 

think a better way to analyze that is under the rubric 

of obstacle preemption, because there are important 

purposes that are served by the savings clause in 

invalidating certain procedural procedures that have an 

exculpatory effect, a substantively unfair effect, but 

at the same time the act, to be able to function, has to 

allow parties to contract for -­

the same thing. Insisting on compliance with the

Federal -- with the California rules of evidence is an 

obstacle to arbitration, but allowing -- insisting on 

the availability of class adjudication is not an 

obstacle to arbitration. But in the end -­

MR. GUPTA: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- we have to make a value 

judgment about whether these things, one thing or the 

other, fits with arbitration. That's what it comes down 

to.

 MR. GUPTA: No, I think -- I think that's 

not right. I mean, I think in the first instance you 

defer to what the State court says it is doing, and what 

the State says it is doing -- and there is no reason to 

doubt this -- is that it is preventing a procedural 

limitation that systematically favors one party, tilts 

the playing field to a degree that parties cannot 

feasibly vindicate their claims through arbitration.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And when it -- when it 

imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply 

across the board, it says it feels that these are 

necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in 

every method of adjudication.

 MR. GUPTA: Right. And, I mean, obviously, 

the application of the Federal Rules of Evidence don't 

have a systematic effect that favors one party or the

other, and -- and so I think a rule like that would not 

be credible. And I'm trying to answer your 

hypothetical, but I do think that the discovery -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Where do we look to find 

the answer? I mean, I understand your answer and I know 

the other side's going to say: Well, this is a 

tremendous obstacle. If I have one person to deal with, 

I say: You want your $75, I will offer you $75, and if 

you don't take it and I turn out to be wrong, I'm going 

to give you $7,500. That's their system. Right?

 So they say the alternative is class action. 

There are a million customers. I'm faced with a claim 

for $75 million. I can't afford that. I'll settle it, 

even if I'm right. So if you have your rule, I'm going 

to be facing these things all the time. I'm not -- I'm 

not going to enter into arbitration agreements. I will 

take my chances in court. Okay? Now, that -- that's 

their argument.

 So it is empirical, in part: What do I look 

to? It's not logic. It's a question of where should 

I -- what should I read to show, in your opinion, you're 

right?

 MR. GUPTA: I think you have to look first 

at what the State law is trying to do, and the -- the 

hypotheticals about the insistence on jury trials,

insistence on Federal Rules of Evidence or civil 

procedure, those are clear -- it just would not be 

credible for a State, I think, to say that those things 

are required.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is your test a purpose test 

or an effects test? Is it a test that says the State is 

doing this in order to kill arbitration, or is it a test 

that says the State is doing something that will kill 

arbitration?

 MR. GUPTA: I think you can look to both. 

think you would have to look to both. I mean, it would 

pose an obstacle to the statute, whether the State was 

doing something antithetical to the purposes of the 

statute or whether it had the effect of destroying 

arbitration. In either case, those things would be 

preempted.

 But all of these hypotheticals describe 

rules that don't exist under any State's laws and are 

unlikely to exist, because they -- they can't -- they 

wouldn't really be able to be reconciled with 

traditional notions of contract law, and then you really 

would have obvious subterfuge. You really would have a 

rule that is not true State law.

 But -- but I think if you look, for example, 

at discovery, a State could not insist on plenary

discovery, full discovery, to the same degree available 

in courts, but a State can certainly insist on 

invalidating one-sided discovery limitations. A State 

could certainly say to someone who seeks to vindicate a 

fact-bound employment discrimination claim has to have 

some opportunity to develop the facts. Otherwise, 

that -- that is exculpatory.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you stick with the 

theory that the test is whether or not the law in 

question is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration -­

whose idea of arbitration? What about, suppose it's the 

bank's idea of arbitration, that we -- we want this 

settlement, say; we do not want that; that's the bank's 

idea of arbitration that the parties agreed on.

 MR. GUPTA: Right. I think you are right 

Justice Kennedy, and I think the difficulty of 

ascertaining what is sort of at the essential core of 

arbitration means that the -- that the test of what's 

tantamount to a rule of non-enforceability is going to 

be -- it's going to be a very small category.

 It's going to describe the ouster doctrine, 

the jury trial waiver of prohibition; and I think that's 

why you have got to resort to some principle of obstacle 

preemption to figure out whether the State is -- is 

legitimately fulfilling the purposes, the important

purposes that the savings clause serves, or whether it's 

just insisting on full-scale procedures for the sake of 

it, in ways that have nothing to do with the -- the 

State policing its own marketplace, protecting its 

substantive rules of liability and ensuring that parties 

can adequately vindicate their claims. And if a State 

is doing that, I think that kind of rule -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I -- I find it 

difficult to regard as -- voiding exculpatory contracts. 

I mean, yes, contracts which say I'm not liable if -­

even though I've committed a wrong, that's exculpatory. 

But the State here says, you have to not only be liable 

for any faults that the other party to this contract 

discovers, but the other party of this contract has to 

be able to benefit from whatever faults anybody else in 

the world might find and bring -- and bring a class 

action lawsuit. I -- that -- that goes well beyond 

forbidding any exculpatory provisions.

 MR. GUPTA: Well, with respect, 

Justice Scalia, that is not the rule of law that this 

State has announced. The State has made a judgment that 

if you preclude class-wide relief, that will mean -­

that will gut the State's substantive consumer 

protection laws, because people will -- in the context 

of small frauds not be able to bring those cases.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Although we believe we win under the 

principle of obstacle preemption that was just being 

discussed for the reasons that were enunciated in 

Stolt-Nielsen, we think there is a much easier way for 

this Court to decide this case. Congress when it wrote 

section 2 used the phrase "any contract." And it 

clearly did that for a reason, and the reason was it 

wasn't -- it recognized, as Justice Sotomayor said, that 

there could be attempts through nondiscriminatory 

provisions to injure arbitration; and the protection 

Congress adopted was a prophylactic rule. It said if 

the State law rule that the State is trying to apply to 

an arbitration clause applies broadly to a large set of 

clauses, that's the best protection against 

discrimination and that's why the "any contract" 

language is there.

 And so, in answer to your question, Justice 

Sotomayor, about where to look for, for what "any

contract" means, we think it means very broad; and the 

Court has said that, and the doctrines that the court 

has identified as qualifying -- duress, fraud and 

unconscionability -- are doctrines that apply broadly 

across the entire range of contract.

 But one thing that is very clear, we think, 

is that it can't mean -- "any contract" can't mean any 

dispute resolution contract, because that is the 

gerrymandered category that most presents the risk of 

discrimination. And if the Court holds that that 

category is impermissible to justify a rule, it deals 

with all of the hypotheticals that are being discussed 

because they are all jury waivers, discovery, evidence; 

those are all rules that, as the Court has propagated as 

hypotheticals, are rules that apply to all dispute 

resolution clauses, and they are focused on dispute 

resolution clauses.

 So we think that disposes of the argument 

that Discover Bank can be applied, simply because it 

applies to litigation contracts and arbitration 

contracts.

 The next question is Respondents' second 

argument, which is okay, if that is not a reason it 

falls within the savings clause, it falls within the 

savings clause because it's simply an application of

Court, which is it isn't, because in the three 

particulars that I listed, it is clearly a totally 

different legal rule that simply has the 

unconscionability label on it.

 And just to drill down on my colleague's 

discussion that this was really an ex ante analysis. It 

couldn't be an ex ante analysis, because that would have 

to take into account that the vast majority of claims 

that anyone will ever have under a contract are 

nonclassable claims. And as to nonclassable claims, 

it's clear that the arbitration process is infinitely 

better than the court process, because for most small 

consumer claims there is no real court process. And so 

if one were to make an ex ante assessment of the 

fairness for the parties of the court, it wouldn't just 

be about classable claims; it would have to include 

nonclassable claims; and as to those claims it is clear 

that there is a tremendous benefit to those people from 

the arbitration clause.

 With respect to exculpation, my friend 

referred to the California rule that the contract has to

have a public effect. That is not about effects on 

third parties. In the Tunkl case, which is a California 

Supreme Court case that we cite, the court makes clear 

that it's looking for contracts that -- in which public 

services are being performed and that are otherwise 

imbued with a public interest. It's not looking at all 

at the effects on third parties.

 Finally, my colleague spoke about lots of 

class arbitrations. To our knowledge all of those class 

arbitrations were arbitrations that were conducted 

before this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen where a 

party had a silent agreement and therefore it was held 

by some lower courts to mean that class arbitration was 

permissible. We are not aware as we say in our brief of 

any contract that explicitly permits class arbitrations 

for the reasons that the Court discussed. It's not -­

just not something that makes any sense.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled case was submitted.)
