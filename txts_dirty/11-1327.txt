 Mr. Moran.
 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN
 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

8  MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 

9 please the Court:


 A long and unbroken line of this Court's 

11 precedents stand for the principle that a judge's final 

12 determination that a defendant is not guilty is a final 

13 determination of an acquittal for -- for double jeopardy 

14 purposes, even if that determination is wrong as a 

matter of law or as a matter of fact. And even if --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we give credence to 

17 how the judge labels what the acquittal is? 

18  MR. MORAN: No. No. This Court must 

19 determine -- whatever its label, what has the judge 

done. Has the judge made a determination that the 

21 government has failed to prove its case, as in Martin 

22 Linen, or has the government -- has the judge made a 

23 determination of something else, as in Scott, for 

24 example, pretrial delay.

 Now, the Michigan Supreme Court --

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once -- once the judge 

2 determines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a 

3 dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I 

4 consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I 

can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking 

6 double jeopardy? 

7  MR. MORAN: Well, you could reserve that 

8 ruling to the end of the case. You could make a ruling 

9 as to the jury instructions without -- or what the jury 

instructions are going to be without applying them to 

11 the facts of the case; in other words, without making a 

12 determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if I persist in 

14 that view, there's nothing the government can do?

 MR. MORAN: The government can try -- we 

16 learned from Smith -- try to get you to reconsider that 

17 view before the defendant puts on his case. But once 

18 the defendant -- once the judge has made a final 

19 determination that the defendant is not guilty, even on 

an erroneous view of the law, this Court has held 

21 multiple times that that is a final determination --

22 that is an acquittal, for double jeopardy purposes. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Because, I suppose, the 

24 judge is the government, too.

 MR. MORAN: Exactly. Once -- once the

1 government --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: So whether the unfairness 

3 adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's 

4 been treated unfairly.

 MR. MORAN: If a state chooses, 

6 Justice Scalia, to vest acquittal power in its judges, 

7 it must accept the double jeopardy consequences of that. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even when the defendant 

9 interjected this issue and the defendant urged the judge 

to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate 

11 the higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser 

12 crime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial 

13 judge into error. The trial judge didn't come up with 

14 this on his own.

 MR. MORAN: The judge came up with this, 

16 Your Honor, on defendant's motion, that's correct. But 

17 it was actually supported by the jury instructions that 

18 were in use. And actually, it was supported by the 

19 structure of the statute in question. The statute in 

question, under which Mr. Evans was charged, explicitly 

21 said that the building other than one specified in the 

22 preceding subsection --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not arguing 

24 that that was the correct charge that --

MR. MORAN: No. We're precluded now from

1 arguing that that's correct. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you don't --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel often encourage 

4 judges to do the wrong thing. In fact, in every case, 

there is one of the two counsel urging the court to do 

6 the wrong thing; right? 

7  MR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Scalia. And --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the adversary 

9 system consists of.

 MR. MORAN: Yes. And in Sanabria, this 

11 Court noted that point exactly, that all acquittals, 

12 whether they're by the judge or by the jury -- or I 

13 should say almost all acquittals, some are sua sponte --

14 almost all acquittals, whether by judge or by jury, are 

upon invitation of defense counsel. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- could a state 

17 provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical 

18 ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing 

19 counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours, 

and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals 

21 to get a mandate? 

22  MR. MORAN: I don't think the state could do 

23 that, Justice Kennedy, because of Smalis. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of?

 MR. MORAN: Because of Smalis. So that was

1 essentially the situation in Smalis. You had a bench
 

2 trial. The judge grants a demurrer. He says the
 

3 evidence is insufficient. And then the prosecution
 

4 attempted to run to the Pennsylvania appellate court.
 

And this Court said it couldn't do that because that was 

6 a final determination.  I think --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in my hypothetical, 

8 the state said -- and this isn't a final determination; 

9 the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours 

and go to the court of appeals. 

11  MR. MORAN: Well, I think a state could 

12 make -- could -- investing acquittal power in judges 

13 could put limitations on that acquittal power. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would they do that? 

I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question. It's 

16 easy when you have a jury because what happens is a 

17 judge can decide whether, at the end of the 

18 prosecution's case, he's going to dismiss for 

19 insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the 

jury renders a verdict, set it aside. 

21  Jeopardy attaches only if the judge 

22 dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but 

23 not if he sets aside the verdict, correct? 

24  MR. MORAN: Well, jeopardy attaches both 

ways, but a retry -- a reversal is possible in the -- in

1 the latter. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the latter. 

3  MR. MORAN: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what can a state 

do -- some have done something -- to ensure that, even 

6 if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid 

7 reversal; if the judge is wrong on a legal theory. 

8  MR. MORAN: Well, the easy --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So give us an example of 

what, in a judge trial, a state could do to ensure that 

11 a legally wrong judgment is still reversible. 

12  MR. MORAN: In a bench trial, Your Honor? 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In a bench trial. What 

14 could it do?

 MR. MORAN: I think if -- if in a bench 

16 trial, if the judge has the power to acquit or convict 

17 and the judge acquits, I believe the Double Jeopardy 

18 Clause would preclude the state from coming up with a 

19 clever mechanism allowing -- for allowing appellate 

review. The Court, of course -- I mean, the state 

21 could, of course --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought there were, in 

23 your briefs, some examples -- in someone's brief, there 

24 were some examples --

MR. MORAN: In a jury trial with a judge --

2 trial. Let's go to the bench trial. 

3  MR. MORAN: I don't know what --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not helping your 

argument by saying there's nothing a state could ever 

6 do. 

7  MR. MORAN: Well, they could withdraw the 

8 power of judges to grant acquittals or convictions in 

9 the first place. In other words, they could abolish 

bench trials, which, as the Court noted --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you know something, 

12 Counselor? You're sinking your hole deeper. You're not 

13 helping yourself in this argument because how does that 

14 help the system?

 MR. MORAN: Well, with all respect, Your 

16 Honor, the Double Jeopardy Clause here transcends the 

17 state's --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree. You 

19 mean no state could ever say to a judge, given --

given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory, 

21 and then set it aside? If you think the theory is not 

22 legally --

23  MR. MORAN: After Smith, it's clear that 

24 immediate reconsideration is a possibility. And if a 

state set up a system, as in Lydon v. Municipal Court,

Official 

1 where you have essentially a magistrate making a 

2 preliminary determination, and then it goes to a higher 

3 judge who goes trial de novo, that, of course, is 

4 permissible.

 But if the judge is the final arbiter -- in 

6 other words, if the judge sits in the place of the jury, 

7 this Court has said, over and over again, that a judge 

8 verdict is equivalent to a jury verdict, for purposes of 

9 Double Jeopardy.

 So, yes, courts -- a state could set up 

11 systems, in which judges have less power than a jury 

12 does. I'm not aware of any state that's done that. I 

13 am aware of what Nevada has done, which has said that 

14 judges can't grant mid-trial directed verdicts. And 

that's the way in a jury trial. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep saying, 

17 "mid-trial." 

18  MR. MORAN: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what is not 

mid-trial? Some states require a judge to wait. 

21  MR. MORAN: Yes. Yes. Nevada. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what happens in 

23 those states? 

24  MR. MORAN: Well, in that case, then there 

is no problem because, if the judge makes a

1 determination after the jury verdict, then the -- then 

2 that can be appealed under Wilson. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I keep talking, not 

4 about jury verdicts, but about bench trials. I want to 

focus on the bench trial process. 

6  MR. MORAN: If -- but if the judge at the 

7 end of a trial renders a solemn, formal, final verdict, 

8 "I find the defendant not guilty," in a bench trial, I 

9 don't see a mechanism for -- for the state to appeal 

that determination, consistent with the Double Jeopardy 

11 guarantee, unless the state has set up a system as in 

12 Lydon -- as Massachusetts did in Lydon. But short of 

13 that, a judge's determination is entitled to the same 

14 respect.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If, in the middle of a 

16 trial, a judge grants a mistrial and says -- I'm sorry, 

17 grants an acquittal and says, I think that prompt 

18 prosecution is an element of the offense, and there 

19 wasn't prompt prosecution here. Now, could there be a 

re-prosecution in that situation? 

21  MR. MORAN: Yes, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Even though the judge says 

23 he thinks that that's an element of the offense? 

24  MR. MORAN: Because no part of my argument 

depends upon the judge's labeling. What the judge has 

11

25

Official 

1 done in that case is -- is a mid-trial dismissal that he 

2 called an acquittal, but it was actually a dismissal for 

3 another purpose. That's exactly what Scott was talking 

4 about. And that is like Scott, where the judge may have 

characterized what he had done as acquitting the
 

6 defendant, but he --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, he saw a phantom
 

8 element, and -- and that's what happened here, too,
 

9 isn't it?


 MR. MORAN: Well, pretrial delay is not an 

11 element of the offense. Pretrial delay is another part 

12 of criminal procedure in this state. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: And this -- and the fact 

14 that this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the 

offense, either. 

16  MR. MORAN: But it is clearly related to the 

17 offense. And then Scott clarified what Martin Linen 

18 meant. Martin Linen was an attempt to distinguish 

19 between cases in which the judge makes a ruling relating 

to guilt or innocence and a ruling designed to serve 

21 some other purpose. 

22  The problem with the line the Michigan 

23 Supreme Court drew here is that it is completely 

24 impossible to administer. And if I can give a couple of 

examples, the Lynch case, from the Second Circuit, was 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 an effort by one circuit to attempt to administer -- to 

2 follow the Maker line, and you get questions that are 

3 completely unanswerable in that case. 

4  Is bad intent simply a gloss on the 

willfulness element? In which case, all you've done is 

6 misconstrue an existing element. Or is it, as the 

7 dissent claimed in Lynch, a -- a new element? And these 

8 are questions like how many angels can dance on the head 

9 of a pin. They're simply semantics. It's all labeling. 

There is no -- there is no substance there. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there -- that's a 

12 problem. But you're -- to come back to my earlier 

13 question, your -- what is your answer? Your answer is 

14 that, if the judge grants an acquittal based on the 

failure to prove anything that the judge thinks the 

16 prosecution has to prove, that's an acquittal. Is that 

17 fair? 

18  MR. MORAN: Yes. And -- and I fall back to 

19 this Court's footnote in Scott, that courts are 

perfectly capable of distinguishing between rulings 

21 relating to guilt and innocence and rulings designed to 

22 serve other purposes. So if you have a devious judge 

23 who's determined to package a prosecutorial misconduct 

24 ruling as an acquittal, I have no doubt that an 

appellate court would be able to -- to smoke that out.

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, to come back to the
 

2 argument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a
 

3 mistrial for failure to prove an action within the
 

4 statute of limitations, even though no statute of
 

limitations defense was raised. Would that be -- would 

6 that be an acquittal? 

7  MR. MORAN: Only -- I think my answer to 

8 that would depend on how you rule in the prior case, 

9 depending on whether the statute of limitations is -- is 

something the prosecution has to prove in order to 

11 establish guilt. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Assuming, for 

13 the sake of argument, that it's not an element -- it's 

14 not really an element, but the judge thinks it's an 

element. 

16  MR. MORAN: Well, if it -- if it's something 

17 that could result in an acquittal, if it is -- if the 

18 defendant raising the statute of limitations is 

19 something that could result in an acquittal -- because I 

come to Burks, where Burks says an affirmative insanity 

21 defense, the prosecution fails to disprove that, that is 

22 an acquittal -- when the appellate court concluded that 

23 there was failure to disprove the affirmative insanity 

24 defense.

1 Linen can't be taken as if it was construing the terms 

2 of an easement. You have to look at what was Martin 

3 Linen getting at. And Martin Linen is trying to 

4 identify those rulings relating to guilt or innocence, 

which include affirmative defenses or --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure I understand 

7 the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical. 

8 The judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a 

9 misconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it 

really isn't. Then you said the court of appeals could 

11 straighten that out? 

12  MR. MORAN: Yes. That's Scott. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: On what rationale -- so 

14 what's the general principle that allows the court of 

appeals to do this sometimes and not others? 

16  MR. MORAN: If the judge has made a ruling 

17 going to the defendant's guilt or innocence and finding 

18 that, as in Martin, examining the government's evidence 

19 and finding that they have failed to prove the 

defendant's guilt, final. There can be no appeal. But 

21 if the judge has made a ruling that is designed to serve 

22 some other purpose, so if the judge, in my hypothetical, 

23 were to say --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I thought -- I thought 

it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he

1 doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an
 

2 acquittal?
 

3  MR. MORAN: That's -- that's a case,
 

4 actually, quite a bit like some of the cases, and it
 

demonstrates the problem of -- of the Michigan Supreme 

6 Court's line. So example, in Martin Linen, all the 

7 judge said is, this is one of the weakest cases I've 

8 ever seen. 

9  Presumably, if the Respondent were to win, 

they would be entitled to appeal a determination like 

11 that to at least try to convince the appellate court 

12 that the reason the case seems so weak to the trial 

13 judge was that the trial judge had added an extra 

14 element.

 Same thing in Smalis, where the judge simply 

16 said -- he granted a demurrer by looking at the 

17 prosecution's case and saying that, I find the evidence 

18 insufficient. And, in fact, in Smalis, the --

19 Pennsylvania tried to argue that the judge had actually 

heightened the burden for mens rea for third-degree 

21 murder. 

22  And -- and so -- you know, they would be 

23 entitled to make these arguments. And so then we get 

24 into questions of, in granting acquittals, would judges 

have to explain all of the elements --

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: I see the problem, but I am 

2 still back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is 

3 my own failing here. I didn't quite understand. I 

4 thought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the 

case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution 

6 was brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle 

7 of the trial, granting something you should have granted 

8 in the first place before you impaneled the jury. 

9  But I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge 

Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment 

11 because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had 

12 been talking to a witness or a juror or something at 

13 lunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal. 

14 And I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote 

Double Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him 

16 again. And I didn't think the Court ever overruled 

17 that. That -- what -- in where? 

18  MR. MORAN: Fong -- Fong Foo has not been 

19 explicitly overruled, but I think it has been limited by 

Scott. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: So Scott says that even in 

22 judge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that 

23 -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it 

24 is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something 

improper at lunch. And -- and that's -- that's -- now,

1 on your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated, 

2 there would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't 

3 protect against the second indictment, right? 

4  MR. MORAN: Well, Justice Breyer, Fong Foo 

actually listed two reasons why the trial judge granted 

6 the directed verdict. One was prosecutorial misconduct. 

7 The judge apparently thought that the prosecutor had 

8 been speaking with a witness. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. MORAN: But the second one was the total 

11 lack of credibility of the prosecution's witnesses. 

12 And -- and when the case came --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. That's --

14  MR. MORAN: When the case came to this 

Court, the concurring Justice said, the second one is 

16 good for Double Jeopardy purposes, but I would make 

17 clear that the prosecutorial misconduct rationale is 

18 not. 

19  That part -- I think that concurring opinion 

has been effectively adopted in Scott, so that a finding 

21 of prosecutorial misconduct on dumping this case 

22 mid-trial, yes, the prosecution gets another bite at the 

23 apple, assuming that it's done on -- on the defendant's 

24 motion.

1 reasons we've said that underlies Double Jeopardy clause 

2 is to prevent overbearing conduct by the government. 

3 That's not an issue here, is it? You said the 

4 government gets one fair shot at conviction. And if 

there has been a legal error below, they haven't had a 

6 fair shot. 

7  MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I would 

8 respectfully disagree. Mr. Evans was hauled into court 

9 by the state. He was acquitted, in our view, by the 

judge who is representative of the state, who was 

11 relying on the standard jury instructions --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this business 

13 about the judge being a representative of the state, I'm 

14 not sure how far that gets you. The government is one 

of the adversaries appearing before the judge, and the 

16 judge is not supposed to take the government's side. So 

17 he is not really a part of the government. And it does 

18 seem to me that, if they had been thrown out of court 

19 because of a legal error, that's not a fair shot.

 MR. MORAN: Well, I understand that view, 

21 Mr. Chief Justice, but it's contrary to a lot of this 

22 Court's cases. I think this Court would have to review 

23 a lot of its cases, most recently, Smith and Smalis and 

24 Martin Linen, all of which said that a legal error 

affects the quality of a judgment -- and Scott also

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose the 

question --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that --

7 I'm just saying that that particular rationale for the 

8 Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable in this case. 

9  MR. MORAN: Well, I think it is because a 

citizen has been brought into court, expects to go 

11 through one trial, and they are told, sir, I am finding 

12 you not guilty. And then to find out later -- for the 

13 state to come back later --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's looking at it 

from the defendant's perspective. We have said that the 

16 government should have one fair shot at conviction. And 

17 it seems to me that, if they lose because of an error, 

18 that's not a fair shot. 

19  MR. MORAN: Your Honor, I come back to the 

language in Martin Linen, which talks about what the 

21 purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, is to protect 

22 defendants against continuing government oppression. 

23 And that oppression arises from the anxiety of having to 

24 go through it again and again.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't it -- isn't it

1 hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten 

2 a windfall here?  I mean, this is not continuing 

3 government oppression and -- and -- you know, that's --

4 that -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your 

client. I mean, here because of a legal error, your 

6 client walks away the winner when he shouldn't have. 

7  MR. MORAN: Well, Your Honor, without the 

8 error, the trial would have -- would have continued. 

9 But I think that argument, respectfully, proves too much 

because there are lots of these cases in which legal 

11 error was made. And so -- in Rumsey, you could say 

12 exactly the same thing about Mr. Rumsey. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I think that's right. 

14 This is -- this is an argument against this whole line 

of cases, that this whole line of cases essentially has 

16 set up a system where the real purposes of the Double 

17 Jeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk 

18 away with windfalls. And I guess what's your best 

19 argument against that proposition?

 MR. MORAN: Well, once you accept the 

21 equivalency of a judicial acquittal to a jury acquittal, 

22 you have to accept that both actors are capable of 

23 error. Both actors are human. Juries are incapable --

24 are capable of making legal errors, as well as factual 

errors. They are capable of misunderstanding the

1 instructions. In fact, they are capable of being 

2 misinstructed. 

3  Had the judge not granted the directed 

4 verdict here, she presumably would have instructed the 

jury the same way, and the jury would have also 

6 acquitted Mr. Evans for the same reason. 

7  And so to try and tease out legal and 

8 factual errors, especially when -- and often, there are 

9 mixed questions of fact or law that are at stake here --

I think, is a losing proposition. I think it -- I think 

11 the Court has decided to draw a firm line, recognizing 

12 that an acquittal is special. An acquittal is the most 

13 fundamental thing that can happen. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a system say, if 

you have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the 

16 case, then arguments like the one that the defendant 

17 made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and 

18 if they are not made pretrial, they are waived. I mean, 

19 here, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the 

defendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system 

21 had built into it a requirement that defendants that are 

22 going to make this kind of plea do it pretrial. 

23  MR. MORAN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think 

24 it would have been right for Mr. Evans to make this 

argument pretrial because it was only with the

1 prosecution's proof that it became clear that what the 

2 prosecution was proving was that the building burned 

3 was, in fact, a dwelling house and, therefore, seemed to 

4 be excluded by the statutory language and especially the 

commentary to the jury instructions from the definition 

6 of the offense. 

7  Michigan is an information state. Michigan 

8 does not require an indictment that lists every -- every 

9 little bit of the crime and all of the details. All 

Michigan requires is a very simple statement of the 

11 crime and the statutory citation and, of course, who the 

12 defendant is and the date and venue of the alleged 

13 crime. 

14  And so here, Mr. Evans would have had no way 

of knowing in advance what the prosecution was going to 

16 prove. That's why this case is unlike Lee. This is --

17 Lee is an effective indictment. Nobody claims that Mr. 

18 Lee was innocent and that the prosecution couldn't prove 

19 the elements of the crime against Mr. Lee. The problem 

was just that the indictment failed to allege a specific 

21 fact. And that --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little 

23 confused. It was charged with the crime of burning down 

24 a dwelling, correct?

thought he was charged with burning down a dwelling, and

4 thereof, other than those specified in the next 

proceeding subsection" -- "subsection of this chapter." 

6 And the next proceeding section of the chapter is about 

7 burning down dwelling houses. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My only quibble is you 

9 have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that 

he burnt down a house -- that someone burnt down a 

11 house, correct? 

12  MR. MORAN: It was -- it was allegedly a 

13 vacant house. And apparently, that's why the 

14 prosecution charged it this way.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Got it. 

16  MR. MORAN: So they charged it. They're the 

17 ones who made the choice of which statute to apply. 

18 They, apparently, thought that they couldn't prove that 

19 it was a dwelling house, so they proved the other crime. 

And the thinking -- the thinking of the defense attorney 

21 and the thinking of the judge was that these two crimes 

22 were complementary to each other; in other words, that 

23 they did not overlap. 

24  It was either a dwelling house or not a 

dwelling house, and then one statute or the other

2  As a result of the ruling of the Michigan
 

3 Court of Appeals in this case, which is now not
 

4 contested, in fact, the burning -- the -- the statute
 

under which Mr. Evans was charged totally encompasses 

6 the greater crime because any building is covered in the 

7 crime with which Mr. Evans is charged, while only 

8 specific buildings, dwelling houses, are charged in the 

9 arson --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a sentencing 

11 enhancement, is really what the argument is -- the 

12 decision was. 

13  MR. MORAN: Well, there --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That every -- you can be 

charged with burning down a dwelling and you can only 

16 get the enhancement if they prove it's a house. 

17  MR. MORAN: You can only get the greater 

18 offense. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.

 MR. MORAN: Yes. But the -- a jury would 

21 have to make that determination -- or the judge in a

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BAUGHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

6 please the Court: 

7  This trial here was ended before verdict 

8 from a jury on the motion of the defendant, opposed 

9 vigorously by the prosecution, alleging, essentially, 

that the crime charged contained an uncharged element on 

11 which insufficient proof had been presented for a 

12 rational factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable 

13 doubt; that uncharged element being that the offense be, 

14 for want of a better term, of a -- excuse me -- the 

structure be, for want of a better term, a non-dwelling. 

16  We had -- that had not been alleged. But it 

17 has been conceded throughout the appellate history of 

18 this case, from the Michigan Court of Appeals on, that 

19 there is no such element in -- in the -- in the crime.

 The statute that Mr. Moran mentioned, that 

21 refers to the next preceding section, over three decades 

22 ago, was held to be words of limitation; in other words, 

23 you don't have to prove it's a dwelling, to prove that 

24 other real property -- a building or other real property 

has been burned. 

27

Official 

1  So in the 1970s, it was held the difference 

2 between the two statutes is the greater requires proof 

3 of a dwelling or a habitation; the lesser does not. The 

4 judge held that you have to prove the negative of the 

element that enhances the offense, in order to prove the 

6 lesser offense; you have to prove it's a non-dwelling. 

7 And, again, that's been conceded to be error throughout 

8 the entire appellate history here. 

9  And so the proofs were adequate -- were 

appropriate here, and the charging document was 

11 appropriate here. And the question becomes, on these 

12 facts, does termination of the trial by the judge 

13 constitute an acquittal, so that jeopardy should bar a 

14 second trial?

 The Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting 

16 certain governmental abuses that occurred historically. 

17 One of them is when the government would terminate a 

18 trial that was not going well, without the consent of 

19 the defendant, in order to take another shot at it -- to 

build a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder. 

21  And the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits 

22 that kind of conduct by establishing, through this 

23 Court's cases, that mistrials without the consent of the 

24 defendant bar retrial, that abhorrent practice is 

barred, unless a manifest necessity is shown.

1  And we've even extended that to the 

2 circumstance that, if the judge is intending to help the 

3 defendant, if he is doing something that he believes is 

4 in defendant's favor, if defendant has not consented, 

then that valued right to a verdict from the tribunal 

6 that he is before trumps everything. 

7  But if there is consent, as there was in 

8 this case -- the defendant asked the judge to terminate 

9 the trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his 

valued right to a decision by this tribunal -- if he 

11 does that, then that -- the other side of that coin is, 

12 that is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way. 

13  A retrial is permissible, unless the 

14 government has achieved the first harm by the back door; 

that is, by goading the defendant into the mistrial. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: So if -- if the judge did 

17 this on her own, that would have been okay? And there 

18 would be Double Jeopardy attaching? 

19  MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So we have to decide in 

21 each case whether the defendant was the initiating 

22 source of the error? 

23  MR. BAUGHMAN: In terms of the -- whether or 

24 not a judgment of acquittal was granted, yes, both the 

Federal rule and the Michigan rule provide that, on the

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if the

you know, I think this indictment is bad because you --

6 you have to show that it wasn't a dwelling place, and 

7 the counsel for the Defendant says, yes, that seems like 

8 a good -- a good idea.  Is -- is that enough to --

9  MR. BAUGHMAN: I think that would be enough. 

I think agreement with the judge's course of action 

11 would be the judge -- would be, as in the mistrial 

12 situation, would be the defendant's --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, my goodness, 

14 disagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it?

 (Laughter.)

17 whether you really wish to get a verdict from this jury 

18 or whether you risk having a -- risk -- risk wanting to 

19 have a retrial before a different factfinder. You may 

be very happy with --

2 happen if the defendant asked for improper instructions, 

3 really saying exactly something like this -- you know, 

4 that the jury has to find this additional element that, 

in fact, it doesn't have to find? But your theory, I 

6 would think, would say that too, the government could 

7 try the defendant again. After all, the government 

8 didn't get its one fair shot. 

9  MR. BAUGHMAN: That -- that's correct. And 

that -- that's the logic of Justice Holmes' position in 

11 Kepner, and we don't go that far, essentially because 

12 this isn't a jury case. There is a logic to that 

13 position, but it is -- there's --

other words, just because it doesn't happen to be this 

16 case.

19 logic of your position would extend to improperly 

instructed juries? 

21  MR. BAUGHMAN: It would, to a certain

1 historically said that a verdict by the factfinder, by

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, we've historically 

said it in this context, too. I mean, the cases that 

6 you are asking us to overrule go back 50 years. 

7  MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, when I say 

8 historically, I mean back to the time of the founding, 

9 in terms of when the Double Jeopardy Clause was 

promulgated and adopted into the Constitution. 

11 Fifty years is not back to when we were determining what 

12 it is we were protecting against when we adopted the 

13 clause. 

14  And as I think most of the commentators have 

noted, there is very little explanation in Fong Foo as 

16 to how the Court came out where it came out, and there 

17 has been very little explanation since as to how we got 

18 from the common law prohibition of a retrial after 

19 acquittal on the merits by a jury, to a ruling of law by 

the judge that no jury could find guilt beyond a 

21 reasonable doubt being the same thing, which is where we 

22 are today. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You cannot necessarily --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't have it, at 

the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to

1 do that. I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and 

2 how it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was 

3 certainly a -- an open question. 

4  It's not as though this procedure existed at 

the time of the founding or in English law before then 

6 and was never adequate to -- to constitute Double 

7 Jeopardy. It's a new procedure introduced, so the 

8 question for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's 

9 the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the 

acquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy? 

11  MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, I think you are exactly 

12 right. It, of course, is a new procedure. It didn't 

13 exist at the time of the founding. So our question then 

14 becomes is this new procedure sufficiently equivalent to 

that procedure that is historically protected, that 

16 it's -- that the protections that it is designed to 

17 guard against are served when we bar retrial in these 

18 circumstances? 

19  And I think, as Justice Kagan has indicated, 

there are many circumstances where what -- what we are 

21 doing is giving the defendant a windfall while serving 

22 no interest that was protected by the Jeopardy Clause. 

23 So if it's to be an analog, then we need to see does it 

24 really closely approximate a retrial after acquittal on 

the merits by a jury --

3 that gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed 

4 jury.

 MR. BAUGHMAN: But -- that is true, except 

6 we -- we could speculate that's -- that's true, but we 

7 don't know why the jury came back the way it did. The 

8 jury may have acquitted for an entirely different 

9 reason. We don't know. We don't have special verdicts, 

and we don't have any mechanism for inquiring, so we 

11 treat -- you have to have a line somewhere. Jeopardy 

12 terminates with the jury verdict, which may have been 

13 misinstructed, but we don't know why they came out the 

14 way they did.

 If they --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, I take it 

17 you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the 

18 prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but 

19 they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so --

because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough 

21 evidence, and so the prosecutor thinks, I think I'd like 

22 to try him again, and then he's acquitted again. I'd 

23 like to try him again, and he's acquitted again. 

24  Now, substitute judge for jury, the same 

thing could happen. I mean, I don't see why not. And

1 there's no answer to that, is there? And if there's no

3 then you're going to have to start distinguishing among 

4 which judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the 

problem of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 

6  And where I'm driving is that -- that there 

7 is a principle, and the principle was -- it seems the 

8 simplest way to put it, is where in fact the acquittal 

9 rests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence, 

that's it. That's what we're after. And where it's 

11 some procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't. Okay. 

12  Now, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's 

13 consistent with the cases, it's been clear. And you're 

14 advocating, let's go into that and change it or at least 

interpret the cases that's consistent with it. And 

16 we're saying there wasn't enough evidence, is because 

17 the judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong 

18 about, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work. But if 

19 the judge was right, it does work. Well, except for the 

matter of substantive evidence. Now, that way, as your 

21 opponent, lies a mess. 

22  I just went through that long thing because 

23 I don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing

2 One is we don't -- we don't have the circumstance that 

3 existed at the common law that the Jeopardy Clause was 

4 designed to protect against of the executive simply 

saying, after an acquittal by the factfinder, let's try 

6 him again, let's try him again, let's try him again. 

7  Something has to happen in-between there, 

8 and that is that a court has to determine -- neutral and 

9 detached arbiters have to determine that what happened 

when the judge granted the directed verdict of 

11 acquittal, as it's known in Michigan, was not that at 

12 all. 

13  The judge actually did something different. 

14 And if the court doesn't interpose on the prosecution's 

request, there will be no retrial. So it's not the 

16 harassment and abusive practice of simply starting a new 

17 prosecution, we're trying to get what happened in 

18 that --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're beginning to 

make distinctions. 

21  MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: And once you make those

1 it's whether there was -- "Just talk to the U.S. 

2 attorney, I didn't like it," or "Talk to the witness," 

3 or "The prosecution brought too late." 

4  The other side of it, where the clause 

attaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis, 

6 not enough evidence. I said -- I don't want to repeat 

7 myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a 

8 simple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases, 

9 and why shouldn't we follow it?

 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, I think -- I think 

11 consistent with the cases, and also clear, is to apply 

12 Martin Linen Supply by the very terms that it uses; that 

13 is, the resolution that we're talking about the judge 

14 making is moored to something. It's moored to the 

elements of the crime. We're talking about somebody 

16 being twice tried for the same offense. How do we 

17 define offense in the law? 

18  In other Double Jeopardy cases, this Court 

19 has taken an elements approach. Two -- two offenses 

are -- are different if one requires proof of an 

21 element, the other does not. We look to the elements. 

22 And to direct a jury trial, this Court has been very 

23 active very recently in determining how is it that we 

24 determine when somebody has a right to a jury trial on 

some fact before punishment can be imposed? We look to

3  If a fact is necessary to -- to -- in order 

4 for punishment to be imposed, if that has to be proven, 

then it is a matter for jury trial and it has to be 

6 proven beyond a reasonable doubt. So when this Court 

7 said one or more of the factual elements of the offense 

8 in Martin Linen Supply, I took it to mean -- and I have 

9 always taken it to mean -- one or more of the factual 

elements. And we can identify what those are. We have 

11 to identify them in every case. 

12  This is not a -- a strange process you have 

13 to instruct on them, determine what they are and use 

14 those --

JUSTICE ALITO: If the judge -- if the judge 

16 simply misinterprets one of the elements, but doesn't 

17 add a new element, you say that there would be Double 

18 Jeopardy there, right? 

19  MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that going to be a 

21 very difficult line to draw? 

22  MR. BAUGHMAN: It can be a very difficult

24 difficult lines to draw. We used to have a no evidence

1 was changed in Jackson v. Virginia, to whether a 

2 reasonable juror could find guilt beyond a reasonable 

3 doubt. 

4  And you will find a great many dissents in 

cases between appellate judges on whether or not this 

6 case itself involved sufficient proof for a jury to find 

7 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The test is not always 

8 easily -- easily applicable. And neither was the no 

9 evidence test. So there might be some --

JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you an example. 

11 Suppose the -- a statute makes it a crime to burn down a 

12 dwelling, and the judge interprets dwelling to mean a 

13 building that is currently lived in and, therefore, not 

14 including a vacation home. And let's assume that's an 

incorrect interpretation. 

16  Now, is that an incorrect interpretation? 

17 Or is that the addition of a new element to the statute, 

18 namely, that it is a building in which people -- that's 

19 one element, and the other is people are currently 

living there? 

21  MR. BAUGHMAN: I -- I would define -- I 

22 would draw the line at any time the court requires the 

23 prosecution to prove a fact that, under the law passed 

24 by the legislature, the prosecution never has to prove 

in order to make out the case.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's every 

2 misinterpretation. I mean, I don't know why this case 

3 doesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the 

4 elements of the crime are. I mean, any 

misinterpretation, you can -- which goes beyond the 

6 minimum that the -- that the statute requires, can be 

7 recharacterized as adding an additional element. 

8  MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, it does involve a -- a 

9 mischaracterization of what the elements were, but not 

of an element. The judge didn't here say, you can't 

11 prove that this is a building, unless it was a dwelling, 

12 you can't prove it was real property unless it was a 

13 dwelling. 

14  The judge said, you have -- you can prove 

those things, and it's not enough, you also have to 

16 prove that it was a non-dwelling in this case. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: But in several of our cases, 

18 what the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution 

19 prove additional facts in order to prove an element. So 

the distinction that you're drawing is one between 

21 incorrectly making the prosecution prove additional 

22 facts and incorrectly saying that the prosecution has to 

23 show an additional element. And I guess I just don't 

24 understand that distinction.

 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, I would suggest that

2 at does -- does the judge require -- has the judge 

3 required the prosecution to prove something the statute 

4 doesn't require to be proven, it's not one of the 

factual elements of the offense. 

6  Or has the judge -- the error the judge can 

7 make under Martin Linen Supply -- has the judge simply 

8 misassessed the evidence? The judge has looked at it 

9 and said -- you know, I -- I understand all your proofs, 

I'm looking at them, and they're just not enough for a 

11 reasonable juror to find guilt --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if I understand your 

13 test correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis, and 

14 Smith would all have come out differently.

 MR. BAUGHMAN: No, I don't think so. Rumsey 

16 is -- is a difficult case, but Rumsey is a verdict case. 

17 Rumsey is not a directed verdict case. The judge in 

18 Rumsey was the factfinder. Rumsey is your bench trial. 

19 It's -- it's -- it's complicated because it was a 

sentencing case -- a death penalty sentencing case that 

21 this Court treats the hearing the same as the trial for 

22 Double Jeopardy purposes. 

23  But the judge was the factfinder, and it was 

24 more like a misinstructed jury. The judge himself --

1 your -- your approach doesn't solve the bench trial 

2 problem any more than your friend's approach, right? 

3  MR. BAUGHMAN: A verdict is a verdict, I 

4 agree with Mr. Moran. When the judge on the merits 

returns a verdict, what the judge does or the jury does 

6 in returning a verdict on the merits is very different 

7 when what the judge does on a judgment of acquittal. 

8  The jury weighs credibility and assesses the 

9 weight of evidence, and the judge is prohibited from 

doing those things -- is supposed to be by the law, in 

11 making his decision. His is the ruling of law as 

12 gatekeeper, that -- that we won't even reach this 

13 decision. 

14  The jury is expressing its opinion based on 

the evidence. And although it can be proven that 

16 they've reached a result contrary to reality, they can't 

17 be right or wrong. Legally, their opinion is their 

18 opinion of those 12 collective people after doing 

19 something the judge isn't allowed to do.

 So the directed verdict isn't, I don't 

21 think, a perfect analog to the jury trial. But the 

22 bench trial issue gets very complicated because it is 

23 possible to do something with a bench trial that we 

24 don't do with jury trials, and that is have specific 

factfinding as to the elements. Many jurisdictions do.

1  There is, in fact, a case -- the Lynch case 

2 that Mr. Moran cited, where, on rehearing en banc, the 

3 court split evenly as to whether or not the judge's 

4 verdict, where the judge had actually specifically found 

all of the elements -- the crime is elements A, B, and 

6 C, I find them; I don't find element B, so I acquit --

7 the court split five to five on rehearing en banc and 

8 whether or not that judge had really announced two 

9 verdicts and it could be reformed -- be reformed to a 

conviction. 

11  And Justice Sotomayor was one of the members 

12 of the five who would have addressed the question of, is 

13 that not different? The form of the language doesn't 

14 control. Has not the judge actually entered a guilty 

verdict in that circumstance? 

16  That's a very -- you know, kind of 

17 off-the-beaten-track kind of a situation. In a jury 

18 trial, where a judge simply takes the case from the jury 

19 on the motion of the defendant and resolves the fact 

that the legislature has not said that one needs to be 

21 proven, that is not one of the constituent parts of the 

22 crime, that is not something that need be proven to 

23 impose punishment under the law, then he's done 

24 something very different than what the jury has done.

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS F. GANNON, 

8  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

9  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  We believe the Court can resolve this case 

13 by distinguishing between the misconstruction of an 

14 element and the erroneous addition of an element to the 

case. But if the Court's unwilling to draw that 

16 particular distinction, it could also resolve the case 

17 by allowing the government to appeal in both of those 

18 instances. This goes to the question that Justice Kagan 

19 was asking near the end of my friend's argument.

 We don't think that that would require 

21 overruling any of the Court's cases. We think it would 

22 require narrowing Smalis and Rumsey to their facts, 

23 and -- and -- but Smith would not be a problem in that 

24 context.

 Rumsey is distinct for the reason that my

Official 

1 friend suggested. It was actually a case involving 

2 factfindings by the judge. The Court characterized it 

3 as a special verdict made by the sole decisionmaker 

4 there. It was not an instance like this, where the 

judge had taken the case away, as a matter of law, from 

6 the jury because there wouldn't be any sufficient 

7 evidence. It has been cited later on in this cases, in 

8 particular, in Smalis, as being about something like a 

9 sufficiency decision, but on its facts, that's not what 

it was. 

11  Smith is about a completely separate 

12 question because there is no dispute there about the 

13 appropriate construction of the element. The firearms 

14 offense there, the element in question was whether the 

barrel length was less than 13 inches. There was a 

16 question about whether certain evidence that the firearm 

17 in question was a pistol was sufficient to satisfy that 

18 burden, but there was no doubt about what the -- what 

19 the element was. It was 13 inches or less. And so it 

wasn't about misconstruing the element. 

21  Smalis is probably the hardest case in this 

22 context, but if you look at what actually happened in 

23 Smalis and what was at issue in the demurrer there, the 

24 decision that the Court was reviewing was one that was 

principally about whether there was sufficient evidence

1 of causation, which was an undisputed element of each of 

2 the counts at issue there, and only in footnote 7 of the 

3 Court's opinion did it address potential misconstruction 

4 of the element.

 And it was a different element. This was 

6 what my -- my friend Mr. Moran mentioned --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Let's go through this. My 

8 basic question: Normally, a judge will wait till the 

9 jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him, 

whether to set it aside. So there's no problem. So 

11 now, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this 

12 judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in 

13 the middle of the case. 

14  Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope. 

And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing 

16 down his reasons. So he might just say there isn't 

17 enough evidence. And now, it happens that, just before 

18 he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an 

19 erroneous theory. All right. An added element or 

something or other, some kind of misconstruction of 

21 this. What happens then? 

22  MR. GANNON: Well, I think that we -- we 

23 normally expect judges to give reasons for their 

24 decisions.

4  MR. GANNON: Well, in the -- in the State of 

Michigan, the rule does not permit the judge to reserve 

6 the ruling on this motion. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see. So there are a 

8 lot more places --

9  MS. GANNON: So -- and actually, in the vast 

majority of states --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: They do. They --

12  MR. GANNON: -- that's the rule. The 

13 Federal rule was only changed in 1994, to allow this 

14 type of --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then this is a --

16  MS. GANNON: -- decision to be reserved 

17 after trial. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: This has arisen a lot more 

19 than -- than I think.

 All right. Fine. Thank you. 

21  MS. GANNON: And in fact, in the Federal 

22 context --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: And in that case, do they 

24 have to write it down?

1 rule in Michigan, and in the Federal Rule 29, does 

2 require the judge to make a determination of -- to 

3 satisfy that -- that there's an acquittal, which would 

4 mean that there is no -- no sufficient evidence to -- to 

support a guilty --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But many states have a 

7 different rule. 

8  MR. GANNON: Many -- many states --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And many states permit 

the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict. 

11  MR. GANNON: My -- my understanding is that 

12 most states do not permit that. The Federal government 

13 only started permitting that in 1994, and even the last 

14 time the Justice Department studied this, about ten 

years ago, it concluded that, notwithstanding the 1994 

16 rule amendment in the Federal rules, which came with 

17 advisory committee notes, strongly encouraging judges to 

18 reserve these sorts of decisions precisely to preserve 

19 the public's interest. So notwithstanding --

JUSTICE BREYER: So then, in other words, 

21 when an acquittal --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Finish the sentence. 

23 Notwithstanding that, what? 

24  MR. GANNON: Notwithstanding that, in 

approximately 70 percent of the cases in which there are

1 Rule 29 verdicts, they are done mid-trial, even in the 

2 Federal system, at least in the early 2000s, is the only 

3 data collection that I'm aware of. 

4  And so this -- this still is a problem. I 

think that if -- if it looks like the decision is based 

6 on classic insufficiency of the evidence and there is no 

7 argument about whether it was -- it's based on a 

8 misconstruction or an erroneous addition of the 

9 elements, then we -- we would have to be -- we would 

lose, unless the Court's willing to overturn the broader 

11 line of cases in Martin Linens, Sanabria, Scott, and the 

12 other cases that were --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Can you add to that -- your 

14 -- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in 

the last 30 or 40 years? Have most U.S. prosecutors or 

16 prosecutors in these states thought that they could 

17 appeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial 

18 on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law? 

19  MR. GANNON: I don't think that they -- they 

have mostly thought that, but the Federal government 

21 certainly has maintained that that -- that that is 

22 appropriate. In -- we think that in the Maker decision 

23 in the Third Circuit in 1984 recognized this. 

24  We do think that there is -- my -- my friend 

Mr. Moran asks the Court to conclude that any decision

1 like this, that is predicated upon a supposed erroneous 

2 addition of an element, could easily be recharacterized 

3 as a misconstruction of another element. 

4  And I think that -- that while, at some 

formal level, that -- that that might be theoretically 

6 true, in an egregious case like this, there is a 

7 distinction, which is that if -- if this were an element 

8 of the offense that needed to be charged in the 

9 indictment -- at least in the Federal system, then the 

failure to have alleged that the structure here was a 

11 non-dwelling would have made the indictment invalid. 

12  And the Defendant would have been able to 

13 make exactly the same legal argument he made to the 

14 judge here, which is to say that the prosecution has 

failed to prove -- has failed even to allege one of the 

16 necessary elements of the offense, which is that this 

17 structure is not a dwelling. We know that that 

18 particular --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, if we -- if 

we adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case 

21 only. And I -- I think this characterization, 

22 nonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of 

23 an element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call 

24 it one or call it the other, so that -- that's a 

difficult line to -- to adopt.

1  MR. GANNON: Well, I don't think it's 

2 difficult, in the sense that most -- most of the cases 

3 that we are talking about don't involve this type of 

4 error. The cases that this Court has decided, Rumsey, 

Smalis, and Smith, even the Petitioner doesn't 

6 characterize this case as involving additional elements. 

7  And this Court has recognized, in Lee, that 

8 when the error is one that kept the indictment from 

9 being valid because it failed to charge a relevant 

element and the judge did not rule on that until after 

11 jeopardy attached, the government was still entitled to 

12 appeal that decision, and if it were erroneous -- the 

13 government's only going to get a chance at retrial if 

14 the judge's decision was legally erroneous, then, 

therefore, it demonstrates that there was no so-called 

16 acquittal on the -- on the offense charged --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you gave us 

18 earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29 

19 motions in trial. I think you said 76 percent. What's 

the gross number, relative to the number of actual 

21 verdict decisions by juries or the judge himself? 

22  MR. GANNON: The only data that I have seen 

23 about this is data that the Justice Department collected 

24 about ten years ago. It was from the early 2000s. 

And -- and the conclusion there was that there were

1 approximately 73 pretrial Rule 29 dismissals per year --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Out of what number? 

3  MS. GANNON: -- which actually is a larger 

4 number than you -- than you might at first think, 

because that represents about ten percent of the number 

6 of cases that were actually resolved by jury verdicts. 

7 And so it -- it is not uncommon. 

8  I mean, this particular type of error that 

9 we have in this case, we think, is the most egregious 

kind, the non-existent element error, which -- which the 

11 government had also pointed out in its amicus brief in 

12 Smalis, we think is the most egregious kind of error. 

13 It's one that demonstrates that the court is engaging 

14 in -- it's usurping the province of the legislature in 

redefining the scope of the offense. 

16  And we think, under the terms of the Double 

17 Jeopardy Clause itself, which talks about whether 

18 there's been -- somebody's been subject to being twice 

19 in jeopardy for the same offense -- then it -- it 

matters what the offense was. 

21  And when the judge has redefined the -- the 

22 crime so extensively that the indictment literally would 

23 have been invalid and could have been dismissed as not 

24 adequately alleging the elements of the offense, and we 

know that that is something that the government would

1 have been able to appeal. 

2  We also know that the government would be 

3 able to appeal if the judge had reserved decision until 

4 after the jury had returned a jury -- a guilty verdict.

 We acknowledge, as the state does, that jury 

6 verdicts are different. If a jury is misinstructed and 

7 a jury returns an acquittal, that we are not quarrelling 

8 with that in any way. We don't think there's any 

9 purchase in the Court's case law to do that. And I 

think one of the reasons is because the jury verdict 

11 might be attributable, not just to mistake or error, but 

12 also to lenity or compromise. 

13  There -- there are lots of reasons why we 

14 don't exactly know why a jury did what it did, and why 

juries generally enter general verdicts. And that makes 

16 it different from what we have here. We have here an 

17 instance where the court, as a matter of law, at the 

18 defendant's behest, took the case away from the jury. 

19 We think the fact that the defendants chose --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that important, "at 

21 defendant's behest"? 

22  MR. GANNON: We do think that that's 

23 important by analogy to the Court's mistrial cases in

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MORAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

11  Responding to Mr. Gannon's argument first, I 

12 do characterize Rumsey as an additional element case. 

13 And I also characterize it as a misconstrued element 

14 case. It's a perfect example of how these cases can be 

construed either way. 

16  The judge required a contract. You can call 

17 that an additional element to the aggravating 

18 circumstance, or you can call it as a misconstruction of 

19 what pecuniary gain means in the first place.

 The same here, the error here can be 

21 construed as a misconstruction of the element that the 

22 property burned has to be a building, and the judge 

23 says, looking at the statute, I construe that to mean a 

24 particular type of building. Or it can be, as the 

prosecution construed it, as the addition of an element.

1 There is no difference between the two 

2 characterizations. 

3  Turning to the -- the broader question about 

4 this whole line of cases and should this Court go back 

and revisit this whole line of cases, is there really a 

6 problem here? We have no amicus briefs from any states 

7 indicating that there's a problem. We have only the 

8 amicus from the United States saying that there's a 

9 problem.

 Is there a problem here that justifies going 

11 back and revisiting 50 years -- or possibly 108 years, 

12 all the way back to Kepner -- all of this case law? We 

13 submit not, especially since, as this Court noted just 

14 six years ago in Smith, there is an easy solution if 

there really is a problem. 

16  If there really is a problem with judges 

17 going wild and granting directed verdicts mid-trial for 

18 no apparent reason, all that has to be done is the 

19 states can fall into that, as we can say, judges can't 

do that, or judges as an intermediate -- states as an 

21 intermediate step could at least give judges the power 

22 to reserve that decision --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have any states done that? 

24 I -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that, 

if the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient

1 evidence, that then it has to proceed with a trial.
 

2  MR. MORAN: I would be, too,
 

3 Justice Kennedy. I think it would be a mistake.
 

4  I'm not aware of any state, since this
 

decision -- since this Court's decision in Smith -- that 

6 have followed Nevada's lead. There are good reasons to 

7 give judges this acquittal power, namely, preserve the 

8 state's resources, preserve the jury's time, and 

9 present -- and prevent the defendant from having to go 

through a trial that is going nowhere. 

11  And so there are good reasons why states 

12 don't do this. States have apparently made the 

13 decision, even after being alerted in Smith, that 

14 there's something they can do about it, that the good of 

giving judges this mid-trial directed verdict acquittal 

16 power outweighs the bad. 

17  Finally, I'd just like to respond to 

18 Mr. Baughman's point, and it was also raised by 

19 Mr. Gannon, about how jury verdicts are different. 

There's something special about jury verdicts because we 

21 don't always know why they granted the verdict. 

22  But we have the same problem with judicial 

23 directed verdicts. And we have Martin Linen, where the 

24 judge just says, this is the weakest case I -- I have 

ever seen. We have Smalis, where he just says, it's

6 the offense are and which ones that they -- they don't
