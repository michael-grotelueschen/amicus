 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 09-158, Magwood v. Patterson.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A habeas petition challenging a new State 

court judgment for the first time cannot be a second or 

successive petition. AEDPA, of course, is a highly 

complex statutory system that has many interdependent 

parts. The pivotal language of this case, section 2244, 

is reproduced at page 2 of the blue brief, of 

Petitioner's brief.

 What that section does is it restricts 

claims that can be brought in, quote, "a second or 

successive habeas corpus application" under section 

2254. So this text establishes a two-step framework. 

First, the court needs to decide whether it's dealing 

with a second or successive petition. And second, if it 

is and only if it is, then the Court applies the 

modified res judicata principles set forth in that 

section.

Now, this case involves only the first of 

those two steps. And a petition, as here, that 

challenges a new death sentence cannot be a second or 

successive petition for the very simple reason that it 

challenges a State court judgment that has no -- never 

been covered in a habeas petition before.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 2244 doesn't make any 

reference to judgment, 2244(b). And now you bring in 

the concept of a judgment by looking at another 

provision. But if "second or successive application" 

means a second or successive application with respect to 

a particular judgment, then I don't see why the 

important and seemingly common sense point that you make 

in footnote 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that 

when a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief 

from his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas 

petition after his resentencing that challenged his 

conviction would be successive.

 You suggest that there are two judgments; 

there is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment 

of conviction. But for habeas purposes, the only thing 

that is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the 

Petitioner is held in custody. And that is the 

judgment -- that is the sentence.

 So I -- I -- if your argument is correct

that you look to whether there's a second or successive 

application as to a judgment, then the point you make in 

footnote 8 just cannot be true. So that if Petitioner 

gets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second 

petition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction.

 MR. FISHER: But, Justice Alito, let me make 

clear how we get to incorporating judgment and then 

answer your question. The way that you incorporate the 

word "judgment" is because, again, the language I just 

quoted says "an application under section 2244." And 

section 2244 defines -- and this is at the bottom of the 

page, of page 2 -­

JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that.

 MR. FISHER: -- defines it as "seeking 

relief from a State court judgment."

 Now, you are right that -- that -- that if 

somebody receives relief only as to their sentence and 

gets a new death sentence, as in this case, that the 

judgment he is challenging is new only as to the 

sentence.

 Now, there -- the word "judgment" appears in 

other places in the U.S. Code. There is two other 

places I am aware of where this Court had to construe 

the word "judgment." One of them is when this -- is 

with respect to this Court's jurisdiction over final

State court judgments. And in that realm -- this is in 

Brady v. Maryland in footnote 1 it's laid out. In that 

realm, this Court treats the judgment as having two 

parts that can be final -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if a -- if someone has 

a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in 

custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas 

petition, isn't that right?

 MR. FISHER: That's right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So it -- it is the judgment 

pursuant to which the person then is held in custody to 

which the habeas petition goes.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. And in Burton 

this Court made it very clear that the judgment that 

he's being held in custody as to is the new judgment 

that he is challenging.

 Now, what I'm saying is in the Brady context 

this Court has treated judgment as having two parts that 

can be final as to one and not as to the other. In 

other contexts in Burton, for purposes of seeking an 

appeal or seeking habeas relief, it is treated as 

inseparable.

 And the common thread between those two 

circumstances has been what minimizes Federal intrusion 

on State affairs? And so in this context that's a very

easy answer, because what this Court always assumed, and 

correctly so, I believe, is that if the only thing that 

is unconstitutional is somebody's sentence, that's the 

only thing a Federal court has the power to invalidate. 

And that's the only thing -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the sentence 

is -- he is convicted, sentenced to 10 years, and raises 

an argument, and only an argument, that cuts off 2 years 

of his sentence. He says under the statute the maximum 

is 8 years, and the court says, the judgment is vacated 

to the extent it goes beyond 8 years.

 Can he then bring a new challenge to, say, 

the whole sentence, or cut it off at 4 years, or does 

that limit his challenge? In other words, I'm trying to 

get to the point that it's not just the conviction, but 

if it's a period of the sentence that is not subject to 

challenge the first time?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I don't know, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that that question could actually 

arise in a section 2254 case, where the only thing a 

Federal court has power to do is to declare one way or 

the other whether the sentence is constitutional or not 

and then leave it to the State to decide in further 

proceedings how to -- how to go forward.

 In the Federal context in section 2255, the

question you suggest might arise, and indeed it has in a 

few places. And the question that the Federal courts 

have asked themselves in the second habeas petition, the 

second in time habeas petition, is the -- is the 

Petitioner challenging something he lost on the first 

time? And if the answer to that is yes, then it's a 

successive petition.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to 

belabor -­

MR. FISHER: If he's challenging -­

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't want to belabor this 

point, but once you get beyond the formal argument that 

you just look to whether it's a new judgment -- if you 

-- if you take a step beyond that, and if you -- if you 

don't take a step beyond that, then footnote 8 is wrong.

 If you take a step beyond that, then 

there -- then there isn't a textual basis for drawing 

this distinction between the sentence and the 

conviction. And what you need to ask is what is 

consistent with the scheme of that; isn't that right?

 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Alito. I think 

there are two textual bases. The first is the word 

"judgment" and, as I've described, sometimes this Court 

treats the judgment as having two parts that can be 

divided, and sometimes it doesn't. I think in this

context it ought to treat them as able to be divided. 

The other place you look is the words "second" -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Before you get 

beyond that, what you are talking about here is the 

judgment under which he is being held in custody, right?

 MR. FISHER: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- even if you 

divide it, that judgment hasn't changed.

 MR. FISHER: Well, certainly it has -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: He is still -- even -- his 

sentence has been altered and it's sent back for 

resentencing, but he is still being held in custody 

under the same judgment.

 MR. FISHER: He is being held in custody 

until he is executed, certainly, under his conviction. 

But his death sentence -- and in habeas -- in habeas 

it's always been understood you can challenge not just 

the fact of your custody, but the terms under which your 

custody -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. But -­

MR. FISHER: So I think the death sentence 

here is most easily thought of as the terms of the 

custody, which is a separate thing that he challenged 

and won on the first time and is challenging again now.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I'm not sure.

And getting back to Justice Alito's point, if -- if we 

say that the conviction is separate from the sentence, 

he can't challenge the conviction without being -­

meeting the successive bar, what about the finding of 

death eligibility? Why -- why can't that be separated 

from the sentence just like the earlier conviction?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think that because -­

what we're we are really talking about here when we talk 

about death eligibility is the need to find an 

aggravating circumstance. And here that goes only to 

whether -- his penalty, what his penalty can be. It's 

only to whether he can receive the death sentence or 

not. So it goes solely to punishment, not to crime.

 Now, Justice Alito, on -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That followed from the 

first conviction.

 MR. FISHER: The first conviction enabled 

him -- if we put aside for the moment our substantive 

fight over whether or not the crime itself constitutes 

an aggravating circumstance, but the conviction itself 

carries a life sentence unless an aggravating 

circumstance is found.

 And so put -- put it this way, 

Justice Kennedy: After the Eleventh Circuit granted 

habeas relief the first time, Mr. Magwood at that

moment, in 1986, was subject to a conviction that 

carried a life sentence. And it was the State that 

elected to go forward at that point and to seek a new 

death sentence. And all our position is, is that when 

that brandnew full-blown sentencing hearing was held -­

and the Alabama trial court at Pet App. 103a called this 

a "complete and new assessment of the evidence and the 

law" -- when this new hearing was held it had to comport 

with the Constitution.

 I don't think even the State disputes that 

all the -- all parts of the Constitution applied in that 

context.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher -­

MR. FISHER: And so -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you -- you say -- you 

present this argument that it is a second petition and 

you say that's the only issue before us and there is no 

other way that the new proceeding would be cut off under 

AEDPA.

 There was in this case, in the first -- when 

the -- the sentence was set -- set aside, an order by 

the district judge; and it said: Magwood, I want you 

now to bring out all conceivable -- all conceivable 

claims on pain of forfeiture.

 Why doesn't that alone -- this is an order

by the court: I don't want you to engage in seriatim 

litigation; I want you to bring forward all conceivable 

claims. And that was an order and it was made on pain 

of forfeiture. Why isn't that dispositive of this case?

 MR. FISHER: Because that order was entered 

in one case, and now we have an entirely different case, 

Justice Ginsburg. That order was entered in the case 

under which Mr. Magwood challenged his 1981 judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what he's 

bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could 

have brought up then.

 MR. FISHER: Well, it's not -- it was not 

claim he could have brought, and this is an important 

point, Justice Ginsburg. Under res judicata law, he is 

not making, as the State would say, the same claim now 

as he could have made then. The fact that he is 

challenging a different judgment by definition makes it 

a new -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the issue is the 

same. The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death 

penalty because at the time he committed this offense, 

there had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at 

least one aggravator.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. The legal -- the 

legal issue that he is raising is one that he could have

raised then.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why doesn't preclusion 

result from the court's order that says: Bring up all 

conceivable claims?

 MR. FISHER: Because you can't waive 

something by failing to raise it in a different case. 

This is an entirely different case, in the district 

court -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then you get to -­

you get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact 

what we have here is we have piece of paper issued in 

1981, and on that piece of paper it says: You, Billy 

Joe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by 

electrocution. Then we have another piece of paper 

which was issued in 1986, and that says: You are 

ordered and adjudged guilty of the offense of aggravated 

murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. So the 

words are identical. And one was issued in '81 and one 

was issued in '86.

 So you are saying since '86 -- this piece of 

paper in '86 is a new judgment, you can start all over. 

So then the question comes up, well, if you can start 

all over in respect to anything, why can't you start all 

over in respect to everything? But you recognize that 

that would be a mess, because all the things that were

never challenged here, like those things related to 

guilt, they could all come up again, too, even though he 

has never done it.

 So what is -- what is -- what is your 

answer? Clearly you are going to start saying some 

things if it wasn't at issue you can bring up, and 

others you can't; and once you are down that track, how 

do we know whether these are on one side or the other?

 MR. FISHER: So let me answer that in 

practical terms and then get back to Justice Alito by 

giving a -- giving statutory hook for it.

 In practical terms, even though the new 

judgment, which is at Pet. App. 106a, reimposes the 

conviction, it's not anything new as to that conviction. 

If it were a new judgment as to that conviction, the 

State of Alabama would have to have a whole new trial on 

guilt/innocence, and it didn't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is something new in 

respect to the sentence.

 MR. FISHER: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is something new in 

respect to the sentence.

 MR. FISHER: It is new because of the 

brandnew sentence, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah! But it is not new in

respect to the words. They are identical.

 MR. FISHER: Well, it's -­

JUSTICE BREYER: All that happened -­

MR. FISHER: -- they imposed -­

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is the sentence was 

reimposed. So why not those things?

 Does your concession on the first part, 

which I agree is necessary, imply a concession on the 

second part, that it's not new in respect to what might 

have been brought up before?

 MR. FISHER: No, it doesn't. Look at this 

Court's decision in Lawlor. This is discussed in our 

opening brief, I believe around page 23, and it's a res 

judicata case. And what the Court held in that case is 

if somebody does something to somebody, the exact same 

thing multiple times, you can bring a new case when they 

do it to you the second time or the third time, and you 

can make arguments that were never made the first time. 

There is no waiver, there is no forfeiture, and the 

reason you can do it is you are challenging a new 

injury.

 So Mr. Magwood under -- even under res 

judicata law, which this Court has said is stricter than 

habeas law, even under res judicata law he would have 

the right to bring this claim as to the sentence because

it's challenging something new.

 Now let me get back to the statute, because 

this is important. The other place that we get our -­

our answer is the word -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The reason 

Lawlor doesn't work is what you have there is different 

acts. The later judgment is -- is not just a later 

judgment with respect to the same act. It's a later 

judgment with -- with respect to a different act. Here 

you are saying you want to apply the same rule with 

respect to a later judgment, redoing the judgment for 

the same prior act. And I don't think that the same 

rule has to apply.

 MR. FISHER: With all due respect, I think 

Lawlor does apply. One example in that case is an 

abatable nuisance. Imagine that smoke goes over and 

pollutes somebody's property every -- every first day of 

January every year. Somebody brings a lawsuit about 

that saying it violates certain laws, and they lose. If 

the next year smoke goes over the property again, you 

can bring a lawsuit for the identical thing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not the identical thing. 

The last one was for the smoke that went last year. The 

next one is for the smoke that went this year.

same here. The first case Mr. Magwood brought was about 

the 1981 judgment sentencing him to death, and this case 

is about the 1986.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same act of his. I'm 

talking about the act that is the basis of the lawsuit.

 MR. FISHER: But remember, the act -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the very same act.

 MR. FISHER: But all we are talking about 

here is not the same act. The same act as to the 

conviction carries over, but this was, as the trial 

court put it, a complete and new assessment of the 

evidence. This second -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I -- I want you 

to get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want 

to ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get 

back to Justice Alito's question as well. Under Alabama 

procedure, at the sentencing hearing both in the first 

trial and the second, is there evidence about the 

aggravating and mitigating, or do you just look at the 

evidence that was proven in the guilt phase?

 MR. FISHER: Well, the trial judge -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there new witnesses, 

et cetera?

 MR. FISHER: As it turns out, the parties 

did not put new witnesses on the stand. But the trial

judge was explicit -- and this is in the -- in the order 

that's in the back of the appendix -- it was explicit 

that the parties had the right to do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then it's -­

MR. FISHER: They had every right -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not clear to me why 

death eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction.

 MR. FISHER: Because death eligibility 

hinges on the finding of an aggravating circumstance. 

And so that was vacated when the -- when the -- when the 

State elected to go forward and tried to reimpose a 

death sentence and the -- reimpose a new death sentence 

and the trial judge found new -- it turned out to be the 

same aggravating circumstance, but it found an 

aggravating circumstance all over again.

 Imagine, Justice Kennedy, the State if it 

had wanted to at the second death sentence hearing could 

have submitted evidence to try to prove a new 

aggravating circumstance. The defendants could have 

submitted evidence trying to prove new mitigating 

circumstances.

 Now, Mr. -- Justice Alito, I think it's 

important to get back to your question for the second 

actual hook for my argument, and it's the words "second 

or successive." It has to -- in some way to make any

sense of the statute, you have to say it's second or 

successive as to something.

 Now, if you look at McCleskey, which is this 

Court's most thorough consideration of that concept, it 

says again and again in that decision what makes it 

second or successive is that you are asking for the same 

thing you have been denied before. You are coming back, 

as -- as -- as it used to be the case, you are filing, 

in effect, an appeal, endless appeals from the denials 

that you have been getting.

 We are giving meaning to "second or 

successive" by saying that it's second or successive if 

you are asking for relief that has been denied before. 

It is not second or successive if it's the first time 

you are challenging something new that the State's 

imposed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher -- Mr. Fisher, 

to get -- I get your "second, it's a new judgment." But 

thinking in terms of what AEDPA was attempting to do, we 

have two claims, one after the other. The second claim 

is one that would take away the death penalty forever, 

that would be it, because he said the only sentence I 

can get is life without parole.

 He brings instead, first, one that doesn't 

make him -- that still leaves him exposed to the death

penalty. So the court has been put upon twice. If he 

had brought the first claim and he is right about that, 

he's not death eligible. Instead, he brings a claim 

that still leaves him death eligible, and the court has 

been burdened twice, when easily he could have brought, 

as the district judge instructed him to do, everything 

the first time.

 MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I'm going to 

tell you two things. First of all, with -- with respect 

to the two different claims, given the severity of 

Mr. Magwood's mental illness, I think there was every 

reason to expect that prevailing on that claim in the 

Eleventh Circuit would have put an end to the State's 

decision to seek the death penalty in this case.

 As it turns out, it didn't and the State 

went forward.

 But also understand that the State's 

argument here, to the extent you are ordering the claims 

in sort of a level of importance, would apply even if 

the opposite were true, even if Mr. Magwood had brought 

the -- had brought some other claim the first time and 

prevailed on it. Any claim, the State says, that you 

could have raised the first time is forever barred. And 

that gets to, well, I still don't think I have quite 

answered the question on second or successive, so let me

continue that.

 We are giving meaning to that term "second 

or successive." It's important to understand that, 

whatever slight difficulty you have with the word 

"judgment" and making sense of the words "second or 

successive" in our case are dwarfed by the interpretive 

difficulties, in fact the impossibilities, with respect 

to the State's proposal.

 The State's proposal -- and it's laid out at 

page 17 of its brief, at the top of the page, right 

after the number 1 -- the State's proposed rule -- and I 

think it's useful to put it next to the statute. The 

State's proposed rule is if a claim could have been or 

was raised in a prior petition, it is barred by Section 

2244 (2) or (1).

 Now, the first thing you will notice is that 

the words "second or successive" appear nowhere in the 

State's rule. The State gives no definition, no meaning 

whatsoever, to those concepts. What the State is trying 

to do is -- is ask this Court to create a brandnew 

waiver system, a brandnew waiver system for all second 

in time petitions.

 And we know -- we know from 

Martinez-Villareal and Slack and other cases that second 

in time petitions are not necessarily successive and

certainly they ought not to be thought of as successive 

when they challenge a different judgment or a different 

conviction or the like.

 But what the State is asking for is a 

brandnew waiver system that has never been imposed in 

any decision from this Court and there have been three 

decisions from this Court where it would have come up. 

One is Burton, another is Richmond, which is cited in 

our brief, and the third case is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how -- how does the 

State's definition at page 17 of the red brief not 

comport with the whole idea of second or successive?

 MR. FISHER: Because the only way to get the 

idea of second or successive into the State's definition 

is where it says prior habeas petition. So, the only 

way that a State can even be pretending to give meaning 

to that would be a second in time petition.

 Now, we know that can't be enough because of 

Slack and Martinez-Villareal. But even more than that, 

we know that can't be enough because it would -- it 

would prohibit defendants from bringing second habeas 

petitions even as to things that are novel as to -- a 

second in time rule would apply section 2244's rules to 

even second in time petitions that are brandnew things 

that arose at the retrial or resentencing.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that's not -­

that's not something that could have been or was raised.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy. 

So the State creates additional statutory language that 

doesn't exist. It could have been or a previously 

available rule. Let me give you some -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's an issue 

that we look at all the time under AEDPA. That's not a 

new approach. AEDPA says, you know, if you show that a 

claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law made 

retroactive, that was previously unavailable. That 

seems to me to be the same inquiry, as to whether or not 

a claim could not have been raised in a prior habeas 

petition.

 MR. FISHER: I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice. 

You do look at those questions once it has been 

determined that a petition is second or successive. You 

have never looked at those questions in order to 

determine somehow whether it gets in the door.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an -- I thought 

your point -- I thought your point was, oh, this is 

going to be hard to do, impossible, as you say.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I can tell you lots of 

reasons why that would be the case. So, let me give you 

some examples.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. First -­

before you get off whether this is second or successive, 

although the -- the State didn't put it this way, I 

think what the State is clearly saying is that if it is 

the second petition that could have raised this issue, 

it is second or successive. What's wrong with that?

 MR. FISHER: The word -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't that fit -- fit 

the statutory language?

 MR. FISHER: Because the word the statute 

used, Justice Scalia, is "claim," not issue. And this 

is not the same claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't use -­

MR. FISHER: Lawlor tells you that, and res 

judicata.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't use 

"judgment," either, and -- and -- and you are -- you are 

dragging in judgment as the -- as the -­

MR. FISHER: Well, it refers to section 

2254, and section 2254 uses the word "judgment," so it's 

our belief it is by incorporation.

 But to get back to your precise question, 

it's important because the statute does not use the 

words "issue" or "argument." It uses the word "claim," 

which is a defined term in legal parlance.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So if -- if this is 

the -- if this is the second time that this claim could 

have been presented, it's a second -- it's a second or 

successive claim.

 MR. FISHER: But, Justice Scalia, this is 

not the second time this claim could have been 

presented. In 1983 or '84 when he filed his first 

habeas petition, he couldn't make this claim because 

this judgment didn't even exist. There would be no way 

to challenge this judgment. And I'm not being overly 

technical here. I just urge you to look at res judicata 

law.

 Now let me give you some examples of the 

difficulties the State system would raise. First of 

all, with -- with respect to intervening authority. The 

State itself concedes in its brief that it's not clear 

how its system would apply in the case of somebody who 

gets habeas relief and then later wants to seek habeas 

relief based on an intervening decision of this Court.

 Up until now that has been a perfectly easy 

situation because the new judgment allows a new claim to 

be brought, but under the State's rule it's unclear. To 

the extent that the State says, well, what we would have 

to do is look and see -- look and see whether if there 

was fair notice of that decision, the defendant would

have raised it. That gets into very difficult 

situations about how new is the decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me -- it 

seems to me those are the exact same problems that would 

arise, do arise, under AEDPA. You have got to show that 

it's a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive.

 MR. FISHER: But that's not the State's 

rule, Mr. Chief Justice. It's very easy to say whether 

this Court has made a decision retroactive. It would 

be. It hasn't happened, but I imagine it would be very 

easy.

 The State's rule is any new decision from 

this Court gives the defendant a new -- gives potential 

rise to a debate as to whether or not that claim was 

previously available.

 Let me tick off a couple of other things 

before I sit down. What about a situation the first 

time where a claim is Teague-barred or procedurally 

precluded or maybe even the defendant doesn't raise it 

because under the facts that the first trial went 

forward, it would have been harmless error.

 All of those situations would raise very 

difficult questions as to whether that claim, as the 

State would put it, was previously available. Even, 

again, go back to the idea of having a new trial based

on new -- based on new facts and new evidence. Trying 

to figure out whether it's the same claim, a different 

claim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing 

argument. Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact 

same script a second time, there is going to be a huge 

fight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a 

different claim.

 And finally, the State's other -- the other 

prong of the State's test is about claims that were 

raised before are now barred. Now, the State 

immediately recognizes that that's a huge problem 

because it would bar defendants from making -- from 

seeking habeas relief if the State made the same 

violation the second time around. So it invents a 

brand-new due process principle that has never been held 

to be -- to be in existence by this Court. And indeed, 

in the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas 

situation, where the State court made the same error 

twice, it went straight to the constitutional claim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's the 

second -- I see your light's on. If it's the second 

time around, then it's just barred by law of the case.

 MR. FISHER: Well, it -- well, it shouldn't 

be barred. Because it's a new judgment, the defendant 

should be able to get relief the second time around. It

would be a very strange construction of the habeas 

statute, and it wouldn't be law of the case because it 

would be a new case, again, Justice Kennedy.

 And finally, let me give you the situation 

of claims the defendant raises but then loses on but is 

unable to appeal. Imagine a case like this where the 

defendant has many other claims that he loses on in the 

district court or in the court of appeals. Now, the 

State has a pickle here.

 It has to either say that those claims are 

forever barred from being raised again, even though the 

defendant was deprived of a full right to appeal because 

he won on something else and couldn't appeal the losses 

on the other issues, or the State has to say that those 

were -- that those were not previously available, those 

claims were not previously available, in which all of 

its rhetoric about resurrecting past claims drops away.

 Again, a very difficult question that this 

Court's going to have to grapple with if it accepts the 

State's rule.

 I would like to reserve what time I have 

left.

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MAZE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Even though they rose together, the State 

has litigated Magwood's mitigating circumstances in 

Federal court from 1983 to 1986, and now we have been 

litigating these aggravating circumstances from 1997 

through today. That's piecemeal litigation. That's 

precisely the reason that AEDPA was passed under 2244(b) 

and that's precisely what the abuse of the writ doctrine 

was designed to prevent.

 And it's based on the principle that this 

Court unanimously affirmed again yesterday. You have 

equitable principles that say when you have two parties, 

a party has a full and fair opportunity to praise a 

claim or to litigate. But the other party also has a 

finality interest. And once you take away your full and 

fair opportunity by not using it, the other party's 

interest in finality outweighs. That's what Congress 

envisioned in AEDPA. That's what this Court envisioned 

with the abuse of the write doctrine. That's why we 

don't allow someone who had a claim previously available 

that didn't use it to bring it again.

 And if I may, I want to go straight to

Justice Alito's question about conviction versus 

sentence, and then to Justice Kennedy's about whether or 

not under Alabama law this is aggravated with something 

new to the resentencing.

 As far as judgment -- conviction versus 

sentence, I had two answers. Justice Breyer got to the 

first. On page 106, the new judgment, as Mr. Magwood 

would say, says, "I hereby judge you convicted of the 

underlying offense in the actual guilt phase and the 

sentence." So it contains both, if you consider that a 

new judgment.

 But the second point is, if Magwood is 

correct that you can separate a judgment of sentence and 

conviction, then Burton is wrong. Burton has to be 

wrong. Because the argument in Burton was -- he cited 

In Re Taylor, which was the exact same case we put in 

our brief. He said: My first petition attacked the 

judgment of conviction; my second petition attacked the 

judgment of resentence, and because those are two 

separate judgments, this was my first chance to attack 

the judgment of sentence.

 And this Court said: No, it's one judgment; 

it's conviction and sentence. And because your first 

petition attacked that judgment that contained both, 

your second petition attacks the same judgment that

contained both.

 So if Mr. Magwood is right that you can 

separate the two, then Burton has to be wrong. Now -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I think what you would 

have to do -- it's a dilemma here.

 MR. FISHER: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What you would have to say 

to follow his approach, is you would say: Judge, here 

is what you would do. They're filing it from the second 

judgment. Okay? So it is not second or successive.

 But wait. If there is a first judgment that 

says the same thing, then it is, in effect, the first 

judgment that counts.

 Now, what happens when there is a change? 

Well, to note the scope of the change, you would go to 

the habeas court and you would say, to the extent that 

that habeas court changed -- reversed -­

MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- or left open or told the 

lower court: Do this over; to that extent, it is a new 

judgment. And that -- that would get them where they 

want to go.

 MR. MAZE: And you just answered 

Justice Kennedy's question. The question in this case 

is: What changed? If you'll look at the district

court's opinion, its order from the first case -- it's 

page 228 of the opinion -- it said: The Court finds 

that this case must be remanded to the State court for 

resentencing on the existence of mitigating 

circumstances, rather than two. Justice Kennedy's 

question was -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait 

right there. I would have read that to say that what he 

said was: Vacate the sentencing part.

 Now, you say: Well, vacate the sentencing 

part; fine. Now we look at the second judgment, and we 

say: It's a new judgment. Oh, but it isn't.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as that habeas 

didn't tinker with it. But they did tinker with it, 

because they vacated the sentencing part.

 Now, why doesn't that work? And his 

argument is, that works much easier for the judges, much 

easier for everybody, than to try to figure out whether 

a claim could have or couldn't have been raised, whether 

a sentence was changed from six years to five years, or 

who knows what we are going to get into; et cetera.

 MR. MAZE: Because it's one of two things. 

Either you vacated the entire judgment and the 

conviction and sentence are put back together -- they

are -- it is a new judgment altogether. Or you look at 

specifically what the constitutional infirmity was that 

the Court identified in that case.

 The answer to Justice Kennedy's question is: 

There are four things under Alabama law at the time of 

this case that were necessary to have a death sentence. 

The first was an indictment with an aggravating 

circumstance. The second was a conviction of a capital 

offense. The third was the State announcing an 

aggravating circumstance. And the fourth was a penalty 

phase recommendation from the jury that was unanimous.

 When this case went back, all four of those 

things were carried over from the first trial. We 

didn't do any of those things again. They were all 

carried over. They are relics from the original trial. 

The only thing new that happened was we added the two 

mitigators to the weighing calculus and it was 

reweighed. And we know that is true from the district 

court's opinion in the second case.

 Mr. Magwood claimed that he could bring a 

claim against the fact that we didn't re-empanel the 

penalty phase jury, which, again, is a sentencing claim, 

and the district court said no, the State court didn't 

have to re-empanel the jury to give another 

recommendation, because that wasn't the problem in the

first case. The only problem in the first case was not 

having the two additional mitigators. And under the 

same rationale, the State's announcement of the 

aggravator was also a relic from the first case. And in 

fact, we know that, because in the circuit court's 

opinion in the first case, it specifically told the 

State court: If you will weigh the same aggravating 

circumstance against the four instead of two, we won't 

question your judgment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This argument -- I am 

making it up, but I mean, he doesn't have to apply these 

arguments -- but it seems to me that the argument 

against this is: What you are proposing is too 

complicated. There are thousands of these in the courts 

of appeals. All you would like is you would like the 

court of appeals to look back and say: What part of the 

original sentence did the district court, habeas, 

vacate?

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Not look into the reasons 

for it, et cetera. Because once we start going into the 

reasons for it, the litigation is just going to 

mushroom.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and, you know, you

have this new witness but not that new witness, et 

cetera. So his argument is one from simplicity. Start 

with the judgment. Second, keep it the same insofar as 

the district court didn't vacate it. And deal with it 

as a new judgment, which it is, insofar as they did.

 MR. MAZE: There is a simple answer to why 

the Federal courts can deal with this, and we know they 

can deal with it. And the answer is: When this happens 

on direct appeal in a Federal prisoner's case -- for 

example, if a Federal prisoner says you shouldn't have 

enhanced my sentence for this one reason, and he gets a 

remand where the sentence is vacated, he is resentenced 

and it comes back up -- the circuit courts are 

unanimous. They all say you can't challenge other 

enhancers from the original sentence because you could 

have raised it the first time. I can give you case 

after case after case where they have done that. A good 

example: Judge Posner had the case U.S. v. Parker 101 

at 3rd 527, where he says the exact same thing and his 

analysis is exactly what we are saying. A party cannot 

use the accident of a remand to raise in a second appeal 

an issue that he just as well could have raised in the 

first appeal. And the principle is exactly the same, 

that the Federal courts in State habeas will look to see 

is this was an issue you could have raised the first

time, and if it was, you are out.

 It would make no sense under AEDPA for a 

Federal prisoner on direct appeal to give the U.S. 

government a finality interest in enhancers that could 

have been challenged the first time, but not to give the 

same finality interest to States when they are coming 

into Federal court under AEDPA for aggravators that have 

been challenged the first time. Again, the whole 

purpose of AEDPA was to give finality to the State. If 

Federal government is going to get a greater interest 

than the States, then AEDPA is completely -- I mean, 

it's just completely wrong.

 Now, another problem with Magwood's argument 

is, he is going to kill an entire line of cases, the 

Kyzer cases, where you can challenge good time credits, 

parole credits. If you remember, in Kyzer, you said if 

you are challenging your good time, you can raise that 

in a 2254 petition. Now, under Magwood's rule, if you 

read it as a second or successive application against a 

judgment -- let's assume that you've lost in your first 

habeas, so your first petition is now done and you have 

lost. Good time credits are taken away from you. Under 

this Court's precedent, you raised that in a 2254 

petition, but that petition will be the second petition 

under the same judgment. And he would be barred because

the good time credit claims would meet an exception. 

It's not new facts or law that proves he's innocent, and 

therefore it is barred.

 The only way that the circuits have been 

able to deal with that situation is exactly the way the 

State's saying here and that Justice Scalia is saying. 

You ask the question first: Is this a claim that has 

been available before? And if it's not a claim that was 

available before, and because it's a good time claim 

that wasn't, then you say this is not a second or 

successive application, because it is the first 

application in which he could have brought the claim. 

That's directly -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Mr. Fisher uses the 

word "claim" as -- differently.

 MR. MAZE: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He makes a distinction 

between "issue" and "claim." Yes, it's the same issue; 

could have been -- the issue could have been raised 

earlier, but, he says, it's not the same claim. And the 

statute uses the word "claim."

 MR. MAZE: I have two answers to that, if I 

can, Justice Ginsburg. The first is: This Court has 

defined a claim in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which is a 2254 

case, as the assertion of a ground that entitles the

Petitioner to habeas relief.

 If you'll look at the question presented, 

Magwood agrees that this -- this says at the end: "The 

Petitioner could have challenged his previously imposed 

but now vacated sentence on the same constitutional 

grounds." If the claim is grounds that can give you 

relief and he admits that it's the same grounds he could 

have gotten relief on the first time, it is the same 

claim.

 Now, to the extent he is telling you this is 

a new injury, that -- the smoke example that Mr. Magwood 

is talking about, we disagree with that; to the extent 

that he would be right, the difference is in this case, 

he asked us to blow the smoke at him a second time. 

Remember what happened in the first proceeding. Magwood 

didn't challenge the aggravating circumstance, and then 

when we got to the court of appeals, he asked 

specifically the Eleventh Circuit to send this case back 

for resentencing so that the four mitigators could be 

weighed against the original aggravator. He asked for 

this to go back and to -- asked to have the aggravator 

applied to him again. So he invited the error. This is 

not like a normal civil case where -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what would happen 

if it had been sent back on this ground, but there was

another ground that he had appealed on which the Court 

never reached?

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Would he still be 

able to raise that one on habeas?

 MR. MAZE: Yes. And again, the reason is -­

it's just like you said in Espinoza yesterday -- you get 

one full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim. If 

you raise the claim in the first petition, it's not 

abusive, as this Court said it in McCleskey, because 

McCleskey says it is only abusive if you could have but 

didn't. And this Court's really already answered that 

question in Slack.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you are right, but 

McCleskey was pre-AEDPA.

 MR. MAZE: It was.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the answer under 

AEDPA to Justice Scalia's problem?

 MR. MAZE: I think it's the same, and the 

reason I say that because in Slack, you had a first 

petition that raised an exhausted claim. It was 

dismissed. He raised what everybody acknowledged was a 

second in time petition, but you said because he didn't 

get an adjudication on the merits, we're going to let 

him do it again. The same thing happened in

Martinez-Villareal.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we just found that to 

be successive under the words of the statute?

 MR. MAZE: Right. But in Panetti -- if you 

remember, in Panetti, he raised a -- he did not raise a 

Ford claim the first time around, and this Court said 

yes, if we looked at it only a second in time, this 

would be barred, but we defined second or successive 

application under the abuse of the writ doctrine. And 

because this was the first time this claim was right you 

allowed him to do it and called it a first application, 

and the reason was because he couldn't raise it the 

first time.

 Now, back to the point -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your answer to 

Justice Scalia's point: Suppose it was raised but the 

Court didn't decide it.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your test, I take it, is 

that he must have one full and fair opportunity to 

litigate the question; that means to raise it, to have 

it aired, and to have it decided.

 MR. MAZE: Absolutely. The point would be, 

it's not an abuse of the writ if you raise a claim the 

first time but don't have the chance to have it

adjudicated. You abuse the writ, as this Court has 

always said, by having a chance to raise the claim but 

then not doing it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what they raised -­

your view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments 

there are.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If this claim could have 

been raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it 

been, it's barred.

 MR. MAZE: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But if either it couldn't 

have been raised, or if it could have been raised and 

wouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully 

adjudicated, not barred.

 MR. MAZE: Yes, that's it. And that's 

directly in line -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And applied to everything.

 Can we reconcile that with the language? 

Does it work in terms of the language?

 MR. MAZE: What this Court has done since 

AEDPA came out on two different occasions, has said the 

second or successive petition is a term of art, which 

would give substance in our previous habeas corpus 

cases, the abuse of the writ doctrine cases.

This Court has always said since AEDPA came 

out that we have to define the term by looking at what's 

an abuse of the writ. And that's what the circuit 

courts have done. The circuit courts are applying the 

same rule that we have given you, which is precisely 

what Justice Scalia said earlier.

 JUSTICE BREYER: One judgment. One 

judgment. Never come up on appeal. Yes, it did, the 

first one. And let's see. There were 15 issues that 

were raised. They only answered -- you know, they 

answered one. Now we go back and then five years later 

he wants to bring up a different one. Fine. You can do 

it. Not second or successive.

 MR. MAZE: Can you repeat? I'm sorry. I 

lost you.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It -- it's there in the 

case.

 MR. MAZE: Okay. The claim is available.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's one judgment. He 

makes five claims.

 MR. MAZE: Okay. Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The district court doesn't 

decide, for some reason, I don't know, number 3 or 4. 

Maybe I -- maybe it's not realistic, what I say. Let me 

think about it some more.

MR. MAZE: Okay. While you are doing that, 

I want to make another point.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, just to 

follow up: It's very realistic. I think a reasonable 

judge might decide: Look, if I can dispose of this case 

on ground one, you know, why should I go and decide all 

these other issues, which may be difficult?

 MR. MAZE: Right. And it does happen.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. And so I 

assume your point is that he can raise -- he can raise 

again issues that he raised before; it's no fault of his 

that the Court didn't reach -­

MR. MAZE: Yes, that's right. Because he 

didn't have the full and fair opportunity to have it 

adjudicated. Now, in this -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Full -- see, he filed his 

petition -- this would get rid of -- I think there 

are -- I am worried about that there are cases out there 

that say the opposite. But we get rid of all those 

cases, if there are any, and you just say that he has 

not had the full opportunity to have the litigation on a 

claim that he did raise.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Or if he couldn't have 

raised it, it doesn't matter if there was one judgment

forever. He can raise it again and again, as long as he 

only does each one once, and they are not second or 

successive even if they appear in petitions 1, 2, 3, 4, 

5, 6, and 7.

 MR. MAZE: That seems to be what the Court 

said in Martinez-Villareal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he'd have to bring 

them all in petition, too. You can't say, you know, 

there are five that weren't reached and bring a separate 

habeas reach for each one of the five. At first habeas, 

you would have to bring all of them, right?

 MR. MAZE: Right. And in the forum -- and 

in the forum rule, number 9 in the instructions, in big, 

bold letters, informs the Petitioner: You have to raise 

every claim, subject to the fact that you will lose it 

if you don't.

 Now, I want to bring up a point on why this 

matters to the State. On page 48 of our red brief, we 

showed you some statistics about the number of claims 

the Petitioners bring, but what we didn't cite -- it's 

on page 51 and 52 of the same study. The study shows 

that after AEDPA, 13 percent of capital habeas petitions 

nationwide -- and if you take Texas out, it's actually 

18 percent -- are granted. 70 percent of capital habeas 

petitions that are granted are granted on penalty phase

claims alone. In Alabama, we looked, and we haven't 

found a conviction-based grant in over a decade, but we 

have had two penalty phases in the last two years.

 So what Mr. Magwood is doing is asking you 

to adopt the rule that, 10 percent of the time, would 

put the State and district courts in the position of 

relitigating an entire capital habeas case. And what we 

showed you was capital habeas proceedings are the 

absolute most time-consuming cases in the district 

courts. And he's wanting you to throw away the abuse of 

the writ doctrine and the successive petition doctrine 

in cases where there was a limited grant in the first 

case. And it -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the whole 

case. I mean, he concedes that the conviction can't be 

challenged. It's just the sentencing aspect.

 MR. MAZE: Right. As the point we have been 

making with Justice Alito, I just don't see where he can 

make that distinction between conviction and sentence. 

And if this Court just comes back and says: New 

judgment means it resurrects, I can assure you that the 

next petitioner will come along and say: I am not 

making the same concession that Mr. Magwood did; 

judgment means conviction and sentence, see Burton. And 

he's going to raise 50 repetitive claims from his

conviction and from his original sentence. And then we 

have the problem that the Federal district courts are 

already dealing with, if the habeas petitions, as we 

showed in the brief -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Wouldn't 

collateral estoppel block the relitigation of all 

sentencing -- resentencing issues that were decided that 

were identical?

 MR. MAZE: No, Justice Sotomayor, and the 

reason is collateral estoppel is a res judicata 

principle that doesn't apply to Federal habeas 

proceedings. That's the reason that the abuse of writ 

doctrine and the successive petition doctrine were 

created. When you go all the way back to Salinger -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case do I 

read that supports that proposition?

 MR. MAZE: Salinger.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I had thought that 

law of the case issue preclusion would apply.

 MR. MAZE: No. The Court has always said 

that res judicata in -- forms, and the case to lack back 

to is all the way back to Salinger. If you remember 

Salinger, he had two habeas petitions. The first one 

raised a claim on which lost. The second petition 

raised exactly the same claim, and he lost again.

And the Federal Government -- the reason he 

lost is because they said it was barred by res judicata, 

in this case claim preclusion. It went up to this Court 

and this Court said res judicata doesn't apply in 

Federal habeas proceedings, so that court is wrong.

 But we understand the problems the courts 

are going to have because there is no res judicata; 

therefore we are creating this abuse of the writ 

doctrine, this equitable doctrine, that will allow the 

courts to deal with the law of collateral estoppel. The 

only thing that Mr. Magwood has been able to cite -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess if res judicata 

applied, you wouldn't bring habeas in the first place on 

an issue that was wrongly decided, right? If it was 

decided res judicata.

 MR. MAZE: Yes. Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so your -- your habeas 

claim would be barred.

 MR. MAZE: Right. And -- and again, a 

further point would be that, you know, Mr. Magwood keeps 

saying that just because he won, this was different. 

But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the old -- the 

former rule of course, was that you could bring writ 

after writ after writ.

No.

 MR. MAZE: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that just -- that 

just incorporated a whole body of law which was very 

much like issue preclusion, was it not?

 MR. MAZE: Yes. No. The courts always said 

it is a modified sort of res judicata, but they are 

different in some respects. You can use it sort of as 

an analogy, but they are different. The Court has said 

res adjudicata doesn't apply; that's why we have to have 

this similar doctrine because without it you could raise 

repetitive claims. It was the whole reason that the 

rule came into existence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens if in the 

first trial, the lawyer thinks, you know, I have two 

claims here; one is mediocre and one is great. And I'm 

not going to win in the court of appeals unless I make 

the great one; just forget about the mediocre. And he 

brings it and he wins. Okay? Now he goes back. Now 

can he make the mediocre one?

Doo. The very first case that this Court ever decided 

under abuse of the writ principles, Wong Doo raised two 

claims, but the second claim he decided wasn't good 

enough. He failed to put on evidence and abandoned it.

the claim itself is that I have did I have fair notice 

in 1978 that I could get the death penalty? The claim 

itself, no, is not meritorious, but of course that's our 

opinion. The Eleventh Circuit hasn't decided that issue 

yet, nor has it decided what has always been our

principle argument: this claim is also procedurally 

defaulted because he didn't fairly present it to the 

State courts. The State courts never had an opportunity 

to decide this fair warning claim -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: The merits of the claims 

have never been decided?

 MR. MAZE: Not -- not by the State courts 

because it wasn't fairly presented to them. The only -­

only court to have even talked about it was the district 

court.

 But again, the Eleventh Circuit hasn't dealt 

with it because second or successive is a jurisdictional 

question, and if the claim is second or successive, then 

it's barred and we simply haven't gotten to it.

 Again, Your Honors, all we are asking you to 

do is uphold the abuse of the write doctrine for the 

same reason the Court adopted it in 1924 all the way 

through AEDPA, and that is we are going to force 

petitioners to raise every claim they could the first 

time, so we prevent the State, the victim's family and 

the Federal court from going through second or third 

rounds of Federal habeas litigation on grounds they 

could have raised the first time.

 If the Court has no further questions I will 

cede my time to the Court.

 Mr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me make two 

points, Your Honor.

 If I leave you with nothing else, think 

about the argument that you just heard that again and 

again talks about abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ, 

abuse of the writ. Well, there is now a statute that 

occupies this field, it's section 2254. And abuse of 

the writ principles apply only if a petition is second 

or successive. So if this Court does nothing else, it 

has to define that term, and we are the only ones who 

have given you a definition of second or successive.

 And Congress made that decision for a 

reason. It thought it was fair to impose strict burdens 

oh relitigation to the extent that the defendant lost. 

But when he wins, and gets a brand-new trial or a 

brand-new sentencing hearing -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to 

Justice -- to the Chief Justice's example to you at the 

very beginning of your argument?

 MR. FISHER: Pardon me?

argument.

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is an order to 

resentence, to reduce a sentence from 10 to 8 years. 

The prior sentence was vacated. There is a new 

proceeding, a new Booker type 35538 proceeding where the 

judge is thinking about everything, and he says I am 

going to reduce it from 10 to 8 years. I am leaving 

everything else the same, because there was no arguments 

about it; there is no anything about it.

 Does your rule then mean that that 

petitioner can come back and say, my fine was wrong, my 

supervised release was wrong, other convictions, other 

sentences that were consecutive or concurrent are wrong?

 MR. FISHER: Probably not. But let me tell 

you, Justice Sotomayor, that question can arise only in 

a Federal situation. It cannot arise under section 2244 

which gets to the other important point I wanted to 

make.

 The State keeps talking about what the 

district court said. Well, when the State -- when this 

case went to the Eleventh Circuit the first time, the 

State made it very clear. It complained, it said the 

district court can't remand this to the State courts, it 

can't micromanage what a State court does.

The Federal court in this case ordered Magwood's release 

from the death penalty unless the defendant -- unless 

the State wanted to elect to have a brandnew sentencing 

proceeding.

 Now, the State elected to do that, 

and had every right to do it. But Magwood also had 

every right to insist on every constitutional protection 

in that circumstance.

 And if I might finish this 

sentence, Mr. Chief Justice, when he -- we agreed if 

that Mr. Magwood had not properly preserved this 

argument the second time around, it would be 

procedurally defaulted. And if the State wants to make 

that argument on remand, it can. But understand that 

the State's argument is asking you to say that a claim 

is barred from Federal habeas even if the defendant 

completely properly raises it the second time around and 

loses it and wants to then bring it to the Federal 

courts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the
