CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-9995, Wood v. Milyard. 

Ms. Lord. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. LORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Tenth Circuit, after finding that 

Mr. Wood's petition presented two substantial 

constitutional claims, denied him habeas relief solely 

on the ground that his petition was untimely. It did 

this even though the State had done three things that 

should have precluded this result: First, the State 

deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations 

defense. 

Second, in doing so, the State acted 

strategically, not inadvertently. 

And, third, in doing so, the State induced 

the district court to expend substantial resources in 

deciding claims of exhaustion and -- and deciding claims 

on the merits. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, we asked for 

two questions presented. The first was: Do court of

appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues? And 

in your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in 

some circumstances. So, are you conceding that that 

power exists or that there is no power whatsoever? 

MS. LORD: I'm proposing a clear line that 

would divide situations in which the court of appeals 

would have power and those in which it absolutely has no 

power. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that a question of 

power or a question of exercise of discretion? 

MS. LORD: I would say it's a question of 

power, and this is why: I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That seems sort of 

strange. Both rely on a factual situation. Either you 

can do something or you can't. That's power. If you 

can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the 

question is, did you do it when you couldn't do it? 

MS. LORD: Well, what I'm proposing is that 

there are situations when it is never a proper exercise 

of the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua 

sponte a statute of limitations defense even in the 

habeas context. And now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's what we 

said in Day, isn't it? 

MS. LORD: Correct, that in Day the Court

said that courts -- "courts" -- it wasn't directed at 

appellate courts, but no court would be free to 

disregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of 

limitations defense. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, all this fight is 

about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not? 

MS. LORD: Well, that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As opposed to power? 

MS. LORD: That's our primary -- our primary 

argument is that there was a deliberate waiver in this 

case, and, given what this Court said in Day, the case 

could be resolved on that narrow ground. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it is -- it is what 

the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this 

is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no, 

it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's 

forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to 

take it up. If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear --

so, it's a question of which box this case fits into: 

Is it forfeiture or is it waiver? And your position is 

it's waiver. 

MS. LORD: That's correct, and my position 

also is that there is an overlap between those boxes and 

that when the statute of limitations defense is 

forfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a

timely manner because of a deliberate choice, I mean --

and in this instance --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there a lot of cases 

raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in 

this case? I mean, if you tell me that's all this case 

is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it 

as improvidently granted. 

MS. LORD: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't sit here to decide 

whether when the government says, you know, we do not 

concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the 

language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions 

like that, that come up in a particular case. 

I thought we took this case to decide the 

more significant issue, on which there is a division in 

the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say, 

power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute 

of limitations defense has not been raised. We all 

agree it wasn't raised. Now, whether it was forfeited 

or not is another question. If that's all you want us 

to decide, I don't want to decide that. 

MS. LORD: Well, I clearly want a decision 

that would favor my client. This --

issues, and certainly this case presents the first 

issue, which is whether a court of appeals, once the 

State has had an opportunity to raise the statute of 

limitations defense and chooses not to, whether the 

court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only the opportunity or 

when it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district 

court for not telling the State, essentially, which we may --

not telling the State that it had a potential statute of 

limitations defense. 

Is it your position that if the State had 

just been silent about the statute of limitations 

defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals 

wouldn't have power? Or is it your position that 

because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise 

it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua 

sponte raise it. 

MS. LORD: Well, both -- the district court 

ordered the State to announce --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my 

question. 

MS. LORD: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the court of 

appeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the 

State -- neither the court or the State addressed the

issue? 

MS. LORD: Probably yes. Probably yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, it 

doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised? Is 

that your position? 

MS. LORD: That's correct. If the stage of 

the proceedings is after it was in Day, because in Day 

when the issue arose under the Rules of Civil Procedure 

and under traditional treatment of statute of 

limitations defense, there was still time for the State 

to announce we -- there was still time for the State to 

change or to raise the statute of limitations defense. 

Here --

JUSTICE ALITO: It sounds to me that what 

you're -- what you're arguing is that the court of 

appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain 

forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the 

court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead 

of a deliberate waiver. Is that what it comes down to? 

MS. LORD: Or a purposeful forfeiture. I 

mean, there are forfeitures by --

JUSTICE ALITO: They put it in the wrong --

they -- they abused their discretion by putting it in 

the wrong box. They didn't put it in the forfeiture 

box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.

MS. LORD: Well, the way the court of 

appeals handled it will create problems if it's approved 

by this Court because --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, this is what -- this 

is what troubles me about your argument that the court 

of appeals abused its discretion. Is it correct that 

you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals' 

lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until 

rehearing? 

MS. LORD: What happened, Your Honor, is 

that we were appointed at the certificate of 

appealability stage, and we were ordered to brief 

timeliness. Perhaps I took the order too literally. I 

briefed timeliness, but I also set out exactly what 

happened, which is in the briefs and which sets forth 

the State's position. 

The court itself raised Day and raised its 

limited authority under Day to consider a statute of 

limitations defense. They found, rather than a 

deliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports, 

that the State's comments were cryptic, and I will 

stress --

JUSTICE ALITO: But you’re -- but you're arguing 

that the court of appeals abused its discretion by 

failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you

didn't make? 

MS. LORD: No. I -- the court was aware of 

Day, and the court analyzed what it was doing under Day, 

and it determined whether there was a deliberate waiver. 

Once the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I 

definitely challenged that finding. I -- there's a very 

strong argument not included within the -- the -- the 

questions presented, that this is a totally timely 

petition. And it's only a -- it's a very difficult 

argument, which is one of the reasons why it shows how 

much the State's actions in the district court were 

strategic. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you had two 

opportunities at least to make the argument based on the 

original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction 

motion. You -- you did not raise that. You were silent 

twice. 

MS. LORD: Silent on the impact of the 19 --

we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion. 

We've always said, and in fact the State has never 

disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the 

only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it 

tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004. 

And the State realized that that issue -- if they were 

to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very

difficult issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then, I'm confused 

because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that 

the question was asked, did you file another 

postconviction motion? Answer: No. 

MS. LORD: I understand your question now. 

When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions, 

and in those pro se motions, he did say that there --

and I'm talking about the 2004 motion -- he said there 

was no prior postconviction motion. 

And I believe he was confused because if you 

look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State 

forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it 

makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on. 

And Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused. And no one 

else was confused once the State entered their 

appearance. They knew that the 1995 motion was still 

pending. All they had to do was sit at a computer and 

bring up the minute orders from the State, and they 

could learn that. 

So, the courts in making their rulings 

always from the time -- and, you know, one of the 

reasons why what happened was so strategic and so clear 

is that the district court had initially dismissed 

Mr. Wood's petition as untimely. And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Lord, could I ask you 

about the first question presented? 

MS. LORD: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: As I understand the opposing 

argument, it goes sort of like this: It says, in Day, 

we said it's fine to do this in the district court. 

Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise 

it on this exact issue. In Granberry, we said with 

respect to a different issue that the appellate court 

could raise it. And, in Day, we said that those two 

issues were really the same. 

So, that seems sort of like a logical 

argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on 

the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference 

between a court raising a question sua sponte and a 

court allowing a party to raise it later than the party 

ought to have raised it. Are you relying on that 

distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the 

basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this? 

MS. LORD: Both. And with respect to the 

first argument about there being a difference between a 

party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising 

the issue, there is a difference. And the courts -- the 

circuit courts do not always make that distinction and 

do not always focus on that. For example, in Granberry,

it actually was a case where the party presented -- the 

State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the 

court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't 

raised it below. 

Here, you know, at least five times in our 

joint appendix, you'll see the court saying that they 

can't act as an advocate for Petitioner. And in, 

fact, when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an 

-- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its 

certificate of appealability said he is bound by his 

decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims, 

notwithstanding his pro se status. And in the same 

breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least 

concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on 

behalf of the State. 

But I'd also like to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little confused. 

You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals 

raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a 

party raising it first. Is that your position? That 

that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a 

party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries 

to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they 

didn't assert below? Now the court of appeals has more 

power?

MS. LORD: It raises different concerns. My 

concern is not the relative power. It's that when a 

court is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the 

party presentation principle. That's one concern. 

When the court is -- when the party raises 

it after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that 

they wouldn't be allowed to. So, in essence, what 

happens is the court is acting as a super-advocate 

for --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those arguments were 

rejected in Granberry and Day. 

MS. LORD: Well, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should they win now? 

MS. LORD: Well, and that was -- I was going 

to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, 

which is there's something really different going on in 

Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come 

up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the 

State. 

And, in Granberry, of course, as the Court 

all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it 

was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of 

habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when 

dismissing a case to exhaust claims -- all that would do 

is delay Federal relief. It wouldn't eliminate Federal

relief. 

And this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes 

that when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the 

landscape, and it really made some changes. And whether 

the -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be 

raised for the first time on appeal transfers to the 

statute of limitations -- I think there's real doubt 

about that, and I think that goes to an important 

question and the question that the Court granted cert 

on. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But didn't Day say that 

those two issues were functionally identical for this 

purpose? 

MS. LORD: Not for this purpose. And by 

"this purpose" I mean the court of appeals' authority to 

raise sua sponte the defense. In Day, this Court --

there were two prongs to Day. In the context of Day, 

which was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5 

response and patently erroneously calculated the -- the 

limitations period, and the court noticed it, and 

there's no law that required, as this Court held, the 

court to muzzle itself and not mention you've 

miscalculated these days. 

We're in a totally different situation. And 

the Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in

Day. They don't allow what happened in our case. 

And --

JUSTICE ALITO: What Rule of Civil Procedure 

applies here? You're talking about appellate procedure 

here. Is there a rule of appellate procedure that 

governs this? 

MS. LORD: I'm referring to Civil Rule of 

Procedure 8(b) and 12. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they refer to what 

happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that. 

Now you're in the court of appeals. What rule is there 

that addresses the situation in the court of appeals? 

MS. LORD: Well, there's the traditional 

rule that if you don't raise it, you lose it, when we're 

talking about a statute of limitations defense. And 

it's really key here because when AEDPA engrafted this 

1-year statute of limitations into the habeas 

proceedings, it knew how 1-year statute of limitations 

were treated. And, yes, in Day, quite correctly the 

Court held that in that context you're going to treat 

those defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule 

4, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just 

on its face. 

JUSTICE ALITO: You made an argument in your 

brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --

so, maybe you can explain it. You seemed to suggest 

that the State's position on timeliness in the district 

court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims 

that were arguably not exhausted. And I found it 

difficult to understand why the -- why your client's 

strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims 

or not would be affected by the State's position on 

timeliness. 

MS. LORD: Well, if the State had challenged 

timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it 

would, it would have created a real complicated issue on 

abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how 

complicated that is under Colorado law. And if that had 

happened, the court very well could have, district 

court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood, I 

mean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as 

the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that 

counsel was necessary. 

So, once you had counsel, in the State's 

reply or in its answer, they indicated that several of 

Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted. And some of those 

claims were in that 1995 motion that was pending. With 

counsel, there could have been a request for a stay and 

abey. There could have been so much that was done. 

Mr. -- but because the State chose to simplify the

proceedings -- that's what they did, and it was not 

inadvertent; and it wasn't a mistake. They chose to make it 

simple and to focus on exhaustion. So, they got four 

claims dismissed on exhaustion grounds, and then they 

dealt with the other two claims on the merits. 

They also had a procedural default issue 

which was totally unconstitutional. They were relying 

on a procedural default that didn't exist at the time 

you had to raise it. 

But that simplified the proceedings, made it 

more a question of law. Mr. --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's wrong with 

that? Why should we be penalizing the State for trying 

to simplify an action and make it move more 

expeditiously? 

MS. LORD: Absolutely we should not. But we 

also should hold them to that strategic choice, which is 

what Day says you do. And we have to hold them to that 

choice because there were consequences, and there were 

changes of positions. And they got the benefit of going 

forward and just looking at exhaustion. They eliminated 

the risk of an evidentiary hearing. They eliminated the 

risk of a lawyer. They induced Mr. -- and I -- they 

induced Mr. Wood to dismiss four claims because -- oh, 

sorry. Because -- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Keep going 
with your --

MS. LORD: No -- because he was assured that 
he could go forward on two substantial constitutional 
claims without worrying about time bar, because the 
State said that. They said twice we are not 
challenging, we will not challenge, timeliness. 

JUSTICE ALITO: That's what I don't 
understand. I -- why -- you have two situations. One 
situation, the State's raising timeliness. So, he says, 
okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to 
dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not 
exhausted. The other situation, they -- they don't say 
anything about timeliness. And he said now I'm going to 
dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are 
unexhausted. 

I don't understand the connection. 
MS. LORD: Well, the connection is the State 

guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness, and 
that allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two 
constitutional claims without ever having to worry that 
they would be subject to time bar. 

And when the court --
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I understand why that's 

a benefit to him, but what is the connection between 
that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?

MS. LORD: Oh. Because if they had -- if 

they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised 

this very complicated issue, because the only way they 

can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled 

notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under 

Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual 

development. 

And once they pursued in the district court 

that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a 

lawyer would be appointed. That lawyer could see that 

there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and 

could possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have 

gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious 

constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion. 

And -- and maybe a better way of putting it 

is if they had raised timeliness in the district court, 

abandonment would have been front and center. And even 

though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this 

issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse 

of discretion itself, too. It was totally contrary to 

Colorado law, analyzing that issue. 

It is no small thing that the position that 

they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go 

forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that 

are substantial that the court has granted a certificate

of appealability on. 

This is -- this case is so unlike Day in the 

sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the 

statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise 

it in any case. It invites the State to take a position 

in the district court which would be totally contrary to 

AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings. It would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Lord, an amicus brief 

filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil --

the Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be 

consulted here, because they govern only to the extent 

that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and 

asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply 

and that they -- that they cut against your case. 

Do you have a response to that? Was it --

was it in your reply brief or --

MS. LORD: It may be. I believe in some of 

the briefs what I've said is there is no inconsistency 

between Rule 5's requirement that the defense be set 

forth and the traditional recognition that statute of 

limitations is lost if not raised. And I cited the 

Court to Jones v. Bock, which stresses that, for mere 

policy reasons, we shouldn't deviate from the rules that 

would otherwise apply. And I think --

that the -- that a district court performs in the habeas 

case inconsistent with the traditional rule about 

raising affirmative defenses? 

MS. LORD: Well, that's the district court, 

and that's one of the key differences between the 

district court and the appellate court. The appellate 

court can issue a certificate of appealability. The 

district court has that prescreening function, which is 

just like the prescreening function in the PLRA, where 

this Court looked at a circuit's attempt to create rules 

that would address policy concerns and deviated and put 

an enhanced pleading requirement on prisoners and said, 

I believe unanimously, that that shouldn't be done. 

There's a real virtue in having a 

predictable rule. There's a real virtue in letting the 

States or -- letting the States know in the context of 

this Court's Federal timing rules that they have to 

raise it, the statute of limitations defense, when 

they're ordered to and when Rule 5 requires them to. 

You should not adopt the State's position 

when it will just invite the sort of sandbagging that 

this Court has taken care to avoid. You don't want 

straddling by the State on something as important to 

judicial efficiency as asserting the statute of 

limitations in a timely manner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. DOMENICO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In contrast to the new and fairly 

complicated set of doctrines my friend asked the Court 

to adopt today, this Court can resolve this case by 

applying two straightforward longstanding rules. 

First, in Granberry v. Greer, the Court 

recognized that courts are not bound by a State's 

failure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar 

to a habeas claim. 

And, second, to the extent there is an 

exception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the Court 

should apply the common rule that a waiver must be 

unequivocal. 

By applying --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where --

MR. DOMENICO: Please. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Where? What's the case 

that supports you the most on that?

question? Well, that's a common rule. From 

statutory rights such as in Olano --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, just give me a citation. 

MR. DOMENICO: College Savings Bank is one, 

probably the clearest case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Has to -- has to be what? 

What's the word? "Unequivocal"? 

MR. DOMENICO: Unequivocal is a common --

for waiver of everything --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because I'll look at the statute. 

Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's 

Law Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it 

seems like you lose. 

My analysis would be this: Forfeiture is 

the "loss of a right" -- that's what's at issue --

"because of a crime." That doesn't apply. "Because of 

a breach of obligation." That doesn't apply. "Neglect 

of duty." Now, that does because you didn't file the 

answer. Okay? So, that's forfeited. 

Now you look over to waiver and, as you say, 

it says "voluntary relinquishment of a legal right." 

Okay, what's the legal right? The legal right is to get 

the case dismissed. 

So, I'm the judge. I say, State, do you 

want to get the case dismissed? I just gave your

answer. Okay. I say you voluntarily relinquish your 

legal right. Your legal right was to get the case 

dismissed, and you relinquished it. You didn't assert 

it. 

That said, that would be the difference. 

And she's saying that. She's saying that makes a lot of 

sense. When you read Day, they're worried about the 

State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake. 

So, what the judge says is: State, you know you have a 

pretty good claim here on statute of limitations, 

but you didn't assert it. So, I'm going to give you the 

right to assert it. Go ahead, assert it even though 

it's late. You overcome the forfeiture. 

Now you say: I assert it, Your Honor. 

Okay, you haven't waived it. Now you say: I don't 

really care. 

MR. DOMENICO: Justice Breyer, what the 

State was doing here was not strategically trying to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. I assume they 

didn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick. 

It was just what is it that they did? And what they did 

is they were given the opportunity to overcome the 

forfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim, 

and they didn't do it. They didn't want to do it. I 

don't know why they didn't want to do it, because there

was a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah, 

dah. But that's their business. The fact is they 

didn't do it. 

MR. DOMENICO: Justice Breyer, the -- the 

Court has been clear that a State's failure -- normally, 

that's true. The normal rule under the Rules of Civil 

Procedure is a forfeiture of that sort, failure to raise 

an argument, is deemed essentially to be a waiver under 

those definitions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this wasn't failure 

to raise an argument; this was representing to the court 

we will not challenge timeliness. That was the 

representation made to the court. That was not 

negligent oversight in not raising the question. It was 

an affirmative representation to the court that, 

although we might have done it, we will not challenge 

timeliness. 

MR. DOMENICO: Justice Ginsburg, there --

there was an element of mistake, of negligence, as you 

say, but -- but it also was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't the State adhere to 

that? 

MR. DOMENICO: That's right, Justice Scalia.

MR. DOMENICO: What the State was trying to 

do, I think, is slightly different than would make sense 

in any other context. Because of the special procedures 

we're under in a habeas -- a pre-answer response, what 

we were telling the court was we will not assert this 

argument unless there's further inquiry from the court. 

Now, normally in court there would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait, wait. When you 

say "further," I want to be very precise about the 

distinction. You have to put it in your answer. You 

didn't. Okay. So, that's a forfeiture. So, now the 

judge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll 

raise it. So, now you have the right to have the case 

dismissed for statute of limitations. Do you want to 

exercise that right? The answer to that question was 

you didn't. 

MR. DOMENICO: That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: You said you didn't care. 

MR. DOMENICO: That's -- I don't think 

that's quite an accurate characterization of what the 

State --

authorities for your -- you know, the supporting --

MR. DOMENICO: Well, the Black's Law 

Dictionary, of course, applies a usual rule. This Court 

has made clear in Granberry and Day that the usual rule 

that a forfeiture of a legal right means that it's not 

to be brought up again, that it doesn't apply to bind 

the court's hands. Granberry and Day make that quite 

clear. What happened in Granberry would have been a 

forfeiture --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Domenico, you're 

saying something considerably more. You're saying that 

when a State gets up -- after inquiry by the district 

court, when a State gets up and says we do not want to 

press this argument; now we're not saying the 

argument is wrong, because after all we're a repeat 

player and we're going to hear that argument again, and 

we are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this 

case we do not want to press that argument. That's --

that's unequivocal to me. 

MR. DOMENICO: It's unequivocal that we were 

not going to press it again, though I think the 

implication -- there would have been no reason to have 

raised it initially. There would have been no reason to 

include this caveat about refusing to concede, if that 

was all we were trying to say. There are easy ways for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I ask you, 

do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in 

your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment 

of a known right? I think you're equating intentional 

abandonment of a known right to be I have to admit I 

could win and I'm giving up that argument. 

MR. DOMENICO: Well, in this case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what you're 

saying -- deliberate? 

MR. DOMENICO: Well, you have to know what 

it is you're giving up. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you knew you had a 

defense under the statute of limitations. 

MR. DOMENICO: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You thought, because you 

conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was 

untimely. So, you were conceding you thought it was 

untimely, and despite admitting that you knew you had a 

defense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing 

not to assert it. So, tell me why that's not either an 

intentional waiver, a deliberate waiver, or an 

abandonment of a known right?

district court, unless asked, to argue the issue. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this 

example of -- of a regular civil case: There -- there 

are two defendants and the same claim against two 

defendants. One defendant files an answer and raises a 

statute of limitations defense; the other one doesn't. 

The judge asks the second defendant, are you going to 

amend your complaint? And the defendant says no. Now, 

is that a waiver or is that a forfeiture? 

MR. DOMENICO: Well, I think in your typical 

case, it doesn't matter because forfeitures generally 

are deemed to be waivers, I think, in your typical case. 

That's not true under Granberry and Day. The court has 

made clear that a forfeiture is different than a 

deliberate waiver. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under the terminology 

that we're using, wouldn't that be a forfeiture? 

MR. DOMENICO: I think it's better 

understood as a forfeiture. Simply you're not going to 

argue the issue, but the issue doesn't necessarily need 

to be taken off the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why your 

colleague on the other side -- why she made this point 

the way she made it. I think there's no disagreement,

abandon his right, the State, to push the matter. 

That's abandonment. He didn't abandon the right to get 

the case dismissed if the judge pursues it. 

So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a 

court of appeals does have the power on its own to 

overcome a forfeiture. That's Day. But they don't have 

the power on its own to overcome the waiver. And that's 

what they're doing. They don't have the power, in other 

words, to decide it themselves. They only have the 

power to overcome a forfeiture. 

MR. DOMENICO: Well, if the Court looks at 

the -- where this deliberate waiver exception to the 

Granberry and Day rule comes from, it comes from Day, 

and the concern there is with a court overriding a 

State's decision to waive, to take the issue off the 

table. There are examples of States doing that. And 

when they do it, they are clear about it, and you can 

tell when it would be overridden. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the consequence of 

that was the district court then had to deal with the 

case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted 

claims and rule on them, after having told the district 

court you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of 

limitations, we will not challenge timeliness. So, you

case on the merits. It does. It takes up the two 

unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits. 

In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired 

between the State saying the claim was timely and the 

magistrate's detection of the computation error. The 

district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work. 

If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't 

challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with 

them on the merits. 

In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the 

question because counsel thought that it was timely. He 

had miscalculated and made a mathematical error. And 

the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of 

days that's required by statute, they have run. And as 

Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could 

have said: Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't 

you like to amend your complaint and put it in a 

defense? 

So, the two cases, the two situations are --

are so different. The district judge wasn't -- nobody 

was made to do anything extra. But in -- here, because 

the attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had 

to deal with the case on the merits.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Those are sunk costs,

have to repeat the district court's excursus into the

if -- if Mr. Wood prevails now, the court of appeals

merits. Instead, in this case, they applied the very 

common principle that a court of appeals will affirm for 

any basis supported by the record in order precisely to 

avoid -- that happens fairly often. They avoid having 

to address a constitutional problem. They save having 

to engage in those efforts again.

appeals was certainly under no obligation to do this. 

Had the court of appeals refused to do it, we wouldn't 

be here demanding that they be forced to consider this 

issue.

could have gotten mad at the fact that the district

MR. DOMENICO: Well, it didn't get mad 

partly, I think, perhaps because Mr. Wood never argued 

that the issue was forfeited or waived at all until 

after -- after the court of appeals had already resolved 

the question. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why do you say that 

the position that the State took in the district court 

prevented the district court from considering the 

timeliness issue? If it wasn't a deliberate waiver, 

then the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from 

-- from deciding the case untimely.

it. The only reason for us to have raised this sort of 

skeletal outline of the argument was precisely so the 

court of appeals would have the opportunity to consider 

it. 

Remember, this was raised initially in the 

pre-answer response stage where the -- which is 

specifically part of the district court's preliminary 

consideration of the issue. So, it was certainly ex 

ante quite possible that the response of the district 

court would not be to simply ignore the issue as it did 

but to either ask for additional briefing, as happens 

with some regularity, to issue a show-cause order as it 

had already done, or perhaps to dismiss the case again 

as it had already done so. 

So, the issue was not off the table. The 

district court very much could have addressed the 

question. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Domenico, do I 

understand your argument correctly to think that if you 

had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not 

said we're not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the 

State had said is we're not challenging this, Your 

Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under 

Day? 

MR. DOMENICO: I think that's a harder case.

The lead-up to that, I think, undermines the -- at 

least, the unequivocal nature of -- of that statement 

because there would have been no reason to have laid out 

the potential argument if what we were really trying to 

do was waive the -- waive the entire issue as Day uses 

that language. If that's what we were trying to do, 

there would have been no reason to do that either. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The new --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But this is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. The new case 

law is what I said. When you say I won't raise this 

defense, I waive it, everything you said except saying I 

don't admit it, today, before a circuit court abuses its 

discretion, you also have to say I am waiving the right 

of the court of appeals to raise this sua sponte. 

That's -- that's -- you want that to be what you need to 

do for us to find a waiver. 

MR. DOMENICO: I don't think you need to say 

that. I don't think there necessarily need to be any 

magic words at all, but it needs to be unequivocal and 

clear, not ambiguous language that we're going to spend 

an hour here today trying to debate what it was that we 

meant. That's the only rule we're asking for today. 

And the contrary rule really provides some 

perverse incentives to States. I mean, here the State

was trying to be candid with the court. It discovered 

this 1995 motion on its own. Mr. Wood had never 

mentioned it in his filings. He had already briefed the 

timeliness issue twice in the district court without 

mentioning it, let alone raising it in any of his 

petitions. 

The State found this and tried to be candid, 

that we weren't entirely clear about how the argument 

played out. The alternative is that States will be 

forced into something more than scorched earth, throw 

everything at the court, see what sticks, and that's not 

in anybody's interest, let alone the Federal courts' or 

habeas petitioners'. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is something about 

the principle of party presentation. The party raises 

the issue. The court of appeals is the court of review, 

not first view. Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did 

not know that he had a statute of limitations defense, 

that -- did not know because he had miscalculated the 

time. Here the State knew very well that it did have a 

statute of limitations argument, but it says we're not 

challenging it. 

And then the ordinary thing is that a court 

of appeals reviews decisions of the district court; 

doesn't decide questions in the first instance. But

here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge 

don't decide this; go on to the merits. Then the court 

of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the 

district court does, instead deals with that question in 

the first instance. That seems like an odd inversion of 

the role of the -- of the district court and court of 

appeals. 

MR. DOMENICO: Justice Ginsburg, again, I 

don't think it's quite accurate to say that we told the 

district court not to address the issue. We told the 

district court there was an issue that we were going to 

refrain from presenting our full argument on it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't say we're 

going to refrain from it. You said, District Judge, 

Your Honor, we will not challenge timeliness. 

MR. DOMENICO: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't have any 

qualifications. 

MR. DOMENICO: Well, I -- I do think we 

qualified it. The only reason to include the language 

about not conceding was to qualify that. The only 

reason to lay out the argument was to make sure that the 

court was able to consider it in its screening 

procedures and --

language really going to a different point? The

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

This Court's decisions in Granberry and Day 

answer the first question presented. I think Petitioner

no longer contests that, and the Court can simply 

decide the first question presented on that basis and 

reaffirm what it said in Granberry. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sherry, there is one 

difference. If you put Granberry and Day together, it 

gets you most of the way there. The one difference is 

that here there was a sua sponte decision by the court; 

whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day, 

it was a party that raised it, although the party raised 

it late. 

So, why should that difference not matter? 

If you think that party presentation has some 

consequence in this area, you might think that that 

difference does matter, that once you get to the court 

of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it, 

sort of enough is enough. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: A couple of responses to 

that. Number one, I think it's significant that Day 

itself was a case in which the court raised it. It 

raised it on its own. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But at the trial court 

level. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: At the trial level. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Of course, the habeas court 

has a significant screening function.

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, that's certainly 

true. I think the procedural default cases are another 

good example. This Court in Day cited a number of them, 

a number of them of which were cases in which the court 

of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte. 

On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of 

procedural default cases. A lot of them come up in the 

sua sponte context. And the courts of appeals have not 

made a distinction between the two. 

I think they certainly implicate different 

concerns. For example, to the extent this Court has 

been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I 

think that's largely absent in circumstances where the 

court is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the 

party belatedly raising the issue on appeal. 

So, I do think if you look at Granberry, you 

look at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro, 

and you look at the procedural default cases, I think 

that really does resolve the first question presented. 

And, again, I don't think Petitioner really argues 

otherwise at this point. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I may have forgotten 

the procedural complications of this case, but here, did 

the State have any opportunity before the court of 

appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time

when the court of appeals issued its certificate of 

appealability? And if the court of appeals had not 

issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of 

timeliness, would the issue have come up at all? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: The State did have an 

opportunity in the court of appeals because, after the 

application for a certificate of appealability was 

filed, the court did order the State to file a response, 

and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response. 

But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on 

this issue in the certificate of appealability process, 

the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond 

there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely, 

and it strongly argued that. 

And so, I guess, turning to the second 

question presented, of deliberate waiver, I don't think 

there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day 

spoke about that term here for two primary reasons. 

Number one, when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it 

spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I 

think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the 

timeliness question, there's no way to look at that as 

the State -- as a court, rather, actually overriding the 

State's deliberate waiver. At that point, the State had 

argued that the petition was untimely.

Petitioner never argued that the court 

shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that --

that the State had waived that issue below. And I think 

at that time, it's really difficult to characterize that 

as overriding the State's deliberate waiver. 

The other point I would make is in the 

district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the difference is 

that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of 

limitations defense. So -- but the court suggested it. 

In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the 

attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a 

statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the 

court we won't challenge timeliness. 

It seems a big difference between the 

factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know 

there was a statute of limitations defense, and this 

one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and 

decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal 

with that issue. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I -- I think that 

certainly is true, but I think it's important, in 

deciding whether or not this should be treated as a 

deliberate waiver, to look at what the consequences of 

treating it as such would be. The consequences of

treating it as a deliberate waiver under the language of 

Day is that the court's hands would be bound; the court 

would be unable to decide the timeliness question. And 

it's not just the court of appeals; it's the district 

court as well. So, if this were a clear deliberate 

waiver in district court when the State filed its 

pre-answer response, the district court would have been 

without any authority to consider --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, why is that -- why is 

that a bad result? The -- I -- imagine the facts are 

these: The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise 

the issue in the defense. All right? Forgets. 

Judge: State you haven't raised a statute 

of limitations. 

State -- one possible answer -- thank you, 

Your Honor. We overlooked our forfeiture. We want to 

raise it. 

That's one. 

Number two: They say we don't care. 

Number three: We don't want to. Okay? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, in two and three, you 

can say this: You could say the reason that we depart 

from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it 

in your defense is we're trying to protect the State

because of habeas. So, we protect the State at least by 

giving them a chance to make the argument when they 

forget or some other reason. Now we gave them the 

chance. Now they say: Huh? Who cares? 

All right? If that's their attitude, why is 

it the habeas court's business to protect the State from 

themselves? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Because it's not just 

about the State. Because it's -- because of the 

institutional interests that are at stake. And that's 

why Granberry and Schiro and Caspari and Day allowed 

there to be consideration of these issues despite 

forfeiture. It's because of the institutional 

interest --

JUSTICE BREYER: Despite forfeiture? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Despite forfeiture. 

Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And --

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and that's the 

very question here, whether it should be treated like 

forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver. 

And the reason why I think it would be a bad result to 

treat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have 

bound the district court's hands in this case, if you 

look at what happened here, the district court on its

own motion initially dismissed this as untimely. It 

came back and it went to the State and said, you know, I 

need more information. And the State provided that 

additional information. 

It would be a somewhat odd system for --

when the district court now had this information in 

front of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not 

to have been able to do anything further with respect to 

timeliness on -- on that point. The fact that the State 

for whatever reason decided to press other issues 

shouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the 

rarest of circumstances. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Except we have a system 

where the court doesn't raise issue on its own. The 

ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the 

party says to the court we will not challenge 

timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different 

thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the 

defense. It's affirmatively representing to the court 

that we -- we are not making this an issue. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and to be clear, I 

think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and 

do consider in deciding whether to exercise their 

discretion to consider a timeliness issue. The question 

here is whether or not the court should lose any

discretion to consider that issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Day did say that 

if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense, 

then no court can bring it up. The party has made the 

choice. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: That's -- that's what 

this Court said in Day, and I guess the question is --

is how strictly that should be construed. And our 

position would be that it should be strictly construed 

because of the consequences of that waiver. And, again, 

I think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk 

about overriding a State's deliberate waiver. 

In the dissent, Justice Scalia, you 

mentioned the example of a court amending a party's 

pleading over that party's objections. And I think that 

really is a narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule 

should operate. 

It's not that the State's behavior is 

irrelevant to the question before the court as to 

whether the court should exercise its discretion; it's 

actually quite relevant, and it's something that courts 

of appeals can and do look at. The question is whether 

or not the courts lack any authority to consider a 

limitations defense or other procedural defense --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be an abuse 

of discretion for the court not to accept a valid, 

evident statute of limitations defense on the ground 

that the State didn't raise it? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think under Day -- the 

question is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I 

think, under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it 

would be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances. 

And I think there are a limited number of circumstances 

where -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court 

has seen examples of that recently this term, for 

example. 

The Court denied cert in a case, Buck v. 

Thaler, earlier this term, where -- a predecessor case 

that is an example of the State expressly waiving a 

procedural default defense because it wanted the court 

to reach the merits. In that case, the State said quite 

plainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say, the 

State said quite plainly because the use of race in the 

punishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. LORD: The problems with the rulings 

urged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold. 

One, it's not contemplated at all by AEDPA that the 

1-year Federal timing statute of limitations would be 

subject to such a wide latitude in the court of appeals 

to resurrect defenses. 

JUSTICE ALITO: If a State knows that it has 

a potential statute of limitations defense and says 

nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver? 

MS. LORD: It would be a violation of 

Rule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they 

are required to file a response. In our case, it also 

would have been a violation of the court's order. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So, simply saying nothing 

can be a waiver, in your view.

JUSTICE ALITO: If the answer to that is 

not, then what is the difference between saying nothing, 

knowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not 

challenging but we're not conceding? 

What is the difference? 

MS. LORD: Well, by not conceding, that 

doesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver. It 

actually establishes it. It establishes that they know 

that there's a defense, and they're not agreeing that 

the petition is timely, but they're deliberately 

choosing not to assert the statute of limitations. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me just ask it one 

more way, and then I'll --

MS. LORD: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Back in the office, they're

considering what they're going to do. And they say, 

well, what we're going to do is we're not going to 

challenge it, but we're not going to concede it. And, 

therefore, they say nothing. 

MS. LORD: In the face of Rule 5's 

requirement, it could very well be a waiver. And I'd 

cite the court to Hill v. New York, which also addresses 

one of the State's lawyers' points, which was a

waiver -- for the State to waive a statute of 

limitations defense, its waiver has to be unequivocal 

and clear. I don't know if they're suggesting that 

there also has to be an advisement by the court. I 

don't think they're going that far. 

But the fact is, you look at the nature of 

the waiver or the right being waived. And this Court 

recognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if 

the right being waived is, for example, the right to be 

tried in a timely fashion under IAD, it can be waived 

just by a lawyer accepting a date. 

And the statute of limitations issue here is 

a typical strategic decision. And when AEDPA brought 

this in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity. 

It is something to move the case along from the Federal 

point of view. And for this Court to adopt what --
