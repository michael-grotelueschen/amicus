3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 10-444, Missouri v. Frye.

 General Koster. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRIS KOSTER 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. KOSTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 But for counsel's error, defendant would 

11 have insisted on going to trial. That is the test for 

12 prejudice. But in Mr. Frye's case, that test was not 

13 met. The truth is, despite counsel's error, Mr. Frye 

14 knowingly waived his right to trial and solemnly 

admitted his guilt. Under both Hill and Premo, Mr. Frye 

16 has failed to show prejudice, and therefore his guilty 

17 plea remains voluntary, intelligent, and final. 

18  Mr. Frye may not assert ineffective 

19 assistance by alleging that, but for counsel's error, he 

could have gotten a better deal on an earlier date. 

21 That is not the standard. And the court of appeals 

22 should be reversed. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, sometimes one's 

24 experience has to be challenged. I, for one, have never 

heard of a case in which parties are discussing a plea,

1 except in the most unusual of circumstances, and they 

2 advance a court date to enter the plea. In most cases, 

3 they just wait till the court date and tell the judge: 

4 I'm ready to plead guilty.

 This is such an unusual case, because the 

6 plea happens on day one. The court below is assuming 

7 that between day one and day five, or three or four, the 

8 guy would have come in and pled guilty, would have 

9 advanced the later court date?

 MR. KOSTER: Well, the plea -- the plea 

11 occurred on March 3rd, 2008 --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that's the second 

13 plea, but --

14  MR. KOSTER: It went -- the -- right. The 

plea offer --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about the 

17 plea deal. 

18  MR. KOSTER: The plea offer expired on 

19 December 28th, 2007, I believe, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He commits the crime on 

21 the 29th or the 30th -- he commits a second offense on 

22 the 29th or 30th? 

23  MR. KOSTER: That actually was a fifth 

24 offense, but yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. My point is,

1 how reasonable could it be for the -- for a court to 

2 assume that the plea offer had been made and that he 

3 would have taken it before the January court date that 

4 was set?

 MR. KOSTER: It would be less than likely, 

6 but not impossible, I would say. And it would depend on 

7 a myriad of circumstances, many of which are as -- as --

8 could be just dependent on the defense counsel's own 

9 personal schedule.

 But the scheduling of a plea once -- once an 

11 agreement has been made between a prosecutor and a 

12 defense counsel, the scheduling of a plea I think is 

13 largely a basis of convenience and does not 

14 necessarily -- is not necessarily based on the 

preliminary hearing date or any future scheduled date. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the 

17 defendant might think, you know, there is really bad 

18 evidence out there that they don't have yet. And if 

19 I -- I want to nail this deal down as soon as possible. 

I mean, that would be a reason to -- to move things up 

21 and get the plea in early, wouldn't it? 

22  MR. KOSTER: It could be. I would say that 

23 that is --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, I don't know 

how often that happens.

1  MR. KOSTER: That's possible. I don't --

2 right. But it's also exactly another reason to keep the 

3 discretion of offering these plea bargains and the 

4 ability to take these plea bargains back solely in the 

hands of the prosecutors of the country. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: I'm really puzzled by what 

7 as a practical matter is at stake in this case. Under 

8 the State court decision, the defendant has the option 

9 of either pleading guilty to the charge, in which case 

he will be right back where he is now, or he can insist 

11 on a trial. 

12  And if he insists on a trial, you need to 

13 prove that he was driving with a revoked license. That 

14 seems to me -- if there ever was a slam-dunk trial, that 

seems to me that's the slam-dunk trial. You introduce 

16 the records of -- showing that his license was revoked, 

17 and you have the officer testify on such and such a date 

18 he was driving. So, I don't really see what is involved 

19 in this case.

 MR. KOSTER: The last part of the question 

21 was? 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: I don't see what is at stake 

23 here. I don't see what that -- as a practical matter, 

24 this seems to be -- to me to be a case about nothing.

 Am I wrong? Am I missing something?

1  MR. KOSTER: As a former -- as a former
 

2 prosecutor myself, I would agree with this. This
 

3 gentleman went into court. He had two options before
 

4 him. There was not a third option. The -- the plea
 

that was -- that left reality on December 28th was not 

6 there on March 3rd. He had a binary choice between two 

7 options on March 3rd. He chose not trial. By choosing 

8 not trial, it leaves us without a situation where either 

9 Hill or Premo prejudice can be shown.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we take the case on 

11 the assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier 

12 better offer. Am I wrong about that? 

13  MR. KOSTER: In this case, the defendant was 

14 unaware of the earlier better offer. That is correct. 

But in this case also, the defendant went out 2 days 

16 later and picked up a fifth charge. So, one of the 

17 considerations that I think has to be left with the 

18 Court is that the possibility that this particular 

19 defendant was ever going to see this plea offer is 

almost nil. This was his fifth arrest for driving while 

21 revoked. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, aren't we taking 

23 this on -- isn't there an assumption that there's a 

24 finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that 

if he had known about the better deal that was offered, 

7

1 he would have taken it? 

2  MR. KOSTER: That -- what is in the record 

3 is that he would have taken the 90-day deal on the 

4 misdemeanor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

6  MR. KOSTER: But there is also an important 

7 element in the record, that when he went in front of the 

8 court on March 3rd and the felony offer was given to the 

9 judge, which was 3 years and defer on probation plus 10 

days' shock time, the judge in Columbia, Missouri, gave 

11 the felony offer the back of his hand. 

12  And so, while, yes, the record says that --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then that's a causal 

14 problem. You're saying that, even if he had accepted 

it, it would have gone to the judge, and the judge would 

16 have turned it down anyway. The judge wouldn't have 

17 accepted it. 

18  MR. KOSTER: If the judge --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that your point?

 MR. KOSTER: Yes, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then there's a --

22 somebody must have found somewhere that this made a 

23 difference. 

24  MR. KOSTER: That --

JUSTICE BREYER: That the failure to tell 

8

Official 

1 him about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in 

2 fact make a difference because he would have accepted it 

3 and he would have ended up with it. 

4  MR. KOSTER: Well, and that is the problem 

that brings us here today. The Missouri Court of
 

6 Appeals said that --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
 

8  MR. KOSTER: -- through a -- a
 

9 misinterpretation, we believe, of the Strickland
 

standard and, more importantly, a misreading of where 

11 Hill and Premo takes us. Cert was granted on this case 

12 just at the same time that Premo was very clearly 

13 re-articulating the Hill standard. 

14  And so, the court of appeals had gone back 

towards Strickland with a very broad reading just as 

16 this Court was coming down with an opinion that very 

17 clearly re-articulated the Hill standard, the two-part 

18 performance and prejudice test. 

19  And that's what we are asking be reversed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose he had snapped up 

21 this deal as soon as it was offered. By the time he 

22 appeared before the court to answer a formal plea of 

23 guilty, would the court have known that he had in the 

24 interim been arrested yet again for driving without a 

license?

Official 

1  MR. KOSTER: The court probably would have 

2 known as a result of a pre-sentence investigation. And 

3 perhaps more importantly, Your Honor, the prosecutor 

4 himself would have known about the -- the second arrest, 

and he would have withdrawn it. 

6  And if I may, it's not always -- we've 

7 concentrated so far in the case before and today on 

8 subsequent criminal actions. You know, back home in 

9 Missouri, the criminal reporting system, we still use on 

five-part carbon paper that you've got to press hard 

11 with a pen to get down to the fifth page. It is also 

12 possible that the prosecutor learns at a subsequent date 

13 of a criminal history that is -- that is material that 

14 predates the plea offer. And so, in both directions, 

it's important that prosecutors have full discretion to 

16 take these pleas back. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, regardless, your 

18 legal position is that there is no basis for setting 

19 aside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not 

communicated. 

21  That's your legal position, right? 

22  MR. KOSTER: My legal position is that a 

23 finding -- a conviction was entered on March 3rd. He 

24 pled guilty. The question before the Court is, what 

satisfies a standard by which we are going to unwind it?

1 A Sixth Amendment violation would satisfy that standard, 

2 and if -- if there was a Sixth Amendment violation, if 

3 the plea was truly involuntary, we would unwind it. 

4  But the search for a better deal that is 

antecedent to the events of March 3rd is not the Sixth 

6 Amendment violation that should begin unwinding --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say -- you say 

8 there's --

9  MR. KOSTER: -- 97 percent of the 

convictions in the country. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- no Sixth Amendment 

12 violation when the counsel fails to communicate a 

13 favorable offer to the defendant. That's your position. 

14  MR. KOSTER: No. Respectfully, Your Honor, 

that is not my position. My position is that 

16 ineffective assistance is a two-part test, that there 

17 was a performance breach in the failure to communicate, 

18 but once the performance breach is accepted, then it has 

19 to be run through the Hill standard to find whether 

prejudice has occurred, and then we would find a Sixth 

21 Amendment breach. But we -- we do not get there 

22 logically because the offer did not exist after -- after 

23 December 28. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I didn't 

understand that to be your position.

1  There -- there is a statement in your brief 

2 that the question is whether plea negotiations that did 

3 not result in a guilty plea constitute a critical 

4 confrontation that gives the rise to effective 

assistance of counsel during such negotiations. So, I 

6 thought your position was that so long as the plea 

7 negotiations don't result in a guilty plea, effective 

8 assistance of counsel doesn't even come into the 

9 equation.

 MR. KOSTER: I -- there's a question in --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you can say yes or 

12 no. I mean, you could retract -- retreat from --

13  MR. KOSTER: Is the question --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that, I suppose, if you 

want. 

16  MR. KOSTER: Is the question whether I 

17 believe that plea negotiations are a critical stage? 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: When they do not result in 

19 a guilty plea.

 MR. KOSTER: I believe they are not -- I 

21 believe that -- that plea negotiations are not a 

22 critical stage under the laws of this Court. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we took the 

24 case for. We didn't -- we wouldn't have taken the case 

if we were concerned about what happened in March and

1 what happened in February. We took the case because of 

2 your position, that this is not a Sixth Amendment 

3 violation in these circumstances. 

4  MR. KOSTER: I do not -- there is a factual 

question as to whether or not plea negotiations in this 

6 case really ever engaged when all that ever occurred was 

7 the prosecutor sent a letter to the defense attorney. 

8  Only in the most technical of readings --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but we don't care 

about that. You know, what do we care about that? I 

11 mean, we don't take cases to figure out those -- those, 

12 you know, picky, picky factual questions. The issue 

13 that I thought was important here is whether this is a 

14 critical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does 

not accept the -- the plea and plead guilty. 

16  MR. KOSTER: Plea negotiations I don't 

17 believe are a critical stage, because the fate -- in the 

18 back and forth between a prosecutor and a defense 

19 attorney, the fate of the accused is not -- is not set. 

And these -- of course, these negotiations can take 

21 place over a very long time. Either party can get up 

22 from the table and walk away at any time. And then, 

23 perhaps most importantly, the -- the dialogue of the 

24 negotiations are not used against the defendant at 

critical stages, which would contrast it, I suppose,

1 with a Miranda situation in a custodial interrogation 

2 where that would be a critical stage. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it were a critical 

4 stage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not 

only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law, 

6 but if he was a bad negotiator. I mean -- right? Being 

7 a good criminal lawyer means you -- you got to be a good 

8 horse trader, right? 

9  MR. KOSTER: I agree that that would be one 

of the extensions, if critical stage analysis --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You tell him to turn 

12 down a deal --

13  MR. KOSTER: -- was applied to plea 

14 negotiations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that in fact, you know, 

16 was a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective 

17 assistance of counsel. So, you must -- you must know 

18 how to handle yourself in the used car lot, right? 

19  MR. KOSTER: I understand that that would be 

one of the ramifications --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Koster --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: This is on the basic 

23 question --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- it's very odd for 

you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 stage. If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and 

2 the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover 

3 a defense, it can be set aside then.  So, it's -- so, 

4 you're saying it's not a critical stage depending on 

what the end result is. That's very difficult. 

6  I thought we were going to tell attorneys, 

7 you have an obligation during the plea bargain process 

8 to use professional competence. And you say, well, you 

9 do or you don't. That doesn't make much sense.

 MR. KOSTER: My understanding, Your Honor, 

11 is that attorneys are guaranteed to the accused at 

12 critical stages, such as arraignments, plea hearings, 

13 trials, but then there is an implied guarantee that 

14 comes with that critical stage, and that implied 

guarantee is that their -- that the attorney appointed 

16 will do research, analysis, and preparation that 

17 prepares him for the critical stage. 

18  But when David Boyce is sitting home on a 

19 Saturday night with a file open in his lap preparing for 

a case on Monday, that moment is not a critical stage of 

21 trial, on a Saturday night in his den, but it prepares 

22 for, it is precedent to, a critical stage. And the 

23 failure to engage in that preparation analysis can lead 

24 to performance and prejudice at critical stages, but it 

itself is not.

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the 

2 question -- I make a counter-assumption. The problem 

3 that I -- I have the feeling that I'd like you and the 

4 others to comment on, is that you're worried deeply 

about a practical problem, and that the practical 

6 problem is that it would be too easy, as just was 

7 suggested by the question, to find that the lawyer, 

8 after the defendant is convicted, did a bad job during 

9 the plea negotiation, in which case everybody will get 

two or three bites at the apple. And one of the reasons 

11 for that is every brief has been lifting the standards, 

12 particularly in respect to prejudice, from Hill, which 

13 was addressing a different question. It was addressing 

14 the question of missed -- bad performance by the lawyer 

at trial. And that's hard to track what the effects 

16 are, and it isn't that hard to say the trial was unfair, 

17 give him a new one. 

18  That won't work here, I don't think. So 

19 suppose what we did, instead of saying there was no 

right, you simply said you have to prove with some 

21 certainty, work out a standard, that there really was 

22 inadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and 

23 you have to show something more than a reasonable 

24 probability that this would have led to the plea, et 

cetera. You have to show that it would have happened.

1  Or you have a -- in other words, you have
 

2 two tougher standards for this area, but you don't
 

3 reject the idea of inadequate assistance of counsel
 

4 during the plea bargaining stage. I'd like people's
 

views, insofar as they are willing to give them, on that 

6 question. 

7  MR. KOSTER: Ineffective assistance of 

8 counsel is a -- is a term of art, and it is a two-part 

9 test. I believe that there can be performance breaches 

that occur between -- at the -- at the plea bargaining 

11 stage, but that prejudice does not occur until we return 

12 to a critical stage, which is -- is when that -- when 

13 that plea, when the product of that plea negotiation is 

14 returned to a critical stage, and then it has critical 

stage protections over it, where the judge is there, and 

16 there's an allocution and the rest of the protections --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the open -- the 

18 open plea that was made -- that's a critical stage. In 

19 fact, he took a plea. But he, I think, has a plausible 

argument that the plea he made, the open plea with no 

21 bargain in the picture, that that plea was not 

22 intelligently made because he didn't know that there had 

23 been an offer for him to plead to a misdemeanor rather 

24 than a felony.

egregious in my view, which was the 1948 court packing 

6 that occurred and the African American citizens were 

7 excluded from that grand jury pool. 

8  Mr. Henderson's lack of knowledge about a 

9 previous constitutional deprivation was not -- did not 

make his waiver unknowing. Same with the analysis in 

11 McMann and in Parker and in Brady, to say there is no 

12 limiting principle that will allow this omission to 

13 unwind the knowing quality of Mr. Frye's waiver and then

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you taking the same

3 Petitioner's counsel is taking, that you are not 

4 entitled to an attorney at plea bargaining, unless you 

waive your -- unless you waive your right to a trial? 

6  MR. YANG: No, we're not --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not a critical --

8  MR. YANG: We are not taking the view. In 

9 this case, the alleged deficiency is not really an 

interaction between the prosecution and the defense 

11 counsel in plea bargaining. The alleged deficiency is a 

12 failure to inform the defendant of things the defendant 

13 would want to know as going forward, and we're -- we are 

14 willing to assume the defendant has a right to be 

properly informed by counsel. But with any Strickland 

16 claim, the relevant inquiry is whether or not the 

17 defendant has shown cognizable prejudice as a result of 

18 a deficient performance by the counsel. 

19  And when a defendant pleads guilty in open 

court, the conviction rests on the defendant's 

21 assertion, an admission of his own guilt, and his 

22 consent that there be judgment entered, a judgment of 

23 conviction, entered without trial. 

24  And because the conviction rests on a 

consent judgment, it wipes free antecedent

6 perfectly -- you know, there would not be a 

7 constitutional problem with that. Once he pleads 

8 guilty, it just wipes away the fact that no counsel has 

9 been appointed for him.

 MR. YANG: A -- a guilty plea wipes free all 

11 kinds of constitutional violations that went before. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but the guilty -- I 

13 mean, no, the reason that is not true is that the guilty 

14 plea must be entered with advice of counsel. You 

acknowledge that, don't you? 

16  MR. YANG: Correct. And the guilty plea --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the guilty plea doesn't 

18 erase everything if it has been entered without advice 

19 of counsel.

 MR. YANG: Correct. When the counseled 

21 guilty plea is entered, this Court has held that the one 

22 remaining challenge that would be allowed is the 

23 challenge to the knowing and intelligent waiver of the 

24 right to trial, which is what the guilty plea is. Now,

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, does that mean, Mr. 

2 Yang, a State could set up a system where it says we're 

3 going to do all our negotiating with the defendant with 

4 no counsel present in the room, but we're going to keep 

a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him 

6 whether he should plead -- you know, what -- you know, 

7 to advise him about the plea that he has struck, even 

8 though he struck this plea with no counsel in the room, 

9 and that would be perfectly okay?

 MR. YANG: We are not saying that -- that --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: All the negotiations could 

12 be uncounseled. 

13  MR. YANG: We are not taking the position 

14 that States can deprive counsel or deprive counsel from 

participation in the guilty plea process. But what we 

16 are saying --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't understand how 

18 you can say that. It seems --

19  MR. YANG: No --

JUSTICE KAGAN: You are saying that, because 

21 you're saying that in the end, the guilty plea wipes all 

22 constitutional error away. 

23  MR. YANG: Just as we're not saying that 

24 there can be coerced confessions, not just like we're 

saying that a statute can impermissibly burden the right

1 to trial by putting a death sentence on -- that's 

2 available only when you go to trial. We're not saying 

3 any of that is allowed. But what we are saying is 

4 when a -- and that was the Brady trilogy, Brady and 

McMann and ultimately in Tollett, which led to Hill. 

6  What the Court recognized is when you plead 

7 guilty in open court, you are waiving your right to 

8 trial. And the relevant inquiry, the only inquiry once 

9 the defendant has admitted guilt, is to determine 

whether or not the waiver of the trial rights were 

11 knowing and voluntary. And the reason that that is a 

12 relevant inquiry is because you have a constitutional 

13 right to trial, and due process requires that the waiver 

14 of those trial rights be knowing, intelligent, and 

voluntary. 

16  And in Hill, the Court confronted the 

17 question and said: You need to show deficient advice in 

18 the context of pleading guilty; and in addition, you 

19 need to show that that prejudiced you because, absent --

if you had received proper advice, you would have 

21 actually not waived your right to trial; you would have 

22 asserted your right to trial and gone to trial. That's 

23 the standard that applies. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If defense counsel gives 

wrong information to the defendant about witnesses that

1 can testify on his behalf and so forth, very bad legal 

2 advice, that's -- that can be ground for setting aside 

3 the plea, correct? 

4  MR. YANG: It can, and because what's 

relevant --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, so -- and 

7 that's because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not 

8 adequately advise his client. 

9  MR. YANG: Right, right. The key is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why is there no 

11 problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of 

12 earlier better offers? 

13  MR. YANG: It's a different prejudice. The 

14 -- when you plead guilty and your counsel has advised 

you wrongly in a way that would have changed your mind 

16 about the merits of going forward on trial, you can show 

17 that the waiver of the trial right is something that was 

18 prejudiced. But because -- had you known, had you been 

19 properly advised, you would have exercised the whole 

panoply of rights that the Constitution provides one who 

21 goes to trial, not only a right to a trial by jury but 

22 all the trial rights that go with it. 

23  But when you instead plead guilty in open 

24 court -- and the claim here is not that the defendant 

would have exercised his rights to trial. The claim is

1 he would have waived his rights to trial either way. 

2 That is not prejudice to the -- that would overcome the 

3 guilty plea, which again rests on --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Yang, there are 

different kinds of unfairness. One kind of unfairness 

6 is when you're badly advised and you, therefore, waive 

7 your right to trial when you would have gone. But 

8 there's another kind of prejudice, which is, you know, 

9 you and 10 other guys are all in the same situation, and 

those 10 other guys come up with a favorable plea deal 

11 because their lawyers are paying attention, and you come 

12 up with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer has 

13 fallen asleep. And to the extent that we have an 

14 effective assistance right that means something, that 

unfairness needs to be addressed by it, doesn't it? 

16  MR. YANG: Well, when -- again, once --

17 whether or not there was a prior error, once you plead 

18 guilty, the question is not whether there were other 

19 deals on the table; the question is whether that waiver 

of --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess that's the 

22 question. Why isn't that the question? 

23  MR. YANG: Well, right, but if it were the 

24 question, it would call into -- this Court, in -- in 

going back to Brady and then in Boykin, explained that 

24

25

Official 

1 what's -- the relevant question when you enter a guilty 

2 plea is whether you have waived your rights to trial 

3 validly. And, in fact, that has to be spread upon the 

4 record. Rule 11(b) has now been modified by this Court 

to go through the things you have to check to make sure 

6 that that waiver of your trial rights are knowing and 

7 voluntary. 

8  What we have here is not anything associated 

9 with the waiver of trial rights. What really the 

defendant is claiming is some entitlement be able to 

11 take another deal that would not have resulted in trial. 

12 But that is not relevant to the waiver of trial rights. 

13 That would be recognizing another type of right. But 

14 this Court has repeatedly held that there is no right to 

a guilty plea, there is no right to plea bargaining; 

16 once you have a plea agreement, there is no right to 

17 enforcement. The only rights that come into play is 

18 when that guilty plea is rendered into a judgment. And 

19 when you don't get there, but instead you plead guilty 

and you have waived your rights to trial, you have 

21 consented to the entry of judgment, and even if you had 

22 received better advice you would have consented to 

23 the -- you would not have gone forward to trial, you 

24 have -- the basis on which the conviction rests remains 

valid. And that's what --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: You have admitted that you 

2 got what you deserved, right? 

3  MR. YANG: Precisely. And this Court in 

4 Premo addressed the exact same question. In Premo, 

there was a contention that had counsel done better 

6 before by filing a motion to suppress, it would have 

7 been in a better position to secure a better plea 

8 agreement from the prosecution. But the Court concluded 

9 that, no, the relevant inquiry, once you have pled 

guilty, is whether or not you would have, if properly 

11 advised, insisted on your trial rights and gone to 

12 trial. That's the standard set forth in Hill. And the 

13 reason --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, in your view, 

is there any situation in which a defendant could regain 

16 a plea opportunity that he lost due to counsel's 

17 conceded inadequacy? And I think it is accepted that 

18 not telling him of the plea offer was ineffective 

19 representation. Is there any case where the defendant 

could regain the plea opportunity that he lost? 

21  MR. YANG: If he pleads guilty? 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. If he doesn't seek 

23 a trial, right. 

24  MR. YANG: I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. If he doesn't want

1 to go to trial and he's going to plead guilty, is there 

2 any circumstance where he could regain that lost 

3 opportunity? 

4  MR. YANG: If he has -- if he has pleaded 

guilty and he validly waived his rights to trial because 

6 he would not have asserted them, then I think under Hill 

7 what you have is a defendant who admits guilt, there's 

8 no real risk of any kind of error in that determination, 

9 and the judgment which must be set aside -- remember, we 

have to set aside the judgment. The judgment rests on 

11 the admission of guilt and the waiver of trial. The 

12 judgment cannot be set aside at that point, because this 

13 Court has long recognized the -- the special force of 

14 finality with respect to guilty pleas. That's because 

-- for several reasons. 

16  First, guilty pleas are an important part of 

17 the system, and it would be -- both delay and impair the 

18 orderly administration of justice any time we open 

19 another avenue to challenge guilty pleas. But, two, 

once the defendant has stood up in open court and 

21 admitted guilt, there is almost no risk of error, and 

22 the defendant has gotten the proper sentence and the 

23 proper conviction.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF EMMETT D. QUEENER 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

4  MR. QUEENER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

6  Galin Frye entered a plea of guilty to 

7 felony driving while revoked and was sentenced to 3 

8 years in prison. His trial lawyer failed to inform him 

9 that the prosecutor was willing to allow him to accept a 

plea offer to a misdemeanor charge and recommend 90 days 

11 in jail. Fundamental fairness and reliability of 

12 criminal process requires that an attorney provide his 

13 client information regarding matters in his case. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why is it unfair for 

the law to apply to this individual the punishment he 

16 deserved for the crime that he committed? I mean, the 

17 object of the system is to put -- is to punish people 

18 who commit crimes in a certain degree. 

19  And here he admitted he did the crime, and 

he got the degree of punishment that the law provides. 

21 What could be more fair than that? 

22  MR. QUEENER: Fairness includes a whole 

23 range of sentencing options. And in this case, the 

24 prosecutor was making a determination of what was fair 

in this case when he made the offer.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ex ante, I suppose you 

2 could say that. But when you look at it later, it's 

3 clear that that would have been unfair. In fact, this 

4 individual was perfectly willing to admit that he had 

been guilty of more than what the prosecutor had 

6 offered. 

7  MR. QUEENER: Part of the consideration that 

8 a defendant has to make during the plea bargaining 

9 process or plea negotiation process is determining the 

liability that he's willing to accept in entering a plea 

11 of guilty. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, and he did 

13 that when he entered the plea of guilty. You -- you do 

14 not contest he was well advised when he entered that 

plea that it was knowledgeable and he admitted that 

16 that's what he had done and was willing to accept the 

17 degree of punishment prescribed by law. 

18  MR. QUEENER: Well, he was -- the guilty 

19 plea in terms of what he was admitting to, he was 

willing to and had to agree that he had committed the 

21 crime of driving while -- while revoked. But the plea 

22 was open in terms of sentencing, and he was allowed to 

23 argue for something lower than the sentencing. He only 

24 knew that was the available options at that time.

 He wasn't aware that the prosecutor had made

1 available an option to him to limit his exposure for
 

2 that offense to 90 days.
 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have a
 

4 two-part question.


 MR. QUEENER: Okay. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. What exactly 

7 made his plea unknowing or involuntary, number one? 

8  And, number two, identify the right he was 

9 deprived of, substantive or procedural, by his 

attorney's failure to communicate the plea. 

11  MR. QUEENER: The plea was unknowing and 

12 involuntary because he was not made aware by his 

13 counsel's unprofessional representation of all of the 

14 circumstances available to him, the consequences of 

entering that guilty plea, that would have included the 

16 90-day on a misdemeanor if he had been aware of that. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose he had been told 

18 that -- suppose he had been told that, and the 

19 prosecutor said, well, yes, that's true; I made that 

offer, but it's off the table now. And apparently, this 

21 was then off the table. So, what good would it have 

22 done him to know about something that happened in the 

23 past but was no longer available? 

24  MR. QUEENER: Well, this offer was only no 

longer on the table at the time he entered the plea of

1 guilty, because it had expired, and that was a result of 

2 counsel's ineffectiveness in failing to communicate that 

3 to him. The lower court, the court of appeals, made a 

4 finding that this offer was available, and he could have 

taken advantage of it before it expired. And that was a 

6 finding by the court below. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that, and 

8 it may have been unfair, but I don't see why it's 

9 involuntary. Because I don't see that -- advising him 

that he had an option at some point in the past which 

11 was no longer available really doesn't have much of a --

12 doesn't have any bearing on the voluntariness of his 

13 plea to a later less-favorable offer. 

14  MR. QUEENER: I -- that's -- it seems to me 

that that's involuntary in the sense that he didn't know 

16 it then. It's not that it's involuntary now because 

17 that he knows it. It was involuntary because he didn't 

18 know it then. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose the case in 

which a plea offer's made, not communicated, and 

21 expires. Then there's a guilty plea hearing. And he 

22 doesn't -- and the defendant enters a -- a guilty plea 

23 but doesn't know about the prior offer. Is -- is there 

24 injury?

 MR. QUEENER: There is if there is an

1 increase in sentence. And that's the situation here.
 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, is the plea
 

3 involuntary? Is it -- pardon me. Is it unknowing?
 

4  MR. QUEENER: It is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would he -- what 

6 would he have done had he known? 

7  MR. QUEENER: It's unknowing in the sense 

8 that he did not know the full consequences of --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you know, Judge, I'm 

really sorry I didn't accept responsibility 3 months 

11 earlier. 

12  MR. QUEENER: What he -- what's unknowing 

13 about that is the potential consequence that he is 

14 choosing in deciding to plead guilty. And if I may, 

that's the second part of your question. The right that 

16 he has is the right to make fundamental decisions in his 

17 case, one of which is to accept a plea bargain and plead 

18 guilty. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't the rule 

that the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the 

21 prosecutor -- indeed, even after it has been accepted --

22 doesn't that well enough establish that there is no 

23 right to profit from that plea offer, that there is no 

24 constitutional right he's been deprived of, given that 

the prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it?

2 that can be -- excuse me -- that can be withdrawn at any 

3 time by the prosecutor, but we're not arguing that there 

4 is a right to a particular plea -- a particular plea. 

He is entitled to the right to make a knowing and 

6 voluntary acceptance of a plea, a knowing and voluntary 

7 guilty plea, and that requires that he know all of the 

8 information. And the record that we have in this case, 

9 there's nothing to suggest that that plea would not have 

gone forward. The mere potentiality for withdrawing the 

11 plea --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I had hoped you were 

13 making some argument other than the knowing argument, 

14 because as prior discussion has shown, even if he had 

known, it would have made no difference to whether he 

16 accepted the later plea. 

17  Suppose he had been told, "oh, by the way, 

18 there was an earlier plea. It's too late to accept it 

19 now. Do you want to take this plea?" He says, "well, 

oh, I'd like the earlier." "I'm sorry, the earlier plea 

21 is gone. Do you want to take this plea or not?" He 

22 would have taken it. 

23  What does the knowledge of the earlier 

24 lapsed plea have to do with whether his guilty plea is 

knowing and voluntary? It doesn't seem to me to have

2  MR. QUEENER: Well, the knowing -- yes. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you had some 

4 other argument that was somehow a right to profit from 

the earlier offer. And I find it hard to see that 

6 right, given that the prosecutor can withdraw the offer 

7 and, indeed, even withdraw it after it's accepted. 

8  MR. QUEENER: The right is to enter that 

9 plea knowing the full consequences of what he's doing at 

that point, which includes the limitation on his 

11 exposure for the offense. This is sort of a sentencing 

12 issue. And an increase in sentence is a -- is 

13 prejudicial. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he's -- the Missouri 

Supreme Court said in what -- that the prosecutor --

16 they would not -- they would not order the prosecutor to 

17 renew that earlier plea. So, they said the options were 

18 you can get a new trial -- you can get a trial or you 

19 can replead the open plea. But wasn't it -- didn't the 

court say we will not order the prosecutor to reinstate 

21 the earlier offer? 

22  MR. QUEENER: That -- that is correct, Your 

23 Honor. Their finding, more specifically, I think was

where 95 percent of all people in prison are there as a 

6 result of bargaining and guilty pleas arranged with 

7 prosecutors -- in that context, it's fundamentally 

8 unfair to deprive a person of his liberty for 40 years

counsel that caused him to turn down the plea, and,

8 hard to prove. The person turned down a 5-year deal and 

9 gets -- and after trial is sentenced to 20 years. So, 

you've got -- you're got prejudice right there, right? 

11  MR. QUEENER: Right. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: So, there's always going to 

13 be a very good argument for prejudice where a person 

14 turns down a favorable deal and then gets slammed after 

a trial. 

16  MR. QUEENER: I'm -- I'm going to qualify my 

17 answer a little bit because I think where -- what the 

18 Court has to -- to keep in mind is the rational decision 

19 requirement that I think was reiterated in -- in 

Padilla. You're going to have to look at whether or not 

21 the defendant was making a rational decision in that 

22 choice. It's not simply that there was another offer 

23 out there. It -- was the decision rational on the part 

24 of the defendant to accept or reject that offer that was 

there?

3 that -- I'm sorry. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The point is just that 

6 prejudice isn't going to be very tough to show, is it? 

7 You turned down a 1-year deal, and then later when that 

8 was off the table, you accepted a 5-year deal. 

9  MR. QUEENER: That may well be the --

JUSTICE ALITO: There's prejudice --

11  MR. QUEENER: That may well be the easier 

12 part of the -- of the equation. But there's still going 

13 to --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because you have to 

show a causal connection. So, you'd have to show --

16 show in the causal connection that he would have taken 

17 that deal. 

18  MR. QUEENER: That's -- yes. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: And if -- if you're going 

to use the words "reasonable probability" that he would 

21 have taken it, it might be fairly easy to show. And 

22 that's where in the back of my mind I'm thinking that 

23 maybe we want something tougher than reasonable 

24 probability, that you have to show that it really would 

have made a difference.

1  MR. QUEENER: I -- I think reasonable
 

2 probability is a -- is a workable standard that we've
 

3 used for many years.
 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are -- you are
 

leaving out of the picture the prosecutor's prerogative 

6 to withdraw his plea. That you said that the court --

7 said it lacked authority to order the State to offer any 

8 bargain, but also the court said, I'm not going to 

9 require the prosecutor to renew an earlier offer.

 One thing is clear in this case: The 

11 prosecutor did nothing wrong. The wrong was on the part 

12 of defense counsel. So, why should the judge disarm the 

13 prosecutor, take away the prosecutor's right to change 

14 his mind?

 MR. QUEENER: The -- this is a remedy for a 

16 Sixth Amendment violation, and that is to put the 

17 defendant back into the position as nearly as possible 

18 as he would have been in at the time and at the time the 

19 offer was open. This is not a situation where the 

prosecutor is being ordered initially or the first 

21 instance to make an offer; it -- this is being viewed as 

22 the offer that was originally made is still available 

23 and open to the defendant. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but at the time, that 

offer could have been withdrawn by the prosecutor. And

3  MR. QUEENER: There's -- there's never going 

4 to be a perfect remedy for any of these violations, I 

don't believe.
 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's right.
 

7  MR. QUEENER: Right.
 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's one of the
 

9 things that causes us to be suspicious of whether
 

there's a constitutional violation --

11  MR. QUEENER: Well --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because there really 

13 isn't any perfect remedy. 

14  MR. QUEENER: There can't be a perfect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In some cases, not even a 

16 close to perfect remedy. 

17  MR. QUEENER: I think this is close to 

18 perfect, as close to perfect as we can get, which is 

19 what is required for Sixth Amendment remedies, that it 

mitigate it to the extent possible. And in those 

21 circumstances where one party -- the interests of one 

22 party may be infringed upon, if that happens -- they 

23 can't be infringed upon unnecessarily. This is a 

24 necessary infringement. The State bears the burden of 

ineffective assistance of counsel, and if that's in a --

2 burden for the erroneous sentencing. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

4  JUSTICE ALITO: On the issue of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll go this time. 

6  Counsel, on page 24 of your brief, you quote 

7 Alford for the proposition that a valid plea must be a 

8 voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative 

9 courses of action open to the defendant.

 MR. QUEENER: Yes. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the next page, 

12 you say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the 

13 trial court, he was completely unaware that counsel's 

14 ineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options.

 Now, I put the two of those together and 

16 find you saying that this was a valid plea. 

17  MR. QUEENER: No, it was --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question of 

19 validity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you 

quote, among the alternative choices of action open to 

21 the defendant. The next page you say these options have 

22 forever been foreclosed. So, they weren't open to the 

23 defendant. 

24  MR. QUEENER: Well, those were foreclosed 

simply as a result of trial counsel's ineffectiveness,

1 which -- which caused him to be unaware that they had 

2 been ever available to him, so that -- that how the plea 

3 becomes involuntary is not that he's aware of what the 

4 situation is at the time that he's entering the plea, 

because there are many other circumstances that go into 

6 his decision of whether or not to enter a plea. Those 

7 alternatives were only no longer available to him as a 

8 result of counsel's failure to perform his duty 

9 professionally and communicate the offer.

 JUSTICE ALITO: On the issue of remedy, as 

11 the Respondent are you not limited to the remedies that 

12 were provided in the judgment of the State court? 

13  MR. QUEENER: No, I don't believe so, 

14 because the State court, the court of appeals, simply 

thought it was not empowered to put him back in the 

16 position that he was in, and I think that is the remedy 

17 under the Sixth Amendment for that violation. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you didn't file a 

19 cross-petition, and there wasn't one granted. So, 

aren't -- aren't you limited to defending the judgment 

21 below? Can you ask for a modification of the judgment 

22 below in your favor? 

23  MR. QUEENER: With the -- the second point 

24 in the -- in this case is, what is the appropriate 

remedy? And --

3  MR. QUEENER: Yes. Yes. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the Court was 

expecting you to address it. 

6  MR. QUEENER: But we did file the petition 

7 challenging the -- the finding of the -- or the relief 

8 provided by the court below. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: You think that because we 

added a question, that acts as the functional equivalent 

11 of a granted cross-petition that would permit 

12 modification of the judgment in your favor? 

13  MR. QUEENER: No, but the last I -- the last 

14 I recall, that cert petition was still pending. I may 

be wrong about that, I'm not sure, that it was just into 

16 this case. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are -- are you 

18 recognizing that the remedy that the Missouri Supreme 

19 Court did give was a futile remedy? That is, to plead 

guilty, to have another open plea or trial, because this 

21 defendant apparently doesn't want to go to trial. 

22  MR. QUEENER: I think both of those are 

23 futile remedies, and that's why it's really obvious that 

24 the remedy has to be something else. This is not a 

situation where he does have a very -- a very good

1 likelihood of succeeding at trial. That's not going to 

2 do him any good. That won't get him a misdemeanor where 

3 he'll be sentenced to 90 days. The open plea is 

4 basically the same -- the very same thing that's causing 

him the prejudice in this case. So, the remedy being 

6 provided by Missouri Court of Appeals is essentially no 

7 remedy at all for the prejudice that he suffered. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should -- now 

9 that we know what the judge's sentence was, and part of 

the plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was 

11 it -- 3 years with 10 days in jail? 

12  MR. QUEENER: Yes. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge said, no, 

14 I'm not going to give him just 10 days; I'm going to put 

him in jail for the whole 3 years. Now, if that's --

16 this is the sentence that the judge gave, he rejected 

17 the -- half of the plea bargain, so surely he would have 

18 rejected the more generous one. 

19  MR. QUEENER: I -- I'm not sure that's 

entirely the only answer we can draw from this record. 

21 At the time that this -- or this guilty plea was being 

22 entered and the sentence was handed down, this was an 

23 open plea, it was not an agreement. If they had gone to 

24 court on a plea agreement between the prosecutor and the 

defense, and that was up for a -- an amendment down to a

1 misdemeanor and a reduced charge -- you know, that is 

2 something more definitive. Then the judge would be 

3 looking at what the parties had agreed to at that point. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I understand 

the difference between an open plea and a plea 

6 agreement. He just comes to the judge and says I'm 

7 willing to plead to this without the prosecution having 

8 offered it? 

9  MR. QUEENER: The open plea basically means 

there is not an agreement between the parties. Now, 

11 they may each know what either party is going to argue 

12 for or recommend, but there's not an agreement between 

13 the parties. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. QUEENER: And I think that -- would 

16 leave the court with a little more flexibility than --

17 than he might otherwise exercise if they came to him 

18 with an agreement. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Just to make 

sure. I thought the earlier, the November 15th letter 

21 agreement --

22  MR. QUEENER: Yes. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- always left it up to 

24 the judge whether to accept either the felony with shock 

treatment or the misdemeanor with 90 days. So, the

1 judge was always free to reject either of those two? 

2  MR. QUEENER: I think the deference to the 

3 trial court on probation was in that first one, the 3 

4 years with defer to the court on probation. If they had 

agreed on the 90 days in the misdemeanor, that would 

6 have been a plea agreement between the two parties. 

7 That would have been a definitive --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he could still --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Binding the judge?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He could still --

11  MR. QUEENER: Not binding the judge. No, 

12 that would not bind the judge. It never would. The 

13 judge would have the opportunity, at that point -- the 

14 only time -- the only thing the judge would have 

discretion over at that point would be the actual amount 

16 of sentence. If the prosecutor reduced that from a 

17 felony to a misdemeanor, the judge couldn't reject that. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He would have had to 

19 accept it.

6 there is nothing in the record to suggest that that 

7 would not have happened. The appellate court found --

8 in fact by making the determination that Mr. Frye was 

9 prejudiced, necessarily made the conclusion that that 

plea would have gone forward. The motion court said 

11 nothing to refute that. There was nothing in the 

12 court's findings that the court would not have accepted

21  Two of the Justices questions raised the

sentencing equivalency is not an avenue that the Sixth

1 Amendment is intending to reach. The essential question 

2 here, to Justice Breyer's earlier question that I think 

3 I didn't answer properly, is should we begin unwinding 

4 these convictions in search of lost plea opportunities?

 I think that we should not. It undermines 

6 the -- there were long discussions in both Hill and 

7 Premo about the importance of the finality of these and 

8 our being able to rely on the finality of these 

9 decisions. There's mutual reliance. There's State 

reliance as well because, when these offers are made, 

11 the State does not interview witnesses, the State does 

12 not send evidence to the lab, the State does not, you 

13 know -- sometimes even get to the point where the 

14 charges are made. So, there's State reliance and --

which is synonymous with a reliance of justice on the 

16 finality of these agreements as well. 

17  And also, the search for these lost 

18 opportunities that Mr. Frye is asking this Court to lead 

19 us toward takes a point of representation beyond the 

limited scope of the Sixth Amendment in Gonzalez --

21 Gonzalez-Lopez and other courts, the limited -- the 

22 limitation of the Sixth Amendment that this Court has 

23 always appropriately articulated. 

24  For this and other reasons stated in our
