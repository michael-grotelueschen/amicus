4 argument in Case 10-930, Ryan v. Gonzales.

 General Horne. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. HORNE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

9 please the Court:

 I'd like to start picking up on a question 

11 asked by Justice Ginsburg on the Rees case. 

12 The Rees case is pre-AEDPA. If there is one thing that 

13 Congress had in mind when it passed AEDPA, the 

14 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, it is 

that the death penalty process needs to be speeded up, 

16 and habeas should not result in undue delays to give 

17 effect --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't think that 

19 AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees? Do you think 

Rees would come out the other way after AEDPA? 

21  MR. HORNE: Well, I think that Rees didn't 

22 really deal with our issue, which is competence to -- to 

23 aid counsel. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different point.

 MR. HORNE: Yes, I agree, Your Honor, but I 

3

Official 

1 thought it -- it would be relevant to point out that it 

2 was pre-AEDPA. 

3  And then, on that point, this Court has said 

4 several times that habeas should not be used to grant 

indefinite stays. In fact, there -- even pre-AEDPA, in 

6 the Barefoot case, this Court said that habeas is not a 

7 time to retry a case and even less is it a time to grant 

8 indefinite stays. 

9  So the sentence with, "even less," followed 

the sentence with, "not." So it was even less than not 

11 that it should grant permanent stays. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me how you define 

13 indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six 

14 months to a year stay, for a court to try to get someone 

back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in 

16 which the defendant's information is necessary? 

17  MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. We agree with 

18 the Ohio position. In the -- in the American 

19 Psychiatric brief, I think it's page 10, note 20, they 

said that up to 90 percent of the cases are solved in 6 

21 to 9 months. And I think that, if this Court set a 

22 standard of no more than a year for the successive 

23 stays, that would give some guidance to the courts. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you deal with 

Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does

1 it make if the person's still necessary -- or the 

2 information -- potential information is still necessary, 

3 what makes it unnecessary after a year? 

4  MR. HORNE: Because I think the -- the 

consequence of AEDPA is that a balance has to be drawn 

6 between the fact that there has to be finality. In 

7 fact, the -- this Court has said the purposes of AEDPA 

8 include finality, comity, federalism, and reduction of 

9 delays in death sentence cases. There needs to be a 

balance between that and the -- the need to have a 

11 competent defendant, if we can have one, in a case where 

12 the testimony is necessary. 

13  This Court has said several times -- I was 

14 going to mention also the Heinze case, where this Court 

thinks that -- very clearly, that stays cannot be 

16 indefinite. So -- so I think it would be very helpful 

17 for this Court to give a guideline to the courts and say 

18 the way to balance this is that, if they get the time in 

19 which 90 percent of the cases are -- are --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those cases didn't 

21 establish a limit on how long states needed to take to 

22 adjudicate claims. They just said a district court 

23 should put in conditions that move things along --

24  MR. HORNE: Yes. That's correct, 

Your Honor.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that -- that require 

2 defendants to press their claims within a reasonable 

3 time that required periodic updates, that required 

4 monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial 

end time. It just said you can't just do an open-ended 

6 stay and not give conditions to comply with. Why should 

7 this be treated differently? 

8  MR. HORNE: Your Honor, we think it would be 

9 helpful -- and we agree with Ohio on this -- we think it 

would be helpful if the Court gave some kind of a 

11 standard, so that there would be some guidance and 

12 uniformity, and so that -- so that courts did not get 

13 around this Court's --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: How -- how would you 

define that standard? What standard do you suggest? 

16  MR. HORNE: The standard we would suggest 

17 would be that -- that 6 to -- 6 to 9 months would be the 

18 standard, and certainly no more than a year; that it 

19 would be in months and not years, including not just the 

first stay, but any successive stays. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: In all cases? 

22  MR. HORNE: In all cases. In all cases 

23 where a stay was appropriate. Now, in the record-based 

24 case, no stay is appropriate.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What if the -- it might be

1 unusual, but you can't try a person who's not competent. 

2 You can't try him. 

3  MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: So what about -- and now, 

he's been tried, and he's been convicted and been 

6 appealed and gone through the procedures. But some case 

7 could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima 

8 facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there 

9 really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think 

it's probable that the basic trial was unfair, to the 

11 point where it's like not having a trial. 

12  What about in that situation, if it ever 

13 arises? I mean, should we leave the door open just for 

14 that possibility?

 MR. HORNE: I think the answer to that is 

16 no, Your Honor, because the assumption -- once -- once 

17 the conviction has occurred, the presumptions shift. In 

18 the criminal trial, all the presumptions are in favor of 

19 the defendant. The case has to prove -- the state has 

to prove its case --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I have that. That's why I 

22 put in the possibility that, on the basis of what's 

23 presented to me, the judge, I think I have so much 

24 without this defendant's testimony here suggesting it 

was unfair, that maybe the presumption should shift

1 back. I'm -- that's what's worrying me in the back of 

2 my mind, that there could be such a case. There have 

3 been in history. 

4  MR. HORNE: Well, this Court said in Daniels 

that the presumption is that the conviction was valid, 

6 and it becomes the burden of the petitioner to overturn 

7 that -- or the burden of the prisoner to overturn 

8 that --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Which he can't do, if he's 

not competent. 

11  MR. HORNE: Sorry. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: If there is a time limit --

13 if there is a time limit of 6 to 9 months --

14  MR. HORNE: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- at what point does it 

16 begin to run? Does it begin to run at the time when the 

17 petitioner moves for a stay, even if no effort was made 

18 prior to that to restore the petitioner to competency? 

19  MR. HORNE: I would believe the time would 

begin to run with the treatment because the basis for 

21 the 6 to 9 months was what was in the amicus brief 

22 against us by the American Psychiatric Association 

23 indicating that, in 6 to 9 months, almost 90 percent of 

24 the cases are cured. So we -- we needed to have some 

basis to suggest a standard to the Court.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: No, but my question is this: 

2 Suppose that no effort has been made by counsel to 

3 provide -- to obtain treatment for the petitioner to 

4 restore the petitioner to competency prior to the point 

when a motion is made to stay the proceeding. The 6 

6 to -- month period would still begin to run at the time 

7 when the motion for the stay is made? Or would it begin 

8 to run at some earlier point or some later point? 

9  MR. HORNE: Your Honor, I would think, if 

the motion is made and the other requirements are shown, 

11 that it -- that the prisoner's testimony is essential, 

12 then -- and that it's not a record-based case, then I 

13 would think the 6 to 9 months would begin to run when 

14 treatment begins because that's our basis for the 

standard we are suggesting. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When treatment 

17 begins after some sort of initial hearing, right? 

18  MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

19  When the court -- if the court grants the 

motion for the temporary stay, and presumably treatment 

21 would begin right away, or perhaps treatment has been 

22 ongoing, but from that point on, we suggest a 6 to 9 

23 months standard. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In which cases would you 

say the defendant's ability to assist counsel is

1 necessary? On what issues? You say that -- that if --

2 the assistance has to be necessary to a fair 

3 adjudication. 

4  MR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In what cases would that 

6 be so? 

7  MR. HORNE: We have difficulty coming up 

8 with cases at that stage of the proceeding, Your Honor, 

9 because presumably the information the prisoner would 

have would be known to others, especially if it's newly 

11 discovered evidence, that would typically be from 

12 outside, such as a -- somebody admitting -- somebody 

13 else admitting to the crime, DNA evidence, something of 

14 that sort.

 It -- it appears to us highly unlikely that 

16 the prisoner has information that he didn't disclose 

17 earlier when he was competent in the state proceedings 

18 and in the post-conviction proceedings at the state 

19 level, so we think it would be very, be a very rare 

case, Your Honor. 

21  But we are prepared to admit that, if a 

22 showing were made that his testimony is necessary, that 

23 a 6 to 9 month temporary stay be granted, as long as --

3  MR. HORNE: We had to find something to 

4 suggest to the Court, and so we took it out of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So 6 months? Or 9 

6 months? What does it mean to be 6 to 9 months? 

7  MR. HORNE: Oh, I agree, Your Honor. Then 

8 it should be 9 months because that's the point at which 

9 the American Psychiatric Association says almost 

90 percent of the cases are solved. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if it isn't solved 

12 after 9 months, then what? 

13  MR. HORNE: Then the case proceeds --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If competency cannot be 

restored? 

16  MR. HORNE: Correct, Your Honor, then the --

17 then the case proceeds, which was the --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Based on the record. 

19  MR. HORNE: Based on the record -- well, if 

it's record based, there should be no continuance at 

21 all. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't really 

23 understand why the American Psychiatric Association said 

24 6 to 9 months, too. I mean, 90 percent are cured within 

9 months, right?

 MR. HORNE: No, we don't, Your Honor. We --

6 we're just suggesting there should be a guideline, and 

7 we had to find some basis for the guideline. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Because they are not 

9 lawyers, right? They are psychiatrists.

 MR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what happens if, after 

13 9 months, mental health experts come in and they say 

14 there's a 90 percent chance of restoring the petitioner 

to competency in another 9 months or another 3 months or 

16 another month. 

17  MR. HORNE: Your Honor, we're suggesting 

18 that the Court should draw a line to guide the other 

19 courts, so that -- so that -- because once you allow one 

additional period, there can be successive additional 

21 periods, and then it becomes an indefinite stay. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean -- sorry. I 

23 didn't mean to say it in that particular tone. 

24  (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, trial judges

1 run their trials. You know, that's what they're hired 

2 for. And once we make it clear, it shouldn't go on 

3 forever. And -- and why can't we trust them to do their 

4 job?

 MR. HORNE: Well, this Court in Heinze said 

6 that pre-AEDPA, the courts had discretion to grant 

7 stays, but AEDPA circumscribe -- circumscribes that 

8 discretion, and so I think this Court needs to give 

9 guidance to the courts as to the --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean it shouldn't be 

11 indefinite. The object of this is you're trying to give 

12 -- like you would with any witness who's not around at 

13 the moment, you're trying to produce a hearing that will 

14 reach a result with this witness. And if you think, 

after a reasonable period of time, that witness will 

16 recover and be available, fine. And if there is no hope 

17 of that, forget it. I mean -- you know, something like 

18 that. 

19  MR. HORNE: I understand, Your Honor. Our 

suggestion is -- is that the Court give a guideline. I 

21 understand Your Honor's position. 

22  I do want to save some time for rebuttal. I 

23 just wanted to make one quick point about this -- that 

24 the -- that the witness has to be essential to the case 

being made. It was suggested in the Ohio case that --

1 that if there were a possibility that he could be 

2 helpful, that that would be sufficient. 

3  But the -- the American Psychiatric 

4 Association and the ABA both agree that there has to be 

a particularized and substantial case made that the 

6 witness is necessary or -- or they also use the word 

7 "essential or necessary," and we think that that -- that 

8 standard should prevail. 

9  And I'd like to reserve time for rebuttal.

 Thank you.

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

16  SUPPORTING PETITIONERS IN NOS. 11-218 & 10-930 

17  MS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

18 it please the Court: 

19  The United States agrees with Ohio and 

Arizona on the general framework for when no stay is 

21 allowed and for when a limited stay is allowed in 

22 Federal post-conviction proceedings. I'd like to 

23 provide the Court with a practical example of how a 

24 limited stay might work, since that seems to have been 

of some concern.

Official 

1  An analogous Federal statute is 18 U.S.C., 

2 Section 4241, the Federal competency hearing statute 

3 that the Court cited or provided a CF citation to in 

4 Rees. That provides the framework for how a district 

court determines competency for a prisoner to stand 

6 trial and could provide a framework for how a district 

7 court should proceed with competency hearing in a case 

8 where it would be appropriate. 

9  Under Section 4241, the criminal defendant, 

if he is found incompetent, the district court may give 

11 an initial period of up to 4 months for him to be 

12 treated to determine whether he can come back to 

13 competency. 

14  If he cannot regain his competency at the 

end of that 4-month period, then the court can grant an 

16 additional reasonable extension of that time if the 

17 doctors say that there is a reasonable probability that 

18 this prisoner can be restored to competence. 

19  That could provide a framework, if that's 

what this Court is looking to do, for showing district 

21 courts how they could enter a limited stay. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's a reasonable 

23 extension? 

24  MS. O'CONNELL: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Another 4 months? 6

1 months? 

2  MS. O'CONNELL: I think we agree on the 

3 outer end that --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: I was with you. It seemed 

to me you had something really, really clear and solid, 

6 until you said, "reasonable extension." 

7  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, but this is what 

8 district courts do. They do it whenever a competency 

9 motion is filed in a Federal criminal trial, and we 

agree with the -- the outside limit of about a year. It 

11 depends on the -- the interests at stake -- the 

12 interests at stake in the state in proceeding with its 

13 judgment and the interests in finality and whether the 

14 doctors think that there's actually a chance that this 

prisoner could be restored to competence if they work a 

16 little harder. 

17  If the -- if the evidence is crucial or 

18 necessary or there's some indication that we want to --

19 to work hard to get this information from the prisoner, 

we would go for a little bit longer. But at some point, 

21 that attempt to restore the prisoner to competency has 

22 to end and the -- and the proceedings should move 

23 forward based on the best evidence that's available. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. O'Connell, where 

does that outer limit come from? You suggested looking

1 to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no 

2 outer limit in application of that statute, would there? 

3  MS. O'CONNELL: There's not. But -- but at 

4 some point, we do give up, and the district courts have 

discretion to determine how long that would be, and --

6 and, again, we -- we propose an outer limit of about a 

7 year, but it's up to the district court in that 

8 particular circumstance, to see how hard they want to 

9 work to try to get that evidence into the proceeding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that any different from 

11 what the defendants are arguing here? 

12  MS. O'CONNELL: Well --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: They're saying, you know, 

14 give a -- give a temporary stay and extend it as long 

as -- as you need to. 

16  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're taking their 

18 position. 

19  MS. O'CONNELL: No. The difference between 

our position and that position is that if, after a 

21 reasonable period of time, the prisoner cannot be 

22 restored to competence, the claim should move forward 

23 without him, using the best evidence that's available. 

24  That's because, when we arrive at 

post-conviction proceedings, we have a conviction and a

1 sentence that have been affirmed on direct appeal and
 

2 are presumed to be valid, and although it's a valid
 

3 consideration for the district court to take into
 

4 account whether the prisoner is competent and could
 

assist his counsel has a role in these proceedings, 

6 there's no right for the prisoner to be competent during 

7 the post-conviction proceedings. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said shortly 

9 after a reasonable period of time. I thought you were 

saying after a year. I think it's -- it's some guidance 

11 to say no more than a year. It's really no guidance to 

12 say after a reasonable time. 

13  MS. O'CONNELL: Yeah. We -- we think the 

14 outer limit should be presumptively about a year. It's 

not to say that the United --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about a 

17 very narrow range of cases because I take it your 

18 principal position is it -- it would be unusual that the 

19 defendant needs to be competent in order for the lawyer 

effectively to represent him on habeas. So under what 

21 circumstances do you think competency matters, so that 

22 the lawyer should not be expected to go on without a 

23 competent client? 

24  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, we think 

that it would not be an abuse of discretion for the

Official 

1 district court to allow the defendant to try to regain 

2 his competence and help his lawyer with the proceedings 

3 if there is some opportunity for him to present evidence 

4 or to present new claims in his proceeding. That may be 

the case. It will often be the case for a Section 2255 

6 petitioner. 

7  It is his first round of Federal 

8 post-conviction proceedings. It may be his first 

9 opportunity to present an ineffective assistance of 

counsel claim. And in those circumstances, if he has 

11 something that -- if the lawyer has something that he 

12 wants the prisoner's assistance with or may need 

13 testimony from -- from the prisoner, we think the 

14 district court has discretion to allow a stay -- a 

limited stay to allow the prisoner to regain his 

16 competence. But --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: So it's not limited to cases 

18 where the review is restricted to the record? 

19  MS. O'CONNELL: Right. In those cases, we 

think that no stay is appropriate, that it would be an 

21 abuse of discretion to enter a stay. AEDPA doesn't 

22 tolerate delay without a justification, and if it's a 

23 record-based claim, like a state prisoner, where he's 

24 barred by Section 2254(d) in Pinholster from bringing in

1 the state court record, then there is no role for the 

2 prisoner to play. 

3  And it would be an abuse of discretion for 

4 the district court to stay the proceedings in an effort 

to bring him back. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the standard 

7 when the district court is deciding whether to stay the 

8 proceedings? We've heard a number of them, plausible 

9 basis in the record, truly plausible, Iqbal. Which --

which -- what is the government's position on the 

11 appropriate standard? 

12  MS. O'CONNELL: We -- we think that the 

13 district court has discretion to grant a stay when the 

14 prisoner's participation could be -- he could provide a 

useful source of evidence or guidance in the 

16 proceedings. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Could"? 

18  MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your standard is 

"could provide"? 

21  MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. In those 

22 circumstances, we don't think the district court would 

23 abuse its discretion by allowing him an opportunity to 

24 regain his competence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Could provide" means might

2  MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, yes. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: So just a possibility --

4  MS. O'CONNELL: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's all it takes? 

6  MS. O'CONNELL: If there is an opportunity 

7 for this prisoner to present new claims or new evidence 

8 in his Section 2255 proceeding, that we don't think it's 

9 an abuse of discretion for the district court to allow 

him that opportunity. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you cap it by saying 

12 as long as the discretion is not exercised for more than 

13 a year? 

14  MS. O'CONNELL: That's right. We think it 

has to be just a limited stay. We -- the United States 

16 would be opposed in any circumstances to a stay that's 

17 conditioned only on the prisoner's ability to regain his 

18 competence. At some point, if he can't, we move 

19 forward.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that standard have 

21 been met in both of these cases? Meaning, Carter's 

22 claim -- and the one that concerns me the most is why he 

23 was excluded from trial and what if he did or did not do 

24 with his attorneys afterwards. And Gonzales is a 

slightly different case. But would your position be

2  MS. O'CONNELL: Not just that there was 

3 enough, but that the Federal court would be prohibited 

4 from considering further information --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. My question 

6 was, on the facts of both of these cases, was there a 

7 basis for granting the stay with respect to --

8  MS. O'CONNELL: No. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- their conditions?

 MS. O'CONNELL: No. Because both -- all of 

11 the claims involved in these two cases are limited to 

12 the state court record and Federal post-conviction 

13 proceedings under Section 24 -- 2254(d) and Pinholster. 

14  This prisoner could not provide any new 

evidence to his client that could be introduced at court 

16 or that could be relied on by the Federal court. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Neither Carter or 

18 Gonzales? 

19  MS. O'CONNELL: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would we, in this kind 

21 of case, as opposed to, say, some other case, where a 

22 witness is missing and it's crucial? The district court 

23 does have authority to grant stays. And we haven't 

24 said, but no longer than a year. Why do we say, but if 

they do it in a reasonable time?

1  If they abuse their discretion, there is 

2 mandamus, or there are other ways of controlling the 

3 discretion. Why are we suddenly here, in this case, 

4 imposing a fixed number of days?

 I mean, the reason, of course, that the 

6 Psychological Association says 6 months to 9 months is 

7 they have different studies. In some places, it's 6 

8 months; in some places, it's 9 months. And -- and so 

9 why are we picking a number out of a hat here, when we 

don't elsewhere? 

11  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the Court doesn't have 

12 to do that. We're -- we were suggesting a year as the 

13 outer limit, just because that is sort of what the amici 

14 say is sort of the outer limit for when people will be 

restored to competency, if they are going to be able to 

16 be restored; but the Court doesn't have to -- to set an 

17 outer limit. 

18  I mean, it -- it -- but it -- what we are 

19 most --

JUSTICE BREYER: It should, but it should be 

21 something like reasonable or -- or don't abuse your 

22 discretion or -- I mean, at the moment, I'm just not 

23 seeing why this is different than 10,000 other kinds of

days.

hold up the proceedings indefinitely to wait for that 

6 witness. And so it should be no different when the

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LETICIA MARQUEZ 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

9  MS. MARQUEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  I'd like to begin by correcting a statement 

12 by the United States. Mr. Gonzales is not precluded by 

13 2254(d) or Pinholster. Mr. Gonzales has identified 

14 several ineffective assistance of counsel claims that 

would be ripe for review under this Court's decision in 

16 Martinez and, therefore, would be available in district 

17 court. And we would also be able to present new 

18 evidence. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Marquez, could you tell 

me, if it were the case that somebody was limited to the 

21 state court record, what's your best example of a case 

22 in which, nonetheless, a stay would be appropriate; in 

23 which, nonetheless, consultation with the client was 

24 necessary for a full and fair adjudication?

 Because I have been trying to think of 

25

Official 

1 examples, and -- you know, I'm not doing very well, 

2 quite honestly. So what's your best one? 

3  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, in our particular case, 

4 we -- we raise several claims in habeas -- in habeas 

proceedings. We raise guilt claims, and we also raise 

6 sentencing claims. And it is often the case with our 

7 clients that, at their direction, they choose not to --

8 not to pursue or do not want to pursue sentencing claims 

9 and want to only pursue guilt claims.

 So those are claims that are strictly on the 

11 record. And under the ABA guidelines, the client is the 

12 ultimate decisionmaker as to where the particular 

13 representation is going. So that is a huge, 

14 all-encompassing decision that a client needs to make as 

to the ultimate outcome of his or her case. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that is that 

17 you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument, 

18 that in every single case, you have to grant a stay. 

19 You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter, 

and you are making a broader argument. 

21  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, no, Your Honor, where it 

22 does -- just an example of where, if there is a client 

23 in -- in that particular situation --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No incompetent client, 

presumably, can help you make those decisions. So tell

1 me, are you saying that, in every single case, the 

2 client is entitled to a stay? 

3  MS. MARQUEZ: No, Your Honor, we're not 

4 saying in every single case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why does that 

6 situation give you an entitlement, if it's not in every 

7 single case? 

8  MS. MARQUEZ: The -- that situation goes 

9 with the ABA guidelines and what an attorney's duties 

are to maintain communication with the client. And 

11 that's just but one reason why we need a -- a competent 

12 client. But to answer your question --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. If the client 

14 is incompetent, you -- you bring both claims, right? 

You -- you both -- you both challenge the guilt, and you 

16 challenge the sentence. 

17  MS. MARQUEZ: That -- that is if a client is 

18 incompetent. I suppose, if that's -- if we were forced 

19 to do so, we would.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why -- why -- why is 

21 it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so 

22 that the client can tell you not to bring one of those 

23 things? I don't know why that's unfair. 

24  MS. MARQUEZ: That's just but one -- one 

reason why we would need a client.

2 we -- we -- there are several claims. Ineffective 

3 assistance of counsel claims are -- are necessary for --

4 for us to be able to talk to our client. And -- and 

especially in this case, where there was an antagonistic 

6 relationship between his -- the client and the trial 

7 lawyer, that would put the situation in context, and we 

8 would able to -- be able to identify those facts. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why couldn't you use the 

transcript? Everything -- all -- all the exchanges 

11 between the defendant -- defendant and the trial judge 

12 are in the transcript. 

13  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, in -- there -- there 

14 are -- transcripts are -- are available and -- but there 

are situations that are not transcribed. In -- in 

16 ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the 

17 interactions between the lawyer and the client at the 

18 prison, at the jail --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you can't get that in, 

right? I mean, aren't you limited to the record? So 

21 what -- what use is it --

22  MS. MARQUEZ: Well --

24 little -- little secret things that your client knows, 

if they cannot be admitted?

1  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, as this Court held in 

2 Pinholster, not all Federal habeas claims fall within 

3 the scope of 2254(d). And there are situations where we 

4 would be granted an evidentiary hearing.

 In this particular case, we have not yet 

6 been briefed our 2254(d) claims. We are at the stage 

7 where we're going to brief merits claims, and in 

8 addition to that, we are going to brief evidentiary 

9 development in this case, where we would have to assert 

what -- what facts need to be developed and, also, the 

11 diligence standard. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What in the record could 

13 plausibly, certainly be seen, that would suggest that 

14 your defendant has information that could be valuable? 

Assume it's not the ABA standard, but the plausibility 

16 standard or the certainty standard or something. 

17  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, there was -- there is 

18 information in the record that the trial judge and our 

19 client had an antagonistic relationship. And there was 

comments -- the trial prosecutor was interviewed -- or 

21 said on the -- on the record that the judge and the 

22 defendant, Mr. Gonzales, snarled and snapped at each 

23 other.

4 exchange between the judge and the defendant? Is there 

anything to suggest that in the record? 

6  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, we would -- we would 

7 suggest that the actual relationship itself, we would 

8 have to know where -- where this relationship went awry 

9 or why it is that Mr. Gonzales and the trial judge were 

basically at each other's throats. The intensity --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have anything to 

12 suggest that there had been an ex parte exchange that 

13 would account for that snarling? 

14  MS. MARQUEZ: We currently have not been 

able to get that information from our client as to -- to 

16 sit down to -- with our client and say, what happened in 

17 this situation? 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district judge in 

19 this case explained why he concluded that there was no 

issue that couldn't be fairly adjudicated on the basis 

21 of the record. What was wrong with his -- his 

22 explanation? He looked at the case carefully, and he 

23 said, there's nothing that can't fairly be adjudicated 

24 on the record.

1 the district court judge agreed with -- with 

2 Mr. Gonzales that there was a need for Mr. Gonzales to 

3 be competent at his habeas proceeding. And we actually 

4 began a course of -- of a competency determination. 

And -- and that is a longer record. Also, our client 

6 went into -- was treated at the state mental hospital. 

7  However, the -- we believe the trial -- or 

8 the district court judge was in error when he made that 

9 finding. The -- the trial judge did not have -- or the 

district court judge did not have all the evidence 

11 before it when -- when the district court looked at the 

12 particular claims. We were just asked to identify. We 

13 did not put forward a -- a complete briefing on that 

14 issue. And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel? I'm 

16 sorry --

18 motion. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we think 

it's necessary to set some objective limit on how long 

21 an inherent authority could be exercised, is there any 

22 reason to adopt any limit, other than the one that the 

23 psychiatrists have suggested, which is, I gather, most 

24 people, if they're going to, will recover competence 

within 9 months?

2  No. We -- a year or 6 months, just by 

3 listening to the questions from the Court, seems to be 

4 problematic. We suggest that this is all within the 

district court's discretion. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we're looking 

7 for a little more guidance than that and feel the need 

8 for an objective standard, other than abuse of 

9 discretion, you don't have any number that has any basis 

in psychiatric evidence or anything else, besides the 

11 9 months? 

12  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, Your Honor, we -- we 

13 would suggest that the Court look to -- to this decision 

14 in Rhines, where -- and my answer is we can look at a 

year. And possibly, if -- if the client is not 

16 competent at the end of that year, then explore other 

17 options, such as next friend or -- or perhaps 

18 proceeding. 

19  But what we would do is direct the Court to 

this Court's decision in Rhines, where stays were --

21 district courts are allowed to -- to stay proceedings, 

22 so that the petitioner could -- could go back to State 

23 court and exhaust. And in -- in that decision, the 

24 Court was specific as to guidelines for the district 

court to assert its discretion, 30-day updates, make

4 with Rhines stays. The district courts have been able 

to handle those stays. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, in this case, 

7 the district court denied a stay. If this is an 

8 equitable power, how can you be comfortable that the 

9 Ninth Circuit, as an appellate court, overrode the 

district court's equitable discretion? 

11  MS. MARQUEZ: We believe that the district 

12 court was -- abused its discretion, but first, did not 

13 apply the correct standard, which is essential 

14 communication. The district court erroneously decided 

that Mr. Gonzales was not essential -- or his 

16 communication was not essential to the proceedings. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not claiming 

18 that that issue is always in the district court's hands 

19 to start with?

 MS. MARQUEZ: Yes, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please identify for 

22 me what -- how we establish or set a standard so that 

23 appellate courts are not overriding that at whim?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, you're flipping it. 

6 You're saying, first, you give a stay for competence. 

7 You've determined competency first and not essentiality 

8 first? 

9  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, that's how the cases 

are -- are being raised. Always, there is a question of 

11 competency, and then the courts are looking to whether 

12 or not there is essentiality. 

13  I would also like to address the -- the 

14 argument that the AEDPA somehow -- or AEDPA -- somehow 

forecloses any types of stays. The Congress recognized 

16 the need for finality to be balanced against a firm 

17 regard for due process and full Constitutional 

18 protections. So we are --

today -- no one's arguing that it prevents any kind of 

21 stay today, right?

6  Also, I would like to address the Court's --

7 or the government's concern as to whether or not these 

8 cases -- or Rohan decisions, would open the floodgates 

9 to district court stays. The -- we've pointed out in 

our briefs on page 32, 33, the -- the few stays that 

11 have actually been granted. The district courts have 

12 been handling these motions. 

13  And unless there's any further questions --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if there -- if the 

Court were to point to some guideline as to the maximum 

16 length -- or the presumptive maximum length of a stay, 

17 what -- because that's the period within which there's a 

18 good chance in most cases of restoring the petitioner to 

19 competency -- at what point would that begin to run? 

Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment 

21 prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay 

22 is -- is filed? 

23  Now, could many years go by with the same

would begin to run? 

6  MS. MARQUEZ: I believe there's an 

7 obligation for counsel to continue to try to effectively 

8 communicate with his client. And once that attorney 

9 gets to a point where that incapacity forestalls that 

attorney from being able to move forward on his case, 

11 then that attorney is, at that point, under a duty to 

12 raise this claim with the district court. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is he under duty to 

14 raise it as soon as possible, at the risk of forfeiture 

if he doesn't? That's the import of the question. 

16  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, that's -- that's the 

17 million dollar question. I would think that the --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's why I'm 

19 asking.

 (Laughter.)

22 guidelines on ethical duties guide attorneys to -- to

8 basically a notice pleading, the -- within a month of 

9 that, we first got in contact with mental health 

experts, saying, there's something wrong with this guy, 

11 and sought to put together his mental health history. 

12  At that point, Mr. Gonzales was back in

2 evaluated, to finally determine competency. 

3  And while there, he was -- he was treated. 

4 And while he was being treated, he was starting to 

regain competency, at least to some extent. Then 

6 treatment stopped. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Treatment stopped because 

8 he -- he said there were side effects? 

9  MS. MARQUEZ: Because he had back pain. And 

then we began briefing on what the course of treatment 

11 should be, if any. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so how -- what 

13 is this 9 months or 1 year? The amount of time he's 

14 under treatment or the amount of time from the district 

court determination? 

16  MS. MARQUEZ: I believe he was at the state 

17 mental hospital for about 6 months, and he was being 

18 evaluated. And as -- inadvertently, then, the state 

19 mental hospital began treatment.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The million dollar 

21 question: Assume we say you have to spend a reasonable 

22 time trying to get someone to competency. And, here, 

23 there appears to have been efforts to do so. And your 

24 client is saying, I can't be treated because the drugs 

make me sick. So when does all of this end?

1  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, first, our client did 

2 not say he couldn't be treated because -- that he 

3 couldn't be treated. It was just these specific drugs. 

4 And we were on a course of -- of trying to figure out 

what, if any, other regimen was available. And we
 

6 believe that it is within the district court's --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that time has
 

8 passed by now, hasn't it? That that -- they stopped
 

9 treating him?


 MS. MARQUEZ: They -- they quickly 

11 transported him back to DOC, and he is not being treated 

12 currently. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No one's continuing to 

14 monitor him or trying to treat him?

 MS. MARQUEZ: No, Your Honor. And we are --

16 we do not have -- he will not see us, and we do not have 

17 access to medical records because we do not have a 

18 current release. And the district court did not grant 

19 us an order to get those records on a consistent basis. 

So we have no access to our client whatsoever. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little confused as 

22 to -- I think the Ninth Circuit remanded, so that 

23 treatment could be had. So why has it stopped? 

24  MS. MARQUEZ: Well, we haven't moved forward 

in district court. We've been here appealing the

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

7  MR. HORNE: Thank you, Your Honor. 

8  I -- I need to disagree with 

9 the Solicitor General on one point about the standard. 

The standard has to be essentiality. The witness has to 

11 be essential. In fact, you heard my friend representing 

12 Gonzales emphasize essentiality. And it was emphasized 

13 in their -- in their responsive brief, at pages 1, 2, 9, 

14 10, 11, 12, 21, 30, and 39. On all of those pages, they 

said the witness' testimony must be essential. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, could I ask you, 

17 you have been arguing on two different axes. One is how 

18 tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all, 

19 and the other is what limits there should be on how long 

a stay can be if a stay is warranted. 

21  And I'm just curious, if I forced you to 

22 prioritize, in terms of the state's interests in 

23 effective habeas adjudication, which is more 

24 important -- you know, cranking up the standard or 

making sure that there is a time limit in place?

1  MR. HORNE: Well, I think the first -- the 

2 first priority is that there should be no indefinite 

3 stay. And the second priority is that there should be 

4 no stay in a records-based case. Those are the two 

prongs of the Ninth Circuit decision, which we think --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: But ordered in that way, 

7 that, for you, the time limit is the more important? 

8  MR. HORNE: The time limit is -- is crucial, 

9 but I have to say no stay on a records-based case is a 

matter of pretty clear law that is --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I know. But, really, I 

12 said, if I forced you to prioritize between the two. 

13  (Laughter.) 

14  MR. HORNE: I would say it can't be 

indefinite. That would be the first priority. But I 

16 think it's also clear from this Court's very definite 

17 statements in a number of cases that -- that there 

18 cannot be a stay in a records-based case. Now --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Opposing counsel said 

that there is an exception for ineffective assistance of 

21 counsel under our decision in Martinez. 

22  MR. HORNE: Your Honor, in this case, the 

23 district judge specifically found that there is no 

24 possibility for a case of ineffective assistance of 

counsel, that those were waived by the -- by -- when the

1 case was sent back to the State for additional 

2 post-conviction relief proceedings, that claim was 

3 waived. It's in the district court's order, Appendices 

4 B and C to our -- to our petition.

 And even the Ninth Circuit didn't argue 

6 that. The Ninth Circuit argued that there was an issue 

7 as to whether there was prejudice by the judge. But 

8 there is a very detailed analysis, again, in the 

9 district court's order, showing that every time that 

claim was made and was claimed -- made a number of times 

11 in the State proceedings, it was clear that those were 

12 on-the-record comments. 

13  There was nothing secret. There was nothing 

14 ex parte. Those were on-the-record discussions that 

were being complained about. And the district court 

16 judge found that if there was something secret, then 

17 those have been waived by -- by the petitioner because 

18 he didn't bring it up in the numerous case -- times that 

19 it came up at the State level, and he was talking only 

about on-the-record comments by the trial judge. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General, 

22 counsel. 

23  The two cases are submitted.
