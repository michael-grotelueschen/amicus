 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 09-846, United States v. Tohono 

O'Odham Nation. 

Mr. Yang.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This Court in Keene held that section 1500 

of Title 28 deprives the Court Of Federal Claims has 

jurisdiction when the plaintiff has a pending suit in 

another court based on substantially the same operative 

facts and left open the question whether some overlap in 

the relief requested is also necessary to trigger that 

bar. The Federal Circuit erred in holding that section 

1500 applies when both suits -- only when both suits 

seek the same relief, and that the critical distinction 

in this regard is whether the particular relief in the 

plaintiff's plea for relief is deemed legal or 

equitable.

 Section 1500's text broadly bars CFC 

jurisdiction whenever any suit that the plaintiff has 

pending in any other court is a suit for the CFC claim

or is merely a suit in respect to that claim. In other 

words, another suit for a different but a related claim 

will trigger section 1500.

 That provision was intended to protect the 

government from simultaneous duplicative suits against 

the United States and its agents by forcing plaintiffs 

to elect between those related suits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you recognize that 

sequential suits could be brought. So that if the case 

in the district court went to final judgment, then it 

would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.

 MR. YANG: That is correct. In some, in 

perhaps a good number of cases, it's possible to, if you 

are seasonably prompt in your Court Of Federal Claims 

case or your district court case first -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't have 

control over how long the district court case is going 

to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running 

of the statute of limitations.

 MR. YANG: Well, I think there is some 

control that you can exercise over the -- how promptly 

the suit proceeds. Particularly if we are talking about 

suits against the government, many suits proceed on an 

administrative record and go directly to summary 

judgment; that can be done in a relatively prompt

manner.

 But even if not, the Congress that enacted 

section 1500 in 1868 knew that essentially what it was 

doing in many, many cases would prevent a second suit 

from going forward. That's because the Congress was 

concerned with the cotton claimants. The cotton 

claimants had authorization to bring suit in the Court 

of Claims, but there was a two-year statute of 

limitations. That statute ran from the end of the Civil 

War. And this Court in a case called U.S. v. Anderson 

at 76 U.S., and the relevant pages are 70 to 71, made 

clear that the end of the Civil War for the purposes of 

that statute was August in 1866.

 Congress enacted section 1500 in June of 

1868. There was a two-month window, if that, to bring 

suit and Congress recognized, it would have recognized, 

that if you filed suit or were forced to elect at that 

point, that would be the end of the game.

 There was also another statutory provision 

that Congress enacted during the Civil War that put a 

two-year statute of limitations on suits against 

officers. That was discussed in this Court's decision, 

Mitchell v. Clark, 110 U.S. 633 at pages 641 and 642.

 So given the time at which Congress was 

enacting section 1500, it knew it was putting plaintiffs

to a very hard choice. You had to elect between the 

Court Of Federal Claims remedy and between a remedy in 

another court against an officer. That remedy would 

likely be the end of the game. And Congress did that in 

a very particular way. It did it in a targeted statute 

that limited the authority of the court that had its 

hands on the purse strings of the Federal Government, 

and that performed the very function that Congress just 

a few years earlier had itself exercised through the 

enactment of private bills through its appropriations 

power.

 So section 1500 ultimately states in essence 

that if you are going to bring suit in this specialized 

court where Congress has vested the Court of Claims with 

the very special power of distributing money from the 

Federal fisc, that you could only bring one suit arising 

from the same operative facts in order to be in that 

court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's -­

you just -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the cotton cases, why 

isn't my reading of it quite very simple, which is 

Congress was concerned with ensuring that a claimant 

didn't get double-recovered in two different suits.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that a simple -­

you know, you've got people suing in different 

jurisdictions over getting the same pot of money or 

something close to it. Why isn't our view of 1500 just 

simply you can't have two suits that are seeking the 

same pot?

 MR. YANG: Well, it wasn't the same pot of 

money. The Abandoned and -- Abandoned Property 

Collection Act -- we will call it APCA -- provided for a 

special statutory trust remedy. That remedy was for the 

net proceeds of anything -- any -- any auction sales 

that might have resulted from cotton. If the cotton was 

lost, it was damaged, it was destroyed, if the proceeds 

were paid but ultimately didn't make their way into the 

fisc, you got nothing or you got a substantially reduced 

fund. If you sued in court, you might be able to sue, 

as we explained in our reply brief, under certain 

doctrines that would give you the property in specie, or 

you could seek monetary relief. These are quite 

different things. And even in -- it's not -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't get 

both. I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point, 

about duplication. It's not -- even if you can say, 

yes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could -­

couldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and

you prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you 

call the statute. You could not then turn around and 

sue the government official, because you have the -- the 

single claim, you've been compensated.

 MR. YANG: I don't know -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not here -- it's 

quite different. I mean, one suit is not precluded by 

the other. You -- you recognize that by saying you 

could bring the Claims Court suit after the district 

court suit. That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.

 MR. YANG: You may in certain instances. 

But particularly in the cotton cases, Congress knew that 

it -- what it was doing was forcing one path and only 

one path. It wasn't about duplicative recovery. You 

had to choose and you not -- you weren't going to have 

time to bring another suit, and Congress would have 

known that when it enacted the section 1500's 

predecessor two months before the statute ran in APCA 

and perhaps after the statute ran for bringing a tort 

suit against officials under the cases -- the statute 

that this Court construed in Mitchell.

 So it wasn't simply that duplicative relief 

was at issue, Congress was actually forcing you to make 

a choice in cases where the types of relief are quite 

different. And the type of relief, for instance, that

you would get in a suit against an agent of the United 

States, what you get out of that suit is not a pot of 

money; the court does not say at the end of the case, 

here you go, you asked for $1,000, here it is. The 

court enters an order; it enters a judgment. It says, 

"Defendant, perhaps Tony Yang, officer of the 

government, you pay $100 million, $50 million."

 It doesn't mean much to the plaintiff if 

they get at Tony Yang as an individual. This is very 

different relief than a money judgment against the 

United States. It's not the same relief. And in fact, 

we don't normally think of a claim as embodying a 

particular type of relief, which is the submission of 

the trial here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I'm not sure I 

understand your answer to my question. Assuming you had 

a recovery under the -- for the -- confiscated cotton, 

under the one route you had a recovery. You could not 

sue again under the other route without -- leaving aside 

1500, because the claim would be precluded.

 MR. YANG: That might have been true in one 

direction but maybe not in the other. And let me 

explain. The -- I'm not sure that there was an instance 

of this happening because of section 1500's existence, 

but if you had, for instance, obtained damages against

an individual agent in a suit and you still could have 

brought suit within the Abandoned -- Abandoned Property 

Collection Act, the Abandoned Collection Property Act 

provided a statutory trust for the owner of the cotton. 

It's not at all clear that that would have been 

precluded. There may well have been, but for the 

statute of limitations problem, the ability to get a 

double recovery.

 But nevertheless, I mean, our submission 

ultimately turns on our understanding of the text of 

this statute, which is quite broad. The text not only 

precludes -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 

not -- it's not as broad as your test, "arising out of 

the same operative facts." It doesn't say that; it says 

"any claim for and respect to which." And it seems to 

me that the facts of this case draw that precise 

distinction. When you are asking for an accounting, you 

are not raising any claims about people doing anything 

bad at all. You are just saying, let me know what I've 

got. And then when you bring a claim for -- for money 

because of mismanagement of the trust, that's -- that's 

quite different.

 MR. YANG: I -- that's -- that's true in 

some cases of an accounting. It's not true on these

complaints. The complaints here are -- they have the 

sense of a kitchen sink type of a pursuit of these 

claims against the United States. The district court 

case is not simply seeking an accounting of old money, 

as the Tribe submits. It actually alleges a whole slew 

of breaches, including the breach to -- to -- of failure 

to invest money properly, failing to put it to its 

highest use, says the true balances would be far greater 

but for these breaches.

 It specifically seeks a -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- is that 

to assert the basis about why an accounting should be 

required?

 MR. YANG: No, because back -- the counts -­

these are back on pages 90 and 91a of the petition 

appendix. The Tribe not only seeks an accounting, but 

it also seeks an order to comply with all other 

fiduciary duties determined by the court. This is 

paragraph 42.

 It goes on to say that the tribe is not only 

entitled to object and essentially challenge the 

accounting, but it's entitled to any other equitable 

relief that might be appropriate in light of the -- the 

court's decision in the case.

 So the tribe is in no way trying in the

district court simply to seek an accounting. Just like 

in the Court of Federal Claims, it's not simply looking 

to what they claim to be new money. The specific 

allegations in the CFC complaint say that there has been 

no money for the -- no accounting for the revenue 

collected.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is the -­

maybe I don't know enough about what an accounting is. 

But why would it be other equitable relief to which they 

are entitled if they simply say, we want to know what 

we've got?

 MR. YANG: The tribe -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can get -­

and then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if 

that's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and 

that might be the Court of Claims action. But it does 

strike me that they are different -- claims for 

different relief.

 MR. YANG: It -- it should be that way if 

there were a narrowly tailored APA-type-like suit in 

district court, but that's not this. The tribe's 

complaints both invoke, for instance, the Cobell 

litigation which has been going on in -- in D.C. for 

quite some time, and are modeled on the same types of 

broad claims that are at issue at Cobell.

This is not a simple case where there is 

agency action withheld and a court says: Agency, you 

had X duty; do it. This is a -- a situation where the 

tribe is seeking to impose itself on age-old decisions 

that have been made a long time ago and to seek to 

revisit them and at the end of the day restate their 

accounts to reflect what they think should be in the 

trust fund.

 This parallels in both the Federal 

Circuit -- the Court of Federal Claims and the district 

court suit. There is substantial overlap in the 

operative facts. As the two judges -- the only two 

judges to have addressed this -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it accounting 

what should have been in the trust fund or what actually 

is? You say give me an accounting of the trust fund. 

Does the officer go back and just add up the bank 

accounts and value the land and all that? Or -­

MR. YANG: Well, there's a difference -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- does he go back 

and say, well, this should be there but it's not?

 MR. YANG: The -- there is a difference 

between the parties, and I don't think it's been fully 

fleshed out here, about what an accounting is. The 

statute at issue that the tribe invokes for the

accounting in our view provides a prospective obligation 

for the government to provide quarterly statements of 

what's coming in and out of the account going forward.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Going forward.

 MR. YANG: Going forward, not going back, 

and only with respect to moneys that were deposited or 

invested under a specific statutory authority that 

involves deposits that were made in banks. So in our 

view -- you know, our view and the tribe's view I think 

are quite different in terms of what's at issue in the 

district court case. And unfortunately, that's not the 

case that's before you here. But what we're trying to 

do is say whether or not there is substantial overlap 

between the two. And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, are you at 

cross-purposes on those two issues? When it comes to 

what an accounting is, you want to say, oh, that's just 

going forward; when it comes to this 1500 question you 

want to say they're the same as the money damages, which 

goes backward?

 MR. YANG: No, I don't think we are at 

cross-purposes. What we are saying is what the 

complaint alleges. We don't control how the tribe seeks 

to assert rights. We think that the complaint may be 

overbroad, but that's not the correct question.

I mean, this Court in Keene, for instance, 

addressed suits which had been dismissed because they 

were improperly brought in district court, and those 

suits in district court were sufficient to trigger 

section 1500's jurisdictional bar simply because they 

were asserting claims that overlapped with the claims 

that were at issue in the CFC.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you read the claim in 

section 1500 the same way that it should be -- or do you 

think we should read it the same way in 1500 and 

12(b)(6), failure -­

MR. YANG: I think so. I mean -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether or not you've 

stated a claim upon which relief can be granted?

 MR. YANG: Right, which draws a distinction 

between the claim and the relief, right? If relief were 

the particular type of relief, as the tribe asserts, the 

rule would simply say "failure to state a claim," 

because you would have failed to state a certain 

element, a necessary element, of the claim. Instead, it 

says "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 

granted."

 And I think that -- that keys into the other 

important provision of rule -- the Civil Rules for this 

purpose, which is Rule 54(c), which makes clear that the

relief that might be initially stated in a complaint is 

not the relief that is at issue in the case.

 The relief that comes at issue in the case 

is the relief that the -- that is proven, whether it be 

at summary judgment or at trial. And even if, for 

instance, you ask for a dollar in damages in your 

complaint, it may well be that at trial you establish 

your entitlement to injunctive relief or damages far in 

excess.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not so, not so here, 

because of the way Congress has set up the authority of 

each court. You could never -- what is it, 54(c) or -­

MR. YANG: (C).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 54(c) is the relief to 

which you were entitled. The only relief to which you 

were entitled in the one court, the Court of Claims, is 

compensatory damages. So there isn't a question of some 

other form of relief. You have to go to another forum 

to get different relief.

 MR. YANG: Well, yes and no. The district 

court complaint, for instance -- and again, we contest 

this, but they seek a restatement of their accounts. 

They seek remedies such as equitable disgorgement and 

the like. These are monetary remedies that go, again, 

to the same types of issues.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can give injunctive 

relief where that's necessary.

 MR. YANG: That's correct, but if you have a 

claim, for instance -- taking the old money/new money 

framework, which we don't think is borne out by the 

complaints, but even if we were correct, if they were 

seeking so-called old money in district court -- that 

is, money that should have been there, but was 

improperly allocated and therefore didn't show up in 

their account -- they could also bring a claim under the 

Indian Tucker Act claiming that there was some breach of 

duty under a statute or regulation, clear and -- this is 

a Navajo Nation-type question -- and you could get an 

accounting through -- in order to determine the proper 

amount that should be there.

 So this is a way -- the problem that we have 

here, particularly in these cases where there's an 

allegation of 100 years of trust duties going back, and 

simultaneously litigating these cases in courts that

might have different views on discovery obligations, 

different views of the law on various point cases.

 One of the cases that we cite in the 

appendix to the petition, the Ak-Chin case, the CFC 

ordered discovery, for instance, that we have to conduct 

a review of 33,000 boxes of materials from the archives. 

Although we claim there is an APA case going on in 

district court, the plaintiffs are seeking discovery 

there. We are fighting it. But this type of 

duplicative legislation and burden on the government is

of relief that they seek where they couldn't get it all 

in the Court of Claims?

 MR. YANG: A declaratory judgment, for 

instance. Some -- many -- some of these cases arise -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Declaratory judgment. Is 

there anything else?

 MR. YANG: Um -- well, I mean, you wouldn't 

be able to get injunctive relief.

Claims. There are exceptions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No matter what. Okay. 

Well, then they have a problem, because they might want 

-- they might want some money and they want an 

injunction. So what are they supposed to do?

 MR. YANG: There is no question that section 

1500 may put a plaintiff at a difficult choice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a big choice.

 MR. YANG: It's a choice that has existed 

since 1868, when Congress -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: To test that choice -­

it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress 

said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for 

the district court.

 But your position is that under your reading 

of Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment. 

Under your reading of the statute, the Casman decision 

was wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back 

pay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both.

 MR. YANG: That's correct. And I think that 

was this Court's suggestion at the end of Keene, when 

the Court recognized that because there are complicated 

jurisdictional regimes that apply when you sue the 

government, the Court explained there may well be 

situations where this precludes a plaintiff from seeking

all the relief that you would otherwise be able to get 

if you could bring suit separately.

 And the Court in Keene said: Look, if there 

is apparent hardship -- this is following its decision 

in Corona Coal, which is 1924. If there is a hardship 

in the statute, it is a question that must be directed 

to Congress, because Congress is the one that set this 

up, this jurisdictional limit. And the jurisdictional 

limit that existed in 1868, remember, was a very 

difficult choice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic point is this: 

You're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress. But 

you don't deny the basic point, which is that an Indian 

tribe may think the Bureau of Indian Affairs has really 

mismanaged everything and what they would like is some 

money, and also they want an injunction so they won't do 

it again.

 And now your view is, it's true, there is no 

way they can get that, because they have to go to two 

different courts, and really in your view they can't go 

to two different courts, period.

 MR. YANG: Well, let me qualify -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And hardship is definite. 

It's just you are saying, that's what Congress wanted.

 MR. YANG: The hardship may be there. The

hardship is less now than it was in 1868 because of the 

language of the statute -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't it just as bad as 

what I just said?

 MR. YANG: Because you might be able to 

bring, for instance, an APA suit that completes before 

the six-year statute of limitations ends. And frankly, 

we don't think that that's an unusual thing, for an APA 

action to be brought promptly, even with an appeal. APA 

actions, again, if it's limited to the administrative 

record as they should, you can go straight to a summary 

judgment-like procedure -­

that I didn't agree with when it came out. You have to

government want to extend Bowen?

that was a proper suit. But what you could do is you 

could pursue it and it could complete and still be -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's any 

comfort to the Indian tribe, do you?

 MR. YANG: Well, but that's precisely what 

they are seeking to do here, and we just disagree 

whether that relief is available in district court. And 

the question here is whether you can simultaneously 

pursue it.

 Let me be clear. These cases in our view 

should almost all be brought normally in the Court of 

Federal Claims. These cases are seeking money for past 

actions and that's precisely what the Court of Federal 

Claims should address.

 However, a number of plaintiffs like to try 

their hand at more than one court and they bring 

simultaneous suits, just as Tucker -- the cotton 

claimants did in the 1860's, where Congress provided for 

a general statute, very broadly worded. It applies to 

any claim for and in respect to which any suit or 

process is pending in any other court against the U.S. 

or any person acting or professing to act as its agents. 

It's a very broad statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- I mean, 

you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are 

doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a 

chance in more than one court. But your response to

Justice Breyer suggests that that's a tough choice if 

you have to choose between injunctive relief or damages. 

That's not them trying to, you know, get the same -­

take two bites at the apple.

 MR. YANG: In some cases, it's is a tough 

choice. Casman would have been a very difficult choice. 

But as this Court suggested in Keene, the question goes 

to Congress, and when Congress addressed the question it 

decided relief of that sort should be brought all in the 

Court of Claims.

 But in this case, this is not a case where 

we think particular hardship would be had, because the 

tribe could pursue its claims in the Court of Federal 

Claims and probably should be doing that if it simply -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't our rule 

simply -- what is so wrong with a rule that says if you 

can bring it in the Court of Claims you have to, but if 

there's relief that you can't secure there you can have 

two lawsuits? What is so irrational about that?

 MR. YANG: Well, that doesn't square -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there is no double 

recovery possible.

 MR. YANG: But that doesn't square even with 

the history of what Congress is trying to target. The

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have already gone 

through that because most of those claims would have had 

some element of double recovery, that might have 

precluded a second action. The point that I raised was 

if there is a chance of potential double recovery, you 

can't breach, what's wrong with that?

 MR. YANG: I don't think it squares with the 

text of the statute, which is broader than, doesn't 

provide for a claim, it doesn't provide for relief, it 

doesn't speak to double recovery. If Congress was 

intending to target that specific problem it could have 

done so in a much direct manner.

the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Two suits are for or in respect to the same 

claim under Section 1500, only if they stem from the 

same operative facts and seek duplicative relief. And

in response to the Government's argument, I would like 

to explain why that's the best reading of Section 1500's 

text, as well as the only reading that harmonizes 

Section 1500 with the overall jurisdictional and 

remedial scheme.

 Congress has made a broad range of remedies 

available to Plaintiffs wronged by the Government. And 

it's directed Plaintiffs to seek certain remedies only 

in the Court of Federal Claims, and certain remedies 

only in the district court.

 The Government's reading of Section 1500 

assumes that Congress intended to penalize Plaintiffs 

for following that direction by barring them from the 

only forum where they can obtain money damages. But 

nothing in the statute's text or history suggests that 

Congress intended to create such a nonsensical scheme.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your argument assumes that 

there is available in the district courts injunctive 

relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that 

is far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear 

if you had any business being in the district court 

anyway. And so in a way we are resolving a very strange 

question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right 

to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can 

that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit

pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an 

abstract question.

 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Scalia, it is 

disputed whether or not the district court has 

jurisdiction to entertain the Nation's claims there. 

The Government has a move to dismiss on that ground, 

that motion is pending. We don't believe that the 

district court's jurisdiction over the claims raised in 

the district court is a question that this Court needs 

to face. Rather, the question here is whether the Court 

of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over the claims 

brought in the CFC. And that turns not on whether the 

district court has jurisdiction, but on whether 

duplicative relief is sought in both suits.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The main thrust that I was 

raising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble? 

They have to forego one kind of relief for another. So 

what about injunctive relief, that's what he thought of, 

and Justice Scalia raises the point, well, they are not 

going to be entitled to injunctive relief anyway because 

the APA doesn't provide it, if I understand that 

correctly. So you are giving up the null set. You were 

giving up the null set.

are not entitled to the relief that the Nation sought in 

the district court. We believe that the Nation is 

entitled to that relief.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it couldn't get that?

 MS. SPINELLI: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It couldn't get that kind 

of relief in the Court of Claims?

 MS. SPINELLI: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it could.

 MS. SPINELLI: No, no, no. You are right 

that it could not. The relief that is being sought in 

the district court is primarily an accounting. An 

accounting is inherently an equitable remedy, a remedy 

that under trust law the trustee owes to the beneficiary 

to provide the beneficiary with all the information 

necessary for him to protect his rights.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it well established 

that part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when 

it requires an accounting is to give damages for breach 

of the trustee's duty? That's Hornbook.

 MS. SPINELLI: That may well be the case, 

Justice Kennedy, in common law trust suits. That wasn't 

requested -­

historically in equity. No. Historically in equity the

trustee who breaches the trustee's duty in the equity 

court is required to give damages.

 MS. SPINELLI: You are correct that 

normally, that in the past -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not common law, it's 

not common law, it's equity. It's old law, it's equity.

 MS. SPINELLI: Correct. You are correct 

that in the days of the divided bench suit for breach of 

trust were brought in equity. I don't think we need to 

parse that finely here, because the question here is 

whether or not the Tribe has sought duplicative relief 

in both courts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that unrealistic? 

You don't want an accounting for the sake of having an 

accounting so that you can put the accounting in your 

desk. Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us. 

You want to get the $1,000,000,000. If the suits are 

directed at the same object, and it is fanciful to think 

there is this separate suit for an accounting. The 

object of that suit is the same thing as the object of 

the suit in the Court of Claims.

 MS. SPINELLI: With respect, Justice Scalia, 

that is not the case. The accounting has enormous 

benefit entirely apart from any monetary relief that it 

might ultimately lead to. The Nation, as well as other

tribes who have brought these kinds of suits, lack basic 

information about what they own, what the metes and 

bounds of their lands are, what leases have been 

granted, how long they last, what easements and rights 

of way have been granted over their land, what the 

status is of their mineral rights and timber rights. 

All of this is information that the Tribe needs and that 

Congress recognized in the Indian Trust Fund Management 

Reform Act that the Tribe needs in order to exercise its 

Federally granted right to decide how it's assets are 

best managed, and the longer that that accounting is 

delayed, the more the Nation is harmed by the inability 

to do that, the inability to decide whether certain 

funds should be withdrawn from trusts held by the United 

States, the inability to decide whether it should bring 

claims against third-parties. So there's real value to 

the accounting that's entirely separate from any 

monetary relief. And the accounting is not sought in 

the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal 

Claims has long held that it lacks jurisdiction to grant 

that kind of pre-liability historical accounting.

and say, look, I want an accounting, but you can say I 

have been wronged over the century and I would like to 

find out to what extent, and before you can figure that 

out you actually have to have an accounting. Can't the 

Court of Federal Claims get an accounting in that 

context?

 MS. SPINELLI: The Court of Federal Claims 

can order something called an accounting in aid of 

judgment. Despite the similar terminology, they are not 

at all the same. An accounting of the type that's being 

sought in the district court is a remedy by itself. 

It's a remedy that the beneficiary is entitled to once 

its received or denied, that's a final order that can be 

appealed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's a 

remedy, but is it terribly different from what the 

accounting the Court of Federal Claims would order to 

figure out how much -­

MS. SPINELLI: It is because it requires the 

trustee to provide all information about the trust that 

might be relevant to the beneficiary, and it does so 

without requiring the beneficiary to prove any 

mismanagement. By contrast -­

passed? Is the jurisdictional basis for that the waiver 

of sovereign immunity that allows you to demand an 

accounting from the United States? Is that just the 

APA?

 MS. SPINELLI: The waiver of sovereign 

immunity that is being asserted in the district court is 

the APA, that's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about this -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you didn't have a right 

to that before the APA was passed?

 MS. SPINELLI: In the district court, no.

court nor in the Court of Claims. So this is not an

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was thought about for a 

century, anyway.

 MS. SPINELLI: It's a little bit more 

complicated than that because prior to -- prior to the 

Court of Federal Claims in its current incarnation, 

certain claims for an accounting could have been brought 

before the Indian Claims Commission, but -- I mean 

that's going a little far afield. The -- at any rate 

Congress has now recognized specifically by statute that

this is something that Tribes need, and that's the right 

that the Nation is seeking to enforce in the district 

court action.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why have -- you say 

Congress has specifically recognized it by statute. 

You're referring to the APA?

for losses and injuries from the commingling or the 

misappropriation of assets?

 MS. SPINELLI: No, Justice Kennedy, in the 

Court of Federal Claims, as a close reading of the 

complaint will show, the Nation is requesting four 

specific kinds of relief. First it's asking for damages 

from the United States' failure to lease its mineral 

rights for fair market value. That's count 1. Count 2

is seeking damages from the United States' failure to 

obtain fair market value for leases of its land. Count 

3 is seeking damages from the United States' failure to 

invest judgment funds in a timely way and to obtain the 

maximum interest rate; and count 4 asserts a similar 

claim for damages with respect to the trust fund.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your brief makes the 

-- seems to make the point that that's all just interest 

on capital. It's not for lost capital. But even as you 

described it, it sounds to me that you get damages for 

loss of capital plus interest.

 MS. SPINELLI: It's -- it's not just 

interest, you are correct. I mean, maybe if I give an 

example this will make things a little bit clearer. Say 

that the government sold a stand of timber belonging to 

the Nation for $20, even though the stand of timber was 

worth $40. It then deposited it into the trust account, 

$10.

 The suit in the district court seeks an 

accounting and a restatement of the accounts and to the 

extent appropriate and available, equitable restitution 

of the $10 that was missing from the account.

 The suit in the CFC seeks to recover the $20 

that the United States should have earned, had it acted 

as a prudent fiduciary when it was selling the stand of

timber. And the Nation is entitled to both sums of 

money, but they are different, and because the money 

sought in the two courts is different, the relief is not 

duplicative.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem is that I read 

the CFC complaint as including both. I will take a look 

at it. And I intruded on Justice Breyer's question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to work out 

still in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe: 

You have to go to the court of claims, period. Period. 

You can't go to these other courts, I mean unless you 

give up the court of claims. Is the Indian Tribe going 

to really lose something it needs?

the power to remand appropriate matters to any 

administrative or executive body or official with such 

direction as it is may deem proper and just.

 Now that seems awfully broad, so I'm 

thinking now, if they want money, they can get the money 

from the court of claims. If they want something like 

an injunction, they could ask the court of claims, tell 

the executive branch to behave the way we think they 

have to under the law and there's your authority.

as an incident of and collateral to a judgment of a

equitable pre-liability accounting. All that it can do 

is after liability for certain acts of mismanagement has 

been proven, calculate damages for those specific acts 

of mismanagement. Now -­

MS. SPINELLI: Well, two -- two things, 

Justice Sotomayor. We believe that the Nation could not

Claims because it has held repeatedly that it lacks 

jurisdiction to grant an equitable accounting. However, 

I don't believe the answer to that question matters,

extra 10 bucks -- $10, and we want it? What -- what -­

MS. SPINELLI: Dividing -- well, it is clear 

that the accounting sought in the district court 

couldn't have been obtained in the court of claims. And 

it made sense to seek the old money as the court of 

appeals called it, in conjunction with the accounting, 

because the accounting is what should reveal what is

missing from the account. And that's the reason, and 

not for any manipulative or forum-shopping purpose, that 

the Nation split its complaint the way it did.

 Now to be sure, there is some fuzziness 

about the jurisdictional line between the Court of 

Federal Claims and the district court. There is no 

doubt about that. The Nation did its best to negotiate 

that and filed its complaints in good faith. We believe 

that that question doesn't need to be addressed by this 

Court, because the only question section 1500 asks is 

whether the two suits are for or in respect to the same 

claim, by which we think it means are they for or in 

respect to the same demand for relief. Here -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government says the 

statute is simple. It says you can't have two suits 

simultaneously, or you can't when the CFC suit is the -­

the second one.

 And Mr. Yang told me that yes, the 

government thinks that in the Casman case there was a 

choice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district 

court, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but 

you cannot get both. And when Congress realized that 

that's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a 

two -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution. 

Congress said, there will be one lawsuit. It will all

be in the claims court, and they can grant both the back 

pay and the reinstatement.

 So the two-suit approach was rejected, I 

guess, in -- in Congress's response to Casman.

 MS. SPINELLI: With respect, 

Justice Ginsburg, I would disagree. I think that action 

by Congress in the 1972 Remand Act strongly supports the 

conclusion that Congress has implicitly acquiesced in 

this construction of section 1500.

 Congress -- you are right, Congress decided 

not to say go ahead with your two suits in two different 

courts. It thought that was too burdensome for the 

plaintiff; rather it amended the Tucker Act to permit 

the plaintiff to pursue both remedies in the Court of 

Federal Claims. But that shows that Congress was well 

aware of the Casman holding, and it did not make any 

change to the statute to cast the holding into doubt, 

that where two remedies are available in two different 

courts, one can pursue them by bringing simultaneous 

suits in the two different courts.

 All that it did is make it easier for 

plaintiffs in that specific situation to get full 

relief. Beyond that, in 1982 -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me, it didn't 

make it easier. You -- you had to bring them both in

option of -- of still bringing two different suits, did 

you?

 MS. SPINELLI: No, I think after -- after 

the amendment -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You had to go to the court 

of claims.

 MS. SPINELLI: Yes. I mean, other -­

otherwise that would raise a claim-splitting problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but if they were just 

making it easier, they -- they would have said, you 

know, you can do either one.

 MS. SPINELLI: Well, I mean, clearly the 

easier path is to have one suit. I don't think any 

plaintiff wants to be forced to bring two suits to 

obtain two different remedies, both of which it needs, 

at double the expense and, you know, double the anxiety.

 But I think what's significant about the 

1972 action is that Congress did absolutely nothing to 

suggest that it disagreed with the Casman holding. And 

the same is true in 1982, when Congress completely 

revamped the entire jurisdictional scheme, changed the 

jurisdiction of the claims court very much, and yet left 

section 1500 entirely untouched. And that makes sense. 

I mean, just to turn to the text for a minute, the key

word, as I think this Court said in Keene, is the word 

"claim."

 "Claim" can mean a lot of different things. 

It can sometimes mean the set of operative facts from 

which a right to relief arises, which I believe is at 

least implicitly what the government is saying. It can 

also mean a demand for relief; for instance, in this 

Court's cases regarding Article 3 standing, it's 

routinely said that plaintiff has to establish standing 

separately for each claim, which means for each form of 

relief sought.

 The reason that is the correct reading of 

section 1500 is because of the nature of the 

jurisdictional scheme. The Court of Federal Claims has 

always been a court of limited jurisdiction. It can 

only grant certain remedies, primarily money damages. 

And the word "claim" in the Tucker Act and its 

predecessors, from the very beginning, prior to the 

enactment of section 1500, has been read by this Court 

to mean a demand for relief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be 

inconsistent with the definition of "claim" in the 

federal rules, I think.

 MS. SPINELLI: Yes, I think the definition 

of "claim" in the federal rules -- I think that's a

different definition of "claim." I think what we have 

here is a narrower definition that was first established 

in the 19th century through this Court's decisions 

construing the Tucker Act and its predecessors.

 Given that the word "claim" in the Tucker 

Act carries that narrow meaning, it certainly makes 

sense to construe the word "claim" in section 1500 as 

having the same meaning.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you give it that narrow 

meaning, however, the government says you are 

contradicting what was the case with regard to the 

cotton suits. That, in fact, some of them were asking 

for funds from this -- money from this common fund, and 

others were seeking relief against the individuals who 

had taken the cotton or replanted the cotton. Those are 

different claims, as you define "claim," anyway.

 MS. SPINELLI: I don't think that is our 

definition of "claim," but let me explain.

 We don't dispute that certain cotton 

claimants, you know, brought writs of conversion of 

trespass. Some may have brought writs of replevin or 

detinue seeking the cotton itself back. The relevant 

fact is that the suit saying "I want my 100 bales of 

cotton back" and the suit saying "I would like money to 

compensate me for my loss of 100 bales of cotton" seek

duplicative relief. And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is different from the 

word "claim." I mean, if you are hanging the whole 

thing on the word "claim," you gave me a very plausible 

alternate definition of "claim." But your case does not 

follow that. Your case hinges on duplicative relief, 

which is something quite different. I don't know any 

definition of "claim" that is synonymous with 

duplicative relief.

 MS. SPINELLI: The word "claim" in section 

1500 refers to claims over which the Court of Federal 

Claims has jurisdiction, just as it does in the Tucker 

Act. There is no express limitation in the Tucker Act 

on the relief that can be granted. The word "claim" has 

been read implicitly to incorporate a limitation on the 

kind of relief that can be granted.

 Therefore, in section 1500, a suit for or in 

respect to a claim in the Court of Federal Claims must 

mean a suit for or in respect to a demand for relief 

that the Court of Claims can grant, and where 

duplicative relief is being sought, that falls within 

the language of the statute. It falls within the 

overall jurisdictional scheme which directs plaintiffs 

to bring suits for different relief in different courts, 

and it also appears with cotton claimants.

The cotton claimants were seeking 

duplicative relief, and that's the concern that Congress 

aimed at. Congress was not faced in 1868 with a 

situation in which plaintiffs had been directed to seek 

different non-duplicative remedies, remedies that 

weren't substitutes for one another but complimented one 

another in two different courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I had under the impression 

that sometimes they sued for some money out of a fund, 

which would have been partial, and other times they sued 

for the value of the cotton, and other times they sued 

for the cotton itself, which in certain circumstances 

could have been worth a lot more. By the time of suit, 

it went up. I mean, do we know it was always 

duplicative in those cotton suits?

 MS. SPINELLI: I believe we do know it was 

always duplicative, notwithstanding the fact that the 

amount that one might recover might differ.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if the amount 

differs, then, why do you suppose the cotton belonged to 

the Indian Tribe? On the one hand, they want an 

accounting out of the money ever earned out of this 

cotton in the past and on the other hand, they want what 

the cotton is worth in the future on the -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That's Justice Scalia's 

question.

 MS. SPINELLI: That is not duplicative. 

What is duplicative is a remedy that is either the same, 

or a remedy that serves as a substitute for another 

remedy. And what this Court has said, though, is that 

even if it's not a completely full substitute -- even 

if, say, the damages sought in one court are less than 

the damages sought in another -- if they are duplicative 

relief for the same injury, they are barred by section 

1500. And I think that is completely consistent with 

the holding in Keene.

 In Keene, the plaintiff was bringing 

multiple suits against the United States in different 

courts for duplicative relief, money, and compensation 

for funds it had paid out to asbestos claimants. And 

notwithstanding the fact that it brought some of those 

suits on a contract theory and some of those suits on an 

equitable tort theory of indemnification, the statute 

barred those. But Keene was not faced with a situation 

in which the plaintiffs were forced, as in Casman, to 

proceed in two different courts to obtain different 

relief.

 And another particularly good example is an 

example of a regulatory taking suit, in which if a

plaintiff wants to challenge the legality of government 

regulation affecting his property, he needs to do that 

in the district court under the APA. And according to 

the government, he cannot bring a suit for just 

compensation in the Court of Federal Claims until that 

district court suit is completed and any appeal is 

completed and any cert petition is completed, by which 

time the six-year statute of limitations on the just 

compensation claim may very well have expired.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your case -- now, 

let's assume the government prevails. You go to the 

CFC, and you prevail on everything. You get all the 

findings in your favor and so forth. There is some 

relief that you don't get.

 I take it, unless I am missing something, 

that you could then, after the CFC suit is finished, go 

to district court and say: Now we want this added 

protection, this added relief.

 MS. SPINELLI: The reason -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the statute wouldn't 

have run generally, because if you are seeking the 

injunction, it's only latches bars you, and you are not 

barred by latches because you couldn't have gone sooner.

why that doesn't work, Justice Kennedy. First of all,

the Nation needs the accounting now. I mean, it's as if 

in Casman, Casman had been told, well, you know, first 

get reinstated -- I'm sorry -- first get your backpay; 

then go get reinstated. He needs his -- the Nation 

needs the accounting now, not later. In addition, if it 

were the case that the accounting uncovered additional 

mismanagement, this statute of limitations, the six-year 

statute of limitations might well expire while the 

district court suit for an accounting is pending, those 

suits tend to last a very long time. Indeed in the 

Indian Claims Commission they have been known to last 

for up to 50 years. And it would force the Nation to 

run the risk of losing its right to damages. We don't 

believe that's what Congress had in mind. It doesn't 

harmonize Section 1500 with the remainder of the 

statutory scheme. It's not mandated by the history of 

the statute, and it simply doesn't make sense.

 Unless there are further questions, we ask 

for the judgment be affirmed.

basis for its same relief defense to the court of 

federal claims. If it's definition of claim is as 

narrow and circumscribed as it defines, it wouldn't 

capture the cotton claim. Moreover, putting aside the 

definition of claim, the statute applies when there is a 

pending suit or process in another court. That is not 

only for the claim, but in respect to the claim. That 

substantially broadens the statute.

 Two, there are two problems with the same 

relief test that's as a practical matter. In order to 

determine whether the same relief is being sought in the 

other court, which is the relevant question under their 

test, you have to ask, what relief would be sought in 

district court. But Rule 54(c) makes clear that the 

relief which is available in district court is not 

specified by the complaint, it's whatever develops 

through the case. So you might not know until the very 

end whether duplicative relief is being sought.

 Secondly, if you are going to limit the 

relief that is available in the district court based on 

what the court of claims' view is of the district 

court's jurisdiction to issue relief, you are inviting 

the court of federal claims and the federal circuit to 

be opining on the jurisdiction of the district court 

under the APA, in very complicated cases which involve

questions of Bowen, Utah Wilderness, this is not the way 

that you would construe normally a jurisdictional 

statute.

 The specter of 50-year old suits proceeding 

simultaneously in the court of federal claims in 

district court certainly would have motivated, or spoken 

to the Congress that enacted Section 1500's predecessor 

in 1868.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 

your friend that there are differences between the 

accounting you can get in the district court and the 

accounting you can get in the court of federal claims as 

a prelude to monetary damages?

 MR. YANG: I'm not exactly sure the 

differences that they are pointing to. There are 

differences in terms of the procedure and what is a 

relief. The other you would have to show that there was 

some kind of a breach and you get a full kind of 

accounting to quantify damages that relate -- in aid of 

judgment. But at the end of the day, the example, 

losing $10 and you collect 20 but only debit -- put 10 

on the books, that is a claim which is cognizable in the 

court of federal claims if they have a money mandating

MR. YANG: That's what discovery -- that's 

what discovery is for. The Ak-Chin case, for instance. 

33,000 boxes of discovery we have to go through in terms 

of a discovery request in the court of federal claims. 

This is done -- this is the way cases normally proceed. 

They do not proceed on dual tracks where the very 

premise of liability in the court of federal claims is 

being litigated in district court, or they are seeking 

to challenge, you know, an accounting. Accounting 

normally would be, you know, here's an account of 

your -- your assets, but they're seeking to challenge 

it. If you went back to equity, for instance. A 

trustee does, as an equitable matter, have a duty to 

account when requested. But the cost of the accounting 

is taken out of the trust corpus. That's not what is 

going on here. They are trying to seek to use the APA 

to force something which we don't think is authorized 

under statute as a secondary means of discovery for the 

same claims that are at issue in the court of federal 

claims. That type of duplicative litigation and the 

burden on the federal courts is precisely what Section 

1500 was intended to prevent against, and in the absence 

of a textual basis for the same relief test that the
