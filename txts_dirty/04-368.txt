3           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

4 now in Arthur Andersen v. United States.

5           Ms. Mahoney.

6            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

7                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8           MS. MAHONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court: 

10           The Government concedes that the destruction of

11 documents in anticipation of a proceeding was not a crime

12 in the fall of 2001 based upon a statutory rule that

13 Congress had preserved for over a century.  The central

14 question in this case is whether Congress, nevertheless,

15 intended to make a polite request to engage in that lawful

16 conduct, a form of witness tampering punishable by ten

17 years in prison.  We ask this Court to reject that

18 interpretation of the statute and to hold that Arthur

19 Andersen did not commit a crime.

20           I'd like to turn first to the term "corruptly

21 persuade" as it's used in Section 1512 and explain why

22 Arthur Andersen's interpretation represents not only a

23 reasonable reading, but the best reading of the language

24 in the statute.

25           The first thing that we see when we look at the



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

4

1 statutory context is that Congress did not prohibit -- did

2 not prohibit -- all persuasion to destroy documents for

3 the specific purpose of making them unavailable for use in

4 an official proceeding.  It did not, because it did not

5 simply say, "Anyone who persuades a witness to do this has

6 violated the statute."  It added a very important

7 limitation, and that is the word "corruptly" -- "corruptly

8 persuades."

9           So what kinds of requests are excluded from the

10 definition?  When is it that it's okay to persuade someone

11 to destroy a document for use in an official proceeding? 

12 And the answer, we think, based on the traditional meaning

13 of the term "corruptly," is that "corruptly" means that

14 you have persuaded someone in a fashion that uses improper

15 means, such as bribery, or you've asked the witness to

16 violate duties imposed by other law, whether that's the

17 duties imposed by contempt or the duties imposed by a

18 whole range of statutes that govern the obligations of

19 people in our society.

20           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose you persuaded --

21 and I know that is not this case -- suppose you persuaded

22 the person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a

23 fraud.  Would that be corrupt?

24           MS. MAHONEY:  If -- Your Honor, if it was a

25 crime, then, yes --



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

5

1           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in order to -- let's say

2 it's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and

3 you persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to

4 conceal the fraud.

5           MS. MAHONEY:  Okay, if this is in a -- in the

6 course of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to

7 be a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by

8 Section 1512.  If it is in advance of a proceeding -- and

9 let's assume that you know that a proceeding --

10           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

11           MS. MAHONEY:  -- is likely, then the answer

12 depends on whether you know that you are concealing --

13 that you know a crime has been committed.  And if you know

14 that a crime has bee committed, then you are violating a

15 federal statute, 18 U.S.C. --

16           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question is, Does that give

17 -- would that give some content to the meaning of

18 "corruptly," in your view?

19           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, in that case, if the witness

20 knows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking

21 them to violate, they have a duty, under those

22 circumstances, not to assist you in concealing your

23 offense.  That's a duty that's imposed by criminal law. 

24 So if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are

25 corrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

6

1 fall within the interpretation of the statute that Arthur

2 Andersen is advancing here.

3           And it fits, Your Honor, with what Congress

4 really did for a hundred years before 2002.  What it did

5 is, it said that -- under the Pettibone rule, that it is

6 not a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of

7 a proceeding.  But if you know that -- if you know that a

8 crime has been -- a crime has been committed and you

9 destroy documents, that is a crime.  

10           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  May I --

11           MS. MAHONEY:  That's a crime --

12           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- may I ask you about

13 another provision, Section 1515(c)?  And that says, this

14 chapter -- and it -- and it's referring back to Section

15 1512 -- "does not prohibit or punish the providing of

16 lawful bona fide legal representation services in

17 connection with, or anticipation of, an official

18 proceeding." 

19           Now, how -- did Ms. Temple invoke that provision

20 in this case?

21           MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, the -- that section

22 was not argued to the District Court, but it was invoked

23 in the following way, in two ways.  First of all, there

24 was evidence introduced in the case that she was providing

25 legal advice.  And since it is not in affirmative defense,



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

7

1 it really was the Government's burden at all times, at

2 least once there was evidence introduced that she was

3 providing legal advice, to get a finding from the jury

4 that she was not engaged in bona fide and lawful services,

5 particularly in this case, Your Honor, where the

6 Government argued, told the jury, that Nancy Temple was

7 the, quote, "central figure," end quote, in this -- in

8 this episode.  And in addition --

9           JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you know it's not an

10 affirmative defense?

11           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, it doesn't read like an

12 affirmative defense, Your Honor.  It doesn't say

13 "affirmative defense."  It simply -- and in -- when it was

14 introduced, it was listed in the legislation as a Rule of

15 Construction.  And I think that's exactly how it reads. 

16 It doesn't purport to put the burden of proof on Andersen,

17 or on Nancy Temple.

18           And, Your honor, I think, actually --

19           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, of course, it has the

20 word "lawful," "the providing of lawful bona fide legal

21 representation services."  So, you know, it could be

22 argued that if she violating the other provisions, she's

23 still in violation.

24           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, Your Honor, under the

25 Government's definition of "corruptly," she couldn't have



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

8

1 been providing lawful bona fide services.

2           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, that's what I want to

3 know, is, in light of the Government's position and the

4 way this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what

5 does it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision?  I'm

6 just curious how it all plays out.

7           MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, I think it negates it

8 in its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in

9 this case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding

10 ability of a possible future proceeding, even if the

11 Andersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that

12 their conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt.  They

13 were instructed that they must find that.

14           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, does that have the

15 effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your

16 view?

17           MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely.  But I think, Your

18 Honor -- because I think it would be impossible to satisfy

19 it under this instruction.  In addition, I also think that

20 the -- that this provision really just demonstrates that

21 the Government's interpretation of "corruptly" is wrong,

22 to begin with.

23           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What's the effect, in

24 1512(b), of the word "knowingly"?

25           MS. MAHONEY:  I think, Your Honor, that



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

9

1 "knowingly" means, in this context -- just as it means

2 "knowingly intimidate," "knowingly threatened," "knowingly

3 corruptly persuade" -- that means that you have to know

4 that your persuasion is asking the witness to violate

5 their duties, to violate the law.  You have to know that

6 it's corrupt.

7           JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that satisfied at least

8 by the part of the definition that refers to "subverting

9 an official proceeding"?  I mean, that certainly carries,

10 to me, the implication that you realize that you're doing

11 something wrong.  An official proceeding is, prima facie

12 at least, lawful, and you are subverting it.  Doesn't that

13 satisfy the "knowingly" requirement?

14           MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor,

15 because the definition that was given to this jury was

16 "subvert, undermine, or impede," and not just the

17 integrity of the proceeding; but, rather, the fact-finding

18 ability of a future proceeding --

19           JUSTICE SOUTER:  I --

20           MS. MAHONEY:  -- including a governmental

21 inquiry.

22           JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- I think I would go far in

23 agreeing with you if the -- if the instruction had been

24 "merely to impede" or "merely to undermine."  Now, I guess

25 that gets to a question I wanted somebody to answer, and



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

10

1 you can probably do it.  Did the -- did the Court, in

2 giving the instructions, ever refer -- in defining the

3 term, ever refer to any of these three possibilities,

4 separately, or did it do it simply as "subvert, undermine,

5 or" -- what was the third? -- impede"?

6           MS. MAHONEY:  Impede.  I believe -- I believe it

7 was done as a -- as a -- as a group.

8           JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  It did --

9           MS. MAHONEY:  But it says "or."

10           JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- one other question.  In

11 anticipation of that instruction -- I assume the counsel

12 new what was coming -- did the Government ever argue to

13 the jury that "merely impeding," alone, or "merely

14 undermining," alone, would be sufficient, as distinct from

15 saying, "If he subverts, undermines, and impedes"?

16           MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, I'm not certain of the

17 answer, except that I do know that the Government did

18 argue that simply -- the mere idea that David Duncan

19 testified that, you know, he thought that the -- somebody

20 at the SEC might want to look at this information someday

21 was sufficient to satisfy the instructions.  And so, I

22 think it is a fair inference that the way that they argued

23 this case to the jury was that any intent to keep any kind

24 of information away from the SEC was enough to satisfy the

25 definition in this case.  And, in fact, Your Honor, when



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 the instructions were being debated, the pattern

2 instruction for the Fifth Circuit for "corruptly," under

3 1503, actually is -- includes the words "knowingly or

4 dishonestly to subvert the integrity of the proceeding." 

5 The Government insisted that the word "dishonestly" not be

6 used, that the word "impede" be added, and they changed

7 "fact-finding" a bit -- changed it from "subverting the

8 proceedings" to "the fact-finding ability."  They did

9 everything they could to strip this instruction of any

10 mens rea, and then went beyond that and said, "And in

11 addition, even if the Andersen employees had a good-faith

12 and sincere belief that their conduct did not violate the

13 law, it's still a crime."

14           So, what we have here is an array of testimony

15 from people who say, "We honestly believed that this was

16 permissible conduct," but the jury was told that they had

17 to convict anyway if there was any possible partial

18 motivation to impede possible future fact-finding --

19           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does --

20           MS. MAHONEY:  -- of an inquiry.

21           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- how does -- how does David

22 Duncan's guilty plea -- he entered a plea of guilty to a

23 charge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to

24 impede the SEC investigation by shredding documents.  So,

25 what were the elements of that offense that are absent in



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

12

1 this one?

2           MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, he plead guilty to the

3 offense, as described to him and agreed upon between him

4 and his lawyer; in other -- and the Government -- which is

5 basically the instruction that was given in this case. 

6 When he testified in this proceeding, he repeatedly said,

7 despite his guilty plea, that he did not believe, at the

8 time, that he had done anything unlawful or improper.  He

9 said, "I thought my conduct was perfectly appropriate.  I

10 plead guilty because I was persuaded that it didn't matter

11 what I thought at the time."  

12           JUSTICE SCALIA:  What sentence did he get, by

13 the way?

14           MS. MAHONEY:  He's not been sentenced yet, Your

15 Honor.

16           And he was explicit throughout.  He also said --

17 he never testified that he even thought that an SEC

18 proceeding was probable at the time; he just thought it

19 was possible.  Nor did he say that he ever consciously

20 tried to hide the truth or hide the facts.  What he did

21 say is that, "Yes, part of what was on my mind at the time

22 that I asked for compliance with this policy was that the

23 SEC and others might want to look at these files someday,

24 and I'd better get them in compliance with our retention

25 policy, because I know that drafts and notes are the kinds



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

13

1 of things that could be misused and misconstrued at some

2 point in the future."  That was the basis of his guilty

3 plea, that was the basis of his testimony in this case. 

4 And the Government's interpretation, the instructions that

5 were given to this jury, deprived the term "corruptly

6 persuade" of any of its ordinary and traditional meaning.

7           Under the Government's view, for instance, of

8 "corruptly," bribery becomes irrelevant under this

9 statute.  I mean, if you look at this statute, and you

10 say, "What was Congress trying to prohibit here when it

11 says" -- it's a got a list of wrongful means of

12 interfering with witnesses.  It says "intimidate" and

13 "threaten" and "use of physical force," and it says

14 "corruptly persuades."  The first thing that would come to

15 your mind is bribery.  But bribery is irrelevant under the

16 Government's interpretation, and let me explain why.

17 Because they say that, "Well, yes, it's true, it says

18 'corruptly persuade,' but all that means if you -- is if

19 you had any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a

20 proceeding, then you're guilty, just for asking.  It

21 doesn't matter whether you used any money -- monetary

22 compensation in order to extract this behavior; you're

23 automatically guilty.  But if you use bribery --

24           JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume it also would make

25 "intimidate," and so forth, quite superfluous.



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

14

1           MS. MAHONEY:  It absolutely would, Your Honor,

2 because it would basically cover any kind of request.

3           But, in addition, they say that under their

4 definition what it really means is that if you did it for

5 some other motive, if you got them to destroy the document

6 so that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding --

7 and that was your intent, that it couldn't be used in an

8 official proceeding -- and you bribed them to do it, but

9 your motive was to avoid embarrassment, it would not be a

10 crime.  Under Andersen's interpretation, it would still be

11 a crime, because of course you have corruptly persuaded

12 them to destroy a document for use in an official

13 proceeding, even if -- at the appropriate time, if there

14 is a nexus -- because it doesn't matter whether you were

15 trying to avoid embarrassment; if you were bribing them to

16 keep it out of the -- of the proceeding, of course that

17 would be covered by the traditional definition of

18 "corruptly persuade."

19           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you're anticipating a

20 revenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from

21 the SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not

22 required to keep, but that would make the officials' task

23 easier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of

24 days, instead of -- it's going to take him a week.  Can

25 you make it harder for him?



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

15

1           MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, under Section 1519,

2 now, it may well be that that is criminal behavior,

3 because it -- Congress has now, basically, required you to

4 preserve documents.  But, at the time, no, that would not

5 have been a crime.  And if you could do it yourself, then

6 asking your wife to throw them out instead can't be what

7 Congress really had in mind under Section 1512.  You know,

8 hypothetical, the man could throw it out himself and not

9 go to jail, but if he asked his wife to do it, then he

10 goes to jail for ten years.

11           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is, in the case, this

12 lingering feeling that something's wrong out there.  I

13 know that we don't -- we don't convict people on that

14 basis; we require something more specific.

15           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, and I think that this

16 statute, reasonably read, Your Honor, tells you exactly

17 what that specific thing is.  If you intimidate them, if

18 you mislead them, if you use physical force, if you

19 corruptly persuade them.  And that means either you've

20 used unlawful means, like bribery, or you asked them to

21 violate their independent legal duties.  And that

22 definition, Your Honor, is quite consistent with the

23 traditional interpretation of the term "corruptly," even

24 in the obstruction statutes. 

25           And I'd like to just emphasize, for instance, in



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

16

1 a tampering case, a juror tampering case that preceded the

2 congressional adoption of the term "corruptly persuades,"

3 the Jackson case, the jury was specifically instructed

4 that "corruptly" means "knowingly and willfully, with the

5 specific intent to influence a juror to violate his duties

6 as a petit juror."

7      Similarly, in Aguilar, in the District Court, the

8 jury was instructed -- that was a tampering case -- quote,

9 "an act is done corruptly if it is done voluntarily and

10 intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or

11 a lawful result by some unlawful method," end quote.

12      This is exactly parallel to the interpretation that

13 Andersen is asking this Court to adopt.  And if that if

14 that interpretation is adopted, it makes sense of this

15 statute.  If this statute isn't read in reference to the

16 violation of other legal duties, than it covers a whole

17 range of conduct that is unquestionably innocent --

18           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose I just don't like the

19 IRS, and I know they're coming.  I have some very detailed

20 summaries which will give them the answer they need right

21 away.  I throw away those summaries and make them go back

22 to the original records just to make it tough for them. 

23 Can I do that?

24           MS. MAHONEY:  Section 1519, I don't think you

25 can.  Could you have done that in the -- in the fall of



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

17

1 2001?  Yes, Your Honor, you could.  What that really

2 reflects is the Pettibone rule.  The Pettibone rule, for a

3 hundred years, was that destruction and other kinds of

4 acts of potential obstruction in advance of a proceeding

5 were not a crime.

6           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Mahoney, we -- you know, we

7 all know that what are euphemistically termed "record-

8 retention programs" are, in fact, record-destruction

9 programs, and that one of the purposes of the destruction

10 is to eliminate from the files information that private

11 individuals can use for lawsuits and that Government

12 investigators can use for investigations.  And there has

13 been nothing unlawful about having such a program, even if

14 one of your purposes is not to leave lying around in the

15 file stuff that can be used against you by either the

16 government or a private individual.

17           So, I would have thought that your argument was

18 very persuasive, except for the fact of 1519.  I think

19 that 1519 gives me cause to believe that Congress could,

20 indeed, say, "You can't have record-retention programs." 

21 How else do you interpret 1519?

22           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, they certainly hadn't said

23 it in the fall of 2001, Your Honor.  And so, for that

24 reason --

25           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but I -- well, yeah, but



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

18

1 --
2           MS. MAHONEY:  But --
3           JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but your argument is, you
4 know, "It's inconceivable that they would have meant
5 that."  But, my -- they said it in 1519 --
6           MS. MAHONEY:  Well --
7           JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- -- in 2002.
8           MS. MAHONEY:  -- let me put it this way.  If
9 they're gonna -- if they're going to say it, though, they

10 have to say it with very clear language, because,
11 otherwise, there would be no fair warning.  You couldn't
12 conclude from the language of the witness-tampering
13 statute, which is designed to protect witnesses, that
14 Congress had made all record-retention programs unlawful.
15           I also think, Your Honor, that when it comes
16 time to construe Section 1519, some kind of nexus will
17 have to be, you know, reasonably read in there, because,
18 otherwise, you are correct, all document retention
19 policies, or virtually all of them, are fatally doomed.
20           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  And what is a
21 "document"?  I mean, in Justice Kennedy's example, is it
22 just some handwritten notes?  Do they become "documents"?
23           MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And, in
24 this case, the evidence was quite clear that, you know,
25 Andersen retained its work papers, and the work papers



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

19

1 were extremely extensive, and they were required to fully

2 document the audit.  The only things that were thrown away

3 were notes and preliminary drafts, which had already been

4 incorporated, in effect, into the final conclusions in the

5 work papers; and yet that was the whole theory of this

6 case, is that there were some documents that were

7 destroyed.  They were precisely the kinds of documents

8 that document-retention policies are designed to

9 eliminate, in part -- for a variety of reasons, but, in

10 part, because they are preliminary in character and they

11 can be misconstrued.

12           For instance, Your Honor, the FBI agents,

13 generally speaking, have the practice of not keeping their

14 notes of interviews.  They take those notes, they make a

15 file memorandum, they throw away the notes.  Why do they

16 do that?  Of course they know the defendant would love to

17 have those notes when it comes time for a trial.  They do

18 it because they feel that they have written it up in an

19 accurate way, and enough's enough.

20      That's what we're talking about here, Your Honor. 

21 And there was nothing in the language of 1512 that would

22 have put Andersen on notice that its document-retention

23 policy was -- well, in fact, the Government doesn't say

24 its document retention was a crime; it says it wasn't a

25 crime.  Instead, the crime was when David Duncan asked his



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

20

1 secretary to throw away documents that he could have

2 thrown away, lawfully, himself.  This statute does not

3 give fair warning that that --

4           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Was Section 1519 at issue?

5           MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  Section 1519 did

6 not get passed until the year 2002.  It did not exist. 

7 Instead, the rule that was in force then was the Pettibone

8 rule, the one that's reflected in the text of Section

9 1505; and that is, "the proceeding must be pending." 

10 That's, no doubt, why the Government didn't charge

11 Andersen with a crime under Section 1505.  I mean, they

12 make it sound like the culpability here is the destruction

13 of records.  Well, if so, then you would think that they

14 would have charged Andersen with destroying documents --

15           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait a minute -- 

16           MS. MAHONEY:  -- but they didn't.

17           JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- wasn't there another

18 provision in effect that said it doesn't matter whether

19 the -- whether the proceeding is pending?  I forget which

20 one it is.

21           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, that -- no, that's just 15-

22 -- that's 1512, for witness tampering.  But for the act of

23 destroying documents to interfere with a proceeding --

24           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

25           MS. MAHONEY:  -- that's Section 1505, and the



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

21

1 proceeding must be pending.  And that is -- that is still

2 the rule today, Your Honor.

3           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- just to make it

4 clear, I take it you would still have the same objection

5 to the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a

6 proceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?

7           MS. MAHONEY:  Well, if a proceeding is -- yes,

8 we would, in this case.  Yes, absolutely.  But, you know,

9 if a proceeding is pending, then it changed the -- changes

10 the way that you apply the definition of "corruptly."  But

11 you're certainly right that the definition is the same. 

12 The question is, under the proper definition of

13 "corruptly," did you induce the witnesses to engage in

14 this activity through improper means, such as bribery, or

15 did you try to get them to violate their independent legal

16 duties?  For instance, if they had duties, under Section

17 1519, not to destroy, then it makes perfect sense, because

18 what you have done is, you have asked the witness to

19 engage in conduct which violates the law, and that

20 corrupts them, it harms them, it fits with the purposes of

21 the statute, it fits with the structure.

22           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, it was proper, then, for

23 Michael Odom to tell the Andersen personnel when he's

24 encouraging them to follow the policy -- he said, "If it's

25 destroyed in the course of normal policy and litigation,



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

22

1 and litigation is filed the next day, that's great.  We

2 followed our policy, and whatever there was that might

3 have been of interest to somebody, it's gone and

4 irretrievable."

5           MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.

6           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's fine for him to make

7 that linkage between, "Destroy it.  Maybe there's going to

8 be litigation filed tomorrow."  "That's great.  It will be

9 gone"?

10           MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, at the time that he

11 made that statement, what that statement actually reflects

12 is the Pettibone rule.  He was accurate in his -- in his

13 statement about what the law was governing document

14 destruction at the time.  That's a good-faith reasonable

15 belief that was absolutely supported by the law.

16      But, more importantly, Your Honor, if we look at Mr.

17 Odom's remarks, he wasn't working -- he wasn't -- this

18 wasn't in connection with the Enron engagement; there were

19 only, I think, ten people, out of, like, 80, at that

20 training seminar that had anything to do with Enron.  He

21 was talking about the firm's document-retention policy. 

22 The jury asked to see that videotape.  They may have

23 actually convicted Andersen based upon his remarks about

24 the document-retention policy.  They, similarly, may have

25 convicted Andersen based upon Nancy Temple's memos that --



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

23

1 one of which was a reminder to the engagement team that

2 they were supposed to applying -- complying with the

3 document-retention policy.  That's legal services.  This 

4 --

5           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Odom wasn't saying this in

6 the abstract.  There were other proceedings, weren't

7 there?

8           MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, it was just a

9 training session that was just a -- a section of the

10 training session.  It has -- literally, I think there were

11 89 attendees, only about ten of them --

12           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At the time of that training,

13 were there not other proceedings involving Arthur

14 Andersen?

15           MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  No, I don't

16 believe so.  That's --

17           JUSTICE SOUTER:  There were, involving Enron, at

18 that point, isn't that correct?  The -- Enron had gotten

19 the letter?

20           MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  That was on

21 October the 10th.  The letter did not come until October

22 the 17th.  Andersen learned about it on October the 19th.

23           I'd like to save the remainder of my time for

24 rebuttal, please.

25           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Ms.

24

1 Mahoney.

2           Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.

3            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

4                  ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

5           MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court: 

7           Arthur Andersen's conduct in this case explains

8 why Congress enacted a statute like Section 1512 that

9 protects against the anticipatory destruction of documents

10 when a proceeding is --

11           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, Section 1519, enacted

12 subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than

13 1512?

14           MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, Section 1519 was

15 enacted after the events --

16           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.

17           MR. DREEBEN:  -- in this case in order to plug

18 the loophole that Arthur Andersen has pointed out existed

19 in Section 1512 at the time.

20           JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you think it's superfluous. 

21 1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise in

22 futility, because the law already did what 1519 said.

23           MR. DREEBEN:  No.  The law did not already do

24 what 1519 says.

25           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wherein does it go further?



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

25

1           MR. DREEBEN:  It reaches single-actor

2 obstructive conduct.  What Ms. Mahoney has said --

3           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what about the

4 Pettibone interpretation that has been outstanding for a

5 long time?

6           MR. DREEBEN:  Pettibone applied, Justice

7 O'Connor, to a specific statute, Section 1503, and it's

8 similarly incorporated in 1505.  Those statutes protected

9 against obstruction of pending judicial, administrative,

10 and congressional proceedings.  The innovation in Section

11 1512 was to reach beyond the existence of a pending

12 proceeding and to ensure that basically the store doesn't

13 get robbed before the proceeding starts.

14      If Arthur Andersen is correct, the anticipation of a

15 grand jury investigation that is thought to occur the next

16 day, a corporation can send out a directive to its

17 employees and say, "Shred all the smoking guns."  It's the

18 corporate equivalent of seeing something that looks like a

19 crime scene and sending somebody in before the police can

20 get the yellow tape up to wipe down the fingerprints.

21           JUSTICE SCALIA:  When can they do it?  When can

22 they do it?  You didn't allege here that it was in

23 anticipation of any particular proceeding.  You say they

24 can't do it once they know that the investigation is on

25 the way.  But your theory in this case is that they can't



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

26

1 do it, whether they know the investigation is on the way

2 or not.  They can't destroy any evidence that might be the

3 subject of an investigation.

4           MR. DREEBEN:  No, that's not our theory --

5           JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is your theory?

6           MR. DREEBEN:  Our theory is that a person acts

7 corruptly when anticipating a reasonable possibility of an

8 investigation into a specific matter, directs another

9 person to destroy documents that are potentially relevant.

10           JUSTICE SCALIA:  "A reasonable possibility of an

11 investigation."

12           MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.

13           JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you want criminal liability

14 to turn upon that.

15           MR. DREEBEN:  I think that --

16           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether or not there is a

17 reasonable possibility of an investigation.  You want

18 somebody to go to jail on how a jury decides that

19 question.

20           MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think there's anything

21 unusual about the decision of that kind of question at

22 all.  It's a analogous, but different and quite

23 distinguishable nexus requirement from the kind of nexus

24 requirement that this Court interpreted Section 1503 to

25 have in the --



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

27

1           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose I have a company and I

2 know that the pattern is, I'm going to be audited every

3 five years by the IRS.  And in year four, I -- one year --

4 one year before the investigation, I instruct my

5 bookkeeping staff, "Keep everything you need to document

6 our expenses, but destroy everything that's remotely

7 related to that, or indirectly related to that.  Give them

8 just a clean, simple file.  Destroy anything that's -- all

9 supporting documentation.  Give them what they need and

10 what they're entitled to have, but nothing else.  And 

11 step up that policy, because they're going to be here next

12 year."  Under your -- it seems to me that that violates

13 your rule.

14           MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Kennedy, it turns on

15 whether the intent there is to subvert, undermine, or

16 impede the proceeding.  And the answer is, if it is yes,

17 then it would be prohibited by this statute.

18           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it would be prohibited to

19 tell somebody to do it.

20           MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.

21           JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you could do it.  The doing

22 of it is perfectly okay.

23           MR. DREEBEN:  That was a --

24           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't that seem strange to

25 you?



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

28

1           MR. DREEBEN:  It seemed strange to Congress,

2 too.  And when this case threw a spotlight on that

3 omission in the statute, Congress didn't react --

4           JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would suggest that it throws

5 a spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong.  It

6 doesn't -- 

7           [Laughter.] 

8           JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it doesn't make -- it

9 doesn't make any sense to make unlawful the asking of

10 somebody to do something which is, itself, not unlawful,

11 so that the person could do it, but if you asked them to

12 do it, you're guilty, he's not guilty.  And that's -- that

13 is weird.

14           [Laughter.] 

15           MR. DREEBEN:  What was weird about it, Justice

16 Scalia, is that it allowed the person to do it himself. 

17 And when Congress --

18           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, let me ask you about

19 this precise thing.  Is it Mr. Duncan?  If he had,

20 himself, shredded the documents, or destroyed them, that

21 was perfectly okay at the time it was done.

22           MR. DREEBEN:  It wasn't --

23           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is that right?

24           MR. DREEBEN:  -- prohibited by this statute. 

25 And when -- 



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

29

1           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It would not have been a

2 violation.

3           MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.

4           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But the Government got the

5 conviction, got him to plead guilty, apparently, on the

6 basis that if he asked somebody else to do what was

7 perfectly lawful for him to do, it would violate the

8 statute.

9           MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, Justice O'Connor.

10           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what -- how do you read

11 that in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor

12 provision for legal advice and so on?

13           MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that the safe-harbor

14 provision substantially bears on this case at all.  First

15 of all, Arthur Andersen never raised the safe-harbor

16 provision, so that the Government would --

17           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And the woman lawyer never

18 raised it, is that right?

19           MR. DREEBEN:  Nancy Temple was not a defendant

20 in this case, but her conduct was at issue, because, after

21 having immediately recognized that an SEC investigation

22 was highly probable, Nancy Temple sends out a document

23 reminder saying --

24           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well --

25           MR. DREEBEN:  -- basically, "purge the files."



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

30

1           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But under this statute, with

2 the safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her,

3 as a lawyer, to say, "You can destroy these documents"?

4           MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it is, in this case, if her

5 intent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the --

6           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your definition of

7 "subvert, undermine" is, if you destroy any document that

8 might raise a question, say, in the IRS audit.  It seems

9 to me that is a sweeping position, which will cause

10 problems for every major corporation or small business in

11 this country.  I just -- I just don't understand it.

12           MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,

13 because the Government's position here has never been that

14 the mere existence of a document-destruction policy used

15 under routine circumstances is a violation of the statute. 

16 What the Government focused on in this case was using a

17 document-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to

18 clean up and purge files when a government investigation

19 was anticipated and it was perceived that these materials

20 would be relevant.

21           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's like in -- the

22 old -- the rule in the Army, "Make two copies of

23 everything you throw out."  I mean, that's what they're

24 going to have to do.

25           [Laughter.] 



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

31

1           MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think --

2           JUSTICE BREYER:  You used words --

3           MR. DREEBEN:  Under this statute, Justice

4 Kennedy, that's not the issue.  I think the timeline here

5 is critical.  This was not a company that was routinely

6 exercising a document-destruction policy, or document-

7 retention policy, to maintain only that which was

8 necessary for its ongoing business.

9           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, it was.  The training

10 session that you introduced in evidence was precisely

11 that, a general training session for all employees,

12 saying, "This is our document," quote, "retention policy."

13           MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but that was triggered, in

14 part, by Nancy Temple's recognition -- in the midst of

15 serving on a crisis response team, recognizing that Enron

16 was in the process of imploding, Arthur Andersen, which

17 was basically on probation with the SEC -- because it had

18 been previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior

19 summer, and was under a cease and desist order -- and

20 seeing the SEC coming down the pike, at that moment, she

21 decides to remind the Enron team, which had not been at

22 all compliant with this document-retention policy, "It's

23 time to get the files in line."  This wasn't because all

24 of a sudden the company had become preoccupied with

25 neatness; it was so that it could document, in its audit



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

32

1 work papers, those things that supported its conclusions. 

2 That's what its document policy said.

3           JUSTICE SCALIA:  He says that occurred before

4 Enron had even gotten a letter.

5           MR. DREEBEN:  But not --

6           JUSTICE SCALIA:  That meeting.

7           MR. DREEBEN:  -- not before Enron's problems had

8 begun to become -- surfacing in the Wall Street Journal,

9 in the financial press, the stock price was sliding. 

10 Everybody who was sophisticated in this environment -- and

11 surely Arthur Andersen was -- knew that when a Fortune 500

12 company is looking at a potential need to restate its

13 income statements because the accountants have been --

14 proved a black-and-white violation of GAAP, and they all

15 knew that that was true, that SEC proceedings are likely

16 to occur.  Even the witness --

17           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you -- if you had alleged

18 that they did this in order to cover up a fraud, there

19 would be no problem.  But what you're doing is to say it's

20 illegal to do what every other company in the country can

21 do if they don't have an audit immediately on the horizon. 

22 I just don't understand it.

23           MR. DREEBEN:  No other company in the country

24 would do this, Justice Kennedy.  This is an extraordinary

25 case precisely because --



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

33

1           JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say that it would be

2 perfectly okay for this company, or any other one, to

3 destroy their documents.  What's bad is telling somebody

4 to destroy the documents.

5           MR. DREEBEN:  But in an organizational context,

6 that's the only way that directives like this can be given

7 out and implemented.  This wasn't a case of --

8           JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you know that the --

9 you've put your finger on a problem for me.  You have

10 said, Would it be the case that a person, before the

11 proceeding begins, could simply tell somebody else to

12 destroy the smoking gun?  I understand that you fear that

13 Andersen's approach would lead to that result.  And it's

14 bothering me.  Therefore, I'd like you whether the word

15 "corruptly" could include a person who knows three things:

16 one, that the investigation, which has not yet started,

17 almost certainly will want this document; two, there is no

18 legal right to withhold it; and, three, that if I tell him

19 to do it, it will be destroyed -- I mean, that it's

20 important to the investigation.  Important to the

21 investigation, they want it, it's cover-up, and they will,

22 in fact, have no legal right to take it back.  Now, would

23 that be "corrupt"?

24           MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it would --

25           JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.

1           MR. DREEBEN:  -- be "corrupt."

2           JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  IF that's "corrupt,"

3 then does that cover this case?

4           MR. DREEBEN:  I think that it does cover this

5 case, and --

6           JUSTICE BREYER:  How?  Because it seems to me

7 there was quite a lot of -- by the way, the person who's

8 doing the persuading has to know this.  They have to know

9 that it will be wanted, that it's important, and there is

10 no legal right to withhold it.  So it seems to me that, on

11 the one hand, that does cover your problem, and, on the

12 other hand, it does not cover this case.  Now, that's what

13 I'd like you to reply to.

14           MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think that

15 the facts of the case are subsumed within the description

16 that you've given.  The jury instructions did not require

17 findings on all of those features; and that is, in large

18 part, because of the kinds of instructions that Arthur

19 Andersen --

20           JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  The jury instruction left

21 out the word "corruptly," as far as I can see, in the part

22 that was critical.  They define "corruptly" as simply an

23 intent to impede.  And the word "impede" goes well beyond

24 what I've said, both because it does not cover the three

25 things, but, most particularly, because it does not say



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

35

1 that it was dishonest or that the person who did the

2 persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the

3 investigation would have the legal right to get the

4 material and there was no right to withhold it.  The words

5 that Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say

6 precisely that, were at least a step in the right

7 direction.

8           MR. DREEBEN:  The jury instruction said less

9 than what you have suggested, Justice Breyer, no question

10 about it, but what they did require was that there be an

11 intent to undermine, subvert, or impede the investigation. 

12 I think --

13           JUSTICE SOUTER:  Wasn't -- wasn't that

14 instruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be

15 the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of

16 what was being done was no defense?  I mean, if you had an

17 instruction that depended upon the word "subvert," I could

18 -- I could understand your argument.  But it seems to me

19 that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty

20 with your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond

21 "subvert" to merely "impede," and it included an

22 instruction that good faith was no defense.

23           MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Souter, this is to

24 statute, and the word "corruptly" is not a word, that has

25 been ever construed to require consciousness of



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

36

1 illegality.  That is a --

2           JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about "knowingly"?

3           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yeah, the word "knowingly."

4           JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about "knowingly"?  Does

5 that -- does that usually connote knowledge of the

6 illegality?

7           MR. DREEBEN:  Definitely not.  The word

8 "knowingly" usually connotes knowledge of the underlying

9 facts.  And, in this case --

10           JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Knowingly corruptly."

11           MR. DREEBEN:  The word "knowingly" does not

12 travel down the statute to modify "corruptly."  It --

13           JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't see why it doesn't.  I

14 mean, there's no grammatical break.

15           MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there is a logical break,

16 because if it travel down the statute and reach all the

17 way to "misleading conduct," what Congress would have

18 written is a statute, when you read the definition of

19 "misleading conduct," that says, "whoever knowingly

20 knowingly makes a false statement," because the definition

21 of misleading conduct includes "knowingly making false

22 statements," "knowingly omitting things," "intentionally

23 engaging in deceptive behavior."  And you'd end up with a

24 -- in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever.  

25           It makes sense for Congress to have said,



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

37

1 "knowingly used force or intimidation."  But then when you

2 get to the word "threat," there is inherent knowledge in

3 it.  "Corruptly" inherently embodies knowledge.  And the

4 definition of "misleading conduct" inherently --

5           JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's certainly --

6           MR. DREEBEN:  -- embodies knowledge.

7           JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, I will -- I will grant

8 you that the definition that the Government asked for, and

9 got, for "corruptly persuades," does have that

10 implication, so far as the "subvert" prong is concerned. 

11 But when you get beyond the "subvert" prong, and you get

12 down to the third one, "merely to impede," you're getting

13 pretty thin, so far as the -- as the implication of

14 knowledge of wrongdoing is concerned, and you've still go

15 the problem of the instruction that negated good faith is

16 a defense.

17           MR. DREEBEN:  Let me try to address each of

18 those.  First of all, the words were used as a definition

19 of "improper purpose," and they were used together,

20 "subvert, undermine, or impede," and they logically have a

21 relationship to each other.  When the Court of Appeals

22 looked at those words and defined them, which it did, it

23 talked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining

24 of the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that

25 the Government was anticipated to make.  And I think,



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

38

1 "impede" has to be read logically in that group.  Now, I

2 will acknowledge that "impeding" can have broader

3 connotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the

4 obstruction --

5           JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why did -- if that is so, why

6 did you need it?  In other words, you had a -- you had a

7 pattern instruction, apparently, that was -- that was

8 keyed to "subversion," which I think would be an easy

9 argument for you.  If the addition of "impede" really

10 wasn't adding that much, why did you ask the Court to put

11 it in there?

12           MR. DREEBEN:  Here is what it adds, Justice

13 Souter.  "Undermine" and "subvert" have a connotation of

14 completely preventing the performance of the official duty

15 in the proceeding.  "Impede" removes any implication that

16 you need to totally thwart the government activity in

17 order to be guilty of this crime.  It's enough to

18 "interfere" with it, which is the word that the Court of

19 Appeals used to define it.

20           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  But you could

21 undermine and be unsuccessful.  It's not as though

22 undermine means that you're necessarily going to succeed.

23           MR. DREEBEN:  No, but it was to avoid any

24 connotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of

25 those words that the Government sought the use of the word



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

39

1 "impede."  And I should note that it appears, in Section

2 1503, Section 1505 -- 

3           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But not in 1512.

4           MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  That's correct. 

5 But what --

6           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It's not there.

7           MR. DREEBEN:  -- what the Government was doing

8 in this instance was attempting to give content to the

9 word "corruptly" that would enable the jurors to know that

10 they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in

11 dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext

12 to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-

13 finding ability of an anticipated proceeding.

14           JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, but it sounds like --

15 actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute,

16 but that's, in a sense, my problem.  The statute talks

17 about "corruptly persuading another person to destroy a

18 paper with the intent to impair that paper's availability

19 for use in an official proceeding."  So, then we look at

20 the instruction, and the instruction speaks of "destroying

21 the paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede." 

22 Fine.  It sounds like it's just the same as the statute,

23 but for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the

24 word "corruptly."

25           MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, it's a definition



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

40

1 of "corruptly" that --

2           JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So to define

3 "corruptly" as "doing the same thing that the rest of the

4 statute does" seems a little strange.  If I were a juror,

5 I might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of

6 purpose.

7           MR. DREEBEN:  The Court of Appeals addressed the

8 argument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of

9 "corruptly" that was used in this case is redundant and

10 superfluous in light of the additional intent that --

11           JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not perfectly redundant. 

12 One can imagine driving a wedge between making something

13 unavailable, which the jury would find relevant, or the

14 investigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact-

15 finding ability of the investigator.  They're not

16 logically identical, but they do strike me as so similar

17 that it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a

18 difference between those two phrases.

19           MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that they have a

20 very significant difference, an important function in

21 ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope

22 of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is

23 what Congress intended it to do.

24           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge

25 me to go back to a previous answer you gave?  I'm sorry, I



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

41

1 didn't quite get it.  In responding to Justice Souter's

2 inquiry concerning the word "knowingly," you said the word

3 "knowingly" appears later, so that it would be -- it would

4 be reduplicative.  What later appearance are you talking

5 about, in 1512(b)?

6           MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, on page 5(a) --

7 or, I'm sorry, on page 3(a) --

8           JUSTICE SCALIA:  3(a), right.

9           MR. DREEBEN:  -- of the Government's appendix --

10           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

11           MR. DREEBEN:  -- to its brief, at the bottom of

12 the page, subsection (b) --

13           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

14           MR. DREEBEN:  -- appears, "Whoever knowingly

15 uses intimidation or physical force" -- 

16           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

17           MR. DREEBEN:  -- et cetera.

18           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

19           MR. DREEBEN:  The last phrase in the sequence is

20 "engages in misleading conduct towards another person." 

21 That phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page

22 11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the Government's

23 appendix.  It's Section 1515(a)(3).  And it says the term

24 "misleading conduct" means "knowingly making a false

25 statement; intentionally omitting information from a



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

42

1 statement; with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or

2 inviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent to

3 mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a

4 sample;" and, finally, "knowingly using a trick scheme or

5 device."

6           So, "knowingly" is to be read in as if it were

7 part of Section 1512 when it comes to defining the term

8 "engaging in misleading conduct," so you would end up with

9 a statute that Congress have, for some reason, drafted

10 that includes the word "knowingly" at the beginning, and

11 then "knowingly" later as the definition of one of the

12 terms that the initial "knowingly" --

13           JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I don't know how you can

14 avoid that.

15           MR. DREEBEN:  You avoid it --

16           JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Whoever knowingly engages in

17 misleading conduct," which is later defined as --

18           MR. DREEBEN:  No.  It's, "Whoever knowingly uses

19 intimidation or physical force."  That's what "knowingly"

20 applies to.  And then the words "threaten, corruptly

21 persuade, and engages in misleading conduct," have

22 inherent knowledge in them.  In other words --

23           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I see.  The "knowingly"

24 only applies to "uses intimidation or physical force."

25           MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, because "corruptly"



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

43

1 is, and always has been, a scienter term, and its

2 appearance in Section 1512 is a direct lineal descendant

3 from the fact that that word appears in Section 1503. 

4 When Congress enacted this statute, it had every reason to

5 believe, because it intended to do this, that the

6 definition of "corruptly," that had been fairly widespread

7 in the use of the word in Section 1503, would be applied

8 to 1512.

9           JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why --

10           MR. DREEBEN:  And, in that context --

11           JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- why isn't the answer to your

12 argument that the requirement in (b) -- "knowingly"

13 requirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down through

14 the series, but it travels at least as far as "corruptly

15 persuades"?

16           MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's sort of reading the

17 statute just to achieve a result.

18           JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but we know it --

19           MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's contrary to --

20           JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- applies to something at the

21 beginning of the series.  It's got -- it's got some work

22 to do.  You've made an argument that it doesn't apply, or

23 it would be logically absurd to apply it, to something at

24 the end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle.

25 And why isn't the answer to your argument simply to say,



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

44

1 "Okay, it doesn't travel all the way to the end, but it

2 travels up to the end, and it travels as far as this"?

3           MR. DREEBEN:  Because a "threat," itself, which

4 is the third term in the series, and the one that precedes

5 the term that's at issue here, also involves an element of

6 scienter or knowledge.  You can use intimidation

7 inadvertently.  You could be a very heavy, dangerous-

8 looking guy, standing out in front of the grand jury room,

9 and a witness might come along and see you and realize, to

10 himself, "Uh-oh, I'm in trouble if I testify."  If you

11 haven't done that knowingly --

12           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that big, heavy guy

13 would violate the statute just by standing there?

14           MR. DREEBEN:  He wouldn't, Chief Justice

15 Rehnquist, precisely because it requires that he knowingly

16 use intimidation.  So that --

17           JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think you can -- you

18 can use intimidation unknowingly, any more than you can

19 threaten unknowingly.  If they felt it necessary to put

20 "knowingly" before "use intimidation," I think they would

21 have felt it necessary to put "knowingly" before

22 "threaten."  The two terms are just about identical.

23           MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that they're

24 actually quite different in the context of this statute,

25 but even if the Court were to conclude that "knowingly"



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 did travel down and produce a phrase, "knowingly

2 corruptly," the word "knowingly" generally in the criminal

3 law refers to "knowledge of the facts that make your

4 conduct unlawful."  Arthur Andersen here is asking for a

5 very --

6           JUSTICE BREYER:  No, the --- in general terms,

7 when you speak of "general interpretation," I suppose I

8 think it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes

9 with the following idea.  Congress did not intend to try

10 to make of the statute a highly general weapon for the

11 Justice Department to pick and choose.  That's a

12 notification problem.  It's also because we don't want one

13 law, "It is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the

14 Attorney General."  You know, I mean, we want to have

15 narrow criminal statutes. 

16           Now, is it reasonable to start with that frame

17 of mind?  And if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against

18 you in this case?

19           MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that it does,

20 Justice Breyer.  There are, of course, contexts where the

21 Court concludes that a statute, after applying all the

22 tools of statutory construction, is ambiguous, and then

23 rules of construction do apply to narrow it; but there is

24 no provision that says that the Court should approach the

25 question of construction with a view to narrow it.  I



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

46

1 think --

2           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, how about the rule of

3 lenity in the criminal statutes?  If this thing is so

4 confusing, how's the business person supposed to know what

5 they can do?  How's the lawyer supposed to know?

6           MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that it is that

7 confusing, Justice O'Connor.  This is a statute that was

8 enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-

9 understood meaning of the word "corruptly."  The same word

10 appears in Section 1505.  When the D.C. Circuit concluded

11 that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular

12 case, Congress came back with a definition that

13 legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said

14 "corruptly" means "acting with an improper purpose."  The

15 "improper purpose" in an obstruction-of-justice case has

16 traditionally been "the purpose to obstruct justice."

17           That definition logically applies to Section

18 1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades

19 provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it

20 had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-

21 tampering in the statute, originally.  And some courts

22 concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section

23 1503, either.

24      To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model

25 of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

47

1 of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test

2 would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering

3 a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the

4 witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying

5 documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an

6 anticipation that the subpoena was likely.  Those kinds of

7 acts were considered to be unlawful.  

8           Similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to

9 an individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith,

10 not to protect that individual's own interest, but to

11 obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal

12 organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts

13 had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had

14 recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the

15 time of the enactment of this statute.  And Congress

16 specifically said, "We want 1512 to be able to pick up the

17 kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer

18 prosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been

19 included in the original version of 1512."  So that there

20 is history here that explains how these terms should be

21 applied.

22           And as far as Petitioner's contention that the

23 word "corruptly" does nothing and leads to a series of

24 horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and

25 appropriate use of the word "corruptly" solves those



1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
Alderson Reporting Company

48

1 problems.  Petitioners talk about how people should be

2 able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary

3 investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to

4 engage in those conversations.  But if an entity has

5 subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply

6 invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going

7 to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that

8 proceeding to invite them to exercise that right.  If the

9 agency wants their testimony, it can get it through

10 compulsion.

11           Similarly, Petitioners argue that document

12 policies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's

13 approach.  But as the Court of Appeals specifically

14 recognized in this case, a sound application of the word

15 "corruptly" would look to whether there is a threat of

16 some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an

17 obligation not to destroy the documents before the

18 proceeding gets started.  

19           And, as well, there are intents that are simply

20 not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that

21 may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable.  And

22 if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate

23 another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to

24 violate 1512.  And a sound use of "corruptly" prevents all

25 of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to

1 the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad.

2           Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to

3 attacking the word "corruptly," also has advanced a number

4 of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some

5 connection that had to be required between the Defendant's

6 intent in a possible future proceeding.  But the reason

7 that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is

8 largely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided

9 to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the

10 statute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to

11 impose today.  It never asked that the Defendant must be

12 shown to believe that some particular proceeding was

13 likely to occur in the near future.  Instead, what it did

14 is say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair

15 an object's availability for use in a particular

16 proceeding.  And what the Court of Appeals said is that if

17 there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error;

18 it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding

19 that was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron.

20           And the other instruction that Petitioners asked

21 for in the District Court is that the official proceeding

22 must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the

23 future.  But that instruction is flatly contrary to the

24 statute.

3          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

4                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5           MS. MAHONEY:  Thank you. 

6           I'd like to first address the fact that much of

7 the Government's argument is focused on this nexus, the

8 imminence of the proceeding, that sort of thing, but

9 actually the jury was not required to find any nexus

10 whatsoever, and was told the wrong definition of an

11 "official proceeding," to boot.  It was told that the

12 informal inquiry by the SEC staff was an official

13 proceeding, and that an official proceeding was already

14 going on at the time of the events at issue here; in fact,

15 even before Nancy Temple even knew about that informal

16 inquiry, which, in and of itself, is reversible error. 

17 And --

18           JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you think it should

19 have been?

20           MS. MAHONEY:  The "official proceeding," at

21 worst, Your Honor, it was the formal investigation of the

22 SEC, which is commenced by a vote of the Commission and

23 has compulsory process available.  It is certainly not a

24 staff person sitting in their office in Houston opening a

25 file and doing some Internet searches.  That's the

1 Government's definition.  That's in -- a matter within the

2 jurisdiction of an agency, and that's not the language

3 that appears in this statute.

4           Also, in terms of whether Andersen raised this

5 argument, of course they did.  They asked for an

6 instruction that the proceeding be ongoing or scheduled,

7 because that was Fifth Circuit law at the time.  Andersen

8 wasn't supposed to guess that the Fifth Circuit was going

9 to change what it had held in case called Shively.  And

10 the Fifth Circuit understood that Andersen had preserved

11 the argument, and expressly says in its opinion that the

12 issue is, What is the concreteness of the Defendant's

13 expectation of a proceeding that should be required under

14 this statute? -- and found that "feared" was enough. 

15 That's not enough.  "Possible" is not enough, especially

16 if a broad definition, like the one the Government wants

17 to have -- there's got to be a serious nexus.

18           Nexus problems can be avoided, though, if the

19 more traditional definition of "corruptly" is used in the

20 first place, which is not only required by lenity, but,

21 frankly, is required even by the witness-tampering cases

22 under Section 1503.  As I read to you, the definitions of

23 "corruptly" are completely consistent with Andersen's

24 definition.

25           The Government says, "Oh, no.  In fact, all it

52

1 meant under 1503 was an intent to obstruct justice."  That

2 can't possibly be what Congress intended for Section 1512,

3 because this Court had held, for -- a hundred years ago,

4 that you necessarily lack the evil intent to obstruct if a

5 proceeding is not pending.  And 1512 does apply even

6 before proceedings begin, so the definition had to be

7 tailored to the precise circumstances of Section 1512.  It

8 couldn't import the precise thing.  

9           Plus, the definition under 1503 has never been

10 any intent to impede the fact-finding ability is a

11 prohibited intent.  That would require lawyers and clients

12 all over the country to go to jail.  It's that you intend

13 to subvert and undermine the integrity of the due

14 administration of justice.  And that term does not mean

15 simply to impede the fact-finding; it means that you

16 intend to disobey those duties that are imposed upon you

17 in the course of a proceeding.  And cases, including the

18 Howard case cited in our brief and cited by the

19 Government, make that crystal clear.  It is not translated

20 to what this jury instruction was, which is that -- any

21 intent to impede fact-finding.

22           Just take a look at the examples, if the

23 Government were correct about this.  If I were to ask my

24 lawyer to assert, let's say, a reporter's privilege that

25 is debatable, under the Government's -- and I do it,

1 because I know that that document is harmful, and I want

2 to keep it out of the proceeding -- under the Government's

3 definition, that is corrupt, because I am trying to get

4 another person to withhold a document in order to impede

5 the fact-finding ability of the decision-maker.

6           It makes no sense to define "corruptly" that

7 way.  If you, instead, define it with reference to duties,

8 it makes perfect sense.  That's not corrupt, because there

9 is no duty to provide a document when you have a good-

10 faith claim of privilege.

11           Thank you, Your Honor.

12           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.

13 Mahoney.  The case is submitted.

14           [Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the

15 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
