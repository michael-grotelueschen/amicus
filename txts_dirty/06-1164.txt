 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 06-1164, John R. Sand & Gravel 

Company v. the United States.

 Mr. Haynes.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HAYNES: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The plain English reading of Section 2501 of 

Title 28, its phrasing compared to the jurisdictional 

grants to the Court of Federal Claims, the 

contemporaneous legal history of its predecessor, and 

this Court's decisions in Irwin and Franconia Associates 

compel the conclusion that Section 2501 does not limit 

subject matter jurisdiction and should be applied to the 

government as an ordinary waivable affirmative defense.

 The plain text of Section 2501, which reads 

"Every claim of which the United States Court of Federal 

Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the 

petition thereon is filed within 6 years" after it first 

accrues, assumes subject matter jurisdiction, and if it 

assumes subject matter jurisdiction it cannot logically 

limit subject matter jurisdiction. The statute is

phrased in such a way that the jurisdictional inquiry 

precedes the inquiry as to timeliness.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the prior statutes have 

a different structure?

 MR. HAYNES: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We've held this thing is 

jurisdictional for a long time. Did the prior statutes 

under which we made those holdings have a different 

structure?

 MR. HAYNES: The 1863 statute prior to the 

Tucker Act amendment to the statute had approximately 

the same structure, Your Honor, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you asking us 

to, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor 

overrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?

 MR. HAYNES: Your Honor, we believe that 

this Court's decision in Irwin effectively overruled 

Soriano. Irwin held that the Title 7 statute of 

limitations was subject to equitable tolling, and in 

Irwin, the Court had to choose between two lines of 

cases, Soriano and Bowen v. City of New York. And it 

chose the Bowen line of cases. And so if it repudiated 

Soriano -- Soriano of course held that Section 2501 is 

jurisdictional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, Irwin

involved Title 7 and not this 2501. And we hadn't 

addressed Title 7 before, but we have addressed 2501 

before.

 MR. HAYNES: That's correct. But certainly 

in Irwin, the Court uses 2501 as an example of a statute 

that can be equitably tolled and in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in, in the 

more recent case of Kontrick -- I'm looking at footnote 

8 of that opinion -- it used 2401 as an example of the 

jurisdictional bar and 2401 has pretty much the same 

language as 2501.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, Section 2401 in the 

Federal Tort Claims Act has similar language.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think in Contracts it 

was used as an example of a so-called built-in statute 

of limitations, one that is thought to bar the right as 

well as the remedy.

 MR. HAYNES: Well, certainly one could look 

at the statute of limitations in 2401 that is within the 

section that waives sovereign immunity and say that it 

as part of the waiver constitutes a limit on subject 

matter jurisdiction. However, Section 2501 standing 

alone in the procedural chapter concerning the Court of 

Federal Claims is not attached to any particular waiver 

contained in chapter 91, which contains the

jurisdictional grants to the Court of Federal Claims. 

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just, just to 

get all the cases out on the table, our more recent 

decision in Bowles suggested that there may be a 

difference between statutory and rule limitations and 

also suggested that the prior history of the 

interpretation of a provision was highly relevant.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, Bowles does say that, but 

Bowles can be distinguished, I believe, in several ways. 

First, Bowles dealt with the notice of claim, notice of 

appeal and transferring the jurisdiction from the 

district court to the court of appeals. That's not at 

issue here because in the statute of limitations, of 

course, we aren't dealing with transferring 

jurisdiction, we're dealing with the initiation, the 

initiation of the claim and which court that claim 

belongs in, not transferring jurisdiction from one to 

another.

 Second, Bowles -- Bowles was very careful in 

not mentioning statutes of limitations in, in the 

majority opinion. It doesn't mention it at all and I 

think that is, that is purposeful. Third --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It said determining when 

and under what conditions Federal courts can hear cases

falls within the court's adjudicatory authority -- or 

that are within the adjudicatory authority are 

jurisdictional, when and under what conditions Federal 

courts hear cases. That would be very broad, but it did 

say that.

 Could not interfere with the plain-text 

reading of 2501 once you assume --

JUSTICE ALITO: What kind of language would 

we have to find in 2501 in order to conclude that it's 

jurisdictional? Would it be necessary for the statute 

to say that there is no jurisdiction unless the -- the 

claim is filed within a certain period of time?

 MR. HAYNES: I think if Congress said that 

-- if Congress specifically said that this section, this 

statute of limitations, is jurisdictional, that would 

end the issue. And as this case -- as this Court said 

in the Arbaugh case, if Congress plainly establishes a 

statute as jurisdictional, then the court's --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is that necessary? Is there 

anything short of that that would be sufficient?

 MR. HAYNES: If Section -- if the language 

in Section 2501 were attached to the waiver of sovereign 

immunity in 1491(a)(1) for this case, that might allow 

the Court to find that it's jurisdictional and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then there would be a

built-in limitation, and usually that's not considered 

jurisdictional. It would be under the heading of 

failure to state a claim; that is, your claim has been 

extinguished, so you have no claim to state, as opposed 

to the ordinary operation of the statute of limitations 

which bars only the remedy, not the right.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But 

certainly the example -- as the Chief Justice's example 

suggested, in 2401, the Federal Tort Claims Act, and 

also the statute that's found in the Quiet Title Act 

that this Court interpreted in the Block case, Block v. 

North Dakota, those statutes of limitations are attached 

to the jurisdictional grant in some closer fashion than 

2501 is, and so they would more likely to be read to be 

a limit on jurisdiction. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me all of those 

factors are a lot more subtle than the mere fact that we 

have said that this is jurisdictional for years and 

years, it and its predecessor. Why -- why isn't that at 

least as persuasive as the -- as the fragile attachments 

you're -- you're discussing here or even as the -- as 

the, you know, the -- even if the statute said that it's 

jurisdictional, we've said in our opinions that to say 

it's jurisdictional doesn't mean that it's 

jurisdictional necessarily. So I suppose we could say

the same about the statute, couldn't we?

 MR. HAYNES: Justice Scalia, I believe that 

the Irwin case answers that question because Irwin 

certainly undercut Soriano and Soriano relied on the 

Kendall-Finn line of cases. Irwin made a choice, and it 

chose to say that the statute of limitations in Title 7 

and generally other statutes of limitation are presumed 

to be equitably tollable, and if they are equitably 

tollable they cannot be jurisdictional. 2501 was used 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say that. You're 

saying that.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, we are saying that. We 

think that there is a logic --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Bowles said that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Bowles said if it's 

equitably tolled, it's not jurisdictional. If it -- a 

provision that is jurisdictional cannot be equitably 

tolled.

 MR. HAYNES: That's correct. And if it --

if the statute can be equitably tolled, it's not 

jurisdictional, and therefore it can be waived and --

and it does not have to be raised sua sponte by the 

court, as was done here by the Federal Circuit.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One member of the court 

did think that Irvin -- Irwin overruled Soriano, but 

only one member.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, but I think a -- a fair 

reading of Irwin, combined with this Court's decision in 

Franconia Associates, which construed Section 2501 to 

say that it doesn't have a special accrual rule for the 

government and that this Court -- or that courts should 

apply statutes of limitations against the government as 

against private parties --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a pretty risky 

business, though, to rely on a dissent in determining 

whether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not, 

isn't it?

 MR. HAYNES: It would be, Your Honor. I'm 

not sure which case you're referring to.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Irwin. I thought 

that was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you --

MR. HAYNES: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where Justice 

White in dissent said that Irwin overruled Soriano. But 

the majority certainly didn't say that.

 MR. HAYNES: No, but -- it did not say that 

specifically, but I think if you look at Irwin in the 

totality, there is -- I don't think there is a way that

you could look at Irwin and say that it did not overrule 

Soriano. At a minimum -- at a minimum, it took out the 

theoretical underpinnings for the Soriano line of cases. 

Because --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do you suggest we write 

the opinion? If you were writing it and then a dissent, 

say, or someone or we read in the briefs that here is an 

absolute holding of the Supreme Court right on point, 

totally clear, says just exactly what the government 

says here, and it was codified in 1948, and now we say 

the reason, despite that, you win is?

 MR. HAYNES: The reason is because, unless 

the Congress clearly establishes a statute of 

limitations as jurisdictional, unless there is a clear 

statement, then statutes of limitations against the 

government are to be read --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if somebody says, well, 

the Court couldn't have been clearer as to what the 

statute meant, and Congress reenacted it in codifying 

it. So what do you want?

 MR. HAYNES: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what could be 

clearer? Are they supposed to actually -- in the 

recodification in 19 -- or is it that the recodification 

changed things or what?

MR. HAYNES: No, Justice Breyer, I don't 

think the recodification changed the substance of the 

statute. However, certainly that argument that 

Congress's recodification of this Court's ruling in the 

Kendall-Finn line of cases cuts both ways because 

following Irwin, issued in -- when the opinion was 

issued in 1990, the Congress has had 17 years to look at 

that and say no, Section 2501 should not be equitably 

tolled. And Congress certainly could say that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it hasn't 

recodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?

 MR. HAYNES: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. However, I think the recodification argument 

really -- really is not a telling argument because the 

Kendall-Finn line of cases, under Irwin at least, were 

wrongly decided when they were decided. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we do 

have to overrule Kendall and Soriano?

 MR. HAYNES: I think in order to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or at least say that 

we already did in Irwin?

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, Your Honor. We believe 

that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it just Irwin or a 

whole line of cases? There was a time when the

jurisdictional label was used rather frequently. There 

is a more recent case that says "jurisdiction" is a word 

of many meanings, too many meanings. And I think the 

Court has been trying to cut down on the too many 

meanings.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree, 

and those cases start with the Kontrick v. Ryan case and 

continue through -- and even in the Bowles case, that's 

-- that's a species of appellate jurisdiction which --

JUSTICE BREYER: But even all those cases 

which you're going back to, what you're talking about, I 

think, in those cases is general statements in the case. 

The cases themselves, except possibly for that 

Franconia, which has a different problem because it was 

about accrual, the cases themselves don't involve this 

statute. It's simply general statements. I thought, 

and I'd like your response, that in this Court's opinion 

as in statutes, as in life. When people make general 

statements, they don't mean every possible situation in 

the universe; rather, there are always circumstances to 

which the statement doesn't apply. And so why don't we 

just read those statements as incorporating a prior 

explicit holding of the Court as inapplicable to that 

prior explicit holding? I mean, that's what you'd 

normally do with a sentence like that, isn't it?

MR. HAYNES: Perhaps, Justice Breyer. I 

think that the rule that we are proposing here is that 

once Congress has waived sovereign immunity, absent a 

clear statement of Congress to the contrary, a statute 

of limitations is not -- does not limit subject matter 

jurisdiction. So I think the Court has to look at the 

plain language of Section 2501, compared to the 

jurisdictional grant here in 1491(a)(1).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the rule or the 

presumption that you just quoted in effect when Congress 

last revised the statute?

 MR. HAYNES: No, Justice Kennedy. I think 

the presumption was -- was established certainly in 

Irwin, which said: We want to cut through these ad hoc 

decisions that we have been going through on this 

question of equitable tolling. We want to -- we want to 

create a general rule that statutes of limitations 

generally are presumed to be equitably tolled.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can -- was 

Congress aware of that general rule when it last revised 

the statute?

 MR. HAYNES: I don't see how that could 

happen, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't, either, and 

that's why, when you say, well, it's a general rule,

well, your argument tends to lose force because of the 

fact that Congress acts against the background of what 

this Court has stated.

 MR. HAYNES: That may be. However, I don't 

think that that general codification or -- or, rather, 

the rule of statutory construction that says that the 

Congress's codification of the law will then incorporate 

this Court's prior decisions, I don't think that can 

trump the plain language reading of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Haynes, isn't it less 

radical and, indeed, more in accord with the language of 

Irwin to -- to say that what Irwin overruled was not the 

whole principle that this statute of limitation is -- is 

-- and others that relate to sovereign immunity, is 

jurisdictional, but rather the much more limited rule 

that -- that statutes of limitations which are 

jurisdictional are not subject to equitable tolling?

 That's a much more limited point, and -- and 

the language of Irwin is a waiver of sovereign immunity 

must be unequivocally expressed once Congress has made 

such a -- once Congress has made such a waiver, we think 

that making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to 

suits against the government in the same way that it is 

applicable to private suits amounts to little, if any --

little, if any -- broadening of the congressional

waiver.

 I don't think one can say that if you expand 

the principle to cover the whole -- the whole matter of 

whether it's jurisdiction. So why not read Irwin more 

moderately to -- to -- if we have to overrule one of two 

things, the whole doctrine of the jurisdictional nature 

of statutes of limitations in sovereign immunity cases 

and the other is simply, oh, yes, there is sovereign 

immunity, but can there be equitable tolling, why 

shouldn't we adopt the more limited one?

 MR. HAYNES: Well, I think, Justice Scalia, 

that this Court can adopt a more limited ruling based 

upon the rule that I've advanced, and that is if 

Congress specifically says that a statute of limitations 

shall count as jurisdictional.

 And the example I would give, Justice 

Scalia, is in the Indian Tucker Act, which is found on 

page 9A of the appendix to the blue brief. The Indian 

Tucker Act, Section 1505 -- excuse me -- section 1505, 

says that claims that accrue to Indians after August 13, 

1946, go to the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of 

Federal Claims has jurisdiction over those claims.

 That is -- and before that date, such Indian 

claims went to the Indian Claims Commission. So in 1505 

Congress said before a date certain a particular forum

had jurisdiction; and after a date certain another forum 

has jurisdiction. That's -- that's a jurisdictional 

kind of date that I think is -- is appropriate to look 

at here, because once -- once you put an -- you put 

accrual language in a statute of limitations, that by 

its nature suggests that there may be equitable tolling 

or some kind of tolling if you're talking about a claim 

accruing, because there may be estoppel, there may be 

waivers, there may be discovery issues. So the text of 

the statute itself suggests that there is a form of 

tolling allowed in the statute.

 And if Congress wanted to say that this 

statute of limitations goes to the subject matter 

jurisdiction of the court, it very well could have said 

that. It didn't, however; and so I think Irwin fits 

comfortably within the rule that we are suggesting.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's exactly 

what I think we said in -- in Arbaugh; and that, 

certainly, going forward from that point on, Congress 

has more or less specified that it's jurisdictional, or 

we're not going to read it that way. But I'm not sure 

that was the rule in Irwin and I'm pretty sure it wasn't 

the rule in Soriano and Kendall.

 MR. HAYNES: Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly 

was not the rule in Soriano and Kendall. But our

position is that in Kendall the Court ignored the 

legislative history which said, this statute of 

limitations that we are inserting into the 1863 Court of 

Claims Act should be treated -- should be applied to the 

government just as to private parties.

 That's precisely the ruling in Franconia 

Associates: That once sovereign immunity has been 

waived, once -- once there is a waiver of sovereign 

immunity, the government is treated like any other 

defendant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know, but it 

seems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up 

today, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's 

right.

 But the point is it came up 100 years ago 

and it was decided, and the question is whether we 

should overturn that decision.

 MR. HAYNES: I understand. Again, I suggest 

that Irwin erased the theoretical underpinnings of the 

Kendall-Finn line of cases by saying that a statute 

formerly -- which this Court formerly said was 

jurisdictional can be subject to equitable tolling, and 

if it is subject to equitable tolling it cannot be 

jurisdictional because the hallmarks of "jurisdictional" 

are strict construction, it can't be waived and

forfeited, and it has to be raised sua sponte. And so 

if you take out one of those legs of the statute, I 

don't see how it can be held to the jurisdictional.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It did say statutory time 

limits -- this is Irwin -- applicable to lawsuits --

well, the sentence about the suits: The rule of 

equitable tolling applicable to suits against the 

government. It says the rule that was announced is 

applicable to the government, the same as with respect 

to private parties.

 So it's hard to think of what territory 

Irwin would cover if it doesn't -- because in all suits, 

at least for money against the government, there has to 

be a waiver of sovereign immunity.

 MR. HAYNES: That's true, Justice Ginsburg. 

And -- and Congress has specifically waived sovereign 

immunity for the kind of claim involved in this case, 

which is, of course, a takings claim.

 Once the waiver is accomplished, the 

government is treated like any other defendant. That's 

certainly what Franconia Associates says, and I think it 

is inescapable to say, to -- to conclude other than to 

say that Irwin and Franconia have -- have eviscerated 

the Kendall-Finn line of cases.

argument is more strongly supported by Irwin than 

Franconia. Franconia simply involved an accrual rule, 

which doesn't go to what the jurisdictional effect of 

the bar on commencing a case is.

 The government there was overreaching and 

arguing for a special accrual rule, and the Court said 

no. That's different than saying whether the actual 

time for commencing litigation is jurisdictional or not.

 MR. HAYNES: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

correct. That's what Franconia ruled. However, 

Franconia reiterated the Irwin rule, which is that once 

sovereign immunity is waived the statute of limitations 

applies to the government.

 The government in Franconia, as you say, was 

pressing a very novel interpretation of the 

first-accrued language, and the Court said the 

government doesn't get any advantage from that just 

because it's the government.

 So just because the -- the government is the 

defendant doesn't mean that it has that special 

advantage once sovereign immunity is waived, as it has 

been here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if -- even if you're 

right, couldn't the Federal Circuit say: Well, that's 

all very interesting but Day v. McDonough told us that

if we want to raise it on our own -- we don't have to if 

it's not jurisdictional; but if we want to, we can.

 MR. HAYNES: Justice Ginsburg, I think Day 

v. McDonough does not help the government here. Day v. 

McDonough said that, yes, in the habeas situation the 

district court might raise sua sponte the timeliness of 

the claim. What the Court was -- the majority was clear 

on this, and the three-member dissent was also crystal 

clear on this: That if the government waives the 

statute of limitations, the Court would not have -- it 

would be an abuse of discretion for the Court to 

override that waiver.

 So, Day v. McDonough actually helps our 

position. Because not only was there a waiver here as 

-- but there was, for lack of a better word, a super 

waiver, because the government, having raised the 

statute of limitations in its pleadings, having moved to 

dismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations, then 

in special briefing asked by the trial judge here agreed 

that the claim was filed timely and conceded that in the 

Federal Circuit. They not only waived it, they agreed 

that the claim was filed timely.

 So, Day v. McDonough, I think, helps our 

position and not the government's position. And that 

was made emphatically clear by at least eight members of

this Court in Day v. McDonough, the majority and the 

three-member dissent.

 One other point I'd like to make, and that 

is that if this Court holds that the statute of -- that 

2501 is jurisdictional, then the judges in the Court of 

Federal Claims for every case filed in front of them on 

their general jurisdiction docket have to -- will have 

to scrutinize the allegations in every complaint to 

determine if the complaint is -- has been timely filed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that assumes 

that the government has waived in every case. If it 

hasn't waived, I have to do it anyway.

 MR. HAYNES: That's correct, Justice 

Kennedy. However --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can usually count on 

the government to file the canned sovereign immunity 

brief.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HAYNES: I think that's correct, Justice 

Scalia. You can count on the government to file a 

canned affirmative defense to the statute of 

limitations, too.

 But that's true, Justice Kennedy, if the 

government has, has waived it then the court doesn't 

have to, wouldn't have to do that. If they -- excuse

me, if they raise it, the government doesn't have to --

I'm sorry. If the government raises --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they, if they raise the 

defense --

MR. HAYNES: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then you're going to 

have to determine it anyway, subject to clearly 

erroneous findings of fact, as to when the person 

entered the property and so forth.

 MR. HAYNES: That's correct.

 But even if, even if the government were to 

agree that the claim was timely filed, the judges would 

have to consider it sua sponte in every case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's 

like saying in every diversity case, theoretically, the 

court has to scrutinize whether someone who alleges they 

are a citizen of Pennsylvania really is. And that's 

just not the way it really happens. The question 

usually, if not raised by the party, comes up under some 

other situation, such as in this case the amicus raised 

it.

 MR. HAYNES: That's correct. But even if 

it's not raised, we think that if the statute is held 

jurisdictional, then the courts have to address it sua 

sponte.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In a consistent line of decisions beginning 

in 1883, this Court has repeatedly construed the 6-year 

filing requirement contained in Section 2501 and its 

predecessors as a nonwaivable jurisdictional limit on 

the Court of Claim's authority to enter money judgments 

against the United States. Congress has recodified the 

statute on various occasions and has modified its 

language in minor respects. But it has made no change 

that could call into question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I ask you 

this question: Do you think the defense of the 

equitable tolling would be available under this statute?

 MR. STEWART: We don't, Your Honor. In 

fact, the Court has held both in Kendall and in Soriano 

that equitable tolling is not available.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think Irwin even

changed the equitable tolling rule?

 MR. STEWART: We don't. Irwin read in the 

way we would read it, established that at least with 

respect to statutes that provided for private suits 

against both governmental and private defendants, and 

perhaps with respect to suits against the government 

generally, that there is a presumption of equitable 

tolling. But the Court in Irwin recognized that that 

presumption could be rebutted. And in both Kendall and 

Soriano, the Court had relied on, inter alia, the fact 

that the statute listed specific instances in which the 

6-year period could be tolled as evidence that there was 

no general authority to toll the statutory time limit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that when you're 

beyond the seas or something?

 MR. STEWART: Beyond the seas or subject to 

a legal disability. The original 1863 version of the 

statute specified particular disabilities such as 

infancy, et cetera.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you do with 

Justice Rehnquist's sentence: "We think this case 

affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general rule 

to govern the applicability of equitable tolling suits 

against the government"? Is there an implied exception 

for Soriano there?

MR. STEWART: I think there are two bases on 

which we would distinguish that language. The first is 

by its terms Chief Justice Rehnquist's sentence was 

addressed to equitable tolling, not to waivibility. And 

it's true that the Court in Bowles has linked the two, 

but it doesn't appear that the Court in Irwin made that 

equation. That is, in the Irwin opinion the Court 

recited the fact that both the district court and the 

court of appeals had ordered the case dismissed for lack 

of jurisdiction, because the filing requirement had not 

been met. And the Court said, we think that the statute 

is subject to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, I think I 

understand what you're saying, but I thought that the 

government's distinction of Soriano was that was the 

general rule for equitable tolling, so it doesn't apply 

here, which I think is certainly understandable. But 

you're saying it wasn't even a general rule for 

equitable tolling?

 MR. STEWART: It was at least a general rule 

for equitable tolling with respect to statutes like 

Title 7 that authorize suit against both the government 

and against private defendants. And there has been some 

back and forth in the Court since then as to whether the 

Irwin language extends more broadly. In Brockamp, the

Court suggested that some private analog is necessary 

before the Irwin presumption applies. In Scarborough 

versus Principi, the Court seemed to tilt in the 

opposite direction.

 But part of our point is, even if the Irwin 

presumption of equitable tolling extends categorically 

to all suits against the government, equitable tolling 

is not the same thing as jurisdictionality or 

waivibility. The Court in Bowles did link the two, but 

in Irwin itself the Court recited the fact that the 

lower courts had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

 And then when the Court concluded that Irwin 

had not satisfied the prerequisites for equitable 

tolling, the Court simply said: Affirmed.

 Now, if the Court had intended in Irwin to 

establish not simply that equitable tolling was 

potentially available, but that the time limit was not a 

jurisdictional bar to begin with, it seems likely the 

Court would at least have referred to the idea that the 

dismissal should have been for failure --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, I don't --

it's -- we've found it difficult enough to figure out 

which statutes are jurisdictional and which are not. 

And now you want us to say, well, even if it's 

jurisdictional, the consequences may be different for

jurisdiction and for equitable tolling and for 

waivibility. I mean, it seems to me that's a very 

difficult argument.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the Court has said both 

with respect to Section 2501 and its predecessors and 

with respect to statutory time limits for suing the 

government generally, that the terms of Congress's 

consent to suit define the jurisdiction of the reviewing 

court and a time limit for commencing suit is one of 

those terms. And I would direct the Court's attention 

in particular to United States v. Dalm, which is cited 

in our brief on page 23. It was decided less than 9 

months before Irwin was decided. And the opinion in 

Dalm is suffused with references to the jurisdictional 

character of the time limit for commencing suit against 

the government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you certainly would 

be mixing categories terribly if you suggested that 

something that goes to the court's authority to proceed 

in the case can be waived if it's equitable to waive it. 

I mean, those two notions are at odds with each other.

 MR. STEWART: Obviously, the government was 

on the other side in Irwin, so in a sense I'm not the 

best person to defend the Court's reasoning. But as 

between the reading of Irwin that would create this

anomaly, that there could potentially be a 

jurisdictional limit that was nevertheless subject to 

equitable tolling, and the argument on the other side 

that Irwin sub silentio swept away numerous decisions of 

this Court that had recited that the, that the terms of 

the government's consent to suit are jurisdictional 

limits and a time limit is one of those terms.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would, what 

would Irwin and Franconia that made statements -- when 

it's a question of a time limit, they operate against 

the government just like they operate against private 

parties, to what kind of case would that apply? I mean, 

it's been pointed out that 2501 covers a whole slew of 

cases, not just takings cases.

 MR. STEWART: Well, certainly the kind of 

case that the Court was specifically dealing with in 

Irwin itself, and it's not an uncommon type of case now, 

is one in which Congress has passed a statute that 

imposes obligations on private parties and then imposes 

like obligations on the government. And the gestalt of 

Title 7, once it was amended to add the Federal 

Government as a potential defendant and to impose the 

substantive obligations on the government, was that the 

government was to be dealt with with respect to matters 

of employment discrimination in the same way that a

private employer would be in like circumstances, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose Franconia 

would be a case where the Irwin logic not only would but 

did apply.

 MR. STEWART: Well, in Franconia, the Court 

was dealing with a different question. It was what do 

the words "first accrues" mean? And it held that the --

it essentially treated the phrase "first accrues" as a 

term of art, as one that had appeared in prior statutes 

governing suits against other defendants. And so it saw 

no reason to believe that Congress intended those words 

to mean anything different in Section 2501 than they 

meant in other statutes of limitations.

 And I guess the other point that I would 

make both about Franconia and Irwin is, even if you read 

Irwin at its broadest, even if you construe it to mean 

that there is a presumption that time limits for suing 

the government are nonjurisdictional as well as subject 

to tolling, the Court in Irwin still made clear that the 

presumption could be rebutted. The presumption is not a 

limit on Congress's authority. It's simply an aid to 

construction in situations where other tools of 

interpretation don't produce a clear result. And here 

we would say --

Mr. Stewart. Supposing we didn't have any precedent at 

all, just the whole -- this is the first time this issue 

had arisen, and we have the plain language of this 

statute. Would you not read this statute, without any 

background, supporting your opponent?

 MR. STEWART: We wouldn't read it to -- if 

all we had was the text of the statute, we would not 

read it to permit waiver. And I should explain why. 

The statute is reproduced in pertinent part at page 2 of 

the government's brief. And the statute provides "Every 

claim of which the United States" -- "Every claim of 

which the United States Court of Federal Claims has 

jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon 

is filed within 6 years after such claim first accrues."

 And looking only at the text of the statute, 

the language is categorical. It says every claim that 

is filed more than 6 years after accrual shall be 

barred. The statute by its terms makes no exception for 

cases in which the government fails to raise --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Aren't statutes of 

limitations generally more equivocal than that?

 MR. STEWART: No. I think often statutes of 

limitations are written like that. But my point is in 

the end Petitioner's argument really is not a plain 

language argument. Petitioner's argument --

language, you left out the words, "of which the United 

States Court of Claims has jurisdiction."

 MR. STEWART: I can understand that if you 

were looking only at the language of the statute, you 

would say -- you might say this is not a jurisdictional 

bar because it presumes jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. STEWART: But with respect to the 

substantive question presented, namely whether the 

United States' failure to make the argument in a timely 

way causes it to be waived, the statute doesn't support 

Petitioner's position as to that. It is categorical. 

It doesn't by its terms carve out an exception for cases 

in which the United States fails to raise a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about 

the rules of the Court of Federal Claims? Rule 8(c) 

states that the statute of limitations is an affirmative 

defense. And that's in suits against the Government 

because that's all the Court of Federal Claims deals 

with. So to what would that Rule 8(c) apply?

 MR. STEWART: Rule 8(c) says the following 

affirmative defenses shall be pled in the responsive 

proceeding, and it lists statute of limitations. I 

think it could certainly -- it obviously couldn't

supersede the decisions of this Court or even of the 

Federal Circuit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all those statutes of 

limitations would be statutes of limitations operating 

against the government.

 MR. STEWART: I think the rule basically 

tracks, although not precisely tracks, the language of 

the -- the parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, and 

we would read it simply to mean to the extent this is an 

affirmative defense, it should be pleaded initially. It 

doesn't say that the defense is waived if not pleaded.

 But to return to the point that I was making 

earlier, in the end Petitioner's argument is not a plain 

language argument. Petitioner's argument is that, 

notwithstanding the absence on the face of the statute 

of an exception for cases in which the United States 

fails to plead the timeliness defense, this Court should 

read Section 2501 against the backdrop of a large body 

of law holding that statutes of limitations are 

generally waivable, and should assume that Congress 

intended to incorporate that understanding --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't -- I don't 

think it's quite -- putting the argument as I understand 

it, you would say let's look at Irwin, and we read it, 

so it's in your mind. Now think of that set of statute

of limitations, the Federal ones, the Government ones, 

that are either just as ambiguous as Irwin or even more 

ambiguous. Think of that set.

 Now, in Irwin the Court says in the absence 

of special circumstances that whole set is going to be 

interpreted as nonjurisdictional. That's what it says. 

So you say, well, what Irwin didn't talk about is 

suppose there's a member of that set where previously 

the Court had held it was jurisdictional. It doesn't 

tell us what to do. Shall we read it as an exception or 

shall we not?

 And so what they are saying is, don't read 

it as an exception. There's no need to do so. Congress 

probably never really thought about any of this stuff. 

Read it, Irwin, as including that one, too.

 So what do you think of that point, whether 

it's theirs or not, leaving aside the argument about 

whether this particular statute does or does not fall 

within that set? Assume it does.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think -- I think this 

essentially relates to the point that I was making that, 

even if there is a presumption of nonjurisdictionality 

announced in Irwin, it's rebuttable and the presumption 

is simply an aid to construction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right, and then

the question is does the simple fact that we previously 

held to the contrary count as a rebuttal? Does Irwin 

mean to -- see that's the same question I had before, so 

what do you think about that?

 MR. STEWART: In our view, yes, it does. 

That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. STEWART: It's a little artificial to 

talk about what language Congress might or should have 

used in light of Irwin to make clear its intent that 

this be treated as jurisdictional, when Congress in the 

1948 Judicial Code chose to recodify essentially the 

same language that had previously been construed to 

impose a jurisdictional limit. And the point I was 

making before about Petitioner's argument as to imputed 

congressional intent -- in the end Petitioner's position 

depends on the inference that because there was a body 

of law out there saying that statutes of limitations are 

ordinarily waivable, Congress should be assumed to have 

intended to incorporate that body of law.

 And our point is if you're trying to impute 

Congress's intent it makes much more sense to assume 

that Congress intended to recodify the same reading that 

this Court had attached to this particular provision, 

not that Congress intended to incorporate a meaning that

the Court had attached to other statutes of limitations 

that the Court had specifically distinguished from this 

one.

 And it's worth emphasizing that the 

decisions in Kendall and Finn and De Arnaud can't be 

accused of the sort of loose or less than meticulous use 

of jurisdictional language that this Court has recently 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say that 

Franconia did use loose language, because although it 

dealt with accrual -- when does the claim accrue, and 

not when is it cut off -- but it did say, it called 2501 

specifically "an unexceptional statute of limitations."

 MR. STEWART: It said that it was 

unexceptional and it said that many other statutes of 

limitations used this language, namely the phrase "first 

accrues." But one of the other points that the Court in 

Franconia attached significance to was the fact that the 

Court of Claims had never given that phrase a broader 

reading in Section 2501. That is, the Court cited that 

as additional evidence that the phase had not been 

understood in this particular statute to bear a meaning 

other than it would have in other statutes of 

limitations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if we looked at the

Court of Federal Claims decisions now, I think they're 

spelled out in the opinion. They go both directions. 

That is, some say 2501 is jurisdictional, some say it's 

not.

 MR. STEWART: I think the principal line of 

authority in the Federal Circuit says it's 

jurisdictional, but what can't be disputed is that this 

Court has said over and over that it's jurisdictional, 

and the Court has again not used those -- that term in 

passing.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, because it said it in 

a case -- the issue in the case was whether Franconia 

was overruled -- I mean, Soriano was overruled. And 

Justice White thought it was. He said so in so many 

words. And it's interesting that Justice Rehnquist in 

the majority didn't disagree with that. Rather, he 

cited Justice White's dissent as part of his description 

of why some statutes are different from others, then 

comes to the points that we want to adopt a general rule 

that applies to all statutes. So it seems to me that 

the implicit -- in his opinion he did not disagree with 

Justice White's characterization.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think it would be --

again, given the fact in particular that the Court in 

Irwin didn't speak explicitly to the question of

jurisdictionality one way or the other, I think it is 

not uncommon for a -- a dissenting opinion to make 

assertions about the reach of a majority opinion, and 

the majority opinion sometimes does and sometimes does 

not respond to those.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the interesting part 

about this is the discussion of the majority of this 

case is part of its development of the fact that we've 

got cases all over the lot and we want to adopt a clear 

rule to apply across the board. So it's part of the 

reasoning of the Court.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I -- but I think at most 

the Court in Irwin was not trying to adopt a clear rule 

across the board; it was trying to adopt a presumption, 

while recognizing that Congress could provide in 

individual statutes for a rule different from the one 

that the presumption would suggest. And again if --

Congress had already been told that the language it was 

using would be treated as jurisdictional -- and the 

Court in the Kendall line of cases had not simply used 

the label jurisdictional; it had said statutes of 

limitations governing suits against private parties can 

be waived if they're not asserted in a timely fashion, 

but the time limit for filing suit against the United 

States in the Court of Claims is different. This is a

limit on the Court's authority and the Court is required 

to notice it whether it's pleaded by the government or 

not.

 So I think Congress had been told that it 

was already using language that would have the effect of 

causing this to be jurisdictional and nonwaivable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Congress think that 

Rule 8(c) has no range of application? And -- we have 

two recent statements saying statutes of limitations 

against the government are like statutes against private 

parties. But if 2501, which covers all of the cases 

over which the Court of Federal Claims has 

jurisdiction -- if, if it's for jurisdictional, then I 

don't know what cases there would be in which there's a 

time limit in a suit against the government that isn't 

jurisdictional.

 MR. STEWART: I mean -- I think -- I think 

you may well be correct, that is perhaps to the extent 

the drafters of the rule were doing something other than 

simply incorporating the existing language of the 

comparable Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. If all they 

were saying was if there's a statute of limitations out 

there that would function as an affirmative defense in 

our cases, in our court, we want it to be pleaded 

immediately as it would be in a private civil action.

If that's what they're saying, you may well 

be right that the class of cases to which that would 

pertain is the null set or something very close to it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't Mr. Haynes have a 

point when he suggested at the end of his argument that 

questions about accrual involve much more complicated 

factual questions than are usually involved in deciding 

whether a court has jurisdiction? So imagine if this 

case came up today and the government adhered to its 

prior position -- I don't know whether it's still it's 

position -- that there had not been a permanent taking 

until 1998, would the court -- and none of the events 

that happened before 1998 had been brought to the 

court's attention -- would the court have to say to the 

parties: Well, this is fine; we see that there was a 

fence put up in 1998, but now you have to tell us 

everything else that's happened on this site going back 

10 years to see whether there -- whether the claim might 

have accrued at some earlier point.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I guess we'd have two or 

three responses to that. The first is, at least before 

judgment could be entered in favor of the plaintiff, the 

court would ultimately have to determine not only that 

there was -- had been a taking, but would have to 

determine the date on which the taking occurred in order

to award compensation, if nothing else. So this seems 

like the kind of question that would ultimately have to 

be determined, at least before the plaintiff could be 

successful.

 The second thing, as was pointed out before, 

at least in the majority of cases where there is a 

viable limitations argument, the government is going to 

plead it, and so asking the court to look beyond this --

JUSTICE ALITO: But what if you didn't think 

it was -- it was a good argument. Would you have an 

obligation to say, we think there was a permanent fence 

put up in 1998 and we agree that there was a taking as 

of that point, but we don't think it happened earlier, 

but you need to know all of these additional facts? 

Would you have an obligation to present that to the 

court?

 MR. STEWART: It would depend upon the 

court's rules. That is, if the court required a 

separate statement as to jurisdiction then probably the 

advocate would include at least a thumbnail sketch of 

the relevant facts. If it was -- if the rules of the 

court were such that the advocate didn't have to address 

jurisdiction unless he or she was actively contesting 

it, then no.

 But the -- I guess the more fundamental

point we would make is the speculation as to disruptive 

results would carry a lot more force if the government 

were asking for a rule that was different from what had 

been done in the past. That is, even Petitioner would 

concede that, for the great bulk of the country's 

history, this rule was treated as jurisdictional, and 

Petitioner's argument is simply that that line of 

authority was effectively overruled in Irwin in 1990. 

And so if in fact treating this limit as a 

jurisdictional limit would have the effect of disrupting 

litigation in the CFC, we would expect the Petitioner to 

have actual evidence to that effect. If we were asking 

for a different rule than had been enforced in the past, 

then there would be more --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know the CFC is 

at least confused because they have some cases going one 

way and some cases going the other way. And from the 

government's point of view, the government can be relied 

on to raise the statute of limitations, I suppose, but 

aren't there cases where the government would really 

like to get the substantive issue settled? So it says, 

well, the statute of limitations is arguable, but we'll 

concede that the action was timely.

 MR. STEWART: I think that's true even as to 

cases involving barriers that everyone would concede are

jurisdictional. For instance, there are cases in which 

a litigant sues us, and there is great doubt as to his 

standing to sue, and it may be an issue that we think is 

otherwise framed in an appropriate context, and the 

government might feel that it would be to everyone's 

benefit to get the issue resolved when -- one way or the 

other. But one consequence of treating that as a 

jurisdictional barrier is simply that the government 

can't always have its way.

 So I don't think -- I would think that you 

are correct that there might be some instances in which 

treatment of this limit as a jurisdictional bar would 

not be in the government's interest. But that's not a 

basis for holding it to be nonjurisdictional.

 Certainly the majority of cases involving 

both -- I think, involving both 2501 and other 

provisions that impose time limits for suits against the 

government, in which the courts have held that the 

relevant limit is jurisdictional, typically the 

situation arises where the government decides to make an 

argument on appeal that it didn't make in the district 

court. I think a case like this one, where the 

government doesn't argue the point even on appeal and 

the court of appeals nevertheless holds that the suit 

was untimely, those are the rarity. But we certainly

agree that the logical implication of treating the time 

limit as jurisdictional is that the Federal circuit did 

the right thing here.

 I'd like to say a couple of words about 

Bowles. I think Bowles doesn't compel a ruling in the 

government's favor, but it does support our position in 

various respects. First, as the Chief Justice alluded 

to earlier, Bowles emphasized that time limits for 

filing notices of appeal had historically been treated 

as jurisdictional limits, and the Court said that, given 

the choice between calling into question some dicta in 

our recent opinions and effectively overruling a century 

worth of practice, we think the former option is the 

only prudent course.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, of course, Bowles --

I mean the Court did miss something. Everyone on the 

Court did, and that is that the period to file your 

notice of appeal was originally not in any statute. It 

was in the rule, the FRAP rule. The opinions, both 

sides, assumed that the statute came first, and the rule 

was adopted to conform to the statute, but in fact it 

was just the opposite. It was a rule, a Federal Rule of 

Civil Procedure, which can't affect jurisdiction. We 

know that. As Congress says rules of procedure don't 

affect jurisdiction. So there was the rule, and then

the U.S. Judicial Conference said to Congress, when it 

referred the rule to Congress, you might consider a 

conforming amendment. And then the statute, after the 

rule came into effect, conformed to the rule. So what 

the Court, both sides, thought in Bowles -- we just had 

it in reverse.

 MR. STEWART: I agree that the Court's 

opinions didn't note that fact, but I don't think that 

fact would or should have affected the treatment of the 

statute as jurisdictional. That is, once it was brought 

to Congress's attention that there was a potential 

conflict or tension between the language of the 

jurisdictional statute and the language of the 

corresponding Federal rule, Congress had the choice to 

make as to which should govern, and if Congress had 

wanted a different result from the one that was in the 

Federal rule, it could have enacted different language. 

I think it would not -- whatever we might privately 

think is the level of attention that Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Congress didn't 

think about it at all until the U.S. Judicial Conference 

said do this --

MR. STEWART: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the U.S. Judicial 

Conference wasn't thinking that thereby it became

jurisdictional.

 MR. STEWART: But my point is that, once 

this was brought to Congress's attention, Congress could 

have chosen to stick with other language, in which case 

I have no doubt that the corresponding rule would have 

been amended to fit the statute. Again, whatever 

level of attention we might privately think that 

Congress devoted to this question, the fact is that 

Congress acted as a body, passed a law, it was signed --

passed statutes in both houses. It was signed into law 

by the President. And from that point forward, it was a 

statutory rule and had to be treated as such. So I 

agree that this aspect of the problem wasn't addressed 

specifically by the opinions in Bowles, but I don't see 

any basis --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was addressed 

specifically. It was addressed that the rule -- that 

the -- that all of this was statute driven. But the 

rule before -- before there was a conforming statute, 

you would say, well, then it wasn't jurisdictional, 

right?

 MR. STEWART: I think to treat it as a 

conforming statute suggests that, in some way, Congress 

was obligated to do what the advisors told it to do or 

was obligated to conform Section 2107(a) to the terms of

the Federal rule, and that's not the case. Congress 

could have -- once this matter was brought to its 

attention, Congress could have enacted whatever statute 

it wanted. It chose to enact a statute that tracked the 

preexisting language of the rule, but from that time 

forward, the notice of appeal deadline was grounded in 

statute, and it was a statutory limit that applied to 

Bowles's own notice of appeal. So I don't think there 

is a basis for saying the case would or should have come 

out differently if the Court had been aware of the 

history of the statute's development.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I go back to the 

answer you gave Justice Stevens when he asked you to 

assume that there was no precedent, we're reading this 

as an original matter. I thought your answer to him, 

correct me if I'm wrong, was that, well, in any event 

"shall be barred" means that it can't be waived anyway. 

But statute -- I looked up other statutes of 

limitations, and other statutes of limitations: "Shall 

not be entertained," "may not be commenced," "may not be 

brought."

 MR. STEWART: My point is, if we were 

reading the statute without reference to any precedent 

addressing either 2501 itself or statutes of limitations 

generally, kind of the pure myopic, literal reading of

the statute, without reference to the legal context, 

would suggest that "every" means every, "shall be 

barred" means shall be barred, and there is no exception 

for cases in which the government fails to raise the 

argument in a timely way. And my point is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My response was all 

statute of limitations say that and all statute of 

limitations can be waived.

 MR. STEWART: And my point is there is no 

basis for Petitioner's argument that in inferring 

Congress's intent the Court should look to part of the 

broader legal context, namely: Decisions of this Court 

and others that have dealt with the general treatment of 

statutes of limitations, but should ignore the other 

part of the legal context, namely: Decisions of this 

Court that have said, squarely and unequivocally, this 

particular time limit is different.

 This particular time limit is nonwaivable 

and jurisdictional even though most statutes of 

limitations can be waived if they are not asserted in a 

timely way.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: One last question: We 

disagreed on parts of the Irwin opinion, but I take it 

you would agree with me that the government was 

particularly well represented in that case, wouldn't

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HAYNES: With respect, I suggest that 

the government won the battle, but lost the war on 

Irwin.

 This Court over the last few decades has 

attempted to bring some coherence to both the questions 

of sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction.

 And I think that the way the Court has 

framed the issues in Irwin to say that there is a

presumption that statutes of limitation are tollable 

and, therefore, are not jurisdictional in our view, 

tends to show that the Court wants a clear statement 

from Congress.

 The presumption language says Congress may 

at any time say otherwise and make a statute of 

limitations jurisdictional. Unless it does so, the 

statute of limitations would not affect subject matter 

jurisdiction.

 My brother makes the argument that Brockamp 

rebutted the Irwin presumption, but it's very important 

to understand that the Brockamp decision did not speak 

in jurisdictional terms. It spoke in a -- a mere matter 

of statutory -- not "a mere matter" -- it spoke in terms 

of statutory interpretation. It did not speak in 

jurisdictional terms.

 So Erwin, standing unassailed since that 

time, has forced the courts to look at the plain 

language of the statute, which is precisely what we 

advocate this Court does. Unless the Court has further 

questions, thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Haynes. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
