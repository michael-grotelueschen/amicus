3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case 10-8145, Smith v. Cain.

 Mr. Shanmugam. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

9 Justice, and may it please the Court:

 In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established 

11 the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must 

12 hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense 

13 before trial. This case presents a flagrant violation 

14 of that principle.

 The Orleans Parish district attorney's 

16 office produced almost no relevant evidence to the 

17 defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was 

18 convicted of first-degree murder based solely on the 

19 testimony of a single eyewitness. Unbeknownst to the 

defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on 

21 multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the 

22 perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know 

23 them if he saw them. 

24  The suppression of those statements alone 

justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's 

3
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 office in this case also engaged in the wholesale 

2 suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses, 

3 statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness 

4 identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast 

doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the 

6 shootings. 

7  If all of that information had been 

8 disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely 

9 would have viewed this case in a completely different 

light. The trial court therefore erred by rejecting 

11 Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be 

12 reversed. 

13  In our view, in order to conclude that 

14 Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court 

need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed 

16 statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner. 

17 Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld 

18 from the defense before trial, and argues only that the 

19 failure to disclose those statements was not 

prejudicial. 

21  Those statements, however, could not have 

22 more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident 

23 identification of Petitioner at trial --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he saw a picture. 

Boatner saw a picture in a newspaper, and that turned on 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 the light for him, right? It wasn't any police 

2 suggestion. 

3  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct. The basis 

4 for Boatner's identification was that he saw a 

photograph in the New Orleans newspaper of Petitioner. 

6 It was in connection with an article describing the 

7 shootings and suggesting that Petitioner was one of the 

8 suspects in the case. And that was what led to his 

9 prior identification out of court.

 But just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg, 

11 we're not arguing today that the identification was 

12 somehow constitutionally problematic. At most, we're 

13 arguing that the identification was of questionable 

14 validity in light of the fact that Boatner had only a 

limited opportunity to see the perpetrators and in light 

16 of the circumstances that led to his identification. 

17  Now, even if his identification were more 

18 clearly reliable, our argument today would be the same. 

19 In a case such as this one, in which the sole basis for 

linking the defendant to the crime is the testimony of a 

21 single eyewitness, and there is evidence that the single 

22 eyewitness said on multiple occasions that he couldn't 

23 identify anyone, we believe that, absent extraordinary 

24 circumstances, that will be sufficient to --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, aren't you 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 exaggerating a little bit about the value of the 

2 impeachment evidence regarding Boatner? Now, my 

3 understanding is that he made his first statement to the 

4 effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene 

when he had been at the scene where five people that he 

6 knew very well had been killed. 

7  He was lying on the floor with a big gash on 

8 his head. He was questioned at the scene, and at that 

9 time -- and this was in the evening -- he said: I can't 

identify anybody. But then, later that very day, wasn't 

11 it, that very evening, after midnight, he was questioned 

12 at the police station; am I correct? 

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's correct. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: And at that point he gave a 

description. He did make an -- he did provide a 

16 description of the person that he said was the one who 

17 first came through the door. So, you know, that -- I 

18 don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were 

19 statements to the effect that he couldn't identify 

anybody. 

21  But in light of the fact that he did provide 

22 a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the 

23 very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you 

24 exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times --

the effect of these statements that he couldn't

Official 

1 identify --

2  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Alito, it is true 

3 that Boatner provided identifying details in the later 

4 statement that night. I would respectfully submit that 

they were relatively limited identifying details, simply 

6 the fact that the first man through the door had a 

7 low-cut haircut and gold teeth. And as we indicate in 

8 our brief, those were characteristics shared by numerous 

9 other suspects in the case.

 But I think more broadly, with regard to 

11 both sets of statements at issue here, the State's 

12 explanations for those statements are at best plausible. 

13 And we really think that in a case such as this one, in 

14 which the evidence on its face is so clearly of high 

exculpatory or impeaching values, it takes something 

16 more than that. It is not sufficient for Respondent to 

17 argue here simply that, even taking into account these 

18 statements, a rational juror could still reach the same 

19 result and return a verdict of guilty here, because this 

Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that the standard 

21 for Brady claims is not a Jackson v. Virginia type 

22 sufficiency of the evidence standard. 

23  So, again, where you have statements that on 

24 their face are not simply statements calling a witness's 

credibility into question, but statements that really 

7

25

Official 

1 directly contradict the confident in-court 

2 identification, it would take an exceedingly persuasive 

3 explanation for those statements to defeat a showing of 

4 materiality. Now, with regard --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The standard is a 

6 reasonable probability that the result would have been 

7 different, reasonable probability? 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's correct. And 

9 this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that that's 

not a more likely than not standard. That is 

11 essentially the same standard that this Court has 

12 articulated for prejudice for ineffective assistance of 

13 counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, and by 

14 now it's a quite clearly established standard. And, 

again, it requires something less than a showing of more 

16 likely than not and perhaps something slightly more than 

17 the showing required for harmless error under Chapman v. 

18 California. 

19  But I do want to touch upon the State's 

explanations for these statements and explain very 

21 briefly why we think that those explanations are frankly 

22 not even plausible. With regard to the first statement 

23 to which Justice Alito referred, the statement that was 

24 made at the scene approximately half an hour after 

initial -- officers initially responded to the scene, 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 the State's argument is that Boatner was somehow too 

2 traumatized to make an identification at the time. 

3  But not only did Boatner not so testify at 

4 the postconviction hearing -- in fact he testified that 

he couldn't recall the statement at all -- but the very 

6 officer who took the statement himself testified at 

7 trial in this case that at the time of the statement 

8 Boatner was, quote, "coherent and articulated very well 

9 the events that transpired." And that is at pages 137 

to 138 of the joint appendix. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: That may be true, but if you 

12 were a juror and Boatner testified and he was 

13 cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based 

14 on his failure to make an identification right at the 

scene, and he said, well, that was because five of my 

16 friends had just been killed and I was lying on the 

17 floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had 

18 a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later 

19 when I collected myself and they asked me the same 

question at the police station, I provided a description 

21 and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody -- do you 

22 think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he 

23 couldn't identify him at the scene so he must have been 

24 lying when he identified -- when he provided a 

description later at the police station?

Official 

1  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Alito, I think that 

2 it's possible that a juror could credit that explanation 

3 in any retrial, though I --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there also an 

intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he 

6 couldn't identify? And that was after what he said on 

7 the night, the same night. 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Five days later he said: 

I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him. 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct, Justice 

12 Ginsburg. But even if we didn't have the March 6th 

13 statement or statements, I would frankly be happy to 

14 take my chances with the jury, even with regard solely 

to the March 1st statement, in light of that testimony 

16 of Officer Ronquillo that Boatner was in fact coherent, 

17 articulated very well the events that transpired, just 

18 like any witness, and so on and so forth. 

19  So, again -- -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor --

21  MR. SHANMUGAM: -- we don't think that it's 

22 our burden to show that no juror could credit the 

23 State's explanation. It's simply that we think that 

24 that explanation doesn't hold water.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, your argument

Official 

1 now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most 

2 heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment 

3 materials of the only witness to this crime and the only 

4 piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime. 

But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend 

6 90 percent of their brief arguing against the other 

7 things. But I just want to clarify those other things. 

8  Number one, was the testimony mixed 

9 testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask 

across their face or over their entire head? 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: There --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the best take on 

13 what the evidence showed that was presented on that 

14 issue?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: There was some degree of 

16 variation in what the witnesses said. Now, in the main, 

17 we're talking, again, about statements that were 

18 withheld. And I want to lay out those statements very 

19 briefly, if I may. There were two eyewitnesses who made 

statements to the police indicating that some or all of 

21 the perpetrators, including the first man through the 

22 door, were wearing masks. Those were the statements of 

23 Shelita Russel and the statement of Dale Mims. 

24  Now, with regard to the statement of Shelita 

Russell -- and this was what we believe was the dying 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 declaration that she made at the scene in the immediate 

2 aftermath of having been shot multiple times -- Russell 

3 said she saw people barge into the kitchen; one had a 

4 black cloth across the face, first one through the door. 

So, it is at least theoretically possible --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you 

7 something? Who determines that issue of whether that's 

8 a dying declaration?  Do we determine that in deciding 

9 whether the withholding of the Brady materials was 

harmful or not? Do we give deference to the lower 

11 court's determination of that? Do they have to decide 

12 whether it was a dying declaration? What's the standard 

13 on something like this? 

14  MR. SHANMUGAM: The lower court did not make 

such a determination in this case on this or any of the 

16 other evidentiary issues that Respondent now advances, 

17 at least in part because it does not appear that 

18 Respondent advanced any of those arguments below. But I 

19 think more broadly, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of the 

role of this Court or any other court considering a 

21 Brady claim, this Court hasn't quite spoken to the 

22 specific issue of whether a Brady court is supposed to 

23 itself make an evidentiary determination where there's a 

24 question about admissibility, but the closest that this 

Court came was in Wood v. Bartholomew, in which this 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Court indicated that with regard to Brady material, it 

2 either has to itself be admissible or be reasonably 

3 likely to lead to admissible evidence. And the Court's 

4 reasoning in Wood v. Bartholomew was somewhat spare on 

that score. That was a summary reversal in a per curiam 

6 opinion. 

7  But I do think that it would be appropriate 

8 for a Brady court to make that determination itself or, 

9 at a minimum, make a determination as to whether it 

appears that it's reasonably likely that the evidence 

11 would be admissible. 

12  Here, we really don't think that it's a 

13 close question, particularly with regard to the 

14 statement of Shelita Russell, because the context of the 

handwritten notes makes clear that the statement was 

16 taken at the scene of the crime. Shelita Russell was 

17 taken to the hospital approximately a half an hour after 

18 the shootings occurred. She told two witnesses that she 

19 believed that she was dying. And so, under the law on 

dying declarations -- and I have no reason to believe 

21 that the law is any different in Louisiana from the 

22 Federal system or the 49 other States -- that would 

23 comfortably satisfy that requirement. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, Mr. Mims was the 

neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 in total, right, and two left the scene? 

2  MR. SHANMUGAM: There's some doubt as to 

3 whether or not there were three or four assailants. And 

4 Mims himself, in all candor, was a little bit 

inconsistent on that point. But he consistently said, 

6 both in the handwritten notes and in his testimony at 

7 the postconviction hearing, that all of the assailants, 

8 however many there were, were wearing masks and that --

9 that he saw them as they were getting into the car. He 

didn't say anything further other than that the masks 

11 were ski-type masks. 

12  But the State's argument with regard to the 

13 materiality of Mims's statement is that it is possible 

14 that the men would not have been wearing masks when they 

entered the house to allegedly commit the armed robbery; 

16 and, therefore, the fact that Boatner saw the first man 

17 unmasked can be reconciled with his statement. And, 

18 again, we would be happy to take our chances with the 

19 jury and make the argument that that would be an 

exceedingly unconventional way to go about committing an 

21 armed robbery. 

22  And, again, with regard to the Russell and 

23 Mims statements, I think it's important to remember that 

24 we view those statements as going directly to and 

contradicting Boatner's in-court identification. And 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 so, in some sense, we view those statements as being of 

2 a piece with Boatner's own prior statements in which he 

3 indicated that he could not identify anyone and that he 

4 did not --

JUSTICE ALITO: Does the defense have any 

6 theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he 

7 could identify this individual? 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: First of all, Justice Alito, 

9 it would, of course, not be the defense's burden in any 

subsequent retrial to come up with a theory of its own. 

11 The defense could simply argue, as it did at the first 

12 trial, that the prosecution simply didn't bear its 

13 burden on reasonable doubt. But --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: But, yes -- but the -- the 

impact of your impeachment evidence would be related 

16 certainly to if a juror would ask, well, why would he 

17 lie about this? And I -- I'm just asking, would -- did 

18 the defense have any theory about what his motive would 

19 be about whether he could identify somebody, whether 

this first person had a mask or not? 

21  MR. SHANMUGAM: As this Court will be aware 

22 from its recent consideration of eyewitness evidence, it 

23 doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that an 

24 eyewitness identification is mistaken that the 

eyewitness was somehow lying about it. It may very well 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 have been that Boatner made a mistaken identification in 

2 good faith out of a desire to identify the person who 

3 killed several of his friends. 

4  And, indeed, as the amicus brief of the 

Innocence Project explains in this case, there is a 

6 phenomenon known as "mug shot exposure effect," where an 

7 individual who sees a mug shot in some other context is 

8 more likely to identify that same person when confronted 

9 with a subsequent line-up. Of course, where, as here, 

the individual is exposed to the mug shot for the first 

11 time in seeing a newspaper article that depicts the 

12 individual in question and suggests that that individual 

13 is a suspect in the crime, it would not at all be 

14 unusual for the individual, when confronted with that 

photograph again in a line-up a few weeks later, to pick 

16 that individual. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: But the first time he -- he 

18 said that the person wasn't masked and provided a 

19 description was long before he saw any mug shots. It 

was the evening of the event. It was when he was 

21 questioned at the police station. 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, on the evening of the 

23 event, he provided those limited details about the gold 

24 teeth and the low-cut haircut.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but by doing that he's 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 saying this person wasn't wearing a mask. That's the 

2 critical point. 

3  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that may suggest that 

4 the person was not wearing a mask. Of course, it's 

possible that the person somehow had part of his face 

6 covered. 

7  But I think it's important to realize, 

8 Justice Alito, that even with regard to that statement, 

9 while it is true that Boatner provided those limiting 

details, he also made statements suggesting that he was 

11 not confident of his ability to actually make an 

12 identification. And in that statement, which is found 

13 at page 296 of the joint appendix, he says: I was too 

14 scared to look at anybody. I wish I could give y'all a 

description. 

16  So, in some sense, we think that the focus 

17 on the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut in this case 

18 is a bit of an aside, because the question here is not 

19 whether he saw enough to support the subsequent 

identification; the question is whether his suppressed 

21 statements in which he repeatedly said, I can't make an 

22 identification, contradict his in-court confident 

23 identification of Petitioner. 

24  And we think that in order to decide this 

case, all that the Court essentially need say in an

Official 

1 opinion is that in a case such as this one, in which all 

2 you have is the identification of a single eyewitness, 

3 where you have statements in which that eyewitness said 

4 I can't make an identification, and those statements 

have concededly been suppressed, the Brady materiality 

6 threshold is satisfied. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I right --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In looking at the 

9 appendix, there are some asterisks. Were these 

statements, the first two -- the one at 252 in the joint 

11 appendix and then the statement on March the 2nd, which 

12 is the one you just referred to, 296, were parts of 

13 those statements given to the defense counsel or none of 

14 the statements? And how long were the documents? Were 

they 20 or 30 pages? Can you tell me a little bit about 

16 that? 

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: First of all, none of those 

18 statements were given to the defense. The only 

19 relevant --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I shouldn't have said 

21 "statements." None of the reports. 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. None of the statements 

23 or the surrounding materials was given to the defense at 

24 all. The only even remotely relevant thing that was 

given to the defense was the initial police report, 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 which was a five-page document prepared by the officers 

2 who initially responded to the scene, with a one-page 

3 narrative of what took place. And that document, for 

4 the Court's reference, is in volume 10 of the initial 

record that was received from the district court at
 

6 pages R1907 to 1911.
 

7  Now, with regard to these specific
 

8 statements, both the narrative statements and the
 

9 handwritten notes, the narrative statements were
 

contained in a relatively voluminous document -- I 

11 believe it was an 83-page document -- that was a 

12 narrative prepared by Officer Ronquillo that set out 

13 everything that took place over the course of the 

14 investigation. And none of that was disclosed.

 Respondent makes the argument that the trial 

16 court reviewed that document in camera, but we think 

17 that it is somewhat unclear what, if anything, the trial 

18 court actually reviewed in camera. There's no dispute 

19 that that document was not handed over to the defense.

 With regard to the handwritten notes, there 

21 actually are a relatively small number of relevant 

22 handwritten notes in this case, but all of them were 

23 contained in the police files, and none of them, none of 

24 the ones at issue on which we're relying, was handed 

over before trial.

1  So, this is not a case in which selective 

2 materials were handed over. None of this material was 

3 handed over, and that's why we really think that this is 

4 a case that involves the categorical withholding of 

documents and not simply the withholding of selected 

6 documents that may subsequently turn out to be relevant. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you just tell me, how 

8 does Brady work? Is there some obligation for the 

9 defense counsel to say please give me all relevant 

reports? 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: No. This Court has made 

12 clear that a request is unnecessary to trigger the Brady 

13 obligation, and this Court has made clear in cases 

14 dating back to Brady itself that the good faith or bad 

faith of the prosecutor is irrelevant. And, of course, 

16 the prosecutor has a duty under Brady to hand over not 

17 only materials in the prosecutor's own possession but 

18 also materials in the possession of the police as well. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is -- this 

group or gang, all of them had gold teeth and faded hair

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: There were five other 

23 suspects who had gold teeth or -- and low-cut haircuts. 

24 Three of the other individuals who were primarily in the 

frame for this murder had those characteristics. I

shootings was withheld.

greater than yours, Justice Scalia. But my 

21 understanding is --

1 or perhaps semipermanent implants, and that in hip-hop 

2 culture in the 1990s, this was relatively common. But 

3 whatever the provenance of this practice, it is 

4 undisputed on this record that multiple other suspects 

had those characteristics. 

6  Justice Sotomayor, there was one thing you 

7 asked that I just want to get back to with regard to the 

8 remaining categories of evidence. I just want to set 

9 them out, and then I'd be happy to answer any questions 

that the Court has about them. And if there are no 

11 further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time. 

12  As we explain in our brief, there are three 

13 other categories of evidence at issue here. There was 

14 the statement of Phillip Young, Petitioner's 

co-defendant, suggesting that Petitioner was not 

16 involved in the shootings. There were also the 

17 statements that would have called into question the 

18 prosecution's theory that Petitioner was one of the 

19 shooters, a theory that was essential to establishing 

the intent required for first-degree murder under 

21 Louisiana law. Louisiana is somewhat different from 

22 other States in that it doesn't require premeditation, 

23 but that it -- but it does require a specific intent to 

24 kill or inflict great bodily harm.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, on that point, the

Official 

1 State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction 

2 between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 

3 9-millimeter automatic pistol. 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't think that 

that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous 

6 sources in our brief that draw precisely that 

7 distinction. 

8  But I think that what's noteworthy with 

9 regard to the statements at issue is that both Boatner, 

who identified the weapon that the perpetrator whom he 

11 believed to be Petitioner was carrying, and the State's 

12 ballistics expert, Kenneth Leary, who identified the 

13 weapon that was responsible for the firing of the 

14 casings at issue, conspicuously failed to say that the 

weapon at issue was a 9- millimeter handgun. But at 

16 trial their testimonies suddenly converged, and Boatner, 

17 who had previously said only that the perpetrator was 

18 carrying a handgun, said that the perpetrator was 

19 carrying a 9-millimeter handgun; and Leary, who said 

that the casings at issue had come from a machine pistol 

21 of the Intratec or MAC-11 type, suddenly said that they 

22 came from a 9-millimeter handgun instead. 

23  And so, at a minimum, if the defense had 

24 possessed those statements, it could have sown doubt on 

whether the firearm was in fact one and the same and, 

23

1 therefore, sown doubt on a critical element of the 

2 offense at issue. 

3  And finally, the only other category --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'd just like to go back 

to that because I'm not sure I understand the argument. 

6 Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the 

7 casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter? And I know 

8 that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was 

9 used. And the issue was whether anybody would call a 

MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol, 

11 correct? 

12  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's right with 

13 regard to Leary's testimony. I think the thing that was 

14 a little bit odd with regard to Boatner's testimony was 

the sudden degree of specificity. Having said only that 

16 it was a handgun or a chrome automatic in his prior 

17 statements, he said at trial that it was a 9-millimeter 

18 handgun, which he had not previously said in the 

19 statements that were withheld.

 And, finally, the last category of evidence 

21 consists of the notes of the interview in which Eric 

22 Rogers relayed Robert Trackling's confession to 

23 involvement in the shootings. As the amicus brief of 

24 the NACDL points out, courts have routinely held that 

confessions by other perpetrators constitute exculpatory

1 evidence, even with regard to offenses that may have had 

2 multiple perpetrators. And we certainly believe that at 

3 a minimum the suppression of those notes, when 

4 considered in conjunction with all of the other 

evidence, comfortably satisfies the Brady materiality 

6 standard, and it's for that reason that we think that 

7 the judgment of the trial court should be reversed. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shanmugam, just a quick 

9 one. Was -- is all the evidence that you're discussing 

here today -- was that presented to the State 

11 postconviction court? 

12  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. We believe that all of 

13 this evidence was before the State postconviction court.

3 yes, Justice Sotomayor, several of the -- those faces or 

4 several of those individuals bore short fade haircuts. 

And, yes, some of the individuals who were pictured in 

6 those photo line-ups were other suspects. The record 

7 reflects that Mr. Boatner scrutinized those 72 faces. 

8 At one point, line-up 11 was shown to him on March 22nd, 

9 and he remarked about the haircut. He said: My 

assailant wore his hair like this --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- was this 

12 line-up -- was this after Boatner saw the photograph in 

13 the newspaper? 

14  MS. ANDRIEU: No, it was not. I believe 

the -- Mr. Smith's photograph was pictured in the 

16 Times-Picayune newspaper on June 7th, and this 

17 particular line-up was shown to Mr. Boatner on March 

18 22nd. So, at that point, line-up 8, he stopped and 

19 remarked about the hair --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me why 

21 Boatner waited 2 weeks to -- or never told the police 

22 that the face that he saw in the newspaper was the face

1  MS. ANDRIEU: Yes, he did. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It wasn't until they 

3 presented him with the line-up including Mr. Smith's 

4 face that he identified Mr. Smith. What's the reason 

for the delay? 

6  MS. ANDRIEU: His reason, Your Honor, is --

7 it's contained most specifically on page 191 of the 

8 joint appendix, and it is frankly that he was afraid. 

9 He -- and I think the jury would have understood that. 

He obviously knew what Mr. Smith was capable of. He --

11 I'm sure he feared --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what turned --

13 what changed his mind once the police showed him the 

14 line-up?

 MS. ANDRIEU: Well, I don't know that he 

16 changed his mind, but he was presented with a line-up, 

17 and when he was presented with the line-up, he very 

18 quickly identified Juan Smith and said: That is him; I 

19 will never forget his face. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was before or 

21 after the picture in the paper? 

22  MS. ANDRIEU: That was after. And all of 

23 this, by the way, was vetted during -- during a motion 

24 to suppress hearing. When the trial judge learned or --

that the photograph had been shown in the newspaper, he

1 reopened the hearing on the motion to suppress to 

2 determine -- and over the State's objection. We argued 

3 that this was not State action. But he reopened the 

4 motion to suppress to determine for himself whether or 

not that newspaper had in any way tainted the later 

6 identification of Juan Smith. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: What is this? I mean, I 

8 thought -- I may -- I thought the issue is that there 

9 were some notes, and the first note, which was made on 

the day, the policeman says that Boatner said he could 

11 not supply a description of the perpetrator, other than 

12 to say they were black males. Then he said they had 

13 golden teeth and a low-cut haircut. 

14  And 5 days later, he said he could not ID 

anyone because he couldn't see faces. Then he said he'd 

16 only glanced at the first man. He couldn't tell if they 

17 had their faces covered and didn't see anyone. Then he 

18 said, I could not ID, would not know them if I saw them. 

19 And another set of police notes says he said that he 

could not identify any of the perpetrators of the 

21 murder. 

22  So, I guess those are all notes that the --

23 the prosecution did not give to the defense. So, if you 

24 were a defense lawyer, whatever this other stuff is, I 

guess you would have been pretty happy to have those

4  JUSTICE BREYER: And so, what are -- you're 

saying that I guess it would have made no difference? 

6  MS. ANDRIEU: That's correct, Your Honor. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Then I'd like to hear that 

8 because it seems on its face that it certainly could 

9 have made a difference, that if he had those notes that 

he could have tried to impeach him and said where did 

11 this sudden recognition come from. 

12  MS. ANDRIEU: And I can appreciate your 

13 concern. This Court has held that favorable evidence --

14 well, this Court has held that favorable evidence which 

is not material need not be turned over to the defense. 

16 And if I could --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how could it not be 

18 material? Here is the only eyewitness --

19  MS. ANDRIEU: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and we have 

21 inconsistent statements. Are you really urging that the 

22 prior statements were immaterial? 

23  MS. ANDRIEU: Yes, Your Honor. If I may put 

24 them in perspective. Mr. Boatner provided two 

statements -- I'm sorry. Mr. Boatner provided a

Official 

1 statement on the scene, two statements the day of the
 

2 incident. To a first responding officer who was not
 

3 Detective Ronquillo, he gave a description, and that
 

4 description was heavy built, with a hair with a fade
 

with a little small top, with a lot of gold in his 

6 mouth. That was while he was at the scene. 

7  Later, homicide Detective John Ronquillo 

8 arrived at the scene, and apparently, according to his 

9 notes and, most importantly, according to his 

postconviction testimony, he asked Larry -- he asked 

11 Larry Boatner for a description. And Larry Boatner 

12 said, I can't give you a description. 

13  I'll put them all in perspective and then go 

14 back to what Detective Ronquillo and Mr. Boatner had to 

say about that. But in any case, Mr. Boatner's severe 

16 laceration was treated, and then he was escorted to the 

17 homicide office, where he gave his formal statement. 

18 And in that statement, part of which has been reproduced 

19 here by opposing counsel, Mr. Boatner said: I can tell 

you about the one, the one who put the pistol in my 

21 face. He was a black male with a low cut, golds in his 

22 mouth. I don't know how many; that's all. I was too 

23 scared to look at anybody. All of them had guns, one 

24 with an AK; one with a TEC-9. The one who hit me had a 

chrome automatic. It was big. So --

2 could argue, presumably you did argue, that before the

4 jury. And if you were the defense lawyer, you really 

would like to have that statement where he said: I 

6 couldn't identify them. 

7  MS. ANDRIEU: You would like to have it, but 

8 it's not material because, sandwiched between two 

9 descriptions -- and he's -- between two descriptions, he 

says, I can't identify. And taken in --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that make it not 

12 material? You can argue that it should be given 

13 diminished weight. But an inconsistent statement by the 

14 only eyewitness seems to me most material and useful to 

the defense in cross-examining the eyewitness. I really 

16 don't understand how you can -- you can argue that the 

17 jury shouldn't put much weight on it because there were 

18 these other things; but to say that it's immaterial I 

19 find that that is -- is not plausible.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And not only the only 

21 eyewitness but, if I understand it correctly, the only 

22 evidence against the defendant. This was the only

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just on the
 

9 materiality point, I -- I just have to agree with
 

Justice Ginsburg. What you're telling us is that when 

11 the defense stands up and said, and isn't it true that, 

12 in this statement which you just have testified to on 

13 direct and which the police have put in on direct, you 

14 also said you could not identify any perpetrators of the 

murder -- and then the prosecutor says immaterial, and

2 he can't identify anybody, he doesn't know. I mean, 

3 what -- that sounds like there's a probability that 

4 would have made a difference. Why not?

 MS. ANDRIEU: The -- among the most 

6 important evidence in this case is the testimony or the 

7 transcript from the postconviction relief hearing. John 

8 Ronquillo, whose notes these are, was asked about the 

9 March 6th statement. And I guess we are 

fast-forwarding. The next -- the statement after the 

11 statement made -- the one made in the homicide office 

12 was made on March 6th. And at that time, Detective 

13 Ronquillo called Larry Boatner, and Larry Boatner said, 

14 I can't identify anyone.

 Based -- and what Detective Ronquillo had to 

16 say about that -- first of all, Larry Boatner didn't 

17 remember saying that. But what Detective Ronquillo had 

18 to say about it -- and he was the person who was --

19 whose impressions -- about whose impressions we're 

speaking -- was that at that point, Mr. Boatner, like 

21 many murder witnesses, was retreating, temporarily 

22 equivocating, as we wrote in brief. He was retreating 

23 somewhat from his assistance with the police. Not an --

2  MS. ANDRIEU: I'm sorry. Those are 

3 statements where he inculpated the defendant. There are 

4 two statements. Starting on the scene, there is a 

statement provided to the first responding officer, 

6 where he provides a description. Larry Boatner provides 

7 a description --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is a description 

9 that others, other suspects, fit. The close-cut hair, 

the gold teeth. That didn't identify Smith, as opposed 

11 to the other suspects who had those same 

12 characteristics. 

13  MS. ANDRIEU: Yes. And those other 

14 suspects' photographs were all contained -- were 

contained in photo IDs -- in photo line-ups, and 

16 Mr. Boatner never selected one of them. 

17  The other thing is he -- gold teeth. He 

18 knew that his perpetrator had gold teeth. The next time 

19 he saw Mr. Smith was at trial in court. Mr. Smith 

revealed his teeth, and he had gold teeth. But as far 

21 as the other suspects having the haircut or physical --

22 similar physical attributes --

11  MS. ANDRIEU: The prosecutor in this case 

12 actually turned them over to the trial court for an in 

13 camera inspection. And article -- Louisiana Code of 

14 Criminal Procedure article 718 actually provides for 

that practice. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: It's so odd that -- I mean, 

17 look, it seems like here it is 5 days after the shooting 

18 and well before, I guess, that this witness saw any mug 

19 shots or did anything. And he says, I could not 

identify anyone, because he couldn't see the faces of 

21 the people. And now you're saying later, which you 

22 introduce into trial, his having looked at the faces of 

23 people and identified them from their faces. 

24  Now, previously, he said he couldn't see 

their faces. All right. And in Louisiana, the State of

JUSTICE BREYER: What? 

6  MS. ANDRIEU: I'm sorry. When he's saying 

7 that he could not see the faces, he is not referring to 

8 Juan Smith. He and Detective Ronquillo testified at 

9 postconviction that he always said he could identify the 

one, the one whose face appeared a handgun's length from 

11 his own, unmasked, when he opened that front door at 

12 2230 North Roman. 

13  Detective Ronquillo put this in perspective 

14 at postconviction. And as I said, he --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you mean all these --

16 all these statements that we have here, you're saying, 

17 all referred to people other than the defendant. 

18  MS. ANDRIEU: Juan. Yes.

a finding on that?

7  MS. ANDRIEU: With regard to the March 6th 

8 statement where Larry Boatner tells John Ronquillo at 

9 that point, I can't identify anyone, what Mr. -- what 

Detective Ronquillo had to say about that is 

11 dispositive. And he said, at that point Larry Boatner 

12 was withdrawing from -- he was afraid -- he was 

13 withdrawing from police assistance.

he becomes the arbiter of what's Brady. You said to me 

16 earlier that a jury would be entitled to reject his 

17 conclusion. All right? Tell me what -- how his 

18 conclusion makes it non-Brady if a juror could decide 

19 differently.

 MS. ANDRIEU: The -- the postconviction

22 filed with attachments, with exhibits. That is what

those are --

identify anyone, Mr. Boatner would not have viewed 15

8 argument. 

9  MS. ANDRIEU: I'm sorry --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me why they didn't 

11 on their face constitute Brady materials that needed to 

12 be turned over. What's the legal principle that doesn't 

13 make them Brady? 

14  MS. ANDRIEU: Because if they had been 

presented -- if those statements had been presented to

17 would have remained the same. The jury --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you know? How do 

19 you know? How can you possibly know? The jury is 

supposed to decide on the credibility of this witness. 

21 There's a statement that he made a prior inconsistent 

22 statement. The -- Mr. Shanmugam outlined five

11 the one who said that his cellmate told him that his

presenting to this Court as evidence of a dying 

16 declaration are words and dashes of Detective Ronquillo 

17 written at some point where he -- written at some 

18 point --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it a determination by 

the judge that it wasn't a dying declaration?

1 because it was not turned over. And with all respect, I 

2 think you misspoke when you -- you were asked what is --

3 what is the test for when Brady material must be turned 

4 over. And you said whether or not there's a reasonable 

probability -- a reasonable likelihood -- pardon me -- a 

6 reasonable probability that the result would have been 

7 different. That's the test for when there has been a 

8 Brady violation. You don't determine your Brady 

9 obligation by the test for the Brady violation. You're 

transposing two very different things. 

11  And so, that's incorrect. 

12  MS. ANDRIEU: And I'm sorry, Justice 

13 Ginsburg, your -- Shelita Russell did not give a dying 

14 declaration. The notes are --

JUDGE GINSBURG: All right. Let's go to

17 to their car when they were exiting. They had ski 

18 masks.

Mims testified at postconviction. He testified he did 

21 not see the assailants arrive. He did not see them --

Mr. Boatner -- I'm sorry -- that Mr. Smith masked 

6 himself upon escape after --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is that maybe --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I'm 

9 sorry. I thought the idea was they were going to kill 

everybody who might have seen them inside. Their only 

11 worry would be someone who would see them outside, 

12 right? 

13  MS. ANDRIEU: Yes. So worried that the car 

14 that they arrived in had no license plate. They were 

definitely looking not to be identified.

have an argument that these statements of Larry Boatner

1 are not material. The other evidence that Mr. Shanmugam 

2 has put before this Court were either not suppressed or 

3 not favorable. The -- Larry Boatner gave several -- he 

4 -- he did describe Juan Smith. He described him on 

several occasions, and he ultimately identified him, and 

6 he identified him after scrupulously viewing 13 

7 line-ups. 

8  So, the suggestion that he said at one 

9 point -- because he's equivocating because his name is 

on -- his name, address, contact information are on the 

11 police report. It is not a surprise -- and I don't 

12 think it would be a surprise to Orleans Parish jurors --

13 to find that, early in an investigation, a murder 

14 witness equivocates. He --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're taking that 

16 judgment away from the jury. There was a prior 

17 inconsistent statement. Shouldn't that be the end of 

18 it? A prior inconsistent statement, one that is 

19 favorable to the defense, has to be turned over, period. 

I thought was what Brady requires.

7  MS. ANDRIEU: Well, I -- and I actually 

8 thought I had when I said a prudent prosecutor would, 

9 but in making a sort of over-the-shoulder, rear-window 

Brady analysis, I don't think that these statements --

11 that the statements made to -- the statement made to 

12 Ronquillo at the scene where he's all shook up and he 

13 says, I can't describe anybody; then he goes to the 

14 hospital, gets his severe laceration taken care of --

8 of Brady. I said there were two prongs to Brady. Do 

9 you have to turn it over, and, second, does it cause 

harm. And the first one you said not. That -- it is

7  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 

11  Just three very quick points. First of all, 

12 with regard to Larry Boatner's statements on March the 

13 6th, Justice Breyer, you'll be happy to know that your 

14 law clerks' notes were correct. Boatner on March the 

6th said -- and this is at page 308 of the joint 

16 appendix -- could not ID anyone because couldn't see 

17 faces; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't see 

18 anyone; would not know them if I saw them. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not surprised they're 

correct. 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: It is quite clear that that 

23 statement applies to all of the perpetrators. The State 

24 advances the argument today, as it did in its brief, 

that Boatner must have been too scared to cooperate by 

54

1 March the 6th, but that is utterly belied by the record 

2 in this case. Boatner continued to cooperate with the 

3 police investigation in the following weeks, reviewing 

4 police line-ups. He even testified that he wanted to go 

looking for Petitioner after seeing his photograph in 

6 the New Orleans newspaper, pages 489 and 494 of the 

7 joint appendix. He didn't leave New Orleans until June, 

8 3 months later, and he actually returned to New Orleans 

9 before Petitioner was even apprehended. So, again --

JUSTICE ALITO: It is your understanding 

11 that the -- that all of Boatner's -- all the notes about 

12 Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge 

13 before trial for in camera inspection? 

14  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Alito, it is 

entirely unclear based on this record. Counsel for 

16 Respondent cites the transcript from October 31st, 1995, 

17 a transcript that wasn't even prepared until after cert 

18 was granted in this case. 

19  It's clear that the court reviewed 

something, but it is entirely unclear from that 

21 transcript what the court reviewed. And, of course, 

22 even if the court had made an in camera determination, 

23 it would no way -- in no way affect our claim after the 

24 fact here.

 My second point: The State today for the

25

Official 

1 first time says, in response to the question from 

2 Justice Scalia, that there was more evidence here 

3 linking Petitioner to the crime and relies on the 

4 testimony of Eddie Young, the brother of Phillip Young, 

the individual who was found at the scene. But the sole 

6 substance of that testimony was that Phillip Young knew 

7 Petitioner. And we would respectfully submit that that 

8 is scarcely inculpatory, and if it was, anyone in New 

9 Orleans who knows a felon ought to be worried. And, 

therefore, we really don't think that that adds anything 

11 to the evidence in this case. The sole evidence linking 

12 Petitioner to the crime was the statement -- the 

13 testimony of Larry Boatner. 

14  Third, there has been some discussion about 

the language in this Court's cases in Kyles and Agurs 

16 suggesting that prosecutors should err on the side of 

17 caution. That is part of the constitutional standard 

18 because, after all, the materiality requirement is part 

19 of the requirement for a constitutional violation under 

Brady. But all of the evidence at issue here, including 

21 Boatner's statements, was withheld from the defense, 

22 leaving aside this question of what the trial court may 

23 have reviewed in camera. 

24  And the prosecutor's conduct in this case, 

with all due respect to Ms. Andrieu, was not, quote, "a 

56

1 little too close to the wind." The Orleans Parish 

2 district attorney's office acted with flagrant disregard 

3 for its obligations under Brady in this case. The Brady 

4 standard has been around for half a century. There is 

no real ambiguity about what that standard requires, and 

6 we think that the conduct in this case was in fact 

7 egregious and clearly violated that standard. We think 

8 that the trial court erred by rejecting Petitioner's 

9 Brady claim, and for that reason, we think that its 

judgment should be reversed.
