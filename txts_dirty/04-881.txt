CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument 

next in Lockhart versus United States. 

Mr. Wolfman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Section 207 of the Social Security Act contains 

a broad ban on the attachment of Social Security benefits 

that may be overridden if, in doing so, Congress expressly 

refers to Section 207. Our basic position is that the 

effect of an express reference to Section 207 can go no 

further than the authority that is granted in the statute 

that includes the express reference. Therefore, here, the 

Debt Collection Act, the statute that contains that 

express reference, prohibits offsets to collect claims 

that have been outstanding for more than 10 years. 

Therefore, the Government lacks offset authority to 

collect Mr. Lockhart's older debts. 

The Debt Collections Act's 10-year bar on the 

right of the Government to offset debt from governmental 

payments owing to debtors was enacted in 1982. But, at 

that time, the Government did not have authority to offset

Social Security benefits at all. The Government's claim 

that there's no 10-year bar here relies entirely on a 

provision of the Higher Education technical amendments 

that overrode statutes of limitations for collecting 

student debts. But that was passed in 1991, 5 years 

before the -- before -- the Government had authority to 

offset Social Security benefits at all. That authority, 

as I've referred to, came only in 1996, in the Debt 

Collection Improvement Act, which did expressly refer to 

the Social Security Act's anti-attachment provision. But 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- are -- just as an 

initial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a 

future Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law 

that says, you know, "In the future, no statute shall have 

X effect unless it says" -- and then it writes in a phrase 

that has to be said? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And then you have a future 

Congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute 

that does not use the magic words. I thought our cases 

held that, in such a situation, the will of the future 

Congress prevails --

MR. WOLFMAN: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as it's clearly

expressed. 

MR. WOLFMAN: I will say that that is something 

that we've considered. It's not briefed here, but I think 

the issue is not presented here. And here's why: because 

in -- what occurred in 1996 comported with the express-

reference requirement. The problem here is that -- so, it 

said that they can offset Social Security benefits. But 

it is contained in a statute that includes the 10-year 

bar. So, even if the anti-attachment provision did not 

exclude the express-reference provision, it still --

whatever allowed the attachment has to be, in our view, 

coincident with the statute in which the express reference 

JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't contain the bar at 

the time that they said, "You can collect it." In the 

later statute, which said, "You now can collect out of 

Social Security," when they passed that, did it contain a 

10-year bar? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, it did. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the Higher Education 

Act said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act 

say, "No statute of limitations applies to us"? 

MR. WOLFMAN: That was 1991. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. In --

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- 1991, it said, "No statute 

of limitations applies to us." Then, in what year did the 

statute -- was passed which said, "And you can collect 

money out of Social Security payments for higher 

education"? 

MR. WOLFMAN: That occurred in 1996. But, as I 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Why isn't that the 

end of it? So --

MR. WOLFMAN: The reason that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- so there was no -- there was 

no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security 

Act; and then, in 1996, they say, "And now go get them." 

MR. WOLFMAN: Because --

JUSTICE BREYER: What can we do about that? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Because, with respect, that's not 

what Congress said in 1996. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What did they say? 

MR. WOLFMAN: They didn't say, "Go get them." 

What they did is, as an amendment to the Debt Collection 

Act, in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, they inserted 

permission to go -- to offset Social Security benefits in 

a statute that has a 10-year bar. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: It has a 10-year bar. But the 

earlier 1991 Act says, "That doesn't apply to us."

 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, but -- but, again, getting 

back -- and I think this takes us back to Justice Scalia's 

question -- that -- the -- there is a broad anti-

attachment provision. There is an express-reference 

requirement. Our view is that the -- that -- those 

requirements can go no -- the abrogation of the -- of the 

bar to offset Social Security benefits, or to attach 

Social Security benefits in any way, can go no further 

than the statute in which that abrogation occurs. And 

this statute has a 10-year bar. 

So, if I can explain further, the Debt 

Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt Collection Act 

before it, has a 10-year bar. It's not merely a statute 

of limitations. It says that the Government has no 

authority to offset after the 10-year period, after the 

claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years. That's 

the statute that includes the abrogation of the offset of 

Social Security benefits. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, you're 

saying that that provision of the later statute that says, 

"Go get them on Social Security," implicitly reads into it 

the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, it's as if it said, "Go get 

them on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but

only for 10 years." 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what your -- I'm trying 

to understand this. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That is our argument. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That is our argument. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

MR. WOLFMAN: But I would only qualify it --

JUSTICE BREYER: The only problem is, it 

doesn't say that. 

MR. WOLFMAN: No, I would disagree, Your Honor. 

I would say that my only quarrel with your question is 

that it's not implicit, it is explicit. The statute --

the Debt Collection Improvement Act, as the Debt 

Collection Act before it, contains a 10-year bar on the 

authority of the Government to offset. This is not a mere 

statute-of-limitations defense that can be waived. This 

is a complete lack of authority to the -- in the 

Government to offset. That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- the statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that this has a 

purpose other than barring stable -- stale claims? It's 

simply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to

allow other Federal programs to proceed and -- I'm looking 

for some way for you to describe (e) as being something 

other than a limitations provision. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, what it says --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I think that would help 

you. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, and I think -- that's exactly 

my point. What (e) says is that this Act does not apply 

-- and I'm quoting now -- "This Act does not apply when 

the claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years." 

That strikes us -- you can call it "limitations" if you 

want, but it strikes us as a very powerful one. Because 

it restricts the Government's ability to bring such a case 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- for offset. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if we call it 

"limitations," you have a much harder case, because of the 

1991 Act. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I -- with respect, I don't 

think that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but 

I will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a 

limitations period, because a limitations period is one 

that is raised as an affirmative defense and may be 

waived. This provision, where it says, "This Act does not

apply" --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- does not apply. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- can you give me a reason 

for the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10-

year bar, other than for stale claims or --

MR. WOLFMAN: Oh, I don't know that there is 

one, but my point, again, is simply that the Government 

has no authority to proceed. So, then we look -- we look 

at that statute, and we say, "What did the -- what did the 

Congress do in 1996?" What the Congress did in 1996 was 

amend that very statute by saying, "Within the confines of 

this statute, you may now offset." 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that, but I'm 

just -- I'm just saying, if you could give me an 

explanation, a characterization, a description, a 

statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale 

claims, I think you'd have a stronger case. But it seems 

to me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back and 

look for other limitations period, and I find it in 

1091(a). 

MR. WOLFMAN: You know, again, if -- it is not 

-- the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of the 

legislative materials, and we can assume that at least one

of the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation, 

the contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals 

repose, which is a purpose of time bars. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You can call it any purpose you 

want, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just 

what Justice Kennedy said. The earlier word says 

limitations don't apply to the higher-education debt. And 

so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about, 

the words of "10 years," the words that limit when you can 

do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a 

"limitation," then I guess the earlier statute says they 

don't apply to the higher-education debt. And so, I don't 

see how you get out of that. I mean -- I mean, this is a 

rather harsh result. I understand why you'd like to get 

out of it. But I don't understand how we do get out of 

it. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I think there are -- there 

are -- I -- there are several answers. And, if I might, 

first of all, if you must characterize what -- and we are 

happy to do so -- was in the 1996 Act as either a time 

bar or a limitations period, this is clearly the former, 

because this -- because the limitations periods in the law 

are ones which have to be raised by affirmative defense. 

For instance, the Rules of Civil Procedure say limitations 

periods are raised by affirmative defense, and the case

law is unanimous that they can be waived. That is not 

what this provision does. This provision restricts the 

authority, in the first instance, for the Government to 

bring the case. 

The second thing I would say, though, Your Honor 

-- and I think it does not matter, ultimately -- that can 

be our principal submission here, and it is, but it does 

not matter -- I think, ultimately, the nomenclature 

doesn't matter, because -- again, because the Act 

restricts the authority of the Government to bring a case 

that is beyond the 10-year period. And that is the 

statute that contains the express reference. That is the 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, part of the problem 

is that 1091(a)(2), the "notwithstanding" clause, talks 

also specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I 

take it. 

MR. WOLFMAN: No, I understand that, Your Honor. 

I mean --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if it had said "no" --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- I understand that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- "no limitations period," 

then I might -- this specifically talks about an offset. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that's right. The -- and I 

-- I don't think that undercuts our argument at all,

because, after all, there's no question that, prior to 

1996, there was offset authority in the Government to 

offset -- to collect debt against other types of income, 

other than Social Security. So, I don't think that 

undercuts our argument at all. 

But let me, if I might, go back to your question 

one more time, because I think there's yet a third answer, 

which is -- which is the chronological answer that -- made 

in our briefs that, in 1991, the Congress could not have 

had the intent to get at Social Security benefits at all, 

because, of course, there -- and it's -- this point is 

conceded -- the Government had no authority whatsoever to 

offset Social Security benefits. 

If I might, in the -- let me go --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I pursue that point for a 

second --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- more? I -- it seems to me 

that you would have a much stronger argument on that point 

if, in 1996, the Act provided that, suddenly, Social 

Security benefits -- some Social Security benefits would 

be -- would be subject to administrative offset, but only 

those when the Government -- imposed when the Government 

is trying to collect educational loans. We would then 

have what seems to -- would seem to me to be a really 

head-to-head conflict between the two statutes. The

trouble is that, in 1996, the extension of the 

administrative setoff authority covered Social Security 

benefits to be -- for which there would be a setoff for 

any purpose -- not just educational loans; for any 

purpose. So that, in fact, it is possible for us to read 

the 1996 Act as having an effect -- there's a 10-year 

limit, generally -- at the same time that we read the 

earlier -- I forget what the -- '91, I guess it is --

MR. WOLFMAN: The HETA law, yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- which says, with respect to 

educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's 

no limitation at all. So, we can have both statutes 

without rendering either one of them nugatory. And isn't 

that the preferred way to read statutes? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, but I -- but I -- with all 

respect, I think our interpretation certainly does not 

render HETA nugatory, because HETA would still override 

limitations periods for other forms of collection with 

respect to other types --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But with --

MR. WOLFMAN: of debts. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- with respect to Social 

Security setoffs, of course, it would. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, it -- I'm not sure I 

understand that question.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Social Security -- Social 

Security said it would be -- it would be a -- it would --

a flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read 

it, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if that's the only thing 

that the 1996 Act covered, we would say, "Boy, there is 

just an absolute conflict here. We can't have both 

statutes." But, in fact, we can have both statutes most of 

the time. We read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering 

everything except setoffs against Social Security for 

educational loans. And, with respect to the educational 

loans, we give respect to the -- to the earlier decision 

that there be no limitation at all. You just have a 

weaker argument than you would have if the 1996 Act only 

covered this case. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that may be, but let me, 

again, if I -- if I might, respond to that -- to this --

to this point, because I think it is true that the 

proportion of times under our argument that the 10-year 

bar would apply would -- is greater under our position, 

but it is, nevertheless, true that HETA still applies to 

many situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar 

applies to somewhat more. But let me -- I think there's 

another answer to your point, which is, it still does not

undercut our basic submission that the Congress could not 

have formed this specific intent. And it's very unlike 

the -- the intent being to get to the Government the --

the result it seeks here. And the reason for that is --

is, they could not have focused on this problem, because 

in -- it wasn't for another 5 years that Social Security 

was even on the radar screen at all. And this brings me 

back, I think, to Justice Breyer's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- initial question. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask this question? 

That's a very -- that's a very interesting statutory 

construction case, I must say, by the way. But the -- in 

1996, when they made the offset available against Social 

Security payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of 

limitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d) 

and said the 10-year provision is retained. And when the 

10-year provision was first put in -- I mean, when the 

exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a 

statute that had a 10-year period for everything except 

student loan recovery. And it seems to me that if you 

look at the 1996 statute as saying, "We're going to allow 

offsets against Social Security," under the same scheme 

that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the 

10-year provision to preserve it -- they preserved the 10-

year provision -- that they seem to me to be preserving it

MR. WOLFMAN: I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It isn't as though they 

enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social 

Security and, in that statute, said, "And -- but, by the 

way, there's a 10-year period of limitations here." 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Rather, they amended the 1991 

Act. 

MR. WOLFMAN: -- that is correct. And I think 

that -- but with a caveat, which I'll get to -- but -- I 

think that is correct, but it is a -- it is a consequence 

of the situation that Congress found itself in, in 1996. 

In other words, it already had a statute, the offset 

statute, which had a 10-year bar. And so --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it also had the exception 

for student loans. It's -- it was --

MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- side by side with the rest 

of the 10-year bar. 

MR. WOLFMAN: I'm not sure what you mean in that 

-- I'm not sure what you mean by the exception for student 

loans. There --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's 1091(a). 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, 1091 was in a different 

statutory provision, in a different part of the code. But 

yes, what I'm saying is, they --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it was in the 1991 

statute. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Right. It was in a 1991 statute 

that was a freestanding statute that dealt with Social 

Security benefits, generally. Then what you had in 1996 

was a focus on offsets, specifically, and on Social 

Security, specifically. And the only point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the '91 Act mentions 

offsets, specifically, as well. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That's right. And -- but it 

mentions a lot of -- many meanings of "collection," that 

is correct. And -- but I think it's not quite fair to say 

that they merely reenacted the 10-year bar. We think 

that's sufficient for us to prevail. But, you know, the 

Congress, in 1996, did a pretty comprehensive overall --

overhaul of the Debt Collection Act. It appears to have 

gone through every section. It strengthened some of the 

notice provisions. It focused specifically on Social 

Security and said that you can now offset them by making 

the express reference. And then it turned to -- what had 

been subsection (c) then became subsection (e). It

amended one of the paragraphs, but retained the paragraph 

that has the 10-year bar. So, I think it's fair to say 

that Congress looked at all the sections carefully. Now 

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you say that -- let me just 

throw this thought out, so you can comment on it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that there is a 

reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought 

that student loans should not have a 10-year bar if you're 

going to collect from Social Security, because most Social 

Security payments won't accrue until many, many years --

much more than 10 years after the student-loan default. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that -- the Government 

certainly makes that submission in its brief, but, as we 

note in our reply brief, the statistics the Government 

cites don't really back that up. I -- but we do -- we do 

acknowledge that, with respect to Social Security 

retirement benefits, there will be many people who are 

beyond the 10-year bar. With respect to people who get 

other sorts of Social Security benefits, that's not clear 

at all, actually. There are survivors --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there is a --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- and there are disability --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Retirement benefits are a 

pretty big part --

MR. WOLFMAN: But, again, I don't think that --


there's no -- there's no suggestion in -- the problem --

the ultimate problem with that point for the Government, 

Justice Stevens, is that it requires us to believe that 

Congress formed that intent in 1991, which is an 

impossibility, because --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that. 

MR. WOLFMAN: -- in 1991, Social Security 

benefits were just, sort of, off the table. They weren't 

on the radar screen at all. And that's the ultimate 

problem with the Government's --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Wolfman, are there 


provisions by regulation in the Department of Education 

for discharge of debts like this on a showing of total and

silent on that question. I don't know the answer to that. 

He was certainly disabled. I will only point out that 

the standards for total and permanent disability under the 

Department of Education regs are much more stringent than 

those for Social Security, because that only requires a 

12-month period of disability. But I don't know the 

answer as to him. 

I do want to get to one other point 

before I sit down, and -- which is to address one of the 

Government's arguments -- is that to -- to get around a --

the problem that the DCIA reenacted the 10-year bar, the 

Government relies on the "notwithstanding" clause of the 

1991 Education Act, arguing that it wipes away any time 

bar, regardless of when the time bar was enacted, and no 

matter what type of collection is at issue. But, as we 

note in our reply brief extensively, those 

"notwithstanding" clauses are not as all-powerful as the 

Government suggests they are. And what the case law --

the lower-court case law suggests is that you need to 

look, as we have done in our submission, at the 

legislative history and the legislative motive surrounding 

both Acts, the previous Act and the subsequent Act. And, 

here, what you have -- and I don't want to beat a dead 

horse, but I will repeat once again that the problem here 

is -- for the Government -- is that we have this very

powerful anti-attachment provision with its express-

reference requirement. And the only place in these 

statutory materials where the express reference occurs is 

in a -- the very Act that includes the 10-year bar. And 

to accept the Government's argument, you would have to 

accept the notion that the -- an express reference in an 

act can go beyond the authority that's granted by that 

very act. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it -- I mean, you -- it's 

-- it probably comes up a lot. You have -- you have the 

earlier act that imposes -- suppose you have some --

Endangered Species Act and -- at an earlier time -- and it 

says all provisions of a certain kind will have this 

effect in respect to endangered species. And then you 

have some laters act -- later acts. And, in those later 

acts, there are certain things about how to treat certain 

animals and so forth. And the question would be, "Well, 

does that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an 

endangered species, apply now to the animals in this later 

act insofar as they're endangered?" And the answer would 

be, "Of course it does" --

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- unless there's some special 

reason --

MR. WOLFMAN: Right.

Now we have a later act, and it has the word "10-year

materials, they have quite a burden. And let me explain

posit is one with which I can agree. We are not saying --

I don't want to be mistaken -- that -- we are not saying 

that previous legislation can't have effect on future 

events, or even future legislation. We're not saying that 

all. But the nub of our argument is this express-

reference requirement, and I think it's -- it seems very, 

very odd to us that when you have a statute that has an --

where the express reference appears, and that has a 10-

year bar on the authority --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- to collect --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Wolfman, couldn't you say 

the question could be phrased in this way? Do we view the 

notwithstanding language in 1091(a) as enacted in 1091 and 

governing the future, or do we view the 1996 amendment as, 

in effect, an amendment to that stat which -- which 

reenacted the provisions that were already there? And if

it's a reenactment in 1996, then it's just an exception 

from the 10-year bar. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Right. I think that -- that is a 

fair characterization of one our arguments here --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. WOLFMAN: -- which -- one of our arguments 

here is, given the various indicia of intent, both in '91 

and '96, that the '96 Act, with respect to a small sliver 

of collections, is effectively an amendment of the '91 

Act. However, that is not our only, or even our principal 

submission. Our principal submission has to do with the 

powerful anti-attachment --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. WOLFMAN: -- provision. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Okay? And, again, the 

Government's position -- and I will rest after this, 

because I've repeated this already -- but the -- the 

Government's position is, in effect, that you can use the 

anti-attachment position in the express-reference 

requirement in a statute to allow authority beyond that 

very statute. And we submit that that is -- that is not 

permissible under section 407. 

Unless the Court has further questions, I'll 

reserve the rest of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wolfman. 

Ms. Blatt. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

In sweeping and unqualified language, the Higher 

Education Act provides that, notwithstanding any other 

provision of law, no limitations as to time shall apply to 

the collection of student-loan debt by offset. Therefore, 

notwithstanding the general 10-year limit that applies to 

the offset of all Federal payments, including Social 

Security payments, no time limit applies. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it didn't include Social 

Security payments when it was enacted. 

MS. BLATT: That's right. In 1982, Congress 

authorized --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or 1991. Either one. 

MS. BLATT: Right. In 1982, Federal payments 

were subject to offsets such as Federal grants or 

contracts or pension. And, in 1991, Congress passed a law 

that said there's no -- going to be no time limit for the 

Government to collect student-loan debt by offset. 

Therefore, there has always been a student-loan exception 

to the Government's ability to offset for only up to 10

years. So, we can't offset Federal pension payments or 

contract payments beyond 10 years unless it's for student 

loans. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- but then, in 

-- you know, you know what's coming. You -- the provision 

you rely on is 3116, and it's stuck into the middle of 

this -- of a provision which requires written notice, 

opportunity to inspect records, and so forth. All those 

apply. But you have to say that (e) doesn't apply. 

MS. BLATT: Well, (e) is a limitations period, 

and it is a provision of law, and the Higher Education Act 

says, notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's 

no time limit for offsetting -- for collection by offset 

when it's to collect student-loan debt. What happened in 

1996 is, Congress authorized Social Security benefits as 

another source of Federal payment. But it's critical to 

understand that Congress left completely undisturbed and 

intact that pre-existing 10-year limit and the pre-

existing student-loan exception --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Wolfman tells us, Ms. 

Blatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you 

suggest, the clause in the 1991 Act, and points 

specifically to provisions that say, "no other provision 

of law enacted before, on, or after." The picture we're 

given of the 1991 Act is that up until 1991, whatever

exists up until 1991, there's no time limitation, but that 

this 1991 statute does not speak to subsequently enacted 

statutes. 

MS. BLATT: Yes, well, it is unqualified, on its 

face, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't say "notwithstanding 

any other provision of existing law." It says "any law." 

And it would be a rather bizarre and novel statute if 

Congress had to keep amending every time Congress 

redesignated a limitation provision, which is all that's 

happened here. Every time Congress had a limitation 

provision that changed from subsection (e) to (a), or was 

given a different section number, Congress would have to 

go back and say -- I guess, reenact the Higher Education 

Act every time it amended the statute of limitations. 

But, even if you think that it only applied to pre-

existing limitations period, this 10-year limit predated 

the Higher Education Act. It was passed in 1982, and had 

-- and has appeared in identical language since 1983. 

Nothing happened in 1996 to statutes of limitations. All 

that happened was that Congress, in essence, put Social 

Security benefits on par, equal footing, with all other 

Federal payments. 

And let me just say, imposing a 10-year limit 

would largely nullify Social Security offsets to collect 

student-loan debt.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The point that Justice 

Stevens made --

MS. BLATT: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- before. 

MS. BLATT: Ninety percent of all student-loan 

debtors who default do so before age 55. And, therefore, 

a 10-year time limit will have expired before the debtor 

reaches full retirement age, at age 65. And it's relevant 

not so much what Congress what was thinking in '91, but 

it's relevant for what Congress was thinking in 1996. In 

1996, Congress made Social Security benefits subject to 

offset. And it's completely rational to think that 

Congress of course understood there would be a general 10-

year limit that's always been applied to offsets of all 

Federal payments, including the Federal contract payments 

or pension payments, and now Social Security payments, 

but, yes, there's another provision of the U.S. code that 

contains an express and, we think, extraordinary 

exception. It says time limits are intolerable when it 

comes to the collection of student-loan debt. 

Now, at the same time, Social Security 

recipients are protected from any undue burden. The -- if 

you are disabled under the Department's regulations, you 

can obtain a complete discharge, a total walk-away-from-

the-debt-forever, if you have a disability that prevents

you from earning income. You also -- the amount of the 

Social Security offset is limited to the lesser of 15 

percent of the benefit payment or the amount by which the 

benefit payment exceeds $750. And any debtor can enter 

into a repayment agreement that will take their total --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are -- those are 

regulatory provisions, right? 

MS. BLATT: The caps, Mr. Chief Justice, are in 

the statute, and further limited by the regulations. But, 

actually, the repayment agreements are mandated provisions 

under the Higher Education Act. It mandates the Secretary 

of Education to allow debtors to enter in repayment 

agreements that are contingent on their income, and that 

will allow them to repay their debt under reasonable and 

affordable terms. That's also in the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, is the statute -- I saw 

something here, that a person who's going to get this 

offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of 

the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent 

of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is 

less. 

MS. BLATT: It's the lesser of -- it's the 

lesser of the 15 percent or the amount by which the 

benefit payment exceeds 750. So, in this case, when the 

original Social Security check was, I think, like, $874,

15 percent would have been a higher number. You have to 

leave the recipient with 750, so I think only $94 was 

taken out. And I may have my math a little off. But you 

-- the -- you give the recipient the benefit. 

Now, the only thing that's in the regulations, 

Mr. Chief Justice, are the disability, that that is just a 

-- it's a walkaway on the loan. Even if you win the 

lottery the next day, if you can show that you can't work 

because of a disability, the Secretary of Education will 

discharge your loan. 

Now, the principal argument on the other side is 

section 207 of the Social Security Act. Now, that statute 

requires an explicit reference before Social Security 

benefits can be subject to a legal process. But it 

doesn't require an explicit reference when the only 

question is the statute of limitations that are applicable 

to a legal process that is already otherwise expressly 

authorized. The Debt Collection Act is the actual statute 

that authorizes the offset of Social Security benefits. 

The Higher Education Act just lifts limitations periods 

when there's another statute that establishes a collection 

mechanism. And the Debt Collection Act contains the 

express reference. It provides, in 3716, that, "We're 

making our clear statement, we want Social Security 

benefits to be subject to offset." And, like I said, it

just -- it plugged the Social Security system into this 

pre-existing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is -- it is true that 

the 1996 statute, which is the first time the express 

reference appears, does contain the 10-year statute by the 

indirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the --

cite the 1091(a). 

MS. BLATT: That's right. It makes the express 

reference to 207, and it has this general limitations 

period that applies to all offsets. But, Justice Stevens, 

just --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it says -- and it says 

"offsets under this section." 

MS. BLATT: That's right. And that takes you 

down to the subsection (e), which imposes a 10-year limit. 

But just as today Congress certainly is free to say, 

"From now on, Social Security benefits and all offsets 

will be subject to an 11-year limitations period," it 

doesn't have to expressly reference 207 to amend the Debt 

Collection Act. The Debt Collection Act is what's being, 

in effect, amended or an exception. And the Debt 

Collection Act doesn't contain its own express-reference

say, "We're forever binding ourselves," or, "We want some 

different canon of interpretation here." And so, you have

a very extraordinary provision in the Higher Education Act 

that says, "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 

there's not going to be a time limit to offset in order to 

collect student loan" --

JUSTICE BREYER: But -- yeah, I think he's --

one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that --

you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had 

said the following, "Section 207 is amended, or changed, 

as follows. We refer specially now -- we can collect, 

through offset, but only for 10 years. I mean, only to 

claims that are more than 10 years old. So, we are 

changing what 207 says for debts over 10 year -- under 10 

years old, and we can offset those." Now, suppose it had 

said that. 

MS. BLATT: It would still -- the express 

reference would be completely overtaken, because it says 

the "notwithstanding section 207." It would authorize 

offset for --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you'd say it's the same. 

MS. BLATT: For up to 10 years. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's the same, 

let's imagine this statute. The statute says, "We bestow 

upon the Social Security agency a very limited power." 

And it says, "This is the limited power. The Social 

Security Agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under-

10-year-old debts." That's what they say, right in the 

Act. 

MS. BLATT: Right. It would -- the --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then, indeed, the whole 

point of it -- it's entitled "Limited Offset Ability," 

parenthesis -- "Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only to 

Debts of Less than Ten Years)," end parenthesis. That's 

the title of the Act, and then it says just what I say, 

repeating that. 

MS. BLATT: Yes. Well, our position is that the 

Social Security Act only requires an express reference to 

create authorization to offset. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But you're not going to treat 

that --

MS. BLATT: And --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- one the same. You see, what 

they're saying here is -- they want to say that what I've 

just said is what Congress wrote in this Act. And --

MS. BLATT: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm making it harder and 

harder for you to accept that saying --

MS. BLATT: Yes. Well, our --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- automatically. 

MS. BLATT: -- fundamental position --

-- I'll be clear on this -- is that

the Higher Education Act applies unless it's been 

repealed. And there's just nothing in the Higher 

Education Act that comes close to repealing -- in, excuse 

me, the Debt Collection Act -- that comes close to 

repealing the Higher Education Act, because it doesn't 

address the subject of student loans. It just speaks to 

the ability to offset Social Security benefits, as well as 

all other Federal payments that have been subject to 

offset. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, can I ask --

there's no discussion -- legislative history in the briefs 

that I -- because I -- that I recall. Is it true that the 

people voting on the bill in 1996 had nothing but the 

amendment before them? Did they have a committee report 

on it explaining that it still applied to the -- that the 

-- that the "notwithstanding" clause in 1091(a) would 

still be in effect? 

MS. BLATT: No, I know of no statement to that 

effect. But I know of no statement -- any discussion 

about limitations period. There's no discussion of the 

10-year limit either. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because it seems to me that, 

conceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by 

itself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the 

code, might well think, "Well, this includes a 10-year

limit." 

MS. BLATT: Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. 

Maybe the knew that a court would actually apply the U.S. 

code, as written --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MS. BLATT: -- and just because it -- the 

limitation period was in one section -- but, now, here's 

where I think the policy does come into play. A 

legislature would think that a 10-year limit would never 

come in to offset Social Security benefits on student 

loan, except in a rare case of an old debtor who -- and 

also defaults close in time to age 65. And, like I said, 

90 percent of all the student-loan defaults are by debtors 

who are under age 55, and over -- about 83 or 84 percent 

of all Social Security payments are under the retirement 

system, not the disability system. And if a person is 

disabled, there's no reason to think that they can't get a 

discharge of that loan. 

So, all we're talking about is basically 

rendering a dead letter Social Security offsets to collect 

student-loan debt, if Petitioner's position were to 

prevail. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can he get a discharge if 

he's disabled? 

MS. BLATT: You can get a discharge of your loan

if you have a disability of indefinite duration that 

prevents you from working. The rationale is, sort of, a 

changed-circumstances rationale. If you took out a loan, 

you signed a promissory note, you intend to pay it back. 

But if you later become disabled, and that disability is 

going to prevent you from ever working, they'll discharge 

it. Now, about 30 percent of all people who do apply for 

this disability discharge do get it, and about 80 percent 

get a conditional discharge, what gives them -- it gives 

them a 3-year grace period. And the only difference 

between -- I mean, there are some small differences, but 

the main difference between a Social Security disability 

determination and an Education Department disability 

determination is the Department of Education wants you to 

be disabled of an indefinite duration, and not just 12 

months, because it's a complete and total walkaway from 

the loan. And Social Security will actually do a lookback 

after 12 months. But Education will never go back and ask 

for the money. Once they've discharged it, it's a 

permanent discharge. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, it -- was this 

statute -- I'm just really kind of curious that something 

this important, we're first putting this burden on Social 

Security -- it's a fairly important change. Was this part 

of one of these omnibus bills that covered 99 different

subjects at once? 

MS. BLATT: Yes. I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That --

MS. BLATT: -- I remember trying to find it on 

Westlaw. It's, like, 3,000 pages. It's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MS. BLATT: -- huge. And it covers many, many 

different subjects. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And they did not have a 

separate committee proceeding on each separate part of 

that monster bill --

MS. BLATT: That --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as I remember. 

MS. BLATT: That, I don't recall. But I can say 

the overall thrust -- and it's in their statement of 

purpose -- was to improve the Government's debt-collection 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MS. BLATT: -- efforts. And what it did was, 

for the first time -- and this was a very significant 

development -- establish a centralized offset. Before 

1996, there was no ability to cross-check a debt from one 

agency to a payment to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MS. BLATT: -- another agency, such that one

Department had no idea what another Department was doing. 

And now it is a massive program involving over $1 

trillion of Federal payables, $255 billion of certified 

debt, and 33 billion of that is education loan debt. And 

so, that -- this was to -- an enormous undertaking to 

start that, in 1996. And one of the things that Congress 

did in setting up this massive program was, made Social 

Security benefits part of the offset program. There's 

about $480 or $490 billion in Social Security benefits, 

so -- which -- it was a huge source of revenue, although 

Congress obviously limited it substantially with the caveat. 

And if there are no further questions, we would 

ask that the Court of Appeals judgment be affirmed. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt. 

Mr. Wolfman, you have three and a half minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. WOLFMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I want to address, first, a point that the 

Government makes, that -- and it's about Section 207 of 

the Social Security Act, the anti-attachment provision. 

Opposing counsel says that it doesn't really matter that 

the 10-year bar was not addressed in 1996, because all 

that's necessary under the express-reference provision is

to refer to the law, in general, that it doesn't apply to 

limitations periods. But that simply cannot be the case 

here, because, again, this statute that we are talking 

about, the Debt Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt 

Collection Act before, is a bar on the authority of the 

Government to collect after 10 years. 

And let me pick up on the language that Justice 

Kennedy pointed to from the Debt Collection Act. It says, 

in the very subsection in which Social Security first was 

put on the radar screen, was first dealt with, 

(c)(3)(a)(i) -- it says that you can now go after Social 

Security benefits, because they are subject to offset 

under this section, meaning 3716. Then, if you turn to 

another subsection of that section, it says -- and this is 

the 10-year bar -- this section, quote, "does not apply," 

end quote, to a claim under this subchapter that has been 

outstanding for more than 10 years. 

Now, I don't see any reason to say that 207, the 

requirement of an express reference, is, sort of, a 

halfway requirement. In other words, "You only have to 

refer to Social Security benefits. We don't care what the 

extent of that authority is in the very section that you 

use that express reference." Here, the entire authority 

is circumscribed by the 10-year bar. That is our 

essential submission.

 I have one other point, which is that the --

because there was a number of questions on it. We think 

it doesn't go to the congressional intent here, but I do 

want to clarify. There is a substantial difference 

between being disabled and being eligible to get the 

discharge. Discharge requires permanent disability --

forever, you cannot -- you are not capable of working. In 

Social Security law, you have to be incapable of working 

for a period of 12 months. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

[Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
