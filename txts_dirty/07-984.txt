 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENTS,

 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The expert agencies charged by Congress with 

implementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the 

discharge of fill material, like the mine tailings at 

issue in this case, should be permitted by the Army 

Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are 

not -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines 

applicable to permits issued by the EPA under section 

402 of the Act.

 That interpretation is grounded on more than 

three decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the 

collective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of 

Engineers and the EPA in administering the Act.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the discharge comes 

from a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or 

can it ever be both fill and --

GENERAL GARRE: Justice Kennedy, it's always 

one or the other. The Clean Water Act establishes two 

permitting regimes. And I think this is actually 

something where the parties agree. Either it's going to 

be permitted under section 402 of the Act, which covers 

pollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged 

material, or fill material, which is covered by section 

404 of the Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a legal 

answer to Justice Kennedy's question. What is the 

physical answer? Can a pipe both emit sludge, fill, and 

effluent?

 GENERAL GARRE: As a practical matter, for 

example, if you take the slurry in this case, which is 

55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid 

coming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under the 

definition that the agencies administer of fill 

material, this is fill material under that definition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fill material trumps 

effluent, in other words?

 GENERAL GARRE: Fill material trumps 

effluent. That's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it does -- here's the 

problem that I am having and I think others may have. 

We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand 

it, of a pollutant that includes suspended solids. 

Number two, there is an existing regulation to the 

effect that wastewater from this particular method of 

extracting gold shall simply not be released, shall not 

be put into a water body. And then the two agencies 

come along and in effect they say by regulation, if the 

suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the 

wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going 

to call it "fill" and leave it entirely to the Army 

Engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto.

 And on the face of it, it sounds as though 

they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant 

of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number 

two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up 

with a contradictory determination about what should be 

done with it.

 And it sounds as though, under the 

Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory 

and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint 

regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat 

contradiction, and query whether that can be anything 

other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Will

you address that?

 GENERAL GARRE: Sure, Justice Souter. First 

of all, I those concerns really go to the definition of 

"fill material," and I don't think that the Respondent 

SEACC has squarely challenged that definition in this 

case. And I would point you to two parts of the record.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume -- and I 

don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done 

-- I am at least raising it because I find it very 

difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing 

with that problem. So you may say, well, they didn't 

raise it well enough, but I still want you to deal with 

it on the merits.

 GENERAL GARRE: Sure. And let me just point 

to the two parts of the record: The JA at 541 note 12, 

where the Ninth Circuit acknowledged they didn't 

challenge it; and also I would point you to the 

complaint, where the complaint is directed to the 

permits and does not seek a determination that the Fill 

Rule definition is arbitrary and capricious.

 We think that that definition reflects the 

settled understanding and expertise of both agencies, 

the Army Corps of Engineers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it be settled, 

because isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary

purpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit 

applied?

 GENERAL GARRE: That is correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. By "settled," I mean it was settled 

in 2002. They adopted this rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not in 30 years' 

experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was 

under 402 until 2002.

 GENERAL GARRE: I think the EPA has always 

adopted and applied an effects test for determining 

whether or not a discharge is fill material --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in fact, was there 

ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose 

was disposal of waste? Was there ever a 404 permit, 

rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call 

"processed wastewater" or "wastewater"?

 GENERAL GARRE: There was a period, of 

course, Justice Ginsburg -- you are right -- where the 

Army Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test. 

During that period -- you are right -- 404 permits were 

not -- were not issued for the discharge of things where 

the purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose 

of material.

 Now, during that period, though, those 

discharges were not regulated under section 402 of the

Act and under Section 306, the effluent guidelines, but 

for a different reason. The reason why that they 

weren't regulated under 402 during that period is 

because of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception, 

which is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies 

excepted from the definition of the "waters of the 

United States" discharges into an impoundment area.

 And what you have going on here is the 

discharge of fill material into an impoundment area, 

which is dammed off with a 50-foot dam. Those 

discharges, in this case, are governed by section 404 of 

the Act. But any discharges from that impoundment area 

into downstream waters of the United States are subject 

to section 402 of the Act -- there's a separate permit 

in this case -- and are subject to the effluent 

guidelines and the new source performance standards.

 So you have those two. The agencies have 

come together. They've reconciled the statutory 

regimes, and they have the 404 permit of dredged 

material, material that's going to fill the bottom of 

the lake, raise it by 50 feet, governed by section 404 

of the Act. That impoundment area then is sealed off, 

and any discharged material out of that impoundment area 

into waters of the United States is going to be governed 

by 402 and the separate effluent guidelines there. That

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's pretty cold comfort 

when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake. I 

suppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're 

doing here, then the lake in the middle of the 

Everglades is an impoundment area, or a Great Salt Lake 

is an impoundment area.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, any -- we're talking 

about --

JUSTICE SOUTER: This is a long way from a 

settling pond.

 GENERAL GARRE: Well, let me address that in 

two different ways: First of all, at the end of this 

project, when the lake is going to be reclaimed, the 

agencies determined that it's going to be 

environmentally as sound, if not superior, for the 

habitats in Alaska, fish and wildlife. So at the end of 

the project, it is going to be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what's that --

what's that got to do with the definition of 

"impoundment area"? My problem is that you are 

treating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area 

a whole natural lake as distinct from a settling basin.

 GENERAL GARRE: The statute refers to 

specified disposal sites and what you have here, you are

right, is a lake. But it's impounded by a 50-foot dam. 

The other part I wanted to point to is the section 404 

guidelines are rigorous environmental guidelines that 

address a number of different concerns, including the 

quality of the water, the fish and wildlife habitat, and 

at the end of that process you have got the EPA, which 

has the right to exercise a veto over --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You keep saying they are 

rigorous. My understanding is -- and I didn't think it 

was seriously disputed here -- is that during the period 

in which the deposits are going to be made, the natural 

life of this water body is going to be destroyed.

 GENERAL GARRE: That's true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the Corps comes along 

and says, oh, when it's all over, it will come back. 

But when you're destroying the entire living sort of 

corpus of this lake, it seems to me that it's getting 

more lenient to say that there are rigorous 

environmental standards.

 GENERAL GARRE: That's true, Justice Souter, 

but it's important to keep in mind that the reason why 

the lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to 

survive is because of the fill effect of the material, 

not because of any toxics put into the water.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but as I understand it,

and you correct me if I am wrong here, I thought 

"suspended solids," I guess is the buzz word for it, is 

a form of pollution.  So you're saying, well, we're 

destroying the fish with one form of pollution rather 

than another form of pollution. And I don't know that 

that advances the ball for your side.

 GENERAL GARRE: Any time you have fill 

material going into the waters of the United States --

of course, section 404 doesn't apply until you've got 

fill material going into the waters of the United 

States.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but this comes back to 

my initial question. You are simply, or the Corps is 

simply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant, 

suspended solids discharged into the water, by calling 

it fill material. And it -- in effect it's defining one 

subject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the 

law of the United States by redefining it and saying, 

oh, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine.

 GENERAL GARRE: I think what the agencies 

have done to reconcile their definitions is to apply 

this effects test. Now, if Coeur Alaska sought to fill 

the entire lake --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But to apply the effects 

test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form

of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form 

of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers 

definition of "fill."

 GENERAL GARRE: I don't think that's 

correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that correct?

 GENERAL GARRE: The legal effect is to 

regulate that pollution under section 404.

 JUSTICE ALITO: General Garre, I don't want 

to take up your rebuttal time, but what's the 

environmental alternative to what was done here?

 GENERAL GARRE: The primary environmental 

alternative considered was a dry tailings alternative. 

And that would be been problematic in two different 

ways. One, it would have required the destruction of 

some 100 acres of wetlands; and two, it would have 

resulted in enormous stacks of tailings, 100 to 200 

high, thousands of feet wide, that would actually dwarf 

the Pentagon and be visible from nearby Berners Bay.

 Now, the Army Corps of Engineers, the State 

of Alaska, and the Forest Service determined that the 

wet tailings option, putting the tailings into a lake, 

and reclaiming that lake so that it would be 

environmentally superior, was the preferable option.

 I do want to emphasize that if this Court

has any doubt about the statutory text the regulatory 

decisions here go back more than 30 years. In 1973 the 

EPA adopted a rule that said that the discharge of fill 

material is not regulated under the section 402 

permitting system. In 2002, in the preamble to the fill 

rule, the agency made clear again EPA has never 

regulated the discharge of fill material under the 

effluent guidelines.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Weren't they then 

thinking of fill material as material that was used 

either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction 

project? I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a 

fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place 

for a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily 

thinks of as a filling operation.

 GENERAL GARRE: Not the Environmental 

Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency 

since the passage of the Clean Water Act has taken the 

position that discharge that has the effect of changing 

the bottom elevation of a water is going to be fill. 

And that makes sense as a practical matter. The 

agencies with 30 years of experience determined that the 

purpose definition that the Corps had adopted for a 

period was unworkable, unpredictable and didn't make 

sense. And I think that if there's any judgment that

the courts ought to defer to here, it's the judgment of 

the agencies based on their collective experience as to 

the proper definition of "fill material."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one question that 

Justice Souter raised and before you sit down I would 

like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any 

water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers 

decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place, 

can any waterway be a settling pond? That is, here we 

have a lake. And is it just up to the Corps of 

Engineers? They say this is a settling pond, it's a 

settling pond?

 GENERAL GARRE: I think as a practical 

matter if you put discharge into a river and it may not 

change the bottom elevation, that wouldn't be fill 

material. But, Justice Ginsburg, there have been a 

number of hypotheticals raised by Respondents here. Let 

me address those. The section 404 process is a rigorous 

environmental process, the EPA does have veto authority. 

We haven't seen these problems at all in the six years 

that the fill definition has been in place and I think 

it's simply untenable to suggest that these standards, 

which in section 4 require water quality determinations, 

wildlife, aquatic determination, would result in the 

sort of environmental harm that Respondents have

hypothesized, and the prospect of that harm is no basis 

for this Court to override the statutory scheme that 

Congress created with two distinct permitting regimes, 

one for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to 

override the agency's pronouncements, interpretations 

for more than 30 years.

 And the other agency document I wanted to 

point to is very important. It's the 2004 mine tailings 

memorandum, which is contained at JA-141 to 146. In 

that memorandum, which is a 2004 memo by the heads of 

the EPA water divisions, they explain the application of 

the statutory and the regulatory scheme to these types 

of discharges, discharges that fill material into the 

impoundment is going to be subject to 404 and the 

rigorous process there. Any discharges out of that 

impoundment area is going to be subject to the rigorous 

requirements of 402 and that agency interpretation is 

entitled to deference.

Clean Water Act itself, Congress created two distinct, 

mutually exclusive but complementary permitting regimes. 

One is fill material, which is governed by, administered 

by the Corps of Engineers. The other is "other, except 

as permitted under section 404," administered by the 

EPA.

 A discharge, in answer to your question, 

Justice Kennedy, may be governed by one program or the 

other, not both. Everybody admits that, including the 

Respondents.

 The fill rule --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't the EPA have a 

veto power over the fill material permit?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it does, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So they're not totally 

mutually exclusive.

 MR. OLSON: It's mutually exclusive in terms 

of the issuing agency, and I think that's a very 

important point. We want to emphasize that, that the 

rules pursuant to which the Corps of Engineers 

administers the fill permit are the 404(b)(1) rules 

which Congress specified to be enacted by the EPA. So 

the rigorous rules governing the quality of the water 

that's going to be affected by these fill permits are 

established by the EPA.

Furthermore, the State is involved, the 

fisheries departments are involved, the conservation 

area of the State of Alaska. Many different agencies 

are involved in this permitting process. The permits in 

this case followed 900 studies, the expenditure of $26 

million, an evaluation by the EPA, the Corps of 

Engineers, the department of conservation of Alaska, 

and, Justice Stevens' point, finally before the permit 

could be issued it had to go to the EPA and the EPA had 

the power to veto the permit.

 Now, Congress determined --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they veto it 

due to its failure to comply with effluent limitations?

 MR. OLSON: No, they could not do that, 

Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, because the --

Congress made a choice under sections 404 and 402. 

Section 402, the EPA program, is governed by those 

effluent limitations under 301 and 306 and standards of 

performance.

 Congress made a choice of applying section 

307, which are toxic effluent limitations that apply to 

the 404 permits. That 307 regime which Congress

this, the permitting process, which Congress made the 

decision to put into two baskets: Either it's fill 

material or it's except permits under --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if the 

agencies disagree as to whether it's fill? If 404 says 

it's fill, EPA says it isn't, can the EPA then veto it 

on that ground?

 MR. OLSON: The -- the -- yes. I -- I think 

the answer to that is yes. But the better answer to 

that, Justice Kennedy, is for a while, as -- as General 

Garre pointed out, the EPA had a different concept of 

what was fill than the Corps of Engineers. The EPA 

right from the beginning said it would be the effect on 

the -- on the water.

 The Corps for a while had that definition. 

Then it used a purpose test. Both agencies, the EPA and 

the Army Corps of Engineers, agreed in 2002 that that 

"purpose" definition of the word "fill" was not 

workable. It was too subjective.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there are still going 

to be cases, I would assume very close cases, even under 

the present standard, where there could be disagreement.

 MR. OLSON: Well, there could be 

disagreement, but I was just about to say that this rule

was jointly adopted by the Corps of Engineers and the 

EPA in 2002. To the extent there is any ambiguity as to 

what fill material is, both the Army Corps of Engineers 

and the EPA agree that it includes slurry from mines. 

So that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The definition that was 

adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition. 

That was the effect. And it was the Corps that had the 

purpose test. And yet, until 2002, if I understand 

correctly, if the only reason of raising the elevation 

of the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a 

404 permit. That was not a 404 situation until 2002.

 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's -- except in 

the early stage, as I understand it, the Corps and --

the Corps also used the "effects" test. Then there was 

a period of time when it used a "purpose" test. The EPA 

consistently used the -- the "effects" test. In --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in an application 

that never included filling a lake, raising the 

elevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing 

of waste.

 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's -- until that 

point, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But the two 

agencies that were involved in this process determined 

that that was not a workable test. It didn't function

well. It allowed too much evasion and -- and 

manipulation, and they both came together after long 

studies and decided a reasonable interpretation that was 

effective, consistent, and workable.

 Under the Clean Water Act, both agencies 

came together and decided that the definition included 

the placement of overburden, slurry, tailings, or 

similar mining-related materials.

 Now, to the extent there is any ambiguity in 

the statute, this is the reasoned judgment, notice-and-

comment rulemaking by the two agencies given 

responsibility.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I perhaps am missing 

this. I -- this is in general what I don't understand, 

how this works. My understanding is that under 404 

something is "fill" -- they have a definition. And it's 

"fill," among other things, if it changes the bottom 

level of any portion of water in the United States. Is 

that right?

 MR. OLSON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And somewhere I have the 

idea -- but I can't find it in the briefs now -- that it 

has to raise the bottom level by 55 feet.

 MR. OLSON: No, I don't -- that does not --

 MR. OLSON: I don't know where you got that. 

That is the result in this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the result of this 

case. But, anyway, it raises the level. I guess it has 

to raise it some significant amount. All right. So 

what happens in this situation?

 Let us think of the worst pollutant you can 

think of. Think of that. I don't know what it is. 

Maybe it's saturated fat in potato chips, something 

absolutely terrible.

 MR. OLSON: Cholesterol.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. We are going to 

think of that pollutant. And now let's suppose that 

with the agreement of the Army Corps of Engineers a 

company takes this pollutant, which is the worst one you 

could think of, that the EPA would never let you go 

within 50 feet of it, and they take it, and they fill a 

lake with it up to the level of 55 feet, or 20 feet, or 

whatever number of feet.

 I mean, it just can't be that simply because 

they poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of 

the lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any 

more. Now, that -- that -- since that's so 

counterintuitive, that all you have to do is take a

terrible pollutant and fill the bottom of the lake with 

it and now it's up to the Army Corps of Engineers and 

not up to the EPA -- that's so counterintuitive that I 

assume I don't understand the statute, and you will 

explain it to me.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, I will, Justice Breyer. If 

it's fill, the administrating, permitting agency is the 

Army Corps of Engineers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.

 MR. OLSON: But in granting that permit, in 

evaluating that permit, they must follow the 404(b)(1) 

guidelines that were drafted and written by the EPA. So 

that -- and EPA has all sorts of provisions. It can't 

have an adverse effect on the water. There cannot be a 

preferable environmental alternative. It must go 

through the Marine Fisheries. It cannot contain that 

toxic material that you are talking about, that worst 

material in the world.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it can contain it so 

long as it is -- as it -- as it is not transitory.

 MR. OLSON: No --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, isn't it arguable 

that the best place for -- for really toxic stuff is at 

the bottom of a lake so long as it stays there and is 

not carried --

MR. OLSON: That -- that may be, but the 

Rule 404(b)(1) guidelines address both that point, and I 

understand your point, too. But in -- on 11(a) of the 

Government's brief the -- the 404(b)(1) guidelines are 

set forth, and it includes a provision, number 2 on that 

page, "violates any applicable toxic effluent standard 

or prohibition under section 307 of the Act." So the 

water quality is going to be regulated according to EPA 

standards.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is identical. So it 

doesn't make any difference.

 MR. OLSON: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I heard you say before 

that it was not identical. That -- I mean if, of 

course, EPA takes all its regs and applies those regs 

when the Army Corps of Engineers considers a permit 

under 404 so that you couldn't get an Army Corps of 

Engineers permit unless you complied with the 402 

etcetera regs, then this all could come to nothing.

me just say "pollutant" includes sand and rock. And 

what's being put in this settling area, this lake, is 

the sand, which is the same consistency of the bottom of 

the lake. It's inert material. It does not changing 

the chemical composition. It is not hurting the water 

quality of the lake.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's going to kill 

every living creature in the lake, right?

 MR. OLSON: Putting sand or rocks --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Wait a minute. It is going 

to kill everything in the lake.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it is, Justice Souter. 

Putting sand in the bottom of the lake is going to do 

that. They are going to reintroduce the fish. It will 

be a bigger lake with a better aquatic system when it's 

finished. But, yes, you are correct, in the interim the 

sand at the bottom of the lake will kill those fish.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how do we know that 

life will ever be restored? I mean, that's a guess. 

Nobody knows.

the permit, and every agency which examined this, 

including the Fisheries Department, the -- the 

conservation agencies of the State of Alaska -- and

in a bigger lake and more livable living conditions for

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS S. WALDO

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. WALDO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In section 306(e), Congress enacted an 

unqualified prohibition against operating any new source 

in violation of any standard of performance applicable 

to the source. The standard of performance at issue in 

this case is applicable on its face to the formula at 

the Kensington mine. It says there shall be no 

discharge of processed wastewater into navigable waters 

from mills that use the froth-flotation process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the 

provision that authorizes permits begins by saying 

"Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344," and 1344 

is 404. So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime 

completely out of what you were just talking about?

MR. WALDO: Because that's only a statement 

about whether section 402 applies. It means that if you 

have a section 404 permit, you don't also need a section 

402 permit. It doesn't say anything about whether a 404 

permit is appropriate under any particular 

circumstances, and it doesn't say anything about whether 

section 306 is applicable. In fact --

JUSTICE ALITO: The standard has to be --

the standard has to be applicable and this is an EPA 

regulation, isn't it?

 MR. WALDO: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the EPA has said this 

isn't applicable to this situation.

 MR. WALDO: But that determination was based 

on a misinterpretation of the Clean Water Act. That 

prefatory clause that the Chief Justice was asking about 

doesn't say anything about whether section 306 applies. 

306 does not have a prefatory clause like that, which 

strongly suggests that it's not intended to apply there. 

In other --

JUSTICE ALITO: So your position requires us 

to determine that EPA's interpretation of those, the 

statutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and 

402, is contrary to the statute?

 MR. WALDO: That the interpretation as it's

presented in this case is contrary to the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If EPA were to amend the 

performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the 

situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be 

a valid regulation?

 MR. WALDO: Well, I doubt that EPA could --

could lawfully under the Clean Water Act enact such a 

thing, because the Clean Water Act requires EPA to 

regulate suspended solids and EPA has always regulated 

suspended solids through effluent limitations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could the -- could the EPA 

allow a point source to discharge sand slurry -- there's 

nothing in it but sand -- into a river? Wouldn't you 

have to -- wouldn't you need some permission from the 

EPA to do that? Wouldn't that violate the Act?

 MR. WALDO: If it -- I'm sorry, so it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I want to discharge. I 

have a pipe and there is sand on my land which is being 

washed away. I'm discharging all that sand into a 

river.

 MR. WALDO: Yes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that violate --

MR. WALDO: That's a discharge of a 

pollutant, that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Discharge of a pollutant.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if I do the same thing 

in a lake, because I want to fill the lake, of what 

possible application is the fill standard unless it 

permits what would otherwise be prohibited under --

under the earlier sections?

 MR. WALDO: Well, the Corps of Engineers has 

the authority under section 404 to grant fill material 

permits --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it violates 

effluent standards.

 MR. WALDO: No, not when it violates 

effluent standards.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say that 

if you discharge sand into -- into a river it violates 

effluent standards.

 MR. WALDO: Oh, that doesn't -- oh, I'm 

sorry. I didn't understand that part of your question. 

Yes, if -- if there is an effluent limitation for a 

particular source -- remember, effluent limitations are 

adopted for industrial sources, so you would have to 

look at what the source of that discharge was.

 And if EPA had identified that source, a 

particular kind of factory of some kind, a mill, you 

know, a leather tanning facility or something like that,

if EPA had adopted effluent limitations that were 

applicable to that source, then discharges have to 

comply with those effluent limitations.

 It's important to realize here that the 

Clean Water Act, contrary to the way the Petitioners try 

to present it, is not just one big permitting statute. 

It's not simply 402 and 404 and that determines 

everything. The effluent limitations under sections 301 

and 306 have independent applicability directly to 

discharges. They are separately enforceable by EPA and 

through citizens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The discharges we 

are talking about have to be discharges of effluent, 

right?

 MR. WALDO: Something that is governed by an 

effluent limitation, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My question is, does 

it apply to solids?

 MR. WALDO: Absolutely. EPA is required in 

the Clean Water Act to regulate suspended solids through 

effluent limitations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, I 

mean, does suspended solids mean there is some liquid 

involved?

 MR. WALDO: That implies some liquid, right;

that -- that the solids are present in the liquid, like 

the discharge here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Like the discharge 

here. Now, I think Mr. Olson said these are 55 percent 

solid by volume.

 MR. WALDO: By weight. By volume it is 30 

percent solids.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a point at 

which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than 

a suspended solid? I mean, 90 percent by weight or by 

volume, whichever it is, solid?

 MR. WALDO: Well, the standard in this case 

prohibits a discharge of processed wastewater.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. WALDO: And so, it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't think 

something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?

 MR. WALDO: There might be some point at 

which the liquid content of a solid waste is so small 

that EPA wouldn't regard it as processed wastewater 

anymore. But that's not the case here. In this case, 

there is no dispute that the discharge is processed 

wastewater. The government has conceded that point.

 And -- and it's extremely important, because 

EPA is required to, as I said, regulate suspended solids

through effluent limitations and to adopt a zero --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they were just 

putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water, 

concrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would 

be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill 

provisions that would govern that?

 MR. WALDO: As long as there is no effluent 

limitation governing it, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, if they chop 

up the concrete and put a little water in so that it's 

easier to move, then all of a sudden it comes under 402 

and the EPA's jurisdiction?

 MR. WALDO: It depends on if EPA has adopted 

an effluent limitation for it. So if that waste stream 

that you are describing comes from some kind of factory, 

concrete -- for example, cement manufacturing is a 

source category that EPA --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I'm just 

curious how that makes any sense, since we are talking 

about putting something into water. I mean, does it 

really matter whether you add the water before it goes 

into the lake or just the lake adds the water when you 

put in the solid?

your friends on the other side would argue, I assume, 

that it's properly regarded as fill material, because 

that is the effect of it, rather than as effluent 

subject to 402.

 MR. WALDO: EPA has always regulated 

industrial sources that -- whose raw processed 

wastewater contains high levels of suspended solids, 

high enough that it would have the effect of fill 

material and can be considered fill. In fact -- and, in 

fact, EPA has always had a definition of fill material 

that was based on the effects.

 So for more than 30 years, EPA has been 

regulating sources like ore processing mills, cement 

manufacturing plants, aluminum smelters, coal-fired 

power plants, all of which and many more require the use 

of settling ponds to remove the solids.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do we decide -- we 

decide this case on the assumption that this is fill? 

Do you agree that this is fill?

 MR. WALDO: It's both. It's fill material 

and it's processed wastewater that is subject to an 

effluent limitation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then the question 

that we've put earlier is whether or not a single pipe 

contained both, and you say that it can contain both.

MR. WALDO: Well, it's -- it's one slurry. 

It meets both definitions. The solids are part of the 

processed wastewater.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's one -- visibly, it's 

one stream, but you say it consists of two things.

 MR. WALDO: Well, it is -- it is a slurry 

that contains water, chemicals --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it both slurry -- is it 

both fill and non-fill?

 MR. WALDO: It's -- it's fill and it's 

processed wastewater.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's both -- do you 

agree that there can be only one permit; there can't be 

a 402 and a 404 permit?

 MR. WALDO: No. In this case there can't be 

any permit because there is a new source performance 

standard that prohibits --

JUSTICE ALITO: All right. So, let's change 

that. What if the -- what if the new source performance 

standard was not a total prohibition? What if there was 

an effluent limitation in there, so that a permit could 

be issued, provided that there was compliance with the 

effluent limitation? Now, who issues the permit? And I 

repeat, I understand it's your position that there can't 

be both a 402 and a 404 permit.

MR. WALDO: If there is an effluent 

limitation applicable, it will end up having to be EPA 

that issues the permit, and that's -- that's simply 

because the Corps of Engineers just doesn't have the 

tools available to apply effluent limitations in its 404 

permits, except for toxic substances.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you find that in 

the statute?

 MR. WALDO: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where there's a situation 

where possibly there could be a 402 and a 404 permit, 

the 402 permit trumps the 404 permit?

 MR. WALDO: Well, it's just that -- where we 

find that is in section 306(e), which says -- which is a 

prohibition against offering -- operating sources in 

violation of performance standards. And here --

JUSTICE ALITO: This wouldn't be an 

operation in violation of a performance standard. There 

would be a performance standard.

 MR. WALDO: The performance standard that 

says --

JUSTICE ALITO: That can be put into a 402 

permit.

 MR. WALDO: Oh, I see what you are saying. 

Yeah. Well, even -- the -- what the problem is is that

section 404 doesn't make any provision for application 

of effluent limitations and performance standards under 

sections 301 and 306.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And 402 doesn't make any 

application for -- for the 404 regulations.

 MR. WALDO: Yeah, that's correct. But it 

does provide the tool for EPA to apply those effluent 

limitations that you were asking about. The effluent 

limitations have to be complied with, and EPA is the 

agency under section --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where does it make the --

where does it make provision for application of the 

standards that should apply to fill under 404?

 MR. WALDO: Well, those standards apply if 

you have fill material that is not subject to some 

effluent limitation. Effluent limitations are only 

adopted for industrial sources --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where does the statute say 

that?

 MR. WALDO: Where does it say -- I'm sorry. 

Could you clarify the question?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Where does it say that? You 

say that there can't be two permits and you say 402 

trumps 404. And I'm asking where in the statute does it 

say that?

MR. WALDO: It is an absence of a provision 

in 404, but -- but the thing is, even if 404 has -- even 

if the Corps of Engineers -- and I should say, we agree 

with the Government and with the agencies about this. 

The agencies have never interpreted section 404 to 

provide for the application of effluent limitations in 

404 permits. The 404(b) guidelines don't provide for 

it; it's not provided in the statute. And so, they just 

don't have the ability to do it.

 The problem is, they try to carry that a 

step farther and take that absence of provision to say 

that it's an exception from effluent limitations, to say 

that they don't have to comply with section 301 and 306, 

but it doesn't say that; and that's an implied 

exception, and the Court should only find an implied 

exception if it's necessary to avoid absurd results.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you go --

MR. WALDO: No one --

JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. Could you go 

back for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson? I'm 

thinking of it in very simplified terms. The simplified 

terms is, I think of a pipe and I think of a 

circumstance where some terrible pollutant comes out of 

the pipe that would be subject to 306; and if the pipe 

goes up in a river or a lake, a regular lake, it could

fill up the bottom. Seems possible.

 MR. WALDO: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if it fills 

up the bottom, it's called fill and comes under 404.

 MR. WALDO: It doesn't even have to fill it 

up very much --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know, I know that. 

I see the point.  But I mean, it seems to me if it fills 

up to the bottom to whatever point, it's fill, and now 

it's the Army Corps of Engineers. If it has effluent in 

it, it's effluent and so now it's under EPA. In other 

words, you have both.

 MR. WALDO: That's the situation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's only been going on for 

40 years. I'm sure this isn't the first time they've 

had both.

 MR. WALDO: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I don't 

understand. What I would think of is if you have two 

sets of standards and it's both, they should satisfy 

both. I'm not writing these statutes.

 MR. WALDO: Well, let me -- I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I heard from -- and I 

might interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said 

this, but the way I heard it was: Well, don't worry,

because if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of 

Engineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard 

anyway. And now you are sort of saying: Well, or they 

are going to apply some standard. And then there was a 

question of well, what standard, and we got a little 

vague there.

 Now, what happens if it goes to the EPA as 

effluent? Justice Alito's question is, well, do they 

apply the fill standard? And between my response to 

these two answers, I still don't understand how it 

works. It's -- help me.

 MR. WALDO: The Corps of Engineers only 

applies toxic effluent limitations. There are other 

pollutants that are nontoxic --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now, if you lose 

this case, what we are going to have is all the fish are 

going to be killed by some horrible pollutant, and the 

-- the Army Corps of Engineers can't do anything about 

it, and the only reason is we put enough of the 

pollutant in there to fill it up to ten feet from the 

bottom. And then if you did it the other way, if the 

EPA regulated it, it might do something terrible under 

404, and they couldn't do anything about it.

 Now it's very hard for me to believe that 

that's really how these agencies have been operating for

40 years.

 MR. WALDO: Well, that's not; and let me 

explain how they have been operating, because I think 

that will help clarify it. For 40 years EPA has 

regulated sources like ore processing mills, aluminum 

smelters, others that I have named, others that are 

listed in our brief, and has applied effluent 

limitations to those discharges. Now, you hear --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even when they --

even fill -- even when they fill a lake?

 MR. WALDO: Yes, absolutely -- and let me 

explain that, because you hear this statement a lot: 

"EPA never regulates fill material." Well, that's 

because when you apply the effluent limitations, it's 

not fill material anymore.

 The effluent limitations require the use of 

settling ponds that are not in navigable waters. The 

settling ponds or other technologies remove almost all 

of the solids so that the discharge that is permitted by 

EPA in the section 402 permit might have a limitation of 

20 or 30 milligrams per liter, something that wouldn't 

have a measurable filling effect on the receiving water 

body.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when EPA 

regulates has regulated these for 40 years, which I

assume is up until 2002, then it's -- it's because they 

don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling 

ponds?

 MR. WALDO: Settling ponds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which are not 

navigable waters of the United States.

 MR. WALDO: Exactly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the new 

regulation says the EPA does not regulate it when it 

goes into -- I can understand why the Army Corps of 

Engineers doesn't care if it's an impoundment pond or a 

settling pond, but they do care when it's a lake.

 MR. WALDO: When they adopted the new 

regulation, they were very clear that they intended to 

continue their past practice. The agencies never stated 

an intent to repeal or modify or change the 

applicability of any effluent limitations, and in fact 

this question came up repeatedly: What happens if it's 

fill material but it's subject to an effluent 

limitation; and every time they addressed it, they said 

the same thing. Effluent limitations will continue to 

apply and will be applied through section 402 permits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To fill material as 

defined in the 2002 regulation?

 MR. WALDO: That's what it's all about, yes.

 MR. WALDO: The -- I'm talking about the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. You are

definition of fill material in -- whatever -- it's 

reproduced at page 7a and 8a of the government's brief.

 MR. WALDO: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- definition --

MR. WALDO: The definition of fill material 

is simply a definition. By itself it doesn't have any 

operative effect. It doesn't -- it doesn't authorize 

any particular kinds of discharges.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but do you have 

a -- a case over these 40 years where a company was 

trying to use the emission from the mine as a fill 

material in a lake rather than in a settling pond, and 

where the EPA, despite the fact that it was using it to 

fill a lake, applied its effluent standards?

prohibited.

illegal for EPA to permit the discharge of the processed 

wastewater --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Evidently not. I mean, the 

EPA says not. Do you have a -- an instance where it was 

prohibited where a company wanted to -- to emit fill 

material into a lake and the EPA said no, you can't do 

it, because of the effluent limitations?

 MR. WALDO: Well, if any -- I don't know if 

anyone ever asked to do that, but if they did the answer 

would have been no. I can't come up with an answer 

because that's what the effluent limitations require.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But your -- your 40 years 

of experience then really don't -- don't cover this

 Let me ask you another question. The other 

side says that the alternative to this would be even 

worse, or it sounds worse to me, anyway. What -- what 

is your solution, closing down the mine? Is there --

MR. WALDO: No, no, no. We -- we agree with 

EPA on this point. There is a different of opinion 

between EPA and Corps of Engineers as to which was the 

preferred site. EPA preferred the dry land disposal 

site, and -- and we agree that has much less adverse

affect on the ecosystem.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your description of 

that effect? The other solution we were told would 

involve filling in a vast expanse of wetlands and then 

having these huge piles that could be seen by all the 

tourist boats.

 MR. WALDO: Yes, it has -- it does have 

adverse impacts, that is, some; but in EPA's view and in 

our view is not as bad as filling up a lake and killing 

all the fish and aquatic life in the lake.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the fish, there 

are a thousand fish in this lake, right?

 MR. WALDO: Yes. Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And those aren't 

endangered fish; there are millions of them somewhere 

else, right?

 MR. WALDO: That's right. But it's -- it's 

also an important point for us here that this is a 

national rule, and EPA considered these kind of 

alternative land use requirements as an effect of its 

no-discharge rule. When the -- EPA specifically 

addressed the fact that if you prohibit discharges of 

processed wastewater into navigable waters, it's going 

to require using more land to dispose of all that solid 

waste somewhere, and they determined that the benefits

of keeping processed wastewater out of the navigable 

waters was worth it. And so it's both site-specifically 

preferable, and it's a determination that was based 

on --

JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there a decision in 

the lower courts that the alternative was unacceptable 

as well? And would you represent that if the case were 

remanded, that would not be your position on remand?

decision to identify --

wetlands and creating a mound that was bigger than the 

Pentagon was an unacceptable solution to the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you said the EPA 

preferred the -- the solution of filling in the wetlands 

and creating an ash Pentagon?

 MR. WALDO: When -- when the Corps of 

Engineers proposed the draft 404 permit, EPA commented 

on it and said, we disagree with your conclusion that 

filling up the lake is the least environmentally 

dangerous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it really felt 

that way, couldn't it simply have vetoed the permit?

 MR. WALDO: Yes, EPA can veto --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it couldn't have felt 

very strongly about it.

 MR. WALDO: Well, EPA -- the veto authority 

is a discretionary authority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. WALDO: It's for unacceptable adverse 

consequences. And for understandable reasons, EPA very 

rarely exercises that authority. But EPA never changed 

its position about whether the -- about which was the

it's not toxic? Okay. I guess cyanide isn't toxic.

 But the -- the -- now I just heard that if 

the EPA doesn't give the permit, but the Corps of 

Engineers does, the EPA has the power to veto the 

permit. Is that right?

 MR. WALDO: EPA can veto for unacceptable 

adverse consequences. It's not a way to enforce 

effluent limitations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? If they have a 

veto power --

MR. WALDO: Because that's all 404(c) says.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know it comes under a 

different statute, but in any instance where in fact 

they see that some of their rules that they promulgate 

are being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers 

is not paying attention to those rules, they can veto 

it.

 MR. WALDO: Well, but then --

JUSTICE BREYER: If they don't veto it, then 

that would be a way of reconciling these two things.

 MR. WALDO: The -- the position that EPA has 

taken in this case, unfortunately, is that, if the 

discharge meets that definition of fill material, no 

matter how bad the consequences are for water quality, 

it's fill material, and it's therefore exempt from

 MR. WALDO: Only if it was for adverse --

well, if they found adverse -- unacceptable adverse 

consequences --

JUSTICE BREYER: And wouldn't an 

unacceptable adverse consequence be that it puts all 

this effluent into the water?

 MR. WALDO: It's a different standard from 

whether it violates an effluent limitation. That's all 

I'm saying.

 And I want to be clear that the effluent in 

this case, although it doesn't necessarily violate any 

toxic pollutant effluent, it is toxic. It's toxic with 

conventional pollutants. It has a pH of 10, which is 

toxic to aquatic life. It's very high. It's about the 

pH of ammonia, is what this slurry effluent is that's 

being discharged in this case. And the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that the pH at the 

point where it's discharged, and not the general pH in 

the lake?

 MR. WALDO: It will dilute in the lake. 

They are using the lake as their diluting settling pond. 

That's right. They're using a navigable water body --

question, when -- once it's released into the lake, 

what's the pH of the lake as opposed to the --

MR. WALDO: Oh, it will dilute in the lake, 

so it will revert to normal levels, but --

JUSTICE ALITO: Within how long?

 MR. WALDO: Oh, I mean, that happens, you 

know, in a -- some sort of a mixing zone just outside 

the pipe. That happens pretty quickly.

 Now, for the lake to recover --

JUSTICE ALITO: The pH that you just cited 

was the pH --

MR. WALDO: Of the slurry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- just at the point of the 

discharge?

 MR. WALDO: Of the slurry. That's right. 

And -- now I want to talk about this allegation that 

it's like dumping wet sand in the lake. That's not true 

at all. They tested the tailings sediment from this 

discharge with two organisms, and with one of them, it 

killed 95 percent of the organisms in the test, which is 

way over the top for EPA's toxicity threshold. In the 

other organism they had, it -- the organism survived, 

but their reproduction rate was significantly reduced, 

also meeting the toxicity test standards that EPA 

establishes. So this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up, 

that's the same point, though, that Justice Alito made: 

You're testing that right as it comes out, not as it's 

diluted in the lake.

 MR. WALDO: No. No, Your Honor, that's not 

right. That's what the solids -- that's the affect of 

the solids, and that's why, as a result of that, they 

established this rule that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I didn't 

understand you. I thought you said that the toxicity in 

the slurry was tested and killed 99 or whatever percent 

of these invertebrates.

 MR. WALDO: They took that slurry, they let 

the solids settle down in the bottom, and then they 

tested the solids for what effect it would have on some 

fresh water organisms, because they were trying to 

determine whether the lake would be able to recover from 

depositing all these solids into the lake. And they 

found that it had a very high toxicity level. And so 

what they did to try to remedy that was require 

depositing native vegetation on the top of all of that, 

after the mine closes. And they are hoping that that 

will have the effect of letting the lake recover. But 

EPA concluded that it will take decades, if ever, before 

the lake can recover from that.

So this is not some benign wet-sand kind of 

discharge. It's a toxic slurry with a high pH level and 

with effects that are going to last for decades. And if 

EPA -- if section 404 is interpreted to allow these 

kinds of discharges to be emitted exempt from effluent 

limitations, it eviscerates key requirements of the 

Clean Water Act. EPA is required to regulate sources of 

this type through effluent limitations. EPA is required 

to regulate the suspended solids through effluent 

limitations from industrial sources like this. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, you have this 

mix, and it satisfies -- it goes to an effluent part and 

a fill part, in your view, what -- if the statute says 

both agencies regulate, they have to meet both, one or 

the other? How does it work?

 MR. WALDO: If there's an effluent 

limitation, the effluent -- there's a performance 

standard under section 306. The performance standard 

must be complied with under section 306(e). And the 

only way --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say this is 404; it's 

not 402 --

MR. WALDO: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is 306?

 MR. WALDO: 404 is not appropriate here

because there is an effluent limitation. With fill 

material --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is fill.

 MR. WALDO: It's fill material, but it's not 

fill material that is available for a section 404 

permit. And EPA has always regulated discharges from 

sources like this, that meet that definition of fill 

material. EPA has had an effects-based definition of 

fill material since virtually the beginning of the Clean 

Water Act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So fill material is only 

that material as to which no effluent standard applies?

 MR. WALDO: No, it's fill material. In this 

case, it's fill material, but this fill material is not 

eligible for a 404 permit.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 404 material is material 

such that it is fill material and there is no effluent 

standard applicable?

 MR. WALDO: Yes, that's correct. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: So, it's 95 percent solid, 

but there's an effluent limitation, and your position is 

that there can't be a 404 permit; it has to be a 402 

permit?

 MR. WALDO: If it's covered -- if that 

discharge is covered by an effluent limitation, yes,

that's correct. And I want to be clear about this 

point, that EPA -- well, I guess my time is up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. Finish 

your thought.

 MR. WALDO: Okay. EPA amended its 

regulations in 1979 specifically to recognize the fact 

that some discharges of fill material are not eligible 

for section 404 permits and require NPDES permits. At 

that time, the regulations said you don't need an NPDES 

permit if it's fill material. EPA amended that 

regulation to say you don't need an NPDES permit if it's 

fill material and it's subject to section 404 of the 

Clean Water Act. And the purpose of that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Waldo.

 MR. WALDO: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, you have 

three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: What the Respondents would wish 

to do is to have this Court disagree with the agencies' 

interpretation of the statutes which they administer, 

their consistent interpretations of those statutes, and 

the factual findings that a whole slew of agencies made

with respect to the subject matter of these permits.

 The preamble of the 202 -- the 2002 fill 

regulations specifically says -- this is 31,135 of 

Federal Register Volume 67 -- EPA has never sought to 

regulate fill material under effluent guidelines. 

Never.

 There was an agreement, a memorandum of 

agreement between EPA and the Corps of Engineers in 

1986. It is cited at the United States Government brief 

at page 27. The EPA and the Corps agree -- and this is 

in response to your question, Justice Breyer, and I 

think something Justice Kennedy said and something 

Justice Souter said with respect to what if there are 

two things in the stream going into the water. Fill 

material remains subject to 404 permitting even if they 

occur in association with discharges meeting 402 

criteria. That's the answer to that question. And the 

-- and the EPA --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought -- I thought 

your brother would say: But that does not respond to 

306 effluent.

 MR. OLSON: 306 provisions in the statute 

are not made applicable to 404 permitting, and the 

consistent regulatory history from 1973 -- and it's all 

set out on page 27, or summarized on page 27 of the

government's brief -- are that 301 and 306 are not 

applicable under the 404 process.

 And if there was any doubt at all, there is 

a -- the so-called mine tailings memorandum at pages 141 

through 145 of the joint appendix in which three top 

officials of the EPA construe what they call the rules, 

the regulations, and the statute. This is both 

agencies. Under the plain regulation language of the 

rule -- this is page 145a -- under the plain language of 

the rule and the agency's interpretation of the 

regulation in its preamble, the mine tailings that are 

to be placed into an impoundment are covered by 404. 

And it specifically addresses this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does that mean anything 

more than you've got to get a 404 permit without 

addressing the question whether you can get a 404 permit 

if it has, in effect, the -- the -- if it has the 

effects which are supposed to be regulated by the 

effluent limitations?

 MR. OLSON: That precise question, 

Justice Souter, is addressed on pages 143, 144, and 145 

of this memorandum from top officials of the EPA, 

applicable to this particular mine and these particular 

discharges --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where is -- where is that

 MR. OLSON: That's on pages 141 through 145a 

of the joint appendix.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But as I read that 

sentence, Mr. Olson, it says they are subject to both 

permitting.

 MR. OLSON: No, it doesn't. It says -- with 

due respect, Justice Stevens, it says on the bottom of 

page 144: "As a result, the regulatory regime 

applicable to the discharges under section 402," and so 

forth. What -- I think one thing that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You are talking about the 

last sentence on --

MR. OLSON: There is a 402 permit in this 

case, too there is a 404 permit with respect to material 

going into the lake and a 402 permit for the material 

coming out of the lake into the waters of the United 

States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Olson. The case is submitted.
