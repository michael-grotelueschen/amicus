3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-507, Pacific Operators 

Offshore v. Valladolid. 

6  Mr. Clement. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The straightforward question in this case is 

12 whether the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides a 

13 remedy for a worker injured in a forklift mishap on dry 

14 land. The answer is no. A worker injured on dry land 

from operations on dry land has a remedy in the State 

16 workers' compensation law, but not from OCSLA's 

17 extension of the Longshore Act to the outer continental 

18 shelf. Indeed, both the Benefits Review Board and the 

19 Ninth Circuit here held that the accident occurred too 

far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say on 

22 land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State 

23 offshore limit? Does that count as land under your 

24 view?

 MR. CLEMENT: No, it wouldn't count as land,

1 Mr. Chief Justice. If there were platforms on there 

2 that were themselves treated as land, that might be. I 

3 think most of the 3 miles from shore is going to be the 

4 navigable waters, and that might be covered, for 

example, directly under the Longshore Act. But as I 

6 say, one of the anomalies here is there was a direct 

7 Longshore Act claim in this case, and the determination 

8 was that the facility here was too far inland for direct 

9 coverage under the Longshore Act.

 So, therefore, the counterintuitive 

11 proposition on the other side of the table today is that 

12 in extending the Longshore Act to the outer continental 

13 shelf, Congress effectively created a boomerang effect 

14 that caused the Longshore Act to apply further inland 

than it otherwise would. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, just to follow 

17 up on the Chief Justice's question, if there's a 

18 helicopter crash in the water, let's say it occurs 2.5 

19 miles from the shore, is that covered? And, similarly, 

would it be covered if it occurred 3.5 miles from the 

21 shore? 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

23 the best answer is both of those crashes would be 

24 covered directly by the Longshore Act because the 

Longshore Act by its own terms, not extended by OCSLA, 

4

1 covers the navigable waters, and both of those would be 

2 accidents occurring in the navigable waters. And in the 

3 part of this Court's opinion in the Pacific Operators 

4 case addressing the DOHSA claim, this Court said that a 

helicopter effectively, when it's performing this kind 

6 of ferrying function, is a vessel. So, I would think 

7 that the right answer there is not that OCSLA extends 

8 the Longshore Act, but the Longshore Act applies 

9 directly under those circumstances.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The curious thing about this 

11 case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak 

12 quite clearly to some theory of causation. Any injury 

13 occurring as the result of operations conducted on the 

14 outer continental shelf. That's -- that's causation. 

Maybe it's but-for, maybe it's proximate, but it's some 

16 -- some species of causation. And yet, nobody wants 

17 this really to be -- neither you nor your adversary nor 

18 the Government wants this to be a -- to be based on 

19 causation. Everyone wants to smuggle something else 

into -- into here -- into this. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let me 

22 talk first about the causation and then about the 

23 smuggling, if I can. As to the causation, I think there 

24 is both causation in this 1333(b) and a situs 

requirement that both sides acknowledge. At a bare 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 minimum, there have to be injuries resulting from
 

2 operations conducted on the shelf. And I think that
 

3 alone, that causation principle alone, if faithfully
 

4 applied, is enough to decide this case in our favor.


 But let me address the smuggling, because I 

6 do think --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Give me an example of a --

8 of an injury that occurs on the shelf that is not a 

9 consequence of operations conducted. What -- just 

beachcombers out there, or what? 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the best example 

12 would be, Your Honor -- is somebody who's on the shelf 

13 but they're not employed in the relevant production 

14 purposes. And so, you might have an --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What are they doing out 

16 there? 

17  MR. CLEMENT: Well, you might have an 

18 accountant out there. You might just have some 

19 employees who are out there whale watching or something.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many accountants go 

21 to platforms? 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

23 think it's worth recognizing -- I mean, I don't know how 

24 many go. I doubt very many go. But Congress passed 

this statute at a time when they didn't know the full 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 scope of the operations that would take place out on the 

2 shelf. And so, what they're trying to do is they're 

3 trying to -- at the one point, they're trying to limit 

4 it to employees who are engaged in the operations out 

there that are designed for the production of the 

6 mineral wealth of the shelf. And so, I think that's 

7 what some of the language is directed at. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if that -- if that's 

9 what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is 

this person one who regularly works on the outer 

11 continental shelf. And the -- this worker, we're told, 

12 was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the 

13 time. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. And if he was at the --

on the outer continental shelf at the time of this 

16 accident, he probably wouldn't have been injured. 

17  But the one thing I think the statute 

18 clearly speaks to is not status, but it speaks to, as 

19 Justice Alito suggested, at a minimum a relationship 

between the operations that caused the injury and the 

21 fact that those operations have to be conducted on the 

22 shelf. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if you had said 

7

1 status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made 

2 more sense, given the language of the statute. We will 

3 all have hypotheticals. We won't have too many, but 

4 it's quite common on oil rigs that the employees bring 

some of the equipment back to the land, clean it, 

6 prepare it, and so that they can bring it back to the 

7 next -- the next shift on the rig. And some of this 

8 machinery is complicated. It has springs in it. 

9 Suppose that the worker brings the machine back from the 

rig to the land, to the base of operations that's 

11 land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine. 

12 Under your view, no coverage? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: No coverage, Your Honor, and I 

14 think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's quite 

16 difficult to square with the "as a result" language 

17 because this is a result of the operation. Let's just 

18 say the machine got broken because of the -- of the 

19 operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's 

injured. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: No, I disagree, Your Honor, 

22 respectfully, and I think your way of looking at that 

23 hypothetical doesn't give sufficient import to the 

24 phrase "conducted on the shelf." It's -- what 

Respondents want to do is they want you to look at the 

8

Official 

1 statute as saying as long as there is an injury that 

2 results from operations that have the purpose of 

3 developing the outer continental shelf, that that's 

4 enough. And if that were enough, I think the answer to 

your hypothetical would be that's covered. 

6  But the statute very specifically says that 

7 they have to be injuries as a result of operations 

8 conducted on the shelf for the purpose of extracting the 

9 mineral wealth of the shelf.

 And so, that first "on the shelf" I think 

11 clearly modifies the operations. Only operations 

12 conducted on the shelf are --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the 

14 Government and --

MR. CLEMENT: -- covered by the statute. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government and the 

17 Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the 

18 person has to have -- the injured employee has to have 

19 spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the 

offshore operations. So, you could add that. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, you can't add that, Your 

22 Honor, because if there's one thing that is absolutely 

23 clear about this statute it's that it doesn't include a 

24 status test that looks for the predominant place you 

spend your time. And that's not --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your brief, 

2 your reply brief, said you -- you superimpose a status 

3 test. You have the situs of the injury, and then you 

4 superimpose status. So, your test is not simple state 

of -- place of injury. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, I agree. I thought 

7 you had a backup argument --

8  MR. CLEMENT: Well --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in your -- in your 

reply brief. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. I mean, I have two 

12 arguments, and let me try to address both, which is to 

13 say, on the causation point, if you look at just 

14 causation and you don't have a situs and a status 

requirement, then in that scenario, there's no way to 

16 get just a status test. And the only thing I would 

17 implore you to think about in that is not only is it not 

18 in the statute, but there is a statute that has a 

19 status-based remedy that travels with the worker 

wherever they go. It's the Jones Act, and it 

21 specifically is written in status terms. And that was a 

22 model that Congress had before it, but it specifically 

23 rejected the admiralty model for dealing with these 

24 structures and adopted the model that has them treated 

as --

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you call status --

2 if the test is where you spend a substantial amount of 

3 time working, is that what you call status? 

4  MR. CLEMENT: That's their status test, 

exactly. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- but you call that 

7 status? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: I call that their pure status 

9 test, which they themselves cite to Chandris, which is a 

Jones Act case. That just doesn't work. This was not 

11 the Jones Act. 

12  Now, there is a test where we say that the 

13 best reading of the statute is status plus situs. And 

14 if I could try to get this argument out -- it's a little 

bit complicated, because I think the defect of this 

16 argument, if it has one, is it doesn't leap out directly 

17 from 1333(b), and you have to read 1333(b) in 

18 conjunction with both the rest of 1333 and in 

19 conjunction with 903(a) of the Longshore Workers' Act. 

If you do that, I think you will see there is a situs 

21 requirement and a status requirement. 

22  Let me start with the rest of the 1333. If 

23 you think about this statute, the primary engine for 

24 applying Federal law to the shelf is not 1333(b); it's 

1333(a). It applies all of Federal law to the shelf.

1  But some statutes, it doesn't work, and the 

2 Longshore Act is one of them. If you apply the 

3 Longshore Act to the shelf without any modifications, it 

4 won't cover the shelf because it by its terms has a 

situs requirement that is limited to the navigable
 

6 waters and at that point the drydocks.
 

7  So, Congress has to tailor the longshore
 

8 remedy to the reality of the shelf, and it does it in
 

9 two ways.


 One, it has this language that everyone's 

11 focused on that is something of a status requirement in 

12 that it limits the recovery to employees who are engaged 

13 in certain activities. But the rest of the language in 

14 1333(b) is important. It's these definitions (1), (2), 

and (3), and they effectively define terms in the 

16 Longshore Act to make them work for purposes of 

17 extending it to the shelf. 

18  And the key definition is (3). Three 

19 defines the term "United States" when used in a 

geographical sense, and it defines it to include the 

21 shelf, the artificial islands, and the fixed attachments 

22 thereto. Now, that's a puzzle if you look at 1333(b) in 

23 isolation, because it's defining the term "United 

24 States" for geographical purposes, and 1333(b) does not 

use the term "United States" for geographical purposes.

1 But another statute does; it's 903. It's the longshore 

2 remedy that's extended. 

3  And 903(a) uses the term "United States." 

4 And 903(a), if you want to look at, is at page 96 of the 

petition appendix. But that's the situs requirement. 

6 The situs requirement of 903(a) unmodified limits 

7 recovery to the navigable waters and drydocks. So, if 

8 you take that definition from (b)(3) and essentially 

9 superimpose it on 903(a), you then get a remedy that has 

a situs requirement; there's a recovery, but only if the 

11 injury occurs on the navigable waters, drydocks, the 

12 shelf, artificial islands, and the attachments thereto. 

13  So it's -- as I say, it's a complicated 

14 argument, and it doesn't stare you in the face if you 

look at 1333(b) --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. How does 

17 that -- how does that provide you situs on the adjacent 

18 waters? 

19  MR. CLEMENT: I don't -- with respect, 

Justice Sotomayor, I think you get that without OCSLA, 

21 which is to say I think that there's a remedy under the 

22 Longshore Act directly under the adjacent waters because 

23 the adjacent waters are navigable waters. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see. So, you're 

saying you don't even -- you're not going --

1  MR. CLEMENT: You don't need those, and that 

2 just underscores that Congress in the statute is really 

3 dealing with a very particular problem with the shelf 

4 and the artificial islands and platforms attached to 

them. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how do you get to 

7 the water above the shelf? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: Same way, Your Honor, which is 

9 to say they're navigable waters.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Instead of saying 

11 they're part of the shelf? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: Exactly, and they're not. And 

13 the statute I think couldn't be clearer about that 

14 because 1332 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think the issue that 

16 Justice Kennedy was alluding to was the example the 

17 Ninth Circuit used: A pitcher on the mound throws a 

18 baseball and hits the batter. The situs is not the 

19 mound, but the injury has occurred as a result of 

pitching. And so, he's coming up with examples, and I 

21 think that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying when it 

22 was creating the test of a substantial nexus between the 

23 operation and the injury. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: I'm --

2 that possibility. 

3  MR. CLEMENT: Well -- and I --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You may be arguing that 

as a factual matter what this man was doing on land was 

6 not a substantial nexus. That's a different issue than 

7 providing a test that limits injury to an operation 

8 solely on the shelf. 

9  MR. CLEMENT: And if I could take that --

there's a couple of pieces to that, Justice Sotomayor. 

11 First of all, I would say that I think that the 

12 hypothetical, let's say, of, you know, a nut or 

13 something coming off the shelf and hitting somebody 

14 somewhere else is -- illustrates the difference between 

our primary argument and our backup argument. 

16  On our primary argument, somebody who -- if 

17 the nut hits somebody in the navigable waters, they 

18 wouldn't recover from OCSLA; they would recover under 

19 the Longshore Act directly because they were on the 

navigable waters. 

21  On our backup theory, that it's a tight 

22 proximate cause test, then I would say, yes, that person 

23 can recover under OCSLA, but that's really a fortuitous 

24 set of circumstances precisely because I wouldn't apply 

a substantial nexus test, which seems to me just an

1 invitation to kind of play around with --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you're not -- you 

3 don't want a but-for test. Or do you? 

4  MR. CLEMENT: Certainly not.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. You don't 

6 want a proximate cause test. 

7  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I could live with a 

8 proximate cause test as long as it's a proximate cause 

9 test that's tailored to the statute. And what I mean by 

that is I think if you look at the statute, you can't 

11 have a proximate cause test that doesn't take geography 

12 into account. 

13  And I think -- in particular, I think in a 

14 case like this, you have to ask yourself not just 

proximate cause in the abstract, but were there 

16 operations somewhere other than the shelf that were a 

17 more direct proximate cause of the injury? And if 

18 that's the case, then the remedy lies in the law that 

19 applies to those other operations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me your definition 

21 of causation now. 

22  MR. CLEMENT: What's that? 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is a new version of 

24 proximate cause, so --

1 funny because, you know, this Court has on more than one 

2 occasion sort of remarked that "proximate cause" itself 

3 is a weird formulation because "proximate" sounds like 

4 it has a location aspect to it. And we actually think, 

for purposes of this statute, that should be right. 

6 It's proximate cause as tailored to this statute and the 

7 policies of this statute, and I think that would want to 

8 really take the geography into account. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, I don't really 

understand proximate cause as applied to a -- a statute 

11 that provides for automatic liability rather than 

12 liability for negligence. To say that it's a proximate 

13 cause of a particular act of negligence is one thing, 

14 and we have a whole body of law that gives guidance for 

that. But do you know of any other situation where we 

16 talk of proximate cause, something proximately caused by 

17 operations? Not by a particular act of negligence or --

18 I don't know how to apply proximate cause to an 

19 operation.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I would 

21 say two things. One is I do think there's an anomaly 

22 here, but I do think it's -- you know, you're not being 

23 asked to apply proximate cause for purposes of assessing 

24 liability because, as you say, strict liability -- it's 

kind of automatic liability.

1  But what I would say is you are being asked, 

2 at least under the backup theory, to apply proximate 

3 cause as a way of determining the geographical scope of 

4 the statute. And that's anomalous, but I don't think 

it's so anomalous that you wouldn't do it if you thought 

6 that was the better way to read the statute. 

7  That said, I do think that the best way to 

8 read the statute is consistent with all the other 

9 statutes as part of a jurisdictional puzzle. I mean, 

all of the areas off of the shelf are governed, with the 

11 exception of seamen under the Jones Act, primarily as a 

12 matter of geography. So --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, if your 

14 position is right, then we have a worker who most of the 

time is doing work on a platform, and he will be covered 

16 or not depending on whether the injury occurred on the 

17 shelf or on the land. So, it's -- the other view is to 

18 say what this person does most of the time is what 

19 counts. Then this worker would always be covered by 

OCSLA. And if you take your view, then one will be 

21 covered by OCSLA; another one who is doing the same job 

22 is covered by a State -- a State -- you have a variety 

23 of State workers' compensation laws as opposed to a 

24 uniform law governing workers of this kind.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, two responses, Justice

1 Ginsburg: First of all, this Court has already 

2 confronted the objection that, well, if -- under OCSLA 

3 workers would move in and out of coverage, and it 

4 rejected it in the Herb's Welding case. And I don't --

I think it's common ground -- well, maybe not, but it 

6 should be common ground that if you had a worker who was 

7 injured on a State platform, that that would not be 

8 covered by -- a State waters platform, that that would 

9 not be covered by OCSLA.

 And, again, that was an anomaly that this 

11 Court confronted in Herb's welding and the Court said: 

12 Yes, well, you know, workers are going to move in and 

13 out of coverage, but that's what OCSLA says. That's 

14 what OCSLA does.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what brings me --

16 I'm looking at petition appendix 96, 903(a) that you 

17 referred us to. I wasn't quite sure of your argument 

18 with respect to this statute. This statute is a 

19 situs-based statute.

 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, and it's the Longshore 

21 Act. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But since Congress didn't

2  MR. CLEMENT: Well, my argument --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't see, in other 

4 words, how 903 doesn't hurt you more than it helps you.

 MR. CLEMENT: It helps me because 1333(b) 

6 doesn't apply a different model. It adopts this model. 

7 It adopts and extends the Longshoreman Act to the shelf. 

8 See, it's a mistake to read 1333 --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it doesn't; it talks 

about where the injury occurs, and that's not what --

11 and that's not what (b) says. 

12  MR. CLEMENT: No, it talks about that as 

13 part of extending the Longshore Workers' Act to the 

14 shelf. It's important that, you know, you can't get --

I mean, 1333(b), like I said, is not a self-contained 

16 offshore workers workers' compensation regime. What it 

17 does is it extends the Longshore Workers' Act to the 

18 shelf, including 903(a). 

19  But what I'm saying is Congress recognized 

that you couldn't just extend 903(a) and the rest of the 

21 Act to the shelf without modification, because then you 

22 come to this language that says you only get relief if 

23 your injury occurred on the navigable waters or the 

24 drydocks attached thereto. So, Congress in (b)(3) 

changes the definition of the United States for

1 geographical purposes in a way that allows you to 

2 superimpose this provision to the shelf, but instead of 

3 reading it to say you only get a recovery if you're 

4 injured on the navigable waters including the drydocks, 

you get a recovery if you're injured on the navigable 

6 waters, including the shelf, the drydocks, the 

7 artificial islands, and the fixtures attached thereto. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, may I go 

9 back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was 

a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an 

11 OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no 

12 opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury. 

13  MR. CLEMENT: That's right. Herb's Welding 

14 is not a holding, but at the end of that opinion, the 

Court confronts this argument that isn't it odd that 

16 somebody would be moving in and out of coverage? And 

17 the Court says that that is a product of OCSLA. And it 

18 doesn't say it's a product of OCSLA generally; it says 

19 particularly that it's a product of OCSLA's extension of 

the Longshore Act. And I do think that this objection 

21 about people moving in and out was answered by the Court 

22 in Herb's Welding. 

23  I would also say, Justice Ginsburg, the 

24 second point I wanted to make in response to your 

earlier question is I understand that it might make

1 policy sense to have coverage that encapsulates an 

2 individual no matter where they work. But the problem 

3 is -- I mean, that's not only a different model; that's 

4 the model that Congress rejected. They thought long and 

hard about having an admiralty remedy, and presumably 

6 then the Jones Act would apply, and if you were attached 

7 to a vessel or a platform, then you would have coverage 

8 no matter where you went. 

9  But that's not what they did. They 

incorporated instead as their model the Longshore Act, 

11 and the Longshore Act always had a situs requirement. 

12 So, when Congress makes a conscious effort to deal with 

13 this unusual geographical problem with -- and solves the 

14 problem with the Longshore Act, which is sitting there 

with a situs requirement, and doesn't adopt the Jones 

16 Act, which has a status-only requirement, it seems very, 

17 very peculiar to adopt instead a model that would have a 

18 status-only test. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress also did not 

adopt the proposal, the specific proposal to confine 

21 OCSLA to situations in which State workers' compensation 

22 was unavailable. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: And I think that's -- they 

24 rejected that with good reason, Your Honor, because you

1 with the experience that this Court ultimately resolved. 

2 But they're living in real time with the experience of 

3 people under the Longshore Act, which at that point, did 

4 carve out and limit the remedy, the Federal remedy, only 

when a State remedy was unavailable. And they were 

6 watching that play out, and it was a mess. People 

7 didn't know if they should bring a State case or a 

8 Federal case, and at that point they were viewed as 

9 exclusive. So, Congress had ample reasons to reject the 

idea that we're going to only give a Federal remedy if a 

11 State remedy is unavailable. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: What reason did they have 

13 to use the terminology "as a result of" instead of 

14 simply saying that this Act applies only with regard to 

injuries on the platform, which is what other statutes 

16 did say? I mean, other statutes had a geographical 

17 requirement. What a strange way to say it, "as a result 

18 of operations." 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't 

know which other statutes you're talking about. I mean, 

21 the other statute that most plainly has a situs 

22 requirement is the Longshore Act, and that's precisely 

23 what they extended to the shelf, as I've argued. Beyond 

24 that, it's true that some of the other provisions of 

this Act have slightly different wording, but I don't

1 think anything turns on that --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement, you are 

3 asking us to just ignore six words in this statute, 

4 right? You read the statute as any injury occurring on 

the outer continental shelf, when in fact the statute 

6 says "any injury occurring as the result of operations 

7 conducted on the outer continental shelf." And you give 

8 a variety of arguments in your brief about what those 

9 six words are supposed to do. They're supposed to cover 

latent injuries. They're supposed to make sure that the 

11 statute only covers things that happen in the scope of 

12 your employment. 

13  But your friends come back and say the 

14 statute did all those things anyway. These six words 

would serve no function under your theory. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, first of all, 

17 it's interesting. The only way they can say that those 

18 functions were performed by the statute anyways is to 

19 incorporate provisions of the Longshore Act, because 

1333(b) itself doesn't take care of latent injuries or 

21 doesn't take care of, you know, who's in the scope of 

22 their employment. All of that is taken care of in the 

23 Longshore Act, which is why I think the best way to read 

24 this is incorporating the Longshore Act and its situs 

requirement.

1  But, beyond that, I would never ask you to 

2 make six words go away, never. Those words do play a 

3 function, but the function they play is to make it clear 

4 that the injury has to result of operations conducted on 

the shelf for certain purposes. And that precludes an 

6 employee accountant who's out on the shelf and injured 

7 by something that has nothing to do with shelf 

8 operations. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: But this goes back to 

Justice Ginsburg's question. She asked you how many 

11 accountants are there on the shelf? One can't really 

12 imagine that Congress is writing this -- this statute, 

13 and drafting those six words in order to make sure that 

14 an accountant who goes out to the outer continental 

shelf isn't covered. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, I would beg to 

17 differ. And I think what you have to understand is, go 

18 back in 1953 and when they're -- I mean, you can say 

19 confidently that there aren't accountants on the shelf 

because you have the benefit of 60 -- 60 years of 

21 experience with -- post-1953 with what goes on, on the 

22 shelf. Congress at this point is sort of legislating 

23 for a brave new world, and they don't -- they're trying 

24 to provide for all of the occasions that may come to 

pass out on the shelf.

1  There is a great law review article that 

2 actually provides this background, and it's written by, 

3 of all people, Warren Christopher, the Warren 

4 Christopher, and it's in the Stanford Law Review, and it 

was written December of 1953, and it's worth a look 

6 because it captures this idea that they're kind of, you 

7 know, legislating for this brave new world out there, 

8 and they don't know who's going to be out there. They 

9 don't know if it's going to be all drill workers or if 

there's going to be accountants and clerical workers out 

11 there. 

12  And so, I think with that context, it's not 

13 at all odd that they would use those six words to say, 

14 kind of the way that Congress did later in 1972 in 

imposing the marine employment test for longshoremen --

16 it's like, look, we want to provide a longshore remedy, 

17 but not to just anybody, any employee who might happen 

18 to be on the shelf; we want to provide it to those 

19 people who are essentially in the core operations that 

are going on, on the shelf.

Official 

1  ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT 

2  MR. PALMORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

3 and may it please the Court: 

4  I'd like to start off with the exchange that 

Justice Kagan had with Mr. Clement about the language 

6 that was used here in 1333(b), and I think the contrast 

7 between the language that Congress used in 1333(b) and 

8 the language it used in other provisions, neighboring 

9 provisions, of 1333 is instructive.

 And I'd like the point the Court to section 

11 1333(c), which is on page 3a of the appendix to the 

12 Government's brief. This is the provision involving the 

13 National Labor Relations Act. And I think this shows 

14 how Congress went about drafting when it wanted to 

specify legal consequences that would flow from an 

16 actual event that took place in a particular place. So, 

17 Congress extends the National Labor Relations Act to 

18 "any unfair labor practice, as defined in such Act, 

19 occurring upon any artificial island...." And then it 

lists with particularity the particular situses where 

21 the National Labor Relations Act would apply. 

22  If Congress had followed that model in 

23 section 1333(b), it would be a very different statute. 

24 It would have said, as Your Honor pointed out, with 

respect to disability or death of an employee resulting

1 from any injury on the outer continental shelf. If 

2 Congress wanted to additionally require -- have some 

3 kind of operations nexus, it could have said occurring 

4 on the outer continental shelf as the result of 

operations on the outer continental shelf. 

6  Congress didn't do either of those things in 

7 section 1333(b), and we think that contrast is -- is 

8 quite instructive here. It's also not the case --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a 

11 little -- it's a little different when you're talking 

12 about a labor practice and an activity that results in 

13 an injury. Labor practice by its terms is going to have 

14 applicability to a particular location. So, you would 

expect them to use that type of language. It doesn't 

16 carry the same negative implication you're suggesting 

17 under 1333(b). 

18  MR. PALMORE: Well, I think that --

19 Mr. Chief Justice, that I think there's a contrast 

between 1333(b) and 1333(c) in terms of the specificity 

21 with which Congress provided for where a particular 

22 event would happen. There's no question that 1333(b) 

23 has a situs requirement, but it's a situs of operations 

24 requirement.

 So, when you're talking about a situs of 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 operations, you're talking about a geographic zone where 

2 operations take place. It makes sense that Congress 

3 would have used this phrase "on the outer continental 

4 shelf." Now, the outer continental shelf itself is a 

defined term in the statutes. In 1331(a), it applies 

6 only to the subsoil and seabed. It doesn't include 

7 artificial installations put on top. So, we're talking 

8 about a general zone, a general geographic zone where 

9 the operations take place. And then Congress wanted to 

provide benefits for injuries that result from those 

11 operations. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the facts of this 

13 case were changed a little bit so that the Respondent, 

14 instead of spending 98 percent of his time on an oil rig 

doing things that he did there, actually spent only 20 

16 percent of his time there, and he spent 80 percent of 

17 his time on land doing what he was supposed to be doing 

18 at the time of the accident. This particular operation 

19 produced so much scrap metal, he had to spend 80 percent 

of his time going around with a forklift gathering it 

21 up. Now, would this case come out the same way then? 

22  MR. PALMORE: We don't think so, Your Honor. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Then how does that -- I 

24 don't see how you get this result out of the statutory 

language, because the causal connection between the 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

Official 

1 operations on the shelf and the accident are precisely 

2 the same in the two situations. Whether he spends 98 

3 percent of his time on the rig or 2 percent of his time 

4 on the rig, that makes no difference whatsoever in the 

causal relationship. 

6  MR. PALMORE: Because we think it's a 

7 mistake in the context of a workers' compensation scheme 

8 to look at this as kind of a snapshot in time. We think 

9 that when you're talking about a workers' compensation 

scheme, the kind of causation that is relevant is the 

11 causation caused by the employment relationship itself. 

12 So, if someone's spending, like Mr. Valladolid --

13 spending 98 percent of his time on the shelf, he's 

14 uniquely exposed to the hazards of work in that 

dangerous environment. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: The trouble with that is 

17 that's not what it says. It says "as a result of 

18 operations." 

19  MR. PALMORE: And we think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't -- you know, I 

21 would think he doesn't even have to be an employee, does 

22 he? 

23  MR. PALMORE: He does have to be an 

24 employee. That's a -- only employees are entitled to 

benefits. But I think the definition of "employee" or

1 really the related definition of "employer" is
 

2 instructive on this question. If you look at the
 

3 definition of an employer in 1333(b)(2) -- this is on
 

4 page 3a of the Government appendix -- says "the term
 

'employer' means 'an employer any of whose employees are 

6 employed in such operations.'" It's somewhat of a 

7 circular definition. But there's a focus here on 

8 employees who are engaged in such operations. Those are 

9 employees like --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, you're asking 

11 us to look at the relationship between the employment 

12 and the shelf activities, and the statute asks us to 

13 look at the relationship between the injury and the 

14 shelf activities. And those may be two different things 

and seemingly are two different things in the 

16 hypothetical that Justice Alito gave you. 

17  MR. PALMORE: And the Ninth Circuit viewed 

18 -- viewed injury in the way that Your Honor and Justice 

19 Alito are suggesting. And I would -- and that's our 

backup position. I think both sides here have backup 

21 positions. I would submit that the backup positions are 

22 where -- -

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: The backup positions may be 

24 better than the primary positions in this case, you 

know?

1  MR. PALMORE: I think the backup positions 

2 really also differ with each other only in a matter of 

3 degree, not in --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the backup position 

that's so much better here? What is it? 

6  (Laughter.) 

7  MR. PALMORE: Well, I don't -- to be clear, 

8 we don't think it's better. We think that the category 

9 of off-shelf injuries that should be covered are those 

that are suffered by workers who spend a substantial 

11 amount of time on the shelf. The backup position is 

12 the -- in our view, is the Ninth Circuit position, which 

13 is the substantial connection between the injury and 

14 operations on the shelf. It doesn't strike me as that 

different from Mr. Clement's backup position. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the trouble is that I 

17 have no idea what that means. Now, they have the 

18 example of an accountant on land who spends all of his 

19 time doing accounting work for the -- for the oil rig. 

Why isn't there a substantial connection there? Were it 

21 not for the operations on the oil rig, this guy would be 

22 out of work or he'd be doing something completely 

23 different. I don't understand that. 

24  MR. PALMORE: Well, that's the -- that would

4 narrowly, and Justice Scalia's exchange with Mr. Clement 

highlighted this. Proximate cause is a --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A substantial nexus is 

7 just right? 

8  MR. PALMORE: We think substantial --

9 substantial nexus, substantial connection. We think, 

though, that it would be a mistake to look at only the 

11 snapshot in time. And there is some language in the 

12 Ninth Circuit decision which -- which might suggest 

13 that. We think --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you accept your 

adversary's position that whatever causal -- you have 

16 to, given your status test. Where are you drawing your 

17 status test from? Meaning, obviously it's not from the 

18 language. 

19  MR. PALMORE: Well, I think I would submit 

that it is from the language, Justice Sotomayor, because 

21 we think that the language has to be understood in the 

22 context of workers' compensation. This is not a 

23 tort-based fault regime. This is a workers' 

24 compensation scheme. Workers' compensation schemes are 

based on the relationship between employer and employee, 

33
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 and they cover injuries that arise out of and in the 

2 course of employment. So, the kind of causation that 

3 matters in a workers' compensation scheme is the -- is 

4 the causation that flows from the worker relationship 

itself, the workplace relationship itself. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not -- I would 

7 have just thought you would have taken it out of (b) 

8 subdivision (2), the term "employer," almost the 

9 obverse, means an employer -- means an employer any of 

whose employees are employed in such operations. 

11  MR. PALMORE: Thank you, Justice Sotomayor. 

12 I think that is the second point. I think that textual 

13 provision provides support for the fact that Congress 

14 was particularly focused on those employees who were 

uniquely exposed to the hazards of work on the shelf. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- but what 

17 if that exposure is not pertinent to what they're doing? 

18 Let's take the same individual, 98 percent of the time 

19 on the rig and 2 percent on land. An emergency comes 

up. They need a new part, and they say: Here, go --

21 you know, go drive to Reno where they have a new part 

22 and bring it back. And he skids off the road and is 

23 injured. Is he really covered by the Offshore Act? 

24  MR. PALMORE: We think he is because that is 

a worker who is uniquely exposed to those hazards

1 offshore, and he shouldn't --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so, he's 

3 subject -- he's injured by, you know, a hazard on the 

4 road to Reno. He's -- I don't know how many miles that 

is from the offshore, and yet he's still covered by the 

6 Offshore Act? 

7  MR. PALMORE: Yes, Your Honor, because we 

8 think that the -- that -- and here the contrast with the 

9 underlying Longshore Act is important, and Justice 

Kennedy's questions of Justice -- of Mr. Clement 

11 highlighted this, because it's quite an unusual thing 

12 for a workers' compensation statute to have a 

13 situs-of-injury requirement. The Longshore Act is the 

14 sole example of which I'm aware, and it has it for 

historical reasons based on this Court's decision in 

16 Jensen. 

17  And it has a provision that's quoted on page 

18 19 of the Government brief, that provides coverage for 

19 disability or death, but only if the disability or death 

result from an injury occurring upon the navigable 

21 waters. That was clearly in front of Congress at the 

22 time that it adopted OCSLA, because it was incorporating 

23 that statute and applying it in the outer continental 

24 shelf context. And it's quite telling that Congress did 

not use that but-only-if formulation.

under the Longshore Act or you're under this Act. And 

6 -- whereas, in your situation, you can be under both, 

7 can't you? 

8  MR. PALMORE: Yes, in some situations. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why does that make 

any sense? 

11  MR. PALMORE: Because the kind of certainty 

12 -- we think our test is actually much easier to 

13 administer and provides greater predictability in this 

14 sense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which one prevails when 

16 they both apply? Are there any differences between the 

17 two? 

18  MR. PALMORE: Well, there's -- Congress 

19 contemplated, expressly contemplated, that there would 

be overlapping coverage and adopted a provision in 

21 903(e) of the Longshore Act to provide for offsetting 

22 payments when there is overlap. So, overlap is a fact 

23 of life in this area.

a certain set -- and it's the same set in both, 

6 virtually, the same set of people -- where they're 

7 injured on navigable waters or piers and docks and so

9 platform, it's this Act, so far. And the benefits are 

the same. 

11  MR. PALMORE: Correct.

platform bits repaired miles from the sea. Now, that 

16 person would not be covered by Longshore Act, would he?

8 take it to the plant to have it repaired, which is 

9 100 miles inland. He does it, and he's hurt at the 

plant. He is not covered, correct? 

11  MR. PALMORE: Under the Longshore Act? 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Yes, that's 

13 right. So, he's not covered. 

14  MR. PALMORE: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But if the same thing 

16 happens on the platform, under your theory he is 

17 covered. Now, your opponent is asking a reasonable 

18 question. That seems to be about the only difference 

19 that he can think of, whether it's the one Act or the 

other, and why would Congress have done that? That's 

21 his question, and I'd like to hear the answer. 

22  MR. PALMORE: Because in that situation, 

23 Justice Breyer, the Longshore Act's strict 

24 situs-of-injury requirement is the exception, not the 

rule. That is unusual and really unprecedented in

3 at the time OCSLA was adopted in 1953, States had nearly 

4 uniformly moved away from the tort theory of workers' 

compensation coverage that would apply benefits --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: So, your answer is 

7 basically there are many statutes like this, they all 

8 have some kind of OCSLA-type requirement, it's the 

9 Longshore Act that was rather stingy, and we don't know 

why. 

11  MR. PALMORE: No, we do know why.

13  MR. PALMORE: It was stingy for historical

JUSTICE BREYER: Because of the workmen's 

16 compensation? 

17  MR. PALMORE: It was based on this Court's 

18 decision in Jensen, and there's a whole long and 

19 tortured history there, and that explains why Congress 

did that. 

21  But when Congress took the unusual step of 

22 imposing a situs-of-injury requirement in the context of 

23 a workers' compensation scheme, it did so in express 

24 terms with this "but-only-if" phrase.

3  MR. PALMORE: Yes, just like the worker on a 

4 fixed platform on the outer Continental Shelf would also 

be covered by State workers' comp. Private Respondent 

6 cites the Bobbitt case from California that says 

7 California workers' comp doesn't have a location 

8 requirement --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; I don't 

understand the answer. So, he's covered by both? 

11  MR. PALMORE: Yes. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh. 

13  MR. PALMORE: Overlap -- a certain degree of 

14 overlap is a fact of life in this area. Section 903(e) 

accounts for that by allowing for offsetting payment, so 

16 there's never going to be double recovery. And 903(e) 

17 really just endorsed a historical practice of offsetting 

18 payments that was discussed by this Court in the Calbeck 

19 case. So that there has always been some degree of 

overlapping coverage. 

21  At the time of -- OCSLA was adopted in 

22 1953 -- this Court in Davis had recognized that even 

23 under the Longshore Act itself there was a twilight zone

1  ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT
 

2  MR. FREDERICK: Thank you,
 

3 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
 

4  I'd like to shift some focus to what would
 

have happened if Mr. Valladolid had worked on a floating 

6 platform instead of a fixed, because the law is clear 

7 that if the platform was floating, he would be a Jones 

8 Act seaman, and under this Court's cases, if he were 

9 injured on land, he would have a Jones Act remedy. So, 

the only anomaly here is that he happened to be working 

11 on a fixed platform 98 percent of the time. And the 

12 question is whether the permissive workers' compensation 

13 benefits provided under OCSLA carry with him when he 

14 happens to be injured on land as a result of the shelf 

operations. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's an 

17 anomaly. I mean, you know, if it's a floating platform, 

18 it's a vessel. The difference between a vessel and a 

19 dock. Is it an anomaly that you're covered under the 

Longshore Act if you're injured on a dock, which is 

21 fixed, but you are not -- you're covered under the Jones 

22 Act instead if you're on a vessel, which is not fixed? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: Your question, Justice 

24 Scalia --

2  MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me answer your 

3 question this way, Justice Scalia. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: How many floating platforms 

are there, anyway? 

6  MR. FREDERICK: There are a number of 

7 floating platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. They're 

8 operating on the outer continental shelf as well as on 

the Western Pacific --

11 Jones Act?

14 vessels.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 


MR. FREDERICK: 


JUSTICE SCALIA: 


MR. FREDERICK: 


And they're covered by the 

Yes. That's correct. 

They should be; they're 

But the point is that they 

16 get a Jones Act remedy if they happen to be injured on 

17 land. So, Mr. Chief Justice, under your hypothetical, 

18 if the Jones Act seaman is driving to Reno and there's 

19 an accident, he's covered under the Jones Act and gets 

to have a Jones Act remedy, notwithstanding that the 

21 injury has nothing to do with his service on the vessel 

22 itself. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you are not 

24 proposing to eliminate that anomaly?

 MR. FREDERICK: No, what I'm saying is that

3 are injured, so long as you're on a platform, 

4 you're covered. I don't think so.

 MR. FREDERICK: If the work is substantially 

6 related and the causal connection goes to the employment 

7 relationship, to the operations, the worker is covered 

8 under OCSLA. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you still have an 

anomaly. 

11  MR. FREDERICK: There is --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes it will be 

13 covered; sometimes it won't be covered. 

14  MR. FREDERICK: It is, to be sure, a more 

comfortable fit to the actual language of the statute 

16 than imposing and superimposing a situs-of-injury 

17 requirement, which is nowhere to be found in section 

18 1333(b). 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any injury on 

land in the course of employment that would not be 

21 covered by OCSLA where we have a worker of this kind 

22 that -- who spends 98 percent of his time on the outer 

23 continental shelf -- the injury, however, is on land? 

24 Is there any case where such a worker who predominantly 

works on the outer continental shelf would not be

1 covered by OCSLA in your view? 

2  MR. FREDERICK: Well, if the work is arising 

3 out of the course and scope of employment, which is the 

4 natural way that these workers' compensation regimes 

work, and it is related to the shelf operations, our 

6 submission is, yes, he is covered under OCSLA. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, then what you're 

8 really saying is -- it's not your test, but really the 

9 Government's saying we look to see, is this person 

dominantly working on the outer continental shelf? 

11  MR. FREDERICK: That -- that's correct, 

12 Justice Ginsburg. It's the easiest to administer test, 

13 too, because the way workers' compensation insurance 

14 works, the employer will -- based on the payroll of the 

workers who are out on the shelf and its overall 

16 payroll, will pay workers' compensation premiums, and 

17 under the Department of Labor regulations, it will add 

18 an endorsement for those workers whose status it 

19 controls, would be covered under OCSLA and thereby get 

the higher Federal benefit. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if you work only 20 

22 percent of your time for this -- this drilling company 

23 on -- on the -- on the platform, but it so happens that 

24 you are injured on the platform, you know, a bolt comes 

off and strikes you, you're not covered?

4 two-factor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then you're 

6 not applying the -- the employment test. I mean, you 

7 either are or you are not. 

8  MR. FREDERICK: Well, that person is going 

9 to be covered under our submission because it's a 

two-part inquiry. You look at the nature of the 

11 relationship, and you look at the nature of how the 

12 injury came about. And under those circumstances we 

13 agree with the Government, that if somebody is -- if an 

14 employee is out on the platform and is injured as a 

result of operations, that person is covered. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Heads, I win; tails, you 

17 lose, right? We -- we have a situs-of-the-injury test 

18 when you have less than your -- a majority of your work 

19 on the platform, but we don't have a situs test when the

4 Act, and yet that flies directly in the face of this 

Court's holding in Herb's Welding, that when he's on the 

6 fixed platform, he doesn't get longshore benefits. And 

7 so, here under their hypothetical --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it the Longshore Act? 

9 I thought -- I thought it was the Jones Act that they 

were covered in the helicopter. 

11  MR. FREDERICK: No. Under his submission --

2 -- back on land 3 months? Does it depend when the 

3 injury occurs, whether it's when he's on the land part 

4 of his job or on the shelf part?

 MR. FREDERICK: The way this Court handled 

6 that under in seaman context under Chandris was to look 

7 at the totality of the circumstances of the worker's 

8 employment, and that seems to be --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's -- I've 

given you all the totality. He's working for 3 months, 

11 and then he's -- you know, it's seasonal or something, 

12 and 3 months he's on -- on the land. That is the 

13 totality of the circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why? 

16  MR. FREDERICK: Because he's the kind of 

17 person that Congress wanted to provide coverage to under 

18 Federal worker -- remind -- remember, in 1950 --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- how do you 

know it's the kind of person? I thought your line was 

21 whether or not he spends most of his time on the shelf 

22 or most of his time somewhere else. 

23  MR. FREDERICK: Our test actually is 

24 substantial work. We don't disagree with the

1 That seems appropriate in light of the fact that many of 

2 these workers come on for 2 weeks, are off for 2 weeks. 

3 They're working 12-hour shifts while they're out on the 

4 rig. It seems appropriate that the coverage should go 

with them when they are --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thirty percent is 

7 the line? 

8  MR. FREDERICK: That's what the Government 

9 -- I have no brief to defend, Mr. Chief Justice, in 

terms of where that line is, because my -- my client's 

11 husband --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but 

13 we'd like to have a test that we apply to your 

14 situation, and it's nice to know -- maybe 30 percent, I 

guess, is as good as any. 

16  MR. FREDERICK: The point that Congress was 

17 trying to get at -- and these are platforms that were 

18 covered by State workers' compensation in 1953 -- was to 

19 extend the more generous Federal benefits to encourage 

an industry that was a nascent industry to develop the 

21 resources of the outer continental shelf, to provide 

22 uniformity, to provide benefits to the workers who were 

23 exposed to the perils that were out on the platform. 

24 And so, it makes sense, we submit, that when those 

workers who are -- who are subjected to those

1 circumstances have the same Federal benefits. And there 

2 are substantial benefits. 

3  My client, for instance, got a one-time 

4 lump-sum payment of $42,000 for the death of her 

husband, as opposed to the Federal benefits that would 

6 be approximately $466 per week during the remainder of 

7 her period as a widow. And the State benefits would be 

8 credited against any Federal benefits that she would be 

9 getting in the future. But it's -- it is a substantial 

dimension to the life of a worker out on the shelf. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, suppose, Mr. Frederick, 

12 that we find that we can't find your status test in the 

13 language of the statute and that what this statute seems 

14 to give us is, instead, a causal test and that the cause 

is whether operations on the outer continental shelf 

16 caused the injury in question. So, what's your best 

17 argument for how operations on the shelf caused the 

18 injury in this case? 

19  MR. FREDERICK: The scrap metal that Mr. 

Valladolid was charged with moving at the time of his 

21 the death was very likely the same scrap metal that he 

22 personally had taken off the shelf, or someone in his 

23 position would have taken off the shelf. And to Justice 

24 Kennedy's point, the equipment is heavy, dangerous, 

difficult equipment. Just the fact that it is moved off

1 the shelf for a cleaning, scrap, for removal, et cetera, 

2 is an immaterial difference. 

3  In their reply brief, they concede that an 

4 oil spill worker who's cleaning up this oil spill from 

an offshore event is going to be covered under a -- what 

6 they call a proximate cause standard -- under any kind 

7 of substantial connection proximate cause. Proximate 

8 cause is a legal policy that determines how you want to 

9 limit the scope of the injuries that would be covered.

 In a workers' compensation scheme, 

11 Justice Scalia, you were completely right it makes no 

12 sense. And so, if you adopt some kind of substantial 

13 connection, it has to be very loosely related. As the 

14 Court in the FELA context last term held in CSX v. 

McBride, where you have a negligence standard, it makes 

16 even more sense to have a very relaxed standard of 

17 causation under workers' compensation. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the Act would 

19 also apply under your analysis to a -- an independent 

contractor, a trucker, who carries this heavy -- this 

21 heavy steel to the place where this worker worked on it, 

22 right? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: I don't think so.

If -- if your hypothetical is the independent contractor 

6 on land, it has to be an employee in order to be 

7 covered. And that person doesn't qualify, which creates 

8 another set of --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see.

 MR. FREDERICK: -- difficult lines to draw 

11 under the Longshore Act, where you also have to be an 

12 employee, and independent contractors are not covered --

operates the platform, right?

19 that drives the truck that takes the steel to the place 

where your client worked on it.

7 that standard, Justice Kennedy, in the Chandris test has 

8 been the subject of litigation in the lower courts, and 

9 my understanding is that the courts have kind of worked 

out the various factors and standards that go into the

4 the vessel, and they go to -- they go to duration, they 

go to the performance of duties in the completion of the 

6 mission of the vessel and the like. And there are a 

7 range of standards. Obviously, the facts of each crew 

8 member is difficult to unpack in a hypothetical at this 

9 time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a real 

11 -- obviously, it's a real mishmash, and maybe that's 

12 what we're -- we're stuck with. How does this work as a 

13 practical matter? I assume the -- the companies get 

14 insurance to cover their risks here.

 MR. FREDERICK: Correct. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who decides -- I 

17 mean, the insurance company will underwrite how many 

18 people spend what percentage of time where? 

19  MR. FREDERICK: And as a practical matter, 

Mr. Chief Justice -- and I don't represent the insurance 

21 company here -- but the way I understand that it works 

22 is that, on an annual or a periodic basis, the company 

23 and the insurance company get together through some 

24 auditing process where there's verification of the 

workers who are OCSLA workers and thereby get the

1 longshore benefits, and the company and the insurance 

2 company work that out to determine either numbers or 

3 particular individuals or the like. 

4  And so, here what we're talking about is a 

situation where the employer is not liable for the 

6 damage. It's an insured risk, and --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- well, they 

8 have to pay higher insurance rates. To say they're not 

9 liable for it I think is a real --

MR. FREDERICK: It's a different form of 

11 liability, and it's one that based on the way workers' 

12 compensation traditionally is developed -- and I would 

13 direct the Court to the opening chapters of Larson's 

14 monumental treatise on workers' compensation, where he 

basically says if this is a social compact in which the 

16 employer doesn't have to face liability for personal 

17 injuries in tort but gets insurance, and the premiums 

18 are then passed on to the consuming public of that 

19 particular entity's goods.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does it carry over who's an 

21 employee from the Longshoreman Act? Which defines an 

22 employee as a maritime worker, and then defines that and 

23 has exceptions and so forth, and this has a couple more. 

24 That's who the employee is; is that right?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, under this statute,

2 is an employer, some of whose employees are engaged in, 

3 quote, "such operations." And Mr. Valladolid was 

4 exactly the kind of person who was engaged in such 

operations. 

6  So, our submission, Justice Breyer, is that 

7 that is the kind of person that Congress contemplated 

8 when it was focusing on the work force that would be 

9 engaged in development of the outer continental shelf.

 If the Court has --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you -- I 

12 don't mean to get back to it all the time, but it's not 

13 -- you have to say that Congress contemplated the person 

14 who spent 30 percent of his time on the outer 

continental shelf. In terms of us coming up with a 

16 test. Maybe your client is an easy case, where it's 98 

17 percent. But the test you want us to adopt covers the 

18 person who spends 70 percent of his time on land. 

19  MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, if I 

could put it this way, the pushback for the but-for test 

21 in its broadest sense is that there isn't a natural kind 

22 of a way of confining some restriction to it. And so, 

23 if you look at the statute in terms of what it naturally 

24 must have meant by Congress, there is a natural limit,

11 before you give any deference to the Government's 

12 position, you should look at the other Government's 

13 position, which is to say the position that the 

14 Government took in its brief to this Court in Pickett v. 

Petroleum Helicopters in 2002. 

16  They have a completely different position 

17 now, and they've never explained the difference other 

18 than to say what they thought was plausible then they 

19 now find persuasive now. That's not enough for 

deference. And in that brief, they took a position very 

21 similar to ours. There has to be status plus situs, 

22 albeit a slightly different situs, but otherwise it's on 

23 all fours with our position. 

24  Second of all, the Government comes up here 

and says that the longshore remedy is an outlier among

1 workers' compensation remedies because it's the only one 

2 with a situs. Well, the problem with that is of all the 

3 workers' compensation provisions that Congress could 

4 have extended to the outer continental shelf, it picked 

the Longshore Act with that situs requirement. 

6  And the Government also says, well, you 

7 know, the reason that the Longshore Act had a situs 

8 requirement was because of Jensen, and this Court's 

9 decision in Jensen created a problem about whether State 

workers' comp law could go to the navigable waters. 

11  Well, that's the exact same backdrop against 

12 which Congress is passing OCSLA. It doesn't know that 

13 State workers' compensation law can go to the outer 

14 continental shelf. Jensen is still good law. Jensen 

tells Congress that it can't extend -- States can't 

16 extend their laws to the navigable waters. What 

17 makes --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why doesn't 

19 Congress know? Because I think States overwhelmingly 

would include outer continental shelf workers in their 

21 compensation scheme. 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg. 

23 What States overwhelming did is say a worker could be 

24 covered in a different State. But covering them on the 

outer continental shelf was not something that was well

1 established. 

2  And, indeed, Congress specifically heard 

3 testimony that questioned the ability of either States 

4 to get their workers' comp law there directly and also 

heard that there might be constitutional problems, 

6 because of the Knickerbocker Ice case, of Congress 

7 extending the State law there. So, that's why they 

8 settled on this remedy of taking this Longshore Act that 

9 solved the Jensen problem on the navigable waters and 

solved the same problem for the outer continental shelf. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would make sense to 

12 use the Longshore Act because they wanted to have the 

13 same level of compensation. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: As other alternatives like the 

Jones Act? 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. No, no. They wanted 

17 the OCSLA worker to have the same benefits as the 

18 longshore worker. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Sure, when they were on the 

shelf. But they were solving the exact same kind of 

21 jurisdictional problem they solved with the Longshore 

22 Act with the shelf -- with the statute. 

23  Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you can 

24 read too much into (b)(2). All (b)(2) is doing is 

modifying the same definition for the longshores.

1 You're an employer if you employ a longshoreman or a 

2 longshore worker. So, they're just updating this for 

3 purposes of extending a longshore remedy to the shelf; 

4 (b)(3) does the same thing, and it modifies the situs 

and creates a situs that makes sense for the shelf: the 

6 navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial 

7 islands, and everything attached thereto. 

8  Mr. Chief Justice, you talked about the 

9 imprecision of their test. It's worse than that. It's 

imprecision without any text. At least in the Jones 

11 Act, you have the seamen and you have some other textual 

12 clues as to where you draw these limits. Here there's 

13 nothing in the statute that in any way suggests a 

14 status-based test. So, you would be completely 

unmoored, if you will. 

16  The last point I would make is this: The 

17 answer to the causation test is really -- the kind of 

18 the lie to the other side's position is what they say 

19 when they're dealing with somebody who's not a 98 

percenter but is a 2 percenter. When that person goes 

21 out on the shelf, when are they covered? Well, when the 

22 injuries operating on the shelf cause them a direct 

23 injury on the shelf. At that point, even the Government 

24 resorts to a situs-based test.

 Well, here's the problem: That status-based

1 test, it's in the Jones Act; it's not in OCSLA. And 

2 even when you recognize that and you look at what's left 

3 of the case, what's left of the case is either our 

4 approach that essentially incorporates the Longshore Act 

through (b)(3) or a tight nexus test that would require 

6 a geographical focus and give -- give force to the words 

7 "conducted on the shelf." 

8  This person was injured by operations for 

9 the purpose of exploring the shelf at some level, but he 

sure wasn't injured by operations conducted on the shelf 

11 for those purposes. He was injured by operations on dry 

12 land. And under those circumstances, the remedy lies 

13 with the State workers' comp law, not with OCSLA. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted. 

16  (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m. the case in the 

17 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
